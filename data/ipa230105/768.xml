Provisional Patent Application No. 62/915,696, filed Oct. 16, 2019.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to methods and compositions for the delivery of at least two active, therapeutic, or pharmaceutical agents in an oil-in-water emulsion, wherein at least one agent is delivered in the hydrophobic phase of the emulsion and at least one agent is delivered in the aqueous phase of the emulsion.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the pharmaceutical field, the effective delivery of active, therapeutic, and pharmaceutical agents often poses difficulties and challenges. Although a particular agent may be effective in vitro, the in vivo effectiveness of an agent in a subject will further depend on the method of delivery, route of administration, and pharmacokinetics in the body. For example, an agent's in vivo effectiveness may depend on its ability to be targeted to a specific tissue or cell type, or instead on its ability to be delivered systemically throughout the body. Furthermore, an agent's effectiveness in vivo may also depend on its rate of release from the site of administration: either a sustained release or an immediate release. The considerations will depend on the nature of a particular agent (e.g. size, stability, solubility, charge) and its desired effects and/or targets.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The targeting of an agent is influenced by the route of administration. An agent that needs to be delivered systemically can be injected intravenously for immediate circulation through the blood or delivered orally for absorption into the blood through the digestive system. Conversely, an agent can be targeted to a particular tissue by injection directly into a specific organ or tissue, or by injection into a site that drains into a specific organ or tissue. For example, an agent can be injected sub-cutaneously for targeting of the agent into a draining lymph node. Alternatively, an agent can be modified by linking it to a targeting molecule and then delivering the agent systemically, with the agent then accumulating in the target tissue or on target cells via the targeting molecule. However, this requires chemical modification of the agent, possibly changing its properties, and adds cost and complexity to the therapy.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The rate of release of an agent can be controlled by its formulation in a pharmaceutical composition. For example, an agent may be provided in an oral tablet with a chemical coating that ensures a sustained release of the agent during digestion. An injected agent may be formulated in an aqueous solution that disperses quickly after injection by dissolving into interstitial fluid or blood, or draining into the lymphatic system, thereby providing an immediate release of the agent. Conversely, an injected agent may be delivered in an oil-based composition that provides a depot-effect, thereby providing a sustained release of the agent.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Often, a therapy for a disease, disorder, or infection requires the administration of more than one agent. However, challenges arise when the agents have different properties and/or desired targets. For example, it may be desired than a first agent in a therapy has a sustained release while a second agent has a faster or immediate release. In another example, it may be desired that a first agent in a therapy is targeted to a specific tissue, such as a lymphatic tissue, while a second agent is released systemically. A common solution is to provide the agents separately. This approach holds several disadvantages. The administration of multiple agents by different methods and with different regimens complicates the therapeutic protocol and may lead to mistakes in administration. Furthermore, if the approach requires multiple injections to separately deliver the agents there is an increase in patient discomfort and possibly increased risk of unwanted injection-site reactions.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">There is therefore a need for new and effective means of delivering multiple agents to a subject in a single composition or administration that accommodates the differing properties of the multiple agents and their desired targets and rates of release. Such a composition or administration could simplify therapies that require multiple agents and improve patient comfort. Furthermore, such a composition or administration could also improve the effectiveness of the therapy by improving the efficacy of the agents and, therefore, the treatment of the subject.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, there is provided herein methods and compositions for delivering multiple agents in separate phases of an oil-in-water emulsion to a subject. The methods and compositions of the present invention are able to co-deliver aqueous phase agents and hydrophobic phase agents, improve the efficacy of the delivered agents, and generate lower titers of unwanted anti-drug antibody in a subject. As demonstrated in Examples 7 and 8, treatment of tumour-challenged mice with an emulsion composition according to the present invention (comprising a DPX anti-cancer composition in the hydrophobic phase and immunomodulatory anti-CTLA-4 antibody in the aqueous phase) improved survival and tumour control and generated lower titers of unwanted anti-drug antibody (ADA) against anti-CTLA4 antibody compared to other compositions.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In an embodiment, the present disclosure relates to a composition for delivering at least two agents to a subject comprising: i) a hydrophobic phase; and ii) an aqueous phase; wherein the composition is an emulsion of the hydrophobic phase in the aqueous phase, wherein the hydrophobic phase comprises at least one hydrophobic phase agent, and wherein the aqueous phase comprises at least one aqueous phase agent.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In an embodiment, the present disclosure relates to a composition for delivering at least two agents to a subject comprising: i) a hydrophobic phase comprising mannide oleate in mineral oil, DOPC, cholesterol, peptide antigen of SEQ ID NO: 1, T-helper epitope of SEQ ID NO: 30, and DNA based polyL:C; and ii) an aqueous phase comprising water and/or an aqueous solution, polysorbate 20, and an antibody that binds to CTLA-4; wherein the composition is an emulsion of the hydrophobic phase in the aqueous phase.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In an embodiment, the present disclosure relates to a composition for delivering at least two agents to a subject comprising: i) a hydrophobic phase comprising mannide oleate in mineral oil, DOPC, cholesterol, peptide antigen of SEQ ID NO: 18, peptide antigen of SEQ ID NO: 20, peptide antigen of SEQ ID NO: 22, peptide antigen of SEQ ID NO: 23, peptide antigen of SEQ ID NO: 24, T-helper epitope of SEQ ID NO: 28, and DNA based polyL:C; and ii) an aqueous phase comprising water and/or an aqueous solution, polysorbate 20, and an antibody that binds to CTLA-4; wherein the composition is an emulsion of the hydrophobic phase in the aqueous phase.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In an embodiment, the present disclosure relates to a composition for delivering at least two agents to a subject comprising: i) a hydrophobic phase comprising mannide oleate in mineral oil, DOPC, cholesterol, fusion peptide of SEQ ID NO: 34, and DNA based polyL:C; and ii) an aqueous phase comprising water and/or an aqueous solution, polysorbate 20, and an antibody that binds to CTLA-4; wherein the composition is an emulsion of the hydrophobic phase in the aqueous phase.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In an embodiment, the present disclosure relates to a composition for delivering at least two agents to a subject comprising: i) a hydrophobic phase comprising mannide oleate in mineral oil, DOPC, cholesterol, peptide antigen of SEQ ID NO: 35, peptide antigen of SEQ ID NO: 36, peptide antigen of SEQ ID NO: 37, peptide antigen of SEQ ID NO: 38, peptide antigen of SEQ ID NO: 20, peptide antigen of SEQ ID NO: 23, T-helper epitope of SEQ ID NO: 28, and DNA based polyL:C; and ii) an aqueous phase comprising water and/or an aqueous solution, polysorbate 20, and an antibody that binds to CTLA-4; wherein the composition is an emulsion of the hydrophobic phase in the aqueous phase.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In an embodiment, the present disclosure relates to a method for making a composition for delivering at least two agents to a subject, said method comprising: i) providing a hydrophobic phase comprising at least one hydrophobic phase agent; ii) providing an aqueous phase comprising at least one aqueous phase agent; iii) mixing the hydrophobic phase and the aqueous phase to produce an emulsion of the hydrophobic phase in the aqueous phase.

The emulsion comprises a hydrophobic phase that provides the sustained release of at least one hydrophobic phase agent and provides targeted delivery to immune cells, lymph nodes, or lymphoid cells in a lymphatic tissue. The emulsion further comprises an aqueous phase of that provides the faster release of at least one aqueous phase agent, compared to the rate of release of the at least one hydrophobic phase agent, and a wider dispersal from the site of administration.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In order to provide a therapy for treating a disease, disorder, or infection in a subject, it may be necessary to provide more than one active, therapeutic, or pharmaceutical agent. In such a situation, it may be advantageous to provide the more than one agent in the same composition, for a single administration to the subject. The agents may have different desired rates of release and/or desired in vivo targets to one another. The present invention therefore provides methods and compositions for the delivery of at least two agents in an oil-in-water emulsion, consisting of a hydrophobic phase dispersed in an aqueous phase. Agents to be delivered to the subject can be incorporated into either the hydrophobic phase for a sustained release and targeted delivery, or into the aqueous phase for a faster release and wider dispersal within the subject, while also being incorporated into a single composition that can be provided in a single administration.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The emulsion comprises a hydrophobic phase that provides a sustained release of at least one hydrophobic phase agent, with the at least one hydrophobic phase agent targeted to immune cells, lymph nodes, or lymphoid cells in a lymphatic tissue.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">As used herein, by &#x201c;sustained release&#x201d;, it is meant that the agent is available for a prolonged period of time for uptake by immune cells from the site of administration. In an embodiment, the term &#x201c;sustained release&#x201d; means that a substantial proportion (e.g. at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 95%, or 100%) of the agent remains localized at the site of administration for at least about 36 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 96 hours, 120 hours, 144 hours, 168 hours, 192 hours, or 384 hours. In an embodiment, less than 1%, 2%, 3%, 4% or 5% of the agent is taken by immune cells from the site of administration within 24 hours after administration. In an embodiment, at least 80% of the agent remains localized at the site of injection for at least about 48 hours after administration.

As used herein, &#x201c;preferentially delivered&#x201d; refers to the fact that the at least one hydrophobic phase agent is delivered to immune cells, lymph nodes, or lymphoid cells in a lymphatic tissue as opposed to being delivered to other regions of the body or being delivered systemically. In an embodiment, by &#x201c;preferentially delivered&#x201d;, it is meant that the concentration or amount of the at least one hydrophobic phase agent is increased in the immune cells, lymph nodes, or lymphoid cells in a lymphatic tissue relative to the concentration or amount of the at least one hydrophobic phase agent in other parts of the body.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As used herein, and without being bound by theory, the term &#x201c;targeted delivery&#x201d; encompasses embodiments whereby the targeting to immune cells, lymph nodes, or lymphoid cells in a lymphatic tissue is accomplished by upstream events whereby the at least one hydrophobic phase agent is more effectively taken up by immune cells (such as by phagocytosis or endocytosis) or delivered to antigen presenting cells that are capable of trafficking the at least one hydrophobic phase agent to lymph nodes or lymphoid cells in a lymphatic tissue. In an embodiment, the hydrophobic phase agent is taken up by immune cells, such as for example and without limitation, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, T cells and/or B cells. In an embodiment, the hydrophobic phase agent is delivered to antigen presenting cells such as for example and without limitation, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and/or B cells, and the antigen presenting cells traffic the at least one hydrophobic phase agent to lymph nodes, or lymphoid cells in a lymphatic tissue. Thus, in an embodiment, &#x201c;targeted delivery to lymph nodes or lymphoid cells in a lymphatic tissue&#x201d; includes preferential delivery of the at least one hydrophobic phase agent to cells in a non-lymphatic fluid or tissue in the body whereby the cells then traffic the at least one hydrophobic phase agent to lymph nodes or lymphoid cells in a lymphatic tissue.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As used herein, &#x201c;lymph nodes&#x201d; refers to any one or more lymph nodes that are present throughout the body of an animal, such as for example a human. In an embodiment, the lymph nodes are any one or more of the following types, based on anatomical location: inguinal (groin), femoral (upper inner thigh), mesentery (lower body below rib cage), mediastinal (upper body behind the sternum); supraclavicular (collar bone); axillary (armpits); and cervical (neck). The lymph node to which the at least one hydrophobic phase agent preferentially targets may depend on the route of administration (e.g. injection) and location of administration. In an embodiment, the lymph nodes are the lymph nodes draining the injection site.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">As used herein, the term &#x201c;lymphatic tissue&#x201d; refers to the cells and organs that make up the lymphatic system. It includes, without limitation, the lymph nodes, spleen, thymus and mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue (e.g., in the lung, lamina propria of the of the intestinal wall, Peyer's patches of the small intestine, or lingual, palatine and pharyngeal tonsils, or Waldeyer's neck ring). The lymphoid cells of the lymphatic tissue include, for example, leukocytes (white blood cells), T cells (T-lymphocytes), B cells (B-lymphocytes), macrophages, dendritic cells and reticular cells. In an embodiment, the targeted delivery of the at least one hydrophobic phase agent disclosed herein is to T-lymphocytes and/or B-lymphocytes in the lymph nodes or lymphatic tissue.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Without being bound by theory, it is believed that the hydrophobic phase of the composition according to the invention provides for targeted delivery of the at least one hydrophobic phase agent to immune cells, lymph nodes, or lymphoid cells in a lymphatic tissues by one or more of: (i) promoting effective uptake of the at least one hydrophobic phase agent by immune cells (e.g. monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, T cells and/or B cells) at or near the site of administration due to the separation of the emulsion at the site of administration, leaving the hydrophobic phase at the site of administration that attracts immune cells and provides extended exposure to the at least one hydrophobic phase agent; (ii) promoting migration of such immune cells to lymph nodes; and (iii) promoting uptake of the at least one hydrophobic phase agent by cells in the lymph nodes or lymphoid cells in a lymphatic tissue.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some embodiments, the at least one hydrophobic phase agent comprises antigens and/or adjuvants for eliciting an immune response. In some embodiments, the hydrophobic phase is a composition comprising antigens and/or adjuvants for eliciting an immune response.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In embodiments in which the hydrophobic phase comprises antigens and/or adjuvants for eliciting an immune response, targeting of the hydrophobic phase agent to immune cells, lymph nodes, or lymphoid cells in a lymphatic tissue allows for the activation of immune cells in order to elicit the immune response. Prior to encountering foreign antigen, immune cells (e.g. monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, T cells and/or B cells) exist in an immature state. Upon phagocytosis of a presentable antigen, antigen-presenting immune cells (e.g. monocytes, macrophages, B cells, and dendritic cells) become activated resulting in an upregulated expression of MHC class I/II molecules and maturation into mature antigen-presenting cells that migrate to the lymph nodes where they interact with lymphocytes (e.g. T cells and B cells) by receptor-mediated interactions. This leads to the activation of the lymphocytes themselves and the induction of an adaptive immune response. In the case of immunotherapy, appropriate activation of immune cells typically also requires administration of an adjuvant to improve routing and adaptive immune responses.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some embodiments, the at least one hydrophobic phase agent comprises agents that are not antigens and/or adjuvants, but rather other agents (e.g. small molecule drugs, antibodies, immunomodulatory agents, allergens, or polynucleotides) that are targeted to lymph nodes or lymphoid cells in a lymphatic tissue. In some embodiments, the hydrophobic phase is a pharmaceutical composition comprising agents for modulating an immune response. In some embodiments, the hydrophobic phase is a pharmaceutical composition comprising an antibody.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In embodiments in which the hydrophobic phase comprises agents for the purpose of modulating an immune response, targeting of the hydrophobic phase agent to immune cells, lymph nodes, or lymphoid cells in a lymphatic tissue allows for the modulation of immune cells and/or an immune response. Even in the absence of presentable antigen and activation of immune cells, agents provided in a hydrophobic phase can be taken up by immune cells and/or trafficked to lymph nodes or lymphoid cells in a lymphatic tissue for targeted delivery, as disclosed in e.g. PCT/CA2019/050328.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The emulsion comprises an aqueous phase that provides a faster release of at least one aqueous phase agent, compared to the rate of release of at least one hydrophobic phase agent, and a wider dispersal from the site of administration. As used herein, by &#x201c;wider dispersal&#x201d;, it is meant that the aqueous phase and the at least one aqueous phase agent disperse from the site of administration rather than form a deposit at the site of administration that does not significantly disperse. For example, the aqueous phase and/or the at least one aqueous phase agent may dissolve into the surrounding interstitial fluid and spread throughout a tissue or organ. In another example, the aqueous phase and/or the at least one aqueous phase agent may dissolve into lymphatic fluid or blood and enter circulation to provide systemic delivery. As used herein, by &#x201c;systemic delivery&#x201d;, it is meant that the at least one aqueous phase agent is delivered throughout the body so that multiple tissues, multiple organs, or the entire body are exposed to therapeutically effective amounts of the agent. Agents that are delivered systemically typically enter the circulatory system, either directly or indirectly, where they are circulated throughout the body via the bloodstream. As used herein, &#x201c;systemic delivery&#x201d; encompasses embodiments wherein the at least one aqueous phase agent disperses from the site of administration and enters circulation, either directly or indirectly, to provide a therapeutically effective amount of the agent to multiple tissues, multiple organs, or the entire body. The aqueous phase provides for the faster release of at least one aqueous phase agent as compared to the rate of release of at least one hydrophobic phase agent. In some embodiments, an emulsion of the present invention provides a slower release of at least one aqueous phase agent compared to a conventional aqueous formulation.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Without being bound by theory, it is believed that the aqueous phase of the composition according to the invention provides for the faster release of at least one aqueous phase agent, compared to the rate of release of at least one hydrophobic phase agent, and the wider dispersal from the site of administration by dissolving into the interstitial fluid, allowing the at least one aqueous phase agent to dissolve into the interstitial fluid whereby it can: (i) disperse into the surrounding tissue or organ; (ii) diffuse into circulation through capillary walls; (iii) and/or enter lymphatic circulation and, subsequently, enter the bloodstream through lymphatic vessels.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The methods and compositions of the present invention are advantageous in providing a single composition for the delivery of at least two agents with differing targets, properties and release rates. The present invention can be used for the delivery of at least 2 agents to a subject when it is necessary that at least one agent be targeted to immune cells, lymph nodes, or lymphoid cells in a lymphatic tissue in a sustained release while at least one other agent be dispersed more widely and rapidly in the subject. By way of non-limiting example, an emulsion composition of the present invention can provide an antigen in the hydrophobic phase and an immunomodulatory agent in the aqueous phase in order to induce an improved immune response in a subject. In this manner, the emulsion composition provides a sustained, targeted release of the antigen to immune cells while simultaneously providing a faster release of an immunomodulatory agent to improve the immune response to the antigen. Furthermore, methods and compositions of the present invention can also improve the efficacy of the delivered agents. As demonstrated in Example 7, treatment of tumour-challenged mice with an emulsion composition according to the present invention (comprising a DPX anti-cancer composition in the hydrophobic phase and immunomodulatory anti-CTLA-4 antibody in the aqueous phase) improved survival and tumour control compared to mice receiving the DPX anti-cancer composition and anti-CTLA-4 antibody either separately, or together in a composition lacking an O/W emulsion. A further advantage of the present invention is demonstrated in Example 8, showing that an emulsion composition according to the present invention generated lower titers of unwanted anti-drug antibody (ADA) against anti-CTLA4 antibody compared to different compositions lacking the O/W emulsion of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Emulsions</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">As used herein, an &#x201c;emulsion&#x201d; refers to a mixture of two or more liquids that are normally immiscible wherein droplets of one liquid are dispersed in the other. As an example, a hydrophobic substance (e.g. oil) and an aqueous substance (e.g. water) are immiscible liquids that may form an emulsion when droplets of one are dispersed in the other. A dispersion of water droplets in oil is a water-in-oil (W/O) emulsion in which the water (aqueous phase) forms a discontinuous phase and the oil (hydrophobic phase) forms a continuous phase. &#x201c;Water-in-oil emulsion&#x201d; or &#x201c;W/O&#x201d;, as used herein, refers to an emulsion of a hydrophobic phase in an aqueous phase. A dispersion of oil droplets in water is an oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion in which the oil (hydrophobic phase) forms a discontinuous phase and the water (aqueous phase) forms a continuous phase. &#x201c;Oil-in-water emulsion&#x201d; or &#x201c;O/W&#x201d;, as used herein, refers to an emulsion of a hydrophobic phase in an aqueous phase. A phase or substance that is hydrophobic may also be called lipophilic. A phase or substance that is aqueous may also be called hydrophilic or lipophobic.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">An emulsion may be described as stable if the discontinuous phase remains dispersed in the continuous phase for a prolonged period of time. As described herein, an emulsion may be described as stable if the discontinuous phase remains dispersed in the continuous phase for 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, or greater than 4 hours after the formation of the emulsion. The phases of an emulsion may separate over time. Phase separation may be due to the buoyancy of the dispersed phase, causing the droplets to sink or float in the continuous phase; due to the coalescence of the droplets into gradually larger droplets; or due to the flocculation of mutually-attracted droplets. Phase separation of an emulsion can be determined visually by seeing if the emulsion appears homogenous or if there is a detectable separation of one phase from the other.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In some embodiments, emulsifiers may be included in one or more of the phases of the emulsion. As used herein, an &#x201c;emulsifier&#x201d; refers to a substance or compound that enables the formation of an emulsion and/or improves the stability of the emulsion. An emulsifier may be, for example, a lipid, a surfactant, detergent, or emulsifying salt. Emulsifiers may enable to formation of an emulsion and/or improve the stability of an emulsion by dispersing and/or stabilizing the droplets of the discontinuous phase, thereby preventing phase separation. Emulsifiers may be amphiphilic, possessing both a polar or hydrophilic region and a non-polar or hydrophobic (i.e. lipophilic) region enabling them to interact with both hydrophobic and aqueous phases. The affinity of an emulsifier for water or oil is measured by its hydrophile-lipophile balance (HLB). HLB is a 0-20 scale: HLB values below 10 indicate a greater affinity for oil and for forming W/O emulsions; HLB values above 10 indicate a greater affinity for water and for forming O/W emulsions. Emulsifiers may further be classified as ionic or non-ionic depending on the presence of an ionic group. The choice of emulsifier(s) for use in stabilizing an emulsion will depend on the desired properties of the emulsion such as O/W vs W/O, density, viscosity, dispersion rate in water or oil, and stability. Emulsifiers that may be used to formulate an O/W emulsion according to the present invention include, but are not limited to polysorbate 20 (e.g. Tween&#x2122; 20), polysorbate 40 (e.g. Tween&#x2122; 40), polysorbate 60 (e.g. Tween&#x2122; 60), polysorbate 80 (e.g. Tween&#x2122; 80), lecithin, mannide oleate, sorbitan monolaurate (e.g. Span&#x2122; 20), sorbitan tristearate (e.g. Span&#x2122; 65), sorbitan monooleate (e.g. Span&#x2122; 80), sorbitan trioleate (e.g. Span&#x2122; 85), Nonoxynols Triton&#x2122; X-100, Octaethylene glycol monododecyl ether, Pentaethylene glycol monododecyl ether, Poloxamers, Glycerol monostearate, Glycerol monolaurate, Decyl glucoside, Lauryl glucoside, Octyl glucoside, Lauryldimethylamine oxide, Dimethyl sulfoxide, Phosphine oxide, Polyethoxylated tallow amine, Cocamide monoethanolamine, Cocamide diethanolamine MONTANE&#x2122; 20, 80 and 85 PPI emulsifiers and MONTANOX&#x2122; 20, 80 PPI and MONTANOX&#x2122; 80 API solubilizers, Anionic surfactants such as ammonium lauryl sulfate, sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium dodecyl sulfate, sodium lauryl ether sulfate, sodium myreth sulfate, dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate, Perfluorooctanesulfonate, Perfluorobutanesulfonate, Alkyl-aryl ether phosphates and Alkyl ether phosphates, Carboxylates surfactants such as sodium stearate, sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, perfluorononanoate and perfluorooctanoate, Cationic Surfactants such as octenidine dihydrochloride, cetrimonium bromide, cetylpyridinium chloride, benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, dimethyldioctadecylammonium chloride, and dioctadecyldimethylammonium bromide, Zwitterionic surfactants such as lauryl-N,N-(dimethylammonio)butyrate, lauryl-N,N-(dimethyl)-glycinebetaine, Cocamidopropyl betaine, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate, 3-([3-cholamidopropyl]dimethylammonio)-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonate, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammo-nio]-1-propanesulfonate, lauryl-N,N-(dimethylammonio)butyrate, lauryl-N,N-(dimethyl)-propanesulfonate, 3-(4-tert-butyl-1-pyridinio)-1-propanesulfonate, 3-(1-pyridinio)-1-propanesulfonate, 3-(benzyl-dimethylammonio)propanesulfonate and Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Compositions according to the present invention comprise an O/W emulsion of a hydrophobic phase (e.g. oil) in an aqueous phase (e.g. water). Emulsions according to the present invention may be formed using a range of hydrophobic phase to aqueous phase ratios, defined as a volume to volume ratio (v/v). In some embodiments, the hydrophobic phase to aqueous phase ratio may be 90:10, 80:20, 70:30: 60:40, 50:50, 40:60, 30:70, 20:80, or 10:90. The necessary ratio to form an O/W emulsion will depend on the respective compositions of the hydrophobic and aqueous phases (e.g. the presence of amphiphilic compounds) as well as the presence or absence of emulsifiers. A skilled person may determine a suitable ratio by emulsifying the desired hydrophobic and aqueous phases using techniques disclosed herein and then determining whether the emulsion is O/W by performing a water drop test or an oil drop test as disclosed herein. Within the range of ratios capable of forming an O/W emulsion, the ratio may further be adjusted to achieve desired properties such as viscosity, density, and dispersion rate in water.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">An emulsion according to the present invention may be formed by a number of techniques known in the art. For example, an emulsion may be formed by mixing the aqueous and hydrophobic phases in a vessel and then agitating the vessel to disperse the hydrophobic phase as droplets in the aqueous phase. The vessel can be agitated by any physical means such as, for example, vortex mixing with a vortex mixer. Alternatively, an emulsion may be formed by repeatedly passing the phases through an aperture. For example, the hydrophobic phase may be placed in one vessel, the aqueous phase may be placed in another vessel, the two vessels are connected via a connector with an aperture, and pressure is applied to pass the phases back and forth between the vessels through the aperture. In a more specific example, the hydrophobic phase is placed in a first syringe, the aqueous phase is placed in a second syringe, the two syringes are connected with a connector, and alternating pressure is applied to the syringes to repeatedly pass the phases through the connector. Syringes should be selected based on the desired volume of the emulsion (e.g. syringes with volumes of 0.5 mL, 1 mL, 2 mL, 5 mL, or more) and their ability to attach to connectors (e.g. Luer Lock syringes or threaded syringes). Suitable connectors for connecting syringes include, but are not limited to, Luer-to-Luer connectors, Luer-to-threaded connectors, threaded connectors, 3-way stopcocks, and Vygon&#x2122; connectors/adaptors.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Hydrophobic Phases</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">An O/W emulsion according to the present invention comprises a discontinuous hydrophobic phase. The hydrophobic phase is immiscible in an aqueous phase. The hydrophobic phase forms an emulsion in an aqueous phase by forming a dispersion of droplets in the aqueous phase. The hydrophobic phase may be dispersed in the aqueous phase to form an emulsion using the techniques disclosed herein. As used herein, a &#x201c;hydrophobic phase&#x201d; refers to a mixture comprising one or more hydrophobic substances and at least one agent (a hydrophobic phase agent). A hydrophobic phase may further comprise other ingredients including, but not limited to, lipids, cholesterol, polymers, glycosides, cellulose, buffer salts, cryoprotectants, surfactants, and emulsifiers as described herein.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Hydrophobic Substances</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The hydrophobic phase may comprise an essentially pure hydrophobic substance or a mixture of hydrophobic substances. Hydrophobic substances that are useful in the hydrophobic phase are those that are pharmaceutically acceptable.

Oils should be pharmaceutically acceptable. Suitable oils include, for example, mineral oils (especially light or low viscosity mineral oil such as Drakeol&#xae; 6VR), vegetable oils (e.g., soybean oil, sunflower oil, corn oil), nut oils (e.g., peanut oil, castor oil, coconut oil), or mixtures thereof. Thus, in an embodiment the hydrophobic substance is vegetable oil, nut oil or mineral oil. Animal fats and artificial hydrophobic polymeric materials, particularly those that are liquid at atmospheric temperature or that can be liquefied relatively easily, may also be used.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In some embodiments, the hydrophobic substance is Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant (IFA) or Modified Freund's Adjuvant (MFA), a mineral oil-based hydrophobic carrier. In another embodiment, the hydrophobic substance is mannide oleate in mineral oil, such as commercially available Montanide&#x2122; ISA 51 (SEPPIC, France). Montanide&#x2122; ISA 51 is a mixture of highly purified mineral oil (Drakeol&#xae; 6VR) and mannide monooleate that forms a water-in oil (W/O) emulsion when mixed with an aqueous phase in a 1:1 ratio (van Doom 2016). In another embodiment, the hydrophobic substance is mannide oleate in non-mineral oil, such as commercially available Montanide&#x2122; ISA 720 (SEPPIC, France).

The term &#x201c;lipid&#x201d; has its common meaning in the art in that it is any organic substance or compound that is soluble in nonpolar solvents, but generally insoluble in polar solvents (e.g. water). Lipids are a diverse group of compounds including, without limitation, fats, waxes, sterols, fat-soluble vitamins, monoglycerides, diglycerides, triglycerides and phospholipids. Lipids may be membrane-forming lipids. By &#x201c;membrane-forming lipids&#x201d; it is meant that the lipids, alone or together with other lipids and/or stabilizing molecules, are capable of forming a lipid membrane. The lipid membranes may form closed lipid vesicles or any other structure, such as for example lipid sheets. Lipids may be amphiphilic. By &#x201c;amphiphilic lipids&#x201d; it is meant that the lipids possess both hydrophilic and hydrophobic (lipophilic) properties. Amphiphilic lipids may act as emulsifiers. Particularly suitable lipids may include those with at least one fatty acid chain containing at least 4 carbons, and typically about 4 to 28 carbons. The fatty acid chain may contain any number of saturated and/or unsaturated bonds. The lipid may be a natural lipid or a synthetic lipid. Non-limiting examples of lipids may include phospholipids, sphingolipids, sphingomyelin, cerobrocides, gangliosides, ether lipids, sterols, cardiolipin, cationic lipids and lipids modified with poly (ethylene glycol) and other polymers. Synthetic lipids may include, without limitation, the following fatty acid constituents: lauroyl, myristoyl, palmitoyl, stearoyl, arachidoyl, oleoyl, linoleoyl, erucoyl, or combinations of these fatty acids.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In some embodiments, the lipid is a phospholipid or a mixture of phospholipids. Broadly defined, a &#x201c;phospholipid&#x201d; is a member of a group of lipid compounds that yield on hydrolysis phosphoric acid, an alcohol, fatty acid, and nitrogenous base. Phospholipids that may be used include, for example and without limitation, those with at least one head group selected from the group consisting of phosphoglycerol, phosphoethanolamine, phosphoserine, phosphocholine (e.g. DOPC; 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) and phosphoinositol. In an embodiment, the phospholipid may be phosphatidylcholine or a mixture of lipids comprising phosphatidylcholine. In an embodiment, the lipid may be DOPC (Lipoid GmbH, Germany) or Lipoid S100 lecithin. Another common phospholipid is sphingomyelin. Sphingomyelin contains sphingosine, an amino alcohol with a long unsaturated hydrocarbon chain. A fatty acyl side chain is linked to the amino group of sphingosine by an amide bond, to form ceramide. The hydroxyl group of sphingosine is esterified to phosphocholine. Like phosphoglycerides, sphingomyelin is amphiphilic. Lecithin, which also may be used, is a natural mixture of phospholipids typically derived from chicken eggs, sheep's wool, soybean and other vegetable sources. All of these and other phospholipids may be used in the practice of the invention. Phospholipids can be purchased, for example, from Avanti lipids (Alabastar, Ala., USA), Lipoid LLC (Newark, N.J., USA) and Lipoid GmbH (Germany), among various other suppliers.

A hydrophobic phase agent may itself be hydrophobic (i.e. lipophilic) in which case the hydrophobic phase agent may be soluble in a hydrophobic substance. A hydrophobic phase agent that is hydrophobic may be dissolved or suspended within a hydrophobic substance without the use of a lipid, emulsifier, or amphiphilic substance. A hydrophobic phase agent that is hydrophobic may be incorporated into a hydrophobic phase by mixing said agent with a hydrophobic substance. Alternatively, a hydrophobic phase agent may be hydrophilic (i.e. lipophobic) in which case the hydrophobic phase agent will not be soluble in a hydrophobic substance. A hydrophobic phase agent that is hydrophilic may require the use of a lipid, emulsifier, or amphiphilic substance to solubilize or suspend said agent in a hydrophobic substance. By way of non-limiting example, one or more hydrophobic phase agents that are hydrophilic may be mixed with a phospholipid and cholesterol in an organic solvent, the mixture is then lyophilized, and the lyophilized mixture is then mixed with a hydrophobic substance such that the phospholipid and cholesterol form lipid-based structures as described herein that promote the suspension of the agent in the hydrophobic substance.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">As used herein, &#x201c;aqueous phase agent&#x201d; refers to an agent that is dissolved or suspended within the aqueous phase of an emulsion.

An aqueous phase agent that is hydrophilic may be dissolved or suspended within water or an aqueous solution without the use of a lipid, emulsifier, or amphiphilic substance. An aqueous phase agent that is hydrophilic may be incorporated into an aqueous phase by mixing said agent with water or an aqueous solution. Alternatively, an aqueous phase agent may be hydrophobic (i.e. lipophilic) in which case the aqueous phase agent will not be soluble in water or an aqueous solution. An aqueous phase agent that is hydrophobic may require the use of a lipid, emulsifier, organic solvent, or amphiphilic substance to solubilize or suspend said agent in an aqueous solution. By way of non-limiting example, one or more aqueous phase agents that are hydrophobic may be mixed with an aqueous solution containing phospholipid and cholesterol, and the solution is agitated to form lipid-based structures as described herein such that the lipid-based structures conceal the hydrophobic regions of the aqueous phase agent and promote the suspension of the agent in the aqueous solution. Alternatively, one or more aqueous phase agents that are hydrophobic can be solubilized in an organic solvent such as DMSO, ethanol, tert.butanol, DMF, or poly ethylene glycol and then the organic solvent containing the one or more aqueous phase agents can be mixed with water and/or aqueous solution to form an aqueous phase.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">Some agents may be amphiphilic, meaning that they possess both a polar or hydrophilic region and a non-polar or hydrophobic region enabling them to interact with both hydrophobic and aqueous phases.

The constant domains of the humanized antibody are likewise derived from a human antibody.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">Without limitation, a &#x201c;human antibody&#x201d; as used herein may refer to an antibody obtained from transgenic animals (e.g. mice) that have been genetically engineered to produce specific human antibodies in response to antigenic challenge. In this technique, elements of the human heavy and light chain loci are introduced into strains of mice derived from embryonic stem cell lines that contain targeted disruptions of the endogenous heavy chain and light chain loci. The transgenic animal can synthesize human antibodies specific for human antigens, and the animal can be used to produce human antibody-secreting hybridomas. Methods for obtaining human antibodies from transgenic mice are described e.g. by Green, 1994; Lonberg, 1994; and Taylor, 1994. A fully human antibody also can be constructed by genetic or chromosomal transfection methods, as well as phage display technology, all of which are known in the art. (See, e.g., McCafferty, 1990, for the production of human antibodies and fragments thereof in vitro, from immunoglobulin variable domain gene repertoires from unimmunized donors). In this technique, antibody variable domain genes are cloned in-frame into either a major or minor coat protein gene of a filamentous bacteriophage, and displayed as functional antibody fragments on the surface of the phage particle. Because the filamentous particle contains a single-stranded DNA copy of the phage genome, selections based on the functional properties of the antibody also result in selection of the gene encoding the antibody exhibiting those properties. In this way, the phage mimics some of the properties of the B cell. Phage display can be performed in a variety of formats, for their review, see, e.g. Johnson and Chiswell, 1993. Human antibodies may also be generated by in vitro activated B cells (see, e.g., U.S. Pat.

In this context, by &#x201c;functional&#x201d; it is meant that the fragment maintains its ability to bind to the target antigen. In an embodiment, the binding affinity may be equivalent to, or greater than, that of parent antibody. In an embodiment, the binding affinity may be less than the parent antibody, but nevertheless the functional fragment maintains a specificity and/or selectivity for the target antigen. In an embodiment, in addition to the functional fragment maintaining its ability to bind to the target antigen of the parent antibody, the functional fragment also maintains the effector function of the antibody, if applicable (e.g. activation of the classical complement pathway; antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC); other downstream signalling processes).</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">Functional fragments of antibodies include, without limitation, a portion of an antibody such as a F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2</sub>, a F(ab)<sub>2</sub>, a Fab&#x2032;, a Fab, a Fab<sub>2</sub>, a Fab<sub>3</sub>, a single domain antibody (e.g. a Dab or VHHs) and the like, including half-molecules of IgG4 (van der Neut Kolfschoten, 2007). Regardless of structure, a functional fragment of an antibody binds with the same antigen that is recognized by the intact antibody. The term &#x201c;functional fragment&#x201d;, in relation to antibodies, also includes isolated fragments consisting of the variable regions, such as the &#x201c;Fv&#x201d; fragments consisting of the variable regions of the heavy and light chains and recombinant single chain polypeptide molecules in which light and heavy chain variable regions are connected by a peptide linker (&#x201c;scFv proteins&#x201d;).

Antibody mimetics are usually artificial peptides or proteins, but they are not limited to such embodiments. Typically, antibody mimetics are smaller than antibodies, with a molar mass of about 3-20 kDa (whereas antibodies are generally about 150 kDa). Non-limiting examples of antibody mimetics include peptide aptamers, affimers, affilins, affibodies, affitins, alphabodies, anticalins, avimers, DARPins&#x2122;, fynomers, Kunitz domain peptides, nanoCLAMPs&#x2122;, affinity reagents and scaffold proteins. Nucleic acids and small molecules may also be antibody mimetics.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0166">The term &#x201c;peptide aptamer&#x201d;, as used herein, refers to peptides or proteins that are designed to interfere with other protein interactions inside cells. They consist of a variable peptide loop attached at both ends to a protein scaffold. This double structural constraint greatly increases the binding affinity of the peptide aptamer to levels comparable to an antibody's (nanomolar range). The variable peptide loop typically comprises 10 to 20 amino acids, and the scaffold may be any protein having good solubility properties. Currently, the bacterial protein Thioredoxin-A is a commonly used scaffold protein, the variable peptide loop being inserted within the redox-active site, which is a -Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys- loop in the wild protein, the two cysteins lateral chains being able to form a disulfide bridge. Peptide aptamer selection can be made using different systems, but the most widely used is currently the yeast two-hybrid system.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0167">The term &#x201c;affimer&#x201d;, as used herein, represents an evolution of peptide aptamers. An affimer is a small, highly stable protein engineered to display peptide loops which provides a high affinity binding surface for a specific target protein or antigen. Affimers can have the same specificity advantage of antibodies, but are smaller, can be chemically synthesized or chemically modified and have the advantage of being free from cell culture contaminants. Affimers are proteins of low molecular weight, typically 12 to 14 kDa, derived from the cysteine protease inhibitor family of cystatins. The affimer scaffold is a stable protein based on the cystatin protein fold. It displays two peptide loops and an N-terminal sequence that can be randomised to bind different target proteins with high affinity and specificity.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0168">The term &#x201c;affilin&#x201d;, as used herein, refers to antibody mimetics that are developed by using either gamma-B crystalline or ubiquitin as a scaffold and modifying amino-acids on the surface of these proteins by random mutagenesis. Selection of affilins with the desired target specificity is effected, for example, by phage display or ribosome display techniques. Depending on the scaffold, affilins have a molecular weight of approximately 10 kDa (ubiquitin) or 20 kDa (gamma-B crystalline). As used herein, the term affilin also refers to di- or multimerised forms of affilins (Weidle, 2013).</p><p id="p-0170" num="0169">The term &#x201c;affibody&#x201d;, as used herein, refers to a family of antibody mimetics which is derived from the Z-domain of staphylococcal protein A. Structurally, affibody molecules are based on a three-helix bundle domain which can also be incorporated into fusion proteins. In itself, an affibody has a molecular mass of around 6 kDa and is stable at high temperatures and under acidic or alkaline conditions. Target specificity is obtained by randomization of 13 amino acids located in two alpha-helices involved in the binding activity of the parent protein domain (Feldwisch and Tolmachev, 2012). In an embodiment, it is an Affibody&#x2122; sourced from Affibody AB, Stockholm, Sweden.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0170">An &#x201c;affitin&#x201d; (also known as nanofitin) is an antibody mimetic protein that is derived from the DNA binding protein Sac7d of <i>Sulfolobus acidocaldarius</i>. Affitins usually have a molecular weight of around 7 kDa and are designed to specifically bind a target molecule by randomising the amino acids on the binding surface (Mouratou, 2012). In an embodiment, the affitin is as described in WO 2012/085861.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0171">The term &#x201c;alphabody&#x201d;, as used herein, refers to small 10 kDa proteins engineered to bind to a variety of antigens. Alphabodies are developed as scaffolds with a set of amino acid residues that can be modified to bind protein targets, while maintaining correct folding and thermostability. The alphabody scaffold is computationally designed based on coiled-coil structures, but it has no known counterpart in nature. Initially, the scaffold was made of three peptides that associated non-covalently to form a parallel coiled-coil trimer (US Patent Publication No. 20100305304), but was later redesigned as a single peptide chain containing three &#x3b1;-helices connected by linker regions (Desmet, 2014).</p><p id="p-0173" num="0172">The term &#x201c;anticalin&#x201d;, as used herein, refers to an engineered protein derived from a lipocalin (Beste, 1999); Gebauer and Skerra, 2009). Anticalins possess an eight-stranded &#x3b2;-barrel which forms a highly conserved core unit among the lipocalins and naturally forms binding sites for ligands by means of four structurally variable loops at the open end. Anticalins, although not homologous to the IgG superfamily, show features that so far have been considered typical for the binding sites of antibodies: (i) high structural plasticity as a consequence of sequence variation and (ii) elevated conformational flexibility, allowing induced fit to targets with differing shape.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0173">The term &#x201c;avimer&#x201d; (avidity multimers), as used herein, refers to a class of antibody mimetics which consist of two or more peptide sequences of 30 to 35 amino acids each, which are derived from A-domains of various membrane receptors and which are connected by linker peptides. Binding of target molecules occurs via the A-domain and domains with the desired binding specificity can be selected, for example, by phage display techniques. The binding specificity of the different A-domains contained in an avimer may, but does not have to be identical (Weidle, 2013).</p><p id="p-0175" num="0174">The term &#x201c;DARPin&#x2122;&#x201d;, as used herein, refers to a designed ankyrin repeat domain (166 residues), which provides a rigid interface arising from typically three repeated &#x3b2;-turns. DARPins usually carry three repeats corresponding to an artificial consensus sequence, wherein six positions per repeat are randomised. Consequently, DARPins lack structural flexibility (Gebauer and Skerra, 2009).</p><p id="p-0176" num="0175">The term &#x201c;Fynomer&#x2122;&#x201d;, as used herein, refers to a non-immunoglobulin-derived binding polypeptide derived from the human Fyn SH3 domain. Fyn SH3-derived polypeptides are well-known in the art and have been described, e.g. in Grabulovski, 2007; WO 2008/022759; Bertschinger, 2007; Gebauer and Skerra, 2009; and Schlatter, 2012).</p><p id="p-0177" num="0176">A &#x201c;Kunitz domain peptide&#x201d; is derived from the Kunitz domain of a Kunitz-type protease inhibitor such as bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI), amyloid precursor protein (APP) or tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI). Kunitz domains have a molecular weight of approximately 6kDA and domains with the required target specificity can be selected by display techniques such as phage display (Weidle, 2013).</p><p id="p-0178" num="0177">The term &#x201c;monobody&#x201d; (also referred to as &#x201c;adnectin&#x201d;), as used herein, relates to a molecule based on the 10th extracellular domain of human fibronectin III (10Fn3), which adopts an Ig-like &#x3b2;-sandwich fold of 94 residues with 2 to 3 exposed loops, but lacks the central disulphide bridge (Gebauer and Skerra, 2009). Monobodies with the desired target specificity can be genetically engineered by introducing modifications in specific loops of the protein. In an embodiment, the monobody is an ADNECTIN&#x2122; (Bristol-Myers Squibb, New York, New York).</p><p id="p-0179" num="0178">The term &#x201c;nanoCLAMP&#x201d; (CLostridal Antibody Mimetic Proteins), as used herein, refers to affinity reagents that are 15 kDa proteins having tight, selective and gently reversible binding to target molecules. The nanoCLAMP scaffold is based on an IgG-like, thermostable carbohydrate binding module family 32 (CBM32) from a <i>Clostridium perfringens </i>hyaluronidase (Mu toxin). The shape of nanoCLAMPs approximates a cylinder of approximately 4 nm in length and 2.5 nm in diameter, roughly the same size as a nanobody. nanoCLAMPs to specific targets are generated by varying the amino acid sequences and sometimes the length of three solvent exposed, adjacent loops that connect the beta strands making up the beta-sandwich fold, conferring binding affinity and specificity for the target (Suderman, 2017).</p><p id="p-0180" num="0179">The term &#x201c;affinity reagent&#x201d;, as used herein, refers to any compound or substance that binds to a larger target molecule to identify, track, capture or influence its activity. Although antibodies and peptide aptamers are common examples, many different types of affinity reagents are available to the skilled person. In an embodiment, the affinity reagent is one that provides a viable scaffold that can be engineered to specifically bind a target (e.g. Top7 is a scaffold engineered specifically to bind CD4; Boschek, 2009).</p><p id="p-0181" num="0180">The term &#x201c;scaffold proteins&#x201d;, as used herein, refers polypeptides or proteins that interact and/or bind with multiple members of a signalling pathway. They are regulators of many key signalling pathways. In such pathways, they regulate signal transduction and help localize pathway components. Herein, they are encompassed by the term &#x201c;antibody mimetics&#x201d; for their ability to specifically and/or selectively bind target proteins, much like antibodies. In addition to their binding function and specificity, scaffold proteins may also have enzymatic activity. Exemplary scaffold proteins include, without limitation, kinase suppressor of Ras 1 (KNS), MEK kinase 1 (MEKK1), B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (BCL-10), A-kinase-anchoring protein (AKAP), Neuroblast differentiation-associated protein AHNAK, HOMER1, pellino proteins, NLRP family, discs large homolog 1 (DLG1) and spinophillin (PPP1R9B).</p><p id="p-0182" num="0181">Other embodiments of antibody mimetics include, without limitation, Z domain of Protein A, Gamma B crystalline, ubiquitin, cystatin, Sac7D from <i>Sulfolobus acidocaldarius</i>, lipocalin, A domain of a membrane receptor, ankyrin repeat motive, SH3 domain of Fyn, Kunits domain of protease inhibitors, the 10<sup>th </sup>type III domain of fibronectin, 3- or 4-helix bundle proteins, an armadillo repeat domain, a leucine-rich repeat domain, a PDZ domain, a SUMO or SUMO-like domain, an immunoglobulin-like domain, phosphotyrosine-binding domain, pleckstrin homology domain, or src homology 2 domain.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0182">As used herein, the term &#x201c;functional fragment&#x201d;, with respect to an antibody mimetic, refers any portion or fragment of an antibody mimetic that maintains the ability to bind to its target molecule. The functional fragment of an antibody mimetic may be, for example, a portion of any of the antibody mimetics as described herein. In an embodiment, the binding affinity may be equivalent to, or greater than, that of parent antibody mimetic. In an embodiment, the binding affinity may be less than the parent antibody mimetic, but nevertheless the functional fragment maintains a specificity and/or selectivity for the target antigen.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0183">In an embodiment, in addition to the functional fragment of an antibody mimetic maintaining its ability to bind to the target molecule of the parent antibody mimetic, the functional fragment also maintains the effector function of the antibody mimetic, if applicable (e.g. downstream signalling).</p><p id="p-0185" num="0184">As used herein, a &#x201c;functional equivalent&#x201d; in the context of an antibody mimetic refers to a polypeptide or other compound or molecule having similar binding characteristics to an antibody mimetic, but not necessarily being a recognizable &#x201c;fragment&#x201d; of an antibody mimetic.

An immunomodulatory agent may be incorporated into a composition according to the present invention as a hydrophobic phase agent and/or an aqueous phase agent. As used herein, an &#x201c;immunomodulatory agent&#x201d; is a compound or molecule that modulates the activity and/or effectiveness of an immune response. &#x201c;Modulate&#x201d;, as used herein, means to enhance (upregulate), suppress (downregulate), direct, redirect or reprogram an immune response. The term &#x201c;modulate&#x201d; is not intended to mean activate or induce. By this, it is meant that the immunomodulatory agent modulates (enhances, reduces or directs) an immune response that is activated, initiated or induced by a particular substance (e.g. an antigen), but the immunomodulatory agent is not itself the substance against which the immune response is directed, nor is the immunomodulatory agent derived from that substance.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0190">In an embodiment, the immunomodulatory agent is one that modulates myeloid cells (monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, magakaryocytes and granulocytes) or lymphoid cells (T cells, B cells and natural killer (NK) cells).

Immune checkpoint proteins are signaling proteins that play a role in regulating immune response. Some checkpoint inhibitors are receptors located on the surface of a cell that respond to extracellular signaling. For example, many checkpoints are initiated by ligand-receptor interactions. When activated, inhibitory checkpoint proteins produce an anti-inflammatory response that can include activation of regulatory T cells and inhibition of cytotoxic or killer T cells. Cancer cells have been shown to express inhibitory checkpoint proteins as a way to avoid recognition by immune cells. Accordingly, inhibitors of inhibitory checkpoint proteins (i.e. &#x201c;immune checkpoint inhibitors&#x201d;) can be used to activate the immune system in an individual to kill cancer cells (see e.g. Pardoll, 2012).</p><p id="p-0197" num="0196">In an embodiment, the immunomodulatory agent is any compound, molecule or substance that is an immune checkpoint inhibitor, including but not limited to, an inhibitor of an immune checkpoint protein selected from Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1, also known as B7-H1, CD274), Programmed Death 1 (PD-1, CD279), CTLA-4 (CD154), PD-L2 (B7-DC, CD273), LAG3 (CD223), TIM3 (HAVCR2, CD366), 41BB (CD137), 2B4, A2aR, B7H1, B7H3, B7H4, B- and T-lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA), CD2, CD27, CD28, CD30, CD33, CD40, CD70, CD80, CD86, CD160, CD226, CD276, DR3, GAL9, GITR, HVEM, IDO1, IDO2, ICOS (inducible T cell costimulator), Killer inhibitory receptor (KIR), LAG-3, LAIR1, LIGHT, MARCO (macrophage receptor with collageneous structure), phosphatidylserine (PS), OX-40, Siglec-5, Siglec-7, Siglec-9, Siglec-11, SLAM, TIGIT, TIM3, TNF-&#x3b1;, VISTA, VTCN1, or any combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0197">In an embodiment, the immunomodulatory agent is any compound, molecule or substance that inhibits or blocks CTLA-4. CTLA-4 signaling inhibits T-cell activation, particularly during strong T-cell responses. CTLA-4 blockade using CTLA-4 inhibitors, such as anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies, has great appeal because suppression of inhibitory signals results in the generation of an antitumor T-cell response. Both clinical and preclinical data indicate that CTLA-4 blockade results in direct activation of CD4+ and CD8+ effector cells, and anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody therapy has shown promise in a number of cancers.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0198">In an embodiment, the immunomodulatory agent is any compound, molecule or substance that inhibits or blocks PD-1. Like CTLA-4 signaling, PD-1/PD-L1 modulates T-cell response. Tregs that express PD-1 have been shown to have an immune inhibitor response and PD-1/PD-L1 expression is thus thought to play a role in self-tolerance. In the context of cancer, tumor cells over express PD-1 and PD-L1 in order to evade recognition by the immune system. Anti-cancer therapy that blocks the PD-L1/PD-1 increases effector T cell activity and decreases suppressive Treg activity which allows recognition and destruction of the tumor by an individual's immune system.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0199">In an embodiment, the immunomodulatory agent is a checkpoint inhibitor.

Immune costimulatory molecules are signaling proteins that play a role in regulating immune response. Some immune costimulatory molecules are receptors located on the surface of a cell that respond to extracellular signaling. When activated, immune costimulatory molecules produce a pro-inflammatory response that can include suppression of regulatory T cells and activation of cytotoxic or killer T cells. Accordingly, immune costimulatory molecule agonists can be used to activate the immune system in an individual to kill cancer cells. Exemplary immune costimulatory molecules include any of CD27, CD28, CD40, CD122, CD137, CD137/4-1BB, ICOS, IL-10, OX40 TGF-beta, TOR receptor, and glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related protein GITR. For example OX40 stimulation suppresses Treg cell function while enhancing effector T cell survival and activity, thereby increasing anti-tumor immunity. In an embodiment, the immunomodulatory agent is any compound, molecule or substance that is an agonist of a costimulatory immune molecule, including, but not limited to, a costimulatory immune molecule selected from CD27, CD28, CD40, CD122, CD137, CD137/4-1BB, ICOS, IL-10, OX40 TGF-beta, TOR receptor, and glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related protein GITR. Various immune costimulatory molecule agonists may be used. For example, the immune costimulatory molecule agonist may be an antibody that binds to and activates an immune costimulatory molecule.

As used herein, the term &#x201c;antigen&#x201d; refers to any substance or molecule that can bind specifically to components of the immune system. In some embodiments, suitable antigens are those that are capable of inducing or generating an immune response in a subject. An antigen that is capable of inducing an immune response is said to be immunogenic, and may also be called an immunogen.

In an embodiment, the peptide antigen may be derived from a microorganism, such as for example a live, attenuated, inactivated or killed bacterium, virus or protozoan, or part thereof. In an embodiment, the peptide antigen may be derived from an animal, such as for example a human, or an antigen that is substantially related thereto.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0210">As used herein, the term &#x201c;derived from&#x201d; encompasses, without limitation: a peptide antigen that is isolated or obtained directly from an originating source (e.g. a subject); a synthetic or recombinantly generated peptide antigen that is identical or substantially related to a peptide antigen from an originating source; or a peptide antigen which is made from a peptide antigen of an originating source or a fragment thereof. When it is stated that a peptide antigen is &#x201c;from&#x201d; a source, the term &#x201c;from&#x201d; may be equated with &#x201c;derived from&#x201d;. The term &#x201c;substantially related&#x201d;, in this context, means that the peptide antigen may have been modified by chemical, physical or other means (e.g. sequence modification), but that the resultant product remains capable of generating an immune response to the original peptide antigen and/or to the disease or disorder associated with the original antigen. &#x201c;Substantially related&#x201d; includes variants and/or derivatives of the native peptide antigen.

Non-limiting examples of modifications that may be made include N-terminal modifications, C-terminal modifications, amidation, acetylation, peptide cyclization by creating disulfide bridges, phosphorylation, methylation, conjugation to other molecules (e.g. BSA, KLH, OVA), PEGylation and the inclusion of unnatural amino acids.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0215">In an embodiment, the modification may be an amino acid sequence modification, e.g. deletion, substitution or insertion. The substitution may be a conservative amino acid substitution or a non-conservative amino acid substitution.

The CTL epitope may be modified as compared to its natural counterpart, such as by one or two amino acids. Unless otherwise stated, reference herein to a CTL epitope is to an unbound molecule that is capable of being taken up by cells and presented on the surface of an antigen-presenting cell.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0220">The CTL epitope should typically be one that is amendable to recognition by T cell receptors so that a cell-mediated immune response can occur. For peptides, CTL epitopes may interact with class I or class II MHC molecules. CTL epitopes presented by MHC class I molecules are typically peptides between 8 and 15 amino acids in length, and more often between 9 and 11 amino acids in length. CTL epitopes presented by MHC class II molecules are typically peptides between 5 and 24 amino acids in length, and more often between 13 and 17 amino acids in length. If the antigen is larger than these sizes, it will be processed by the immune system into fragments of a size more suitable for interaction with MHC class I or II molecules.

Survivin, also called baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis repeat-containing 5 (BIRC5), is a protein involved in the negative regulation of apoptosis. It has been classed as a member of the family of inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs). Survivin is a 16.5 kDa cytoplasmic protein containing a single BIR motif and a highly charged carboxy-terminal coiled region instead of a RING finger. The gene coding for survivin is nearly identical to the sequence of Effector Cell Protease Receptor-1 (EPR-1), but oriented in the opposite direction. The coding sequence for the survivin (<i>Homo sapiens</i>) is 429 nucleotides long including stop codons (SEQ ID NO: 15). The encoded protein survivin (<i>Homo sapiens</i>) is 142 amino acids long (SEQ ID NO: 16).</p><p id="p-0243" num="0241">In an embodiment, the peptide antigen is any peptide, polypeptide or variant thereof derived from a survivin protein, or a fragment thereof.

In specific embodiments, the survivin peptide consists of a heptapeptide, an octapeptide, a nonapeptide, a decapeptide or an undecapeptide, consisting of 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 consecutive amino acid residues of the survivin protein (e.g. SEQ ID NO: 16), respectively. Particular embodiments of the survivin antigen include survivin peptides of about 9 or 10 amino acids.</p><p id="p-0245" num="0243">Survivin peptide antigens also encompass variants and functional equivalents of natural survivin peptides. Variants or functional equivalents of a survivin peptide encompass peptides that exhibit amino acid sequences with differences as compared to the specific sequence of the survivin protein, such as one or more amino acid substitutions, deletions or additions, or any combination thereof. The difference may be measured as a reduction in identity as between the survivin protein sequence and the survivin peptide variant or survivin peptide functional equivalent. In an embodiment, the peptide antigen may include any one or more of the survivin peptides, survivin peptide variants or survivin peptide functional equivalents disclosed in WO 2004/067023; WO 2006/081826 or WO 2016/176761.

As is well-known in the art, a self-antigen is an antigen that originates from within the body of a subject. The immune system is usually non-reactive against self-antigens under normal homeostatic conditions. These types of antigens therefore pose a difficulty in the development of targeted immune therapies. In an embodiment, the peptide antigen is a self-antigen or a fragment or modified variant thereof.</p><p id="p-0247" num="0245">In an embodiment, the peptide antigen is a neoantigen. As used herein, the term &#x201c;neoantigen&#x201d; refers to a class of tumor antigens which arise from tumor-specific mutations in an expressed protein. The neoantigen can be derived from any cancer, tumor or cell thereof. In the context of neoantigens, the term &#x201c;derived from&#x201d; as used herein encompasses, without limitation: a neoantigen that is isolated or obtained directly from an originating source (e.g. a subject); a synthetic or recombinantly generated neoantigen that is identical in sequence to a neoantigen from an originating source; or a neoantigen which is made from a neoantigen of an originating source or a fragment thereof. The mutations in the expressed protein that create the neoantigen may be patient-specific. By &#x201c;patient-specific&#x201d;, it is meant that the mutation(s) are unique to an individual subject. However, it is possible that more than one subject will share the same mutation(s).

A &#x201c;neoepitope&#x201d; is an epitope of a neoantigen which comprises a tumor-specific mutation as compared to the native amino acid sequence. Generally, neoepitopes may be identified by screening neoantigens for anchor residues that have the potential to bind patient HLA. The neoepitopes are normally ranked using algorithms, such as NetMHC, that can predict peptide binding to HLA.</p><p id="p-0249" num="0247">A &#x201c;T-cell neoepitope&#x201d; is to be understood as meaning a mutated peptide sequence which can be bound by the MHC molecules of class I or II in the form of a peptide-presenting MHC molecule or MHC complex. The T-cell neoepitope should typically be one that is amenable to recognition by T cell receptors so that a cell-mediated immune response can occur. A &#x201c;B-cell neoepitope&#x201d; is to be understood as meaning a mutated peptide sequence which can be recognized by B cells and/or by antibodies.</p><p id="p-0250" num="0248">In some embodiments, at least one of the neoepitopes of the neoantigen is a patient-specific neoepitope.

A T-helper epitope may be incorporated into a composition according to the present invention as a hydrophobic phase agent and/or an aqueous phase agent. In some embodiments, a T-helper epitope is used when at least one other agent is an antigen.</p><p id="p-0257" num="0254">T-helper epitopes are a sequence of amino acids (natural or non-natural amino acids) that have T-helper activity. T-helper epitopes are recognised by T-helper lymphocytes, which play an important role in establishing and maximising the capabilities of the immune system, and are involved in activating and directing other immune cells, such as for example cytotoxic T lymphocytes. A T-helper epitope can consist of a continuous or discontinuous epitope. Hence not every amino acid of a T-helper is necessarily part of the epitope.</p><p id="p-0258" num="0255">Accordingly, T-helper epitopes, including analogs and segments of T-helper epitopes, are capable of enhancing or stimulating an immune response. Immunodominant T-helper epitopes are broadly reactive in animal and human populations with widely divergent MHC types (Celis 1988, Demotz 1989, Chong 1992). The T-helper domain of the subject peptides may have from about 10 to about 50 amino acids, and more particularly about 10 to about 30 amino acids. When multiple T-helper epitopes are present, then each T-helper epitope acts independently.</p><p id="p-0259" num="0256">In another embodiment, the T-helper epitope may be a T-helper epitope analog or a T-helper segment. T-helper epitope analogs may include substitutions, deletions and insertions of from one to about 10 amino acid residues in the T-helper epitope. T-helper segments are contiguous portions of a T-helper epitope that are sufficient to enhance or stimulate an immune response. An example of T-helper segments is a series of overlapping peptides that are derived from a single longer peptide.</p><p id="p-0260" num="0257">In a particular embodiment, the T-helper epitope may be the modified Tetanus toxin peptide A16L (amino acids 830 to 844; AQYIKANSKFIGITEL; SEQ ID NO: 28), with an alanine residue added to its amino terminus to enhance stability (Slingluff 2001).</p><p id="p-0261" num="0258">Other sources of T-helper epitopes which may be used include, for example, hepatitis B surface antigen helper T cell epitopes, pertussis toxin helper T cell epitopes, measles virus F protein helper T cell epitope, <i>Chlamydia trachomitis </i>major outer membrane protein helper T cell epitope, diphtheria toxin helper T cell epitopes, <i>Plasmodium falciparum </i>circumsporozoite helper T cell epitopes, <i>Schistosoma mansoni </i>triose phosphate isomerase helper T cell epitopes, <i>Escherichia coli </i>TraT helper T cell epitopes and immune-enhancing analogs and segments of any of these T-helper epitopes.</p><p id="p-0262" num="0259">In some embodiments, the T-helper epitope may be a universal T-helper epitope. A universal T-helper epitope as used herein refers to a peptide or other immunogenic molecule, or a fragment thereof, that binds to a multiplicity of MHC class II molecules in a manner that activates T cell function in a class II (CD4+ T cells)-restricted manner. An example of a universal T-helper epitope is PADRE (pan-DR epitope) comprising the peptide sequence AKXVAAWTLKAAA, wherein X may be cyclohexylalanyl (SEQ ID NO: 29). PADRE specifically has a CD4+ T-helper epitope, that is, it stimulates induction of a PADRE-specific CD4+ T-helper response.</p><p id="p-0263" num="0260">In addition to the modified tetanus toxin peptide A16L mentioned earlier, Tetanus toxoid has other T-helper epitopes that work in the similar manner as PADRE.

PolyI:C polynucleotides are polynucleotide molecules (either RNA or DNA or a combination of DNA and RNA) containing inosinic acid residues (I) and cytidylic acid residues (C), and which induce the production of inflammatory cytokines, such as interferon. In an embodiment, the polyI:C polynucleotide is double-stranded. In such embodiments, they may be composed of one strand consisting entirely of cytosine-containing nucleotides and one strand consisting entirely of inosine-containing nucleotides, although other configurations are possible. For instance, each strand may contain both cytosine-containing and inosine-containing nucleotides. In some instances, either or both strands may additionally contain one or more non-cytosine or non-inosine nucleotides.</p><p id="p-0272" num="0269">It has been reported that polyL:C can be segmented every 16 residues without an effect on its interferon activating potential (Bobst 1981). Furthermore, the interferon inducing potential of a polyL:C molecule mismatched by introducing a uridine residue every 12 repeating cytidylic acid residues (Hendrix 1993), suggests that a minimal double stranded polyL:C molecule of 12 residues is sufficient to promote interferon production. Others have also suggested that regions as small as 6-12 residues, which correspond to 0.5-1 helical turn of the double stranded polynucleotide, are capable of triggering the induction process (Greene 1978). If synthetically made, polyL:C polynucleotides are typically about 20 or more residues in length (commonly 22, 24, 26, 28 or 30 residues in length). If semi-synthetically made (e.g. using an enzyme), the length of the strand may be 500, 1000 or more residues.</p><p id="p-0273" num="0270">Accordingly, as used herein, a &#x201c;polyL:C&#x201d;, &#x201c;polyL:C polynucleotide&#x201d; or &#x201c;polyL:C polynucleotide adjuvant&#x201d; is a double- or single-stranded polynucleotide molecule (RNA or DNA or a combination of DNA and RNA), each strand of which contains at least 6 contiguous inosinic or cytidylic acid residues, or 6 contiguous residues selected from inosinic acid and cytidylic acid in any order (e.g. IICIIC or ICICIC), and which is capable of inducing or enhancing the production of at least one inflammatory cytokine, such as interferon, in a mammalian subject. PolyI:C polynucleotides will typically have a length of about 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 25, 26, 28, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 500, 1000 or more residues.

In either case, the polymer may be interrupted by one or more non-inosinic or non-cytidylic acid residues (e.g. uridine), provided there is at least one contiguous region of 6 I, 6 C or 6 I/C residues as described above. Typically, each strand of a polyL:C polynucleotide will contain no more than 1 non-I/C residue per 6 I/C residues, more preferably, no more than 1 non-I/C residue per every 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28 or 30 I/C residues.</p><p id="p-0275" num="0272">The inosinic acid or cytidylic acid (or other) residues in the polyL:C polynucleotide may be derivatized or modified as is known in the art, provided the ability of the polyL:C polynucleotide to promote the production of an inflammatory cytokine, such as interferon, is retained. Non-limiting examples of derivatives or modifications include e.g. azido modifications, fluoro modifications, or the use of thioester (or similar) linkages instead of natural phosphodiester linkages to enhance stability in vivo. The polyL:C polynucleotide may also be modified to e.g. enhance its resistance to degradation in vivo by e.g. complexing the molecule with positively charged poly-lysine and carboxymethylcellulose, or with a positively charged synthetic peptide.</p><p id="p-0276" num="0273">In an embodiment, the polyL:C polynucleotide may be a single-stranded molecule containing inosinic acid residues (I) and cytidylic acid residues (C).

It is contemplated that the polynucleotide may contain modifications of one or more nitrogenous bases, pentose sugars or phosphate groups in the nucleotide chain. Such modifications are well-known in the art and may be for the purpose of e.g. improving stability, solubility or transcriptional/translational activity of the polynucleotide.</p><p id="p-0289" num="0286">The polynucleotide may be used in various forms. In an embodiment, a naked polynucleotide may be used, either in linear form, or inserted into a plasmid, such as an expression plasmid. In other embodiments, a live vector such as a viral vector or bacterial vector may be used.</p><p id="p-0290" num="0287">Depending on the nature of the polynucleotide and the intended use, one or more regulatory sequences that aid in transcription of DNA into RNA and/or translation of RNA into a polypeptide may be present. For example, if it is intended or not required that the polynucleotide be transcribed or translated, such regulatory sequences may be absent. In some instances, such as in the case of a polynucleotide that is a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule, regulatory sequences relating to the transcription process (e.g. a promoter) are not required, and protein expression may be effected in the absence of a promoter. The skilled artisan can include suitable regulatory sequences as the circumstances require.</p><p id="p-0291" num="0288">In some embodiments, the polynucleotide is present in an expression cassette, in which it is operably linked to regulatory sequences that will permit the polynucleotide to be expressed in the subject. The choice of expression cassette depends on the subject as well as the features desired for the expressed polypeptide. Typically, an expression cassette includes a promoter that is functional in the subject and can be constitutive or inducible; a ribosome binding site; a start codon (ATG) if necessary; the polynucleotide encoding the polypeptide of interest; a stop codon; and optionally a 3&#x2032; terminal region (translation and/or transcription terminator). Additional sequences such as a region encoding a signal peptide may be included. The polynucleotide encoding the polypeptide of interest may be homologous or heterologous to any of the other regulatory sequences in the expression cassette. Sequences to be expressed together with the polypeptide of interest, such as a signal peptide encoding region, are typically located adjacent to the polynucleotide encoding the protein to be expressed and placed in proper reading frame. The open reading frame constituted by the polynucleotide encoding the protein to be expressed solely or together with any other sequence to be expressed (e.g. the signal peptide), is placed under the control of the promoter so that transcription and translation occur in the subject to which the composition is administered.</p><p id="p-0292" num="0289">Promoters suitable for expression of polynucleotides in a wide range of host systems are well-known in the art. Promoters suitable for expression of polynucleotides in mammals include those that function constitutively, ubiquitously or tissue-specifically. Examples of non-tissue specific promoters include promoters of viral origin. Examples of viral promoters include Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus (MMTV) promoter, Human Immunodeficiency Virus Long Terminal Repeat (HIV LTR) promoter, Moloney virus, avian leukosis virus (ALV), Cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate early promoter/enhancer, Rous Sarcoma Virus (RSV), adeno-associated virus (AAV) promoters; adenoviral promoters, and Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) promoters. Compatibility of viral promoters with certain polypeptides is a consideration since their combination may affect expression levels. It is possible to use synthetic promoter/enhancers to optimize expression (see e.g. US patent publication 2004/0171573). An example of a tissue-specific promoter is the desmin promoter which drives expression in muscle cells (Li 1989; Li &#x26; Paulin 1991; and Li &#x26; Paulin 1993). Other examples include artificial promoters such as a synthetic muscle specific promoter and a chimeric muscle-specific/CMV promoter (Li 1999; Hagstrom 2000).</p><p id="p-0293" num="0290">As noted above, the polynucleotide of interest, together with any necessary regulatory sequences, may be delivered naked, e.g. either alone or as part of a plasmid, or may be delivered in a viral or bacterial or bacterial vector. Whether a plasmid-type vector, or a bacterial or viral vector is used, it may be desirable that the vector be unable to replicate or integrate substantially in the subject. Such vectors include those whose sequences are free of regions of substantial identity to the genome of the subject, as to minimize the risk of host-vector recombination. One way to do this is to use promoters not derived from the recipient genome to drive expression of the polypeptide of interest. For example, if the recipient is a mammal, the promoter is preferably non-mammalian derived though it should be able to function in mammalian cells, e.g. a viral promoter.</p><p id="p-0294" num="0291">Viral vectors that may be used to deliver the polynucleotide include e.g. adenoviruses and poxviruses. Useful bacterial vectors include e.g. <i>Shigella, Salmonella, Vibrio cholerae, Lactobacillus</i>, Bacille bilie de Calmette-Guerin (BCG), and <i>Streptococcus</i>. An example of an adenovirus vector, as well as a method for constructing an adenovirus vector capable of expressing a polynucleotide, is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,920,209. Poxvirus vectors include vaccinia and canary pox virus, described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,722,848 and 5,364,773, respectively. Also see, e.g., Tartaglia 1992 for a description of a vaccinia virus vector and Taylor 1995 for a reference of a canary pox. Poxvirus vectors capable of expressing a polynucleotide of interest may be obtained by homologous recombination as described in Kieny 1984, so that the polynucleotide is inserted in the viral genome under appropriate conditions for expression in mammalian cells.</p><p id="p-0295" num="0292">With respect to bacterial vectors, non-toxicogenic <i>Vibrio cholerae </i>mutant strains that are useful for expressing a foreign polynucleotide in a host are known. Mekalanos 1983 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,882,278 describe strains which have a substantial amount of the coding sequence of each of the two ctxA alleles deleted so that no functional <i>cholerae </i>toxin is produced. WO 92/11354 describes a strain in which the irgA locus is inactivated by mutation; this mutation can be combined in a single strain with ctxA mutations. WO 94/01533 describes a deletion mutant lacking functional ctxA and attRSl DNA sequences. These mutant strains are genetically engineered to express heterologous proteins, as described in WO 94/19482. Attenuated <i>Salmonella typhimurium </i>strains, genetically engineered for recombinant expression of heterologous proteins are described in Nakayama 1988 and WO 92/11361. Other bacterial strains which may be used as vectors to express a foreign protein in a subject are described for <i>Shigella flexneri </i>in High 1992 and Sizemore 1995; for <i>Streptococcus gordonii </i>in Medaglini 1995; and for Bacille Calmette Guerin in Flynn 1994, WO 88/06626, WO 90/00594, WO 91/13157, WO 92/01796, and WO 92/21376. In bacterial vectors, the polynucleotide of interest may be inserted into the bacterial genome or remain in a free state as part of a plasmid.</p><p id="p-0296" num="0293">In some embodiments, the RNA polynucleotide does not encode a polypeptide and is an antisense RNA. As used herein, an &#x201c;antisense RNA&#x201d; is any single-stranded RNA that is complementary to a messenger RNA (mRNA). The antisense RNA may exhibit 100% complementarity to the mRNA or less than 100% complementarity so long as the antisense RNA is still able to inhibit translation of the mRNA by base pairing to it, thereby obstructing the translation machinery. In an embodiment, the antisense RNA is highly structured, comprised of one or more stem-and-loop secondary structures, flanked or separated by single-stranded (unpaired) regions. In some embodiments, tertiary structures, such as pseudoknots, may form between two or more secondary structural elements.</p><p id="p-0297" num="0294">In some embodiments, the RNA polynucleotide does not encode a polypeptide and is an interfering RNA, such as a small interfering RNA (siRNA), a microRNA (miRNA) or a small hairpin RNA (shRNA). RNA interference (RNAi) is a biological process in which RNA molecules inhibit gene expression or translation, by neutralizing targeted mRNA molecules. Two types of small ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules&#x2014;microRNA (miRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA)&#x2014;are central to RNA interference. siRNA is a class of double-stranded RNA molecules that are typically 20-25 base pairs in length. It interferes with the expression of specific genes with complementary nucleotide sequences by degrading mRNA after transcription, thereby preventing translation. The natural structure of siRNA is typically a short 20-25 double-stranded RNA with two overhanging nucleotides on each end. The Dicer enzyme catalyzes production of siRNAs from long dsRNAs and small hairpin RNAs (shRNA). shRNA is an artificial RNA molecule with a tight hairpin turn. The design and production of siRNA molecules, and mechanisms of action, are known in the art. miRNAs resemble siRNAs, except miRNAs derive from regions of RNA transcripts that fold back on themselves to form short hairpins, whereas siRNAs derive from longer double-stranded RNA. In an embodiment, the therapeutic agent may be any one or more of these interfering RNAs (siRNA, miRNA or shRNA). The interfering RNA should be one which is capable of decreasing or silencing (preventing) the expression of a gene/mRNA of its endogenous cellular counterpart. In an embodiment, the interfering RNA derived from a naturally occurring interfering RNA. In an embodiment, the interfering RNA is synthetically produced. In an embodiment, the therapeutic agent may be an antagomir. Antagomirs (also known as anti-miRs or blockmirs) are synthetically engineered oligonucleotides that silence endogenous miRNA. It is unclear how antagomirization (the process by which an antagomir inhibits miRNA activity) operates, but it is believed to inhibit by irreversibly binding the miRNA. Because of the promiscuity of microRNAs, antagomirs could affect the regulation of many different mRNA molecules. Antagomirs are designed to have a sequence that is complementary to an mRNA sequence that serves as a binding site for microRNA.</p><p id="p-0298" num="0295">Compositions</p><p id="p-0299" num="0296">The compositions of the present invention comprise an emulsion of a hydrophobic phase comprising at least one hydrophobic phase agent, with the hydrophobic phase being emulsified in an aqueous phase comprising at least one aqueous phase agent.</p><p id="p-0300" num="0297">A composition as disclosed herein may be administered to a subject in a therapeutically effect amount. As used herein, a &#x201c;therapeutically effective amount&#x201d; means an amount of the composition or agent contained therein effective to provide a therapeutic, prophylactic or diagnostic benefit to a subject, and/or an amount sufficient to activate or modulate an immune response in a subject. As used herein, to &#x201c;activate&#x201d; or &#x201c;induce&#x201d; an immune response means to to elicit and/or potentiate an immune response. Inducing an immune response encompasses instances where the immune response is initiated, enhanced, elevated, improved or strengthened to the benefit of the host relative to the prior immune response status. As used herein, to &#x201c;modulate&#x201d; an immune response is distinct and different from activating an immune response. By &#x201c;modulate&#x201d;, it is meant that the active agents and/or immunomodulatory agents herein enhance or suppress an immune response that is activated by other mechanisms or compounds (e.g. by an antigen or immunogen).</p><p id="p-0301" num="0298">In some embodiments, a therapeutically effective amount of the composition is an amount capable of inducing a clinical response in a subject in the treatment of a particular disease or disorder. Determination of a therapeutically effective amount of the composition is well within the capability of those skilled in the art, especially in light of the disclosure provided herein. The therapeutically effective amount may vary according to a variety of factors such as the subject's condition, weight, sex and age.</p><p id="p-0302" num="0299">In some embodiments, one or more components of the emulsion composition are provided as dried preparations or dried compositions for reconstitution in an aqueous solution or a hydrophobic substance. Various methods may be used to produce dried preparations or dried compositions which are known in the art. In an embodiment, the drying is performed by lyophilization, spray freeze-drying, or spray drying. The skilled person is well-aware of these drying techniques and how they may be performed. In an embodiment, the drying is performed by lyophilization. As used herein, &#x201c;lyophilization&#x201d;, &#x201c;lyophilized&#x201d; and &#x201c;freeze-drying&#x201d; are used interchangeably. As is well known in the art, lyophilization works by freezing the material and then reducing the surrounding pressure to allow the volatile solvent (e.g. water) in the material to sublime directly from the solid phase to the gas phase.</p><p id="p-0303" num="0300">As used herein, the term &#x201c;dried preparation&#x201d; or &#x201c;dried composition&#x201d; does not necessarily mean that the preparation or composition is completely dry. For example, depending on the solvent or solvents used in the methods disclosed herein, it is possible that a small component of volatile and/or non-volatile material will remain in the dried preparation or dried composition. In an embodiment, the non-volatile material will remain. By &#x201c;dried preparation&#x201d; or &#x201c;dried composition&#x201d;, it is meant that the preparation or composition no longer contains substantial quantities of water. The process used to dry the preparation or composition should be capable of removing substantially all water from the sized lipid vesicle particle/therapeutic agent mixture. Thus, in an embodiment, the dried preparation or dried composition is completely free of water. In another embodiment, the dried preparation or dried composition may contain a residual moisture content based on the limitations of the drying process (e.g. lyophilization). This residual moisture content will typically be less than 2%, less than 1%, less than 0.5%, less than 0.25%, less than 0.1%, less than 0.05% or less by weight of the dried preparation. This residual moisture content will not be more than 5% by weight of the dried preparation as this would result in a product that is not clear.</p><p id="p-0304" num="0301">When needed, dried preparations or dried compositions can be reconstituted in a suitable solvent, carrier, or liquid. As used herein, by &#x201c;reconstituted&#x201d;, it is meant that a dried preparation or dried composition is brought into solution or suspension by the addition of a suitable solvent, solution, carrier, or liquid to the dried preparation or dried composition. As used herein, the terms &#x201c;reconstituted&#x201d; and &#x201c;resuspended&#x201d; may be used interchangeably. For example, a suitable volume of a hydrophobic substance (e.g. mannide oleate in mineral oil) may be added to a dried composition of lipid, cholesterol, and at least one hydrophobic agent to reconstitute the dried composition. In another example, a suitable volume of water may be added to a dried preparation of at least one aqueous phase agent to reconstitute the dried preparation. During reconstitution, the dried preparation or dried composition can be left to soak for a period of time in the solvent, carrier, or liquid and/or mixed by agitation until the dried preparation or dried composition is fully dissolved or suspended.</p><p id="p-0305" num="0302">Kits</p><p id="p-0306" num="0303">The compositions disclosed herein are optionally provided to a user as a kit.

As used herein, the term &#x201c;modulating&#x201d; is intended to refer to both immunostimulation (e.g. enhancing an immune response) and immunosuppression (e.g. preventing or decreasing an immune response). Typically, the method would involve one or the other of immunostimulation or immunosuppression, but it is possible that the method could be directed to both. As referred to herein, the &#x201c;immune response&#x201d; may either be a cell-mediated (CTL) immune response or an antibody (humoral) immune response.</p><p id="p-0316" num="0313">In some embodiments, the compositions disclosed herein may be used in methods for inducing a cell-mediated immune response to an antigen (e.g. peptide antigens) provided in the composition. In some embodiments, the composition further comprises an agent to enhance the immune response to antigen (e.g. anti-CTLA-4 antibody).</p><p id="p-0317" num="0314">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;cell-mediated immune response&#x201d;, &#x201c;cellular immunity&#x201d;, &#x201c;cellular immune response&#x201d; or &#x201c;cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) immune response&#x201d; (used interchangeably herein) refer to an immune response characterized by the activation of macrophages and natural killer cells, the production of antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes and/or the release of various cytokines in response to an antigen. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes are a sub-group of T lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) which are capable of inducing the death of infected somatic or tumor cells; they kill cells that are infected with viruses (or other pathogens), or that are otherwise damaged or dysfunctional. Most cytotoxic T cells express T cell receptors that can recognise a specific peptide antigen bound to Class I MHC molecules. Typically, cytotoxic T cells also express CD8 (i.e. CD8+ T cells), which is attracted to portions of the Class I MHC molecule. This affinity keeps the cytotoxic T cell and the target cell bound closely together during antigen-specific activation. Cellular immunity protects the body by, for example, activating antigen-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (e.g. antigen-specific CD8+ T cells) that are able to lyse body cells displaying epitopes of foreign or mutated antigen on their surface, such as cancer cells displaying tumor-specific antigens (e.g. neoantigens); activating macrophages and natural killer cells, enabling them to destroy intracellular pathogens; and stimulating cells to secrete a variety of cytokines that influence the function of other cells involved in adaptive immune responses and innate immune responses.</p><p id="p-0318" num="0315">Cellular immunity is an important component of the adaptive immune response and following recognition of antigen by cells through their interaction with antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells, B lymphocytes and to a lesser extent, macrophages, protect the body by various mechanisms such as:</p><p id="p-0319" num="0316">1. activating antigen-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes that are able to induce apoptosis in body cells displaying epitopes of foreign or mutated antigen on their surface, such as cancer cells displaying tumor-specific antigens;</p><p id="p-0320" num="0317">2. activating macrophages and natural killer cells, enabling them to destroy intracellular pathogens; and</p><p id="p-0321" num="0318">3. stimulating cells to secrete a variety of cytokines that influence the function of other cells involved in adaptive immune responses and innate immune responses.</p><p id="p-0322" num="0319">Cell-mediated immunity is most effective in removing virus-infected cells, but also participates in defending against fungi, protozoans, cancers, and intracellular bacteria. It also plays a major role in transplant rejection.</p><p id="p-0323" num="0320">Since cell-mediated immunity involves the participation of various cell types and is mediated by different mechanisms, several methods could be used to demonstrate the induction of immunity following vaccination. These could be broadly classified into detection of i) specific antigen presenting cells; ii) specific effector cells and their functions and iii) release of soluble mediators such as cytokines.</p><p id="p-0324" num="0321">i) Antigen presenting cells: Dendritic cells and B cells (and to a lesser extent macrophages) are equipped with special immunostimulatory receptors that allow for enhanced activation of T cells, and are termed professional antigen presenting cells (APC). These immunostimulatory molecules (also called co-stimulatory molecules) are up-regulated on these cells following infection or vaccination, during the process of antigen presentation to effector cells such as CD4 and CD8 cytotoxic T cells. Such co-stimulatory molecules (such as CD40, CD80, CD86, MHC class I or MHC class II) can be detected, for example, by using flow cytometry with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies directed against these molecules along with antibodies that specifically identify APC (such as CD11c for dendritic cells).</p><p id="p-0325" num="0322">ii) Cytotoxic T cells: (also known as Tc, killer T cell, or cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)) are a sub-group of T cells which induce the death of cells that are infected with viruses (and other pathogens), or expressing tumor antigens. These CTLs directly attack other cells carrying certain foreign or abnormal molecules on their surface. The ability of such cellular cytotoxicity can be detected using in vitro cytolytic assays (chromium release assay). Thus, induction of adaptive cellular immunity can be demonstrated by the presence of such cytotoxic T cells, wherein, when antigen loaded target cells are lysed by specific CTLs that are generated in vivo following vaccination or infection.</p><p id="p-0326" num="0323">Naive cytotoxic T cells are activated when their T cell receptor (TCR) strongly interacts with a peptide-bound MHC class I molecule. This affinity depends on the type and orientation of the antigen/MHC complex, and is what keeps the CTL and infected cell bound together. Once activated the CTL undergoes a process called clonal expansion in which it gains functionality, and divides rapidly, to produce an army of &#x201c;armed&#x201d;-effector cells. Activated CTL will then travel throughout the body in search of cells bearing that unique MHC Class I+peptide. This could be used to identify such CTLs in vitro by using peptide-MHC Class I tetramers in flow cytometric assays.</p><p id="p-0327" num="0324">When exposed to these infected or dysfunctional somatic cells, effector CTL release perform and granulysin: cytotoxins which form pores in the target cell's plasma membrane, allowing ions and water to flow into the infected cell, and causing it to burst or lyse. CTL release granzyme, a serine protease that enters cells via pores to induce apoptosis (cell death). Release of these molecules from CTL can be used as a measure of successful induction of cell-mediated immune response following vaccination. This can be done by enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) or enzyme linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT) where CTLs can be quantitatively measured. Since CTLs are also capable of producing important cytokines such as IFN-&#x3b3;, quantitative measurement of IFN-&#x3b3;-producing CD8 cells can be achieved by ELISPOT and by flowcytometric measurement of intracellular IFN-&#x3b3; in these cells.</p><p id="p-0328" num="0325">CD4+&#x201c;helper&#x201d; T cells: CD4+ lymphocytes, or helper T cells, are immune response mediators, and play an important role in establishing and maximizing the capabilities of the adaptive immune response. These cells have no cytotoxic or phagocytic activity; and cannot kill infected cells or clear pathogens, but, in essence &#x201c;manage&#x201d; the immune response, by directing other cells to perform these tasks. Two types of effector CD4+ T helper cell responses can be induced by a professional APC, designated Th1 and Th2, each designed to eliminate different types of pathogens.</p><p id="p-0329" num="0326">Helper T cells express T cell receptors (TCR) that recognize antigen bound to Class Il MHC molecules. The activation of a naive helper T cell causes it to release cytokines, which influences the activity of many cell types, including the APC that activated it. Helper T cells require a much milder activation stimulus than cytotoxic T cells. Helper T cells can provide extra signals that &#x201c;help&#x201d; activate cytotoxic cells. Two types of effector CD4+ T helper cell responses can be induced by a professional APC, designated Th1 and Th2, each designed to eliminate different types of pathogens. The two Th cell populations differ in the pattern of the effector proteins (cytokines) produced. In general, Th1 cells assist the cell-mediated immune response by activation of macrophages and cytotoxic T cells; whereas Th2 cells promote the humoral immune response by stimulation of B cells for conversion into plasma cells and by formation of antibodies. For example, a response regulated by Th1 cells may induce IgG2a and IgG2b in mouse (IgG1 and IgG3 in humans) and favor a cell mediated immune response to an antigen. If the IgG response to an antigen is regulated by Th2 type cells, it may predominantly enhance the production of IgG1 in mouse (IgG2 in humans). The measure of cytokines associated with Th1 or Th2 responses will give a measure of successful vaccination. This can be achieved by specific ELISA designed for Th1-cytokines such as IFN-&#x3b3;, IL-2, IL-12, TNF-&#x3b1; and others, or Th2-cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 among others.</p><p id="p-0330" num="0327">iii) Measurement of cytokines: released from regional lymph nodes gives a good indication of successful immunization. As a result of antigen presentation and maturation of APC and immune effector cells such as CD4 and CD8 T cells, several cytokines are released by lymph node cells. By culturing these LNC in vitro in the presence of antigen, an antigen-specific immune response can be detected by measuring release if certain important cytokines such as IFN-&#x3b3;, IL-2, IL-12, TNF-&#x3b1; and GM-CSF. This could be done by ELISA using culture supernatants and recombinant cytokines as standards.</p><p id="p-0331" num="0328">Successful immunization may be determined in a number of ways known to the skilled person including, but not limited to, hemagglutination inhibition (HAIJ) and serum neutralization inhibition assays to detect functional antibodies; challenge studies, in which vaccinated subjects are challenged with the associated pathogen to determine the efficacy of the vaccination; and the use of fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) to determine the population of cells that express a specific cell surface marker, e.g. in the identification of activated or memory lymphocytes. A skilled person may also determine if immunization with a composition as disclosed herein elicited an antibody and/or cell mediated immune response using other known methods.</p><p id="p-0332" num="0329">In an embodiment, the compositions disclosed herein may be used in methods for inducing an antibody immune response to an antigen (e.g. peptide antigens) provided in the composition.

Such secreted antibodies bind to antigens, such as for example those on the surfaces of foreign substances, pathogens (e.g. viruses, bacteria, etc.) and/or cancer cells, and flag them for destruction.</p><p id="p-0334" num="0331">As used herein, &#x201c;humoral immune response&#x201d; refers to antibody production and may also include, in addition or alternatively, the accessory processes that accompany it, such as for example the generation and/or activation of T-helper 2 (Th2) or T-helper 17 (Th17) cells, cytokine production, isotype switching, affinity maturation and memory cell activation. &#x201c;Humoral immune response&#x201d; may also include the effector functions of an antibody, such as for example toxin neutralization, classical complement activation, and promotion of phagocytosis and pathogen elimination. The humoral immune response is often aided by CD4+ Th2 cells and therefore the activation or generation of this cell type may also be indicative of a humoral immune response.</p><p id="p-0335" num="0332">An &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; is a protein comprising one or more polypeptides substantially or partially encoded by immunoglobulin genes or fragments of immunoglobulin genes. The recognized immunoglobulin genes include the &#x3ba;, &#x3bb;, &#x3b1;, &#x3b3;, &#x3b4;, &#x3b5; and &#x3bc; constant region genes, as well as myriad immunoglobulin variable region genes. Light chains are classified as either &#x3ba; or &#x3bb;. Heavy chains are classified as &#x3b3;, &#x3bc;, &#x3b1;, &#x3b4;, or &#x3b5;, which in turn define the immunoglobulin classes, IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD and IgE, respectively. A typical immunoglobulin (antibody) structural unit comprises a protein containing four polypeptides. Each antibody structural unit is composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each having one &#x201c;light&#x201d; and one &#x201c;heavy&#x201d; chain. The N-terminus of each chain defines a variable region primarily responsible for antigen recognition. Antibody structural units (e.g. of the IgA and IgM classes) may also assemble into oligomeric forms with each other and additional polypeptide chains, for example as IgM pentamers in association with the J-chain polypeptide.</p><p id="p-0336" num="0333">Antibodies are the antigen-specific glycoprotein products of a subset of white blood cells called B lymphocytes (B cells). Engagement of antigen with antibody expressed on the surface of B cells can induce an antibody response comprising stimulation of B cells to become activated, to undergo mitosis and to terminally differentiate into plasma cells, which are specialized for synthesis and secretion of antigen-specific antibody.</p><p id="p-0337" num="0334">B cells are the sole producers of antibodies during an immune response and are thus a key element to effective humoral immunity. In addition to producing large amounts of antibodies, B cells also act as antigen-presenting cells and can present antigenic peptide to T cells, such as T helper CD4 or cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, thus propagating the immune response. B cells, as well as T cells, are part of the adaptive immune response. During an active immune response, induced for example by either vaccination or natural infection, antigen-specific B cells are activated and clonally expand. During expansion, B cells evolve to have higher affinity for the epitope. Proliferation of B cells can be induced indirectly by activated T-helper cells, and also directly through stimulation of receptors, such as the TLRs.</p><p id="p-0338" num="0335">Antigen presenting cells, such as dendritic cells and B cells, are drawn to vaccination sites and can interact with antigens and adjuvants contained in a vaccine composition. Typically, the adjuvant stimulates the cells to become activated and the antigen provides the blueprint for the target. Different types of adjuvants may provide different stimulation signals to cells. For example, polyLC (a TLR3 agonist) can activate dendritic cells, but not B cells. Adjuvants such as Pam3Cys, Pam2Cys and FSL-1 are especially adept at activating and initiating proliferation of B cells, which is expected to facilitate the production of an antibody response (Moyle 2008; So 2012).</p><p id="p-0339" num="0336">A humoral immune response is one of the common mechanisms for effective infectious disease vaccines (e.g. to protect against viral or bacterial invaders). However, a humoral immune response can also be useful for combating cancer. Whereas a cancer vaccine is typically designed to produce a cell-mediated immune response that can recognize and destroy cancer cells, B cell mediated responses may target cancer cells through other mechanisms which may in some instances cooperate with a cytotoxic T cell for maximum benefit. Examples of B cell mediated (e.g. humoral immune response mediated) anti-tumor responses include, without limitation: 1) Antibodies produced by B cells that bind to surface antigens (e.g. neoantigens) found on tumor cells or other cells that influence tumorigenesis. Such antibodies can, for example. induce killing of target cells through antibody-dependant cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) or complement fixation, potentially resulting in the release of additional antigens that can be recognized by the immune system; 2) Antibodies that bind to receptors on tumor cells to block their stimulation and in effect neutralize their effects; 3) Antibodies that bind to factors released by or associated with a tumor or tumor-associated cells to modulate a signaling or cellular pathway that supports cancer; and 4) Antibodies that bind to intracellular targets and mediate anti-tumor activity through a currently unknown mechanism.</p><p id="p-0340" num="0337">One method of evaluating an antibody response is to measure the titers of antibodies reactive with a particular antigen. This may be performed using a variety of methods known in the art such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of antibody-containing substances obtained from animals. For example, the titers of serum antibodies which bind to a particular antigen may be determined in a subject both before and after exposure to the antigen. A statistically significant increase in the titer of antigen-specific antibodies following exposure to the antigen would indicate the subject had mounted an antibody response to the antigen.</p><p id="p-0341" num="0338">Without limitation, other assays that may be used to detect the presence of an antigen-specific antibody include immunological assays (e.g. radioimmunoassay (RIA)), immunoprecipitation assays, and protein blot (e.g. Western blot) assays; and neutralization assays (e.g., neutralization of viral infectivity in an in vitro or in vivo assay).</p><p id="p-0342" num="0339">The compositions disclosed herein may be used in methods for treating or preventing diseases and/or disorders ameliorated by a cell-mediated immune response or a humoral immune response.

The two syringes were connected using a Vygon&#x2122; connector three-way stopcock, and the phases were mixed by passing them 120 times between the syringes through the stopcock to form an emulsion using a 70:30 hydrophobic:aqueous ratio, beginning by passing the hydrophobic phase into the aqueous phase. Four emulsions were prepared using water containing either 0.5% Tween&#x2122; 20, 0.25% Tween&#x2122; 80, 0.5% Tween&#x2122; 80, or 0.5% PEG 400 by weight as the aqueous phase.</p><p id="p-0405" num="0389">To evaluate emulsion stability, the emulsion was observed for phase separation or cracking for 4 hours. The emulsions were also subjected to drop tests and cobalt chloride paper test to identify whether the mixtures formed oil-in-water (O/W) or water-in-oil (W/O) emulsions. A water drop test consists of filling a 250 mL beaker with &#x2212;200 mL of distilled water and placing a drop (&#x2dc;3 mg) of the prepared emulsion on top of the water without stirring. Dispersion of the drop into the water indicates that the emulsion is O/W. If the drop floats on the water and the water remains clear after gentle hand stirring then the emulsion is W/O. An oil drop test consists of filling a 5 mL glass vial with &#x2dc;4 mL of mineral oil and placing a drop (&#x2dc;3 mg) of the prepared emulsion on top of the oil without stirring. If the drop does not disperse in the oil then the emulsion is O/W. Dispersion of the drop into the oil indicates that the emulsion is W/O. Cobalt chloride paper test: When a drop of emulsion is placed on cobalt chloride filter paper strip, it turns the paper strip from blue to pink, indicating that the formed emulsion is O/W.</p><p id="p-0406" num="0390">The results are shown below in Table 1.

An aqueous phase was prepared by first adding 409.23 mg of Tween&#x2122; 20 (Sigma Aldrich, SLBZ5913) to a 15-mL falcon tube, then adding 9.815 g of sterile water (Baxter, W7F0520) to the tube and mixing by vortex to form a 4% Tween&#x2122; 20 stock solution. Then, 0.265 mL of anti-CTLA-4 (Biocell, 702418A2B, 7.54 mg/mL in PBS, pH 7.0) was added to a 1.5-mL Eppendorf tube along with 35 &#x3bc;L of 4% Tween&#x2122; 20 stock solution (IMV, 2jan.2019BM-1) and mixed by vortex to form an aqueous phase containing 0.5% Tween&#x2122; 20 by weight and 6.7 mg/mL anti-CTLA-4. The O/W emulsion was formed by filling a Normject syringe (Henke Sass Wolf, 18D30C8) with 0.7 mL of hydrophobic phase, filling another Normject syringe with 0.3 mL of the prepared aqueous phase, connecting each syringe using a Vyclic adapter (Vygon&#x2122;, 210317FC), and passing the phase 120 times back and forth through the connector (passing the hydrophobic phase into the aqueous phase first). The final concentration of anti-CTLA-4 antibody in the emulsion was 2.0 mg/mL. The emulsion was confirmed to be O/W by water drop test, oil drop test, and cobalt strip test as shown below in Table 11. The final O/W emulsion formulation contained 2 mg/mL anti-CTLA-4, 66 mg/mL DOPC/Cholesterol, 0.1 mg/mL FP and 0.2 mg/mL dIdC.</p><p id="p-0442" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00013" num="00013"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="70pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="56pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="63pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="28pt" align="left"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" rowsep="1">TABLE 11</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Emulsion</entry><entry/><entry/><entry>Cobalt</entry></row><row><entry>Formulation</entry><entry>Drop Test (water)</entry><entry>Drop Test (oil)</entry><entry>Paper test</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>6.7 mg/mL Anti-</entry><entry>Disperses (oil-in-</entry><entry>Sinks (oil-in-water)</entry><entry>Pink</entry></row><row><entry>CTLA4 and 0.5%</entry><entry>water)</entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>Tween 20 in PBS and</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>S&#x2022;H<sub>2</sub>O +</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>DPX-FP in ISA51</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>Ratio: 0.3 mL: 0.7 mL</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0443" num="0416">Formulations were prepared for treatment of the control groups.

Mice in control group 6 were treated with DPX-FP in ISA51 oil along with DPX-anti-CTLA-4 in ISA51 oil (containing anti-CTLA-4 antibody in a hydrophobic phase instead of peptide and adjuvant). Mice in group 7 were treated with DPX-FP/anti-CTLA-4 comprising anti-CTLA-4 antibody in addition to the peptides and adjuvant of DPX-FP. Mice in control groups 3, 4, and 5 received anti-CTLA-4 via i.p. injection. Mice in control group 9 received no treatment after tumor implantation. Mice in group 8 were treated with sub-cutaneous (s.c.) injections of the O/W emulsion according to the invention, with DPX-FP in the hydrophobic phase and the anti-CTLA-4 antibody in the aqueous phase. All treatments with DPX were by s.c. injection.

Unless defined otherwise all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood to one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs.</p><p id="p-0471" num="0437">The phrase &#x201c;and/or,&#x201d; as used herein in the specification and in the claims, should be understood to mean &#x201c;either or both&#x201d; of the elements so conjoined, i.e., elements that are conjunctively present in some cases and disjunctively present in other cases. Multiple elements listed with &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; should be construed in the same fashion, i.e., &#x201c;one or more&#x201d; of the elements so conjoined. Other elements may optionally be present other than the elements specifically identified by the &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; clause, whether related or unrelated to those elements specifically identified. Thus, as a non-limiting example, a reference to &#x201c;A and/or B&#x201d;, when used in conjunction with open-ended language such as &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; can refer, in one embodiment, to A only (optionally including elements other than B); in another embodiment, to B only (optionally including elements other than A); in yet another embodiment, to both A and B (optionally including other elements); etc.</p><p id="p-0472" num="0438">As used herein in the specification and in the claims, &#x201c;or&#x201d; should be understood to encompass the same meaning as &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; as defined above.

Further, when whole numbers are represented, about can refer to decimal values on either side of the whole number. When used in the context of a range, the term &#x201c;about&#x201d; encompasses all of the exemplary values between the one particular value at one end of the range and the other particular value at the other end of the range, as well as reasonably close values beyond each end.</p><p id="p-0474" num="0440">As used herein, whether in the specification or the appended claims, the transitional terms &#x201c;comprising&#x201d;, &#x201c;including&#x201d;, &#x201c;carrying&#x201d;, &#x201c;having&#x201d;, &#x201c;containing&#x201d;, &#x201c;involving&#x201d;, and the like are to be understood as being inclusive or open-ended (i.e., to mean including but not limited to), and they do not exclude unrecited elements, materials or method steps. Only the transitional phrases &#x201c;consisting of&#x201d; and &#x201c;consisting essentially of&#x201d;, respectively, are closed or semi-closed transitional phrases with respect to claims and exemplary embodiment paragraphs herein.
