The natural gas liquefaction method pre-cools treated natural gas by ethane evaporation, sub-cools liquefied gas using cooled nitrogen as a refrigerant, reduces liquefied gas pressure, separates non-liquefied gas and diverts liquefied natural gas. Before pre-cooling the natural gas is compressed, ethane is evaporated during the multi-stage pre-cooling of liquefied gas with simultaneous evaporation of ethane using cooled ethane as a refrigerant. Ethane generated by evaporation is compressed, condensed and used as a refrigerant during the cooling of liquefied gas and nitrogen, with nitrogen being compressed, cooled, expanded and fed to the natural gas sub-cooling stage. The natural gas liquefaction unit contains a natural gas liquefaction circuit, an ethane circuit and a nitrogen circuit. The natural gas liquefaction circuit includes a natural gas compressor, a cooler unit, ethane vaporizers, a closed-end subcooling heat exchanger, and a separator, connected in series.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="67.23mm" wi="158.75mm" file="US20230003443A1-20230105-D00000.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-D00001" he="258.06mm" wi="138.18mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230003443A1-20230105-D00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure></drawings><description id="description"><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a divisional of and Applicant claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;&#xa7; 120 and 121 of U.S. patent application Ser.

Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to natural gas liquefaction technology for its further transportation by river or sea with subsequent regasification.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">There are many ways to liquefy natural gas, mainly based on the removal of heat by an external refrigerant, of which C3MR, Philips Cascade, Shell DMR and Linde MFCP liquefaction technologies are used in the Arctic climate.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The C3MR technology is adopted at the NOVATEK, JSC plant in the Yamal Peninsula, Sabetta, at the Yamal LNG project.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Initially, the C3MR process (GB 1291467 A, 04.10.1972) was developed by Air Products for the LNG plant in Brunei. The technology is based on natural gas cooling sequence: first, in three heat exchangers using an independent propane-based vapor compression cycle, and then in a two-zone multi-section heat exchanger using a cycle based on a mixture of refrigerants, which is also pre-cooled using the propane cycle in two heat exchangers.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The C3MR process is used at over 80% of the total number of process trains.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A disadvantage of the process in the Arctic climate is incomplete use of the environment cold. If under the equatorial climate heat removal from gas and mixed refrigerant (MR) in the propane circuit is made within temperature range from +45&#xb0; C. to &#x2212;34&#xb0; C., in the Arctic climate this range may start from +10&#xb0; C. As a result, main compressor power is spent on compressing the mixed refrigerant of the second circuit. Compressor capacity is linked to the size of gas drives. For a process train with a capacity of 5 million tons per year of liquefied natural gas (LNG), 86 MW drives are used. The maximum use of this power, with a shift of its consumption balance towards the MR, is only possible by increasing weight and size of a main cryogenic heat exchanger.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The Philips Cascade technology is used by Conoco Phillips at several LNG plants (Alaska, Trinidad and Tobago, etc.)</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The technology is based on the sequential cooling of gas in three circuits by propane, ethylene and methane. Propane condensation is carried out in air coolers, while ethylene is condensed by propane vapors, and methane is condensed by ethylene vapors.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Natural gas, subject to moisture and carbon dioxide pre-purification, is fed into heat exchangers at a pressure of 41 bar and is supplied to tanks after cooling and throttling. Each circuit provides for a three-fold expansion of refrigerants with return streams being fed to the corresponding stages of multi-stage centrifugal compressors downstream of the heat exchangers. Injection pressure of the compressor propane stage is 15.2 bar, throttling is carried out to pressures of 5.5; 3.15 and 1.37 bar. At the ethylene stage, pressure decreases from 20.5 to 5.5; 2.05 and 1.72 bar, in the last circuit pressure decreases from the pressure of 37.2 bar to pressures of 14.8; 5.8 and 2.05 bar.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">A disadvantage of said technology is low pressure of liquefied gas (41 bar), which increases specific energy consumption of the liquefaction process, a large number of equipment, need for third-party ethylene refrigerant supply, a complex scheme for refrigerant stream control comprising 3 three-stage compressors, 9 anti-surge circuits.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Shell implemented the Shell DMR technology (U.S. Pat. No. 6,389,844 A, 21 May 2002) at the Sakhalin LNG plant.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The DMR process uses 2 mixed refrigerants. Gas is liquefied in two circuits, in each of which gas is cooled by mixed refrigerants of different composition. Each circuit uses a multithread coil heat exchanger. In the first circuit, the gas is cooled by refrigerant vapors, previously condensed on the heat exchanger tube side, and a coolant of the second circuit is also cooled. In the second heat exchanger, the gas is sub-cooled at 2 levels of piping with vapors of the second circuit refrigerant condensed in the tube bundle.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The process most closely matches the cold climate. Disadvantage of the process is a complex control scheme of 2 circuits of MR. In practice, transition from one MR composition to another, depending on the time of year, turned out to be hard to predict and is applied at the Sakhalin LNG plant no more than 2-3 times a year.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The Linde MFCP technology (U.S. Pat. No. 6,253,574 A, Jul. 3, 2001) is used by Statoil for natural gas liquefaction at a plant in Hammerfest, Norway.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The MFCP liquefaction process is based on the sequential gas cooling in three circuits with three mixed refrigerants of different composition. The first circuit uses two consecutive plate heat exchangers operating at two pressure levels. The first circuit refrigerant is propane-ethane. Propane-ethane mixture vapors are condensed by seawater, cooled in plate heat exchangers of the first circuit and dissipate cold to the liquefied gas and refrigerant of the second circuit.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The second circuit is designed to liquefy natural gas in a coil heat exchanger using propane-ethane-methane mixture as a refrigerant. In the third circuit, the liquefied gas is sub-cooled with nitrogen-methane-ethane vapors. A coil-wound heat exchanger is used for sub-cooling, as in the second circuit. All three circuits use seawater for preliminary gas cooling.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">A disadvantage of the process is a complex control scheme due to the use of three types of mixed refrigerant, as well as large number of types of heat exchange and compressor equipment.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">GAO Gazprom patented a natural gas liquefaction method, which consists in cooling and condensing in a pre-cooler of pre-treated and dried natural gas, which is further separated from the liquid ethane fraction sent to fractionation, while a gas stream from the first separator is sequentially cooled in a liquefier heat exchanger using a mixed refrigerant, sub-cooled by gaseous nitrogen in a sub-cooling heat exchanger, while pressure of the sub-cooled LNG is reduced in a liquid expander, and the sub-cooled LNG is sent for separation, after which liquefied gas is delivered to a LNG storage tank, while separated gas is discharged to a fuel gas system. A natural gas liquefaction plant comprises a pre-cooler, five separators, two chokes, a liquefier-exchanger, three compressors designed to compress the mixed refrigerant, five air coolers, two pumps, a liquid expander, a sub-cooling heat exchanger, a turbo expander unit including an expander and a compressor, two nitrogen cycle compressors (RU 2538192 C1, published on 10 Jan. 2017).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">A disadvantage of the method and the plant under RU 2538192 C1 is a complex control of pre-cooling circuit.
