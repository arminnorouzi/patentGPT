APPLICATIONS</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 63/217,160, filed Jun. 30, 2021, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates generally to devices for accessing an internal portion of a patient through tubing, and, more particularly, to tubing anchors that can be coupled with tubing and affixed to a patient to resist unintended separation of the tubing or the device for accessing the patient.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Tubing can be used for a variety of therapies that may require accessing an internal portion of a patient, including, for example intravenous therapy and enteral feeding. An internal portion of a patient can be accessed by creating a pathway that penetrates or enters into the patient through a natural or artificial opening of the patient. The pathway can be created or maintained using a device, such as a catheter coupled to tubing, or tubing itself. Often, an extension set is coupled to a catheter to provide one or more access point into the pathway coupled to the patient.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In some instances, the device, tubing, or extension set can be unintentionally separated when an unintended or unexpected force is exerted on the device. An unintended or unexpected force can be applied to the tubing and/or catheter when the patient moves or rolls over within a bed, or when the tubing or another portion of an intravenous set become caught on a portion of the bed, such as the railing, or when a patient is panicking, disoriented, or fidgeting to such an extent that the medical tubing is unintentionally or intentionally pulled away from the patient or away from the medical equipment coupled to the tubing.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">To resist or prevent unintended separation of the device, tubing, or extension set from the patient, any of the medical device and the tubing can be affixed to the patient's skin. Tape or an adhesive can be implemented to affix the device or tubing to the patient's skin; however, such methods have limited effectiveness. The tape utilized for affixing the device or tubing to the patient is often intended to be cut or torn by hand instead of requiring scissors; however, such characteristics provide a tape with a low shear strength. As such, when the tubing is pulled, relative away from the patient, the tape can tear and thereby reduce the resistance to separation of the tubing from the patient.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Further, the tubing used for access into a patient, including the tubing used for extension sets, can have a narrow diameter or width. As such, the surface area engaged by the tape against the tubing is small, relative to the surface area necessary to resist separation from the patient. As a result, the tubing can tear or shear through the tape, or the tubing can move or be pulled from under the tape.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with at least some embodiments disclosed herein is the realization that unintended dislodgement or disconnection of a medical connection, such as a medical tubing, can result in injury to a patient or a caregiver, such as by depriving the patient of a medicament, increasing the potential for infection to the patient, and exposing the caregiver to harmful medicaments.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, an aspect of the present disclosure provides a tubing anchor comprising an anchor body having a first end, a second end, a first sidewall, a second sidewall, a top end, a bottom end, and a tubing passage extending through the first and second ends and defining a longitudinal axis of the anchor body, the first sidewall having front and rear portions that extend away from the longitudinal axis and intersect at an apex of the first sidewall, the second sidewall having front and rear portions that extend away from the longitudinal axis and intersect at an apex of the second sidewall, wherein a width of the anchor body between the apex of the first and second sidewalls, is greater than a height of the anchor body between the top and bottom ends.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Some instances of the present disclosure provide a tubing anchor comprising an anchor body having a first end, a second end, a top end, a bottom end, a first wing, a second wing, and a tubing passage extending through the first and second ends and defining a longitudinal axis of the anchor body, each of the first and second wings comprising a proximal portion adjacent to the longitudinal axis and an apex that is distal to the longitudinal axis, wherein a width of the anchor body defined between the distal end portions of the first and second wings is greater than a height of the anchor body between the top and bottom ends.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some aspects, the present disclosure provide intravenous tubing anchor system comprising: a tubing having a longitudinal length; and an anchor body having a first end, a second end, a first sidewall, a second sidewall, a top end, a bottom end, and a tubing passage extending through the first and second ends and defining a longitudinal axis of the anchor body, the first sidewall having a front and rear portions that extend away from the longitudinal axis and intersect at an apex of the first sidewall, the second sidewall having a front and rear portions that extend away from the longitudinal axis and intersect at an apex of the second sidewall, wherein a width of the anchor body between the apex of the first and second sidewalls, is greater than a height of the anchor body between the top and bottom ends; wherein the tubing is positioned within the tubing passage such that a portion of the longitudinal length of the tubing is coextensive with the longitudinal axis of the anchor body</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Accordingly, the present application addresses several operational challenges encountered in prior systems and methods for coupling medical tubing to a patient and provides numerous improvements that enable a user to more securely and easily couple a tubing to patient while increasing resisting to unintended dislodgement or disconnection of the tubing.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Additional features and advantages of the subject technology will be set forth in the description below, and in part will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the subject technology.

In other instances, well-known structures and techniques have not been shown in detail so as not to obscure the subject technology.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Further, while the present description sets forth specific details of various embodiments, it will be appreciated that the description is illustrative only and should not be construed in any way as limiting. Additionally, it is contemplated that although particular embodiments of the present disclosure may be disclosed or shown in the context of an IV set, such embodiments can be used in other fluid conveyance systems. Furthermore, various applications of such embodiments and modifications thereto, which may occur to those who are skilled in the art, are also encompassed by the general concepts described herein.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In accordance with some embodiments, the present application discloses various features and advantages of a needleless fluid connector system. The needleless fluid connector system can provide for efficient and safe maintenance of fluid connections, such as the connections used for transferring medical fluids toward or away from a patient. The needleless fluid connector system can maintain a fluid pathway by resisting unintended disconnection when a pulling or tension force is applied to the needleless fluid connector system, such as when a patient moves or when the medical tubing is pulled away from the patient.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The needleless fluid connector system can also prevent injury to a patient or a caregiver by permitting disconnection or separation between portions of the connector system when a pulling or tension force exceeds a threshold. The needleless fluid connector system can also prevent injury to a patient or a caregiver by obstructing the fluid pathway when disconnection or separation between portions of the connector system occurs. Further, the needleless fluid connector system can provide for efficient and safe reestablishment of the fluid pathway, by permitting reassembly of portions of the system after a disconnection or separation occurs.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring now to the figures, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> illustrate an example of a tubing anchor <b>100</b> in use in accordance with aspects of the present disclosure. The tubing anchor <b>100</b> is coupled with an IV extension set which includes tubing <b>16</b> and a catheter <b>18</b>. A portion of the catheter <b>18</b> is inserted into the patient and a connector <b>20</b> of the IV extension set is coupled to tubing <b>22</b> of an IV set.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The IV extension set is fluidly coupled with an IV set that includes a medicament bag <b>12</b>, a drip chamber <b>14</b>, tubing <b>22</b>, and a connector <b>24</b>. The connector <b>24</b> of the IV set is fluidly coupled to the connector <b>20</b> of the IV extension set. The IV set and IV extension set are configured to direct a fluid toward or away from the patient <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">To resist unintended dislodgement or disconnection of the tubing <b>16</b> or the catheter <b>18</b> from the patient, tape <b>26</b> is placed over the tubing <b>16</b> and the catheter <b>18</b>, so that the tape engages the tubing <b>16</b>, the catheter <b>18</b>, and the patient. To increase the resistance to unintended dislodgement or disconnection of the tubing <b>16</b> or catheter <b>18</b>, a tubing anchor <b>100</b> is positioned along the tubing <b>16</b>, and tape <b>28</b> is placed over the tubing anchor <b>100</b> and the tubing <b>16</b>, so that the tape engages the tubing <b>16</b>, the tubing anchor <b>100</b>, and the patient.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In use, if the tubing <b>16</b>, <b>22</b>, or another portion IV extension and IV set between the tubing anchor <b>100</b> and the medicament bag <b>12</b>, is pulled in a direction away from the tubing anchor, the tape <b>28</b>, which is engaged against the tubing anchor <b>100</b> and the patient <b>10</b>, can resist the force and prevent unintended dislodgement or disconnection of tubing anchor <b>100</b> and the catheter <b>18</b> from the patient.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">To resist unintended dislodgement or disconnection, the tubing anchor <b>100</b> includes an anchor body with an inner surface forming a tubing passage and an outer surface forming a sidewall, where the sidewall extends in a direction away from the tubing passage. The outer surface of the anchor body can provide a larger surface area, relative to the surface area of the tubing along a coextensive length of the tubing anchor, for engagement by the tape. In some embodiments of the present disclosure, the tubing anchor <b>100</b> can include first and second sidewalls that extend in a direction away from the tubing passage.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Although the tubing anchor <b>100</b> is illustrated as being coupled along a fluid pathway of an IV extension set, it should be understood that the tubing anchor <b>100</b> can be connected to other fluid pathways, such as IV tubing, an IV set, or an enteral feeding tube.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">An embodiment of the tubing anchor <b>100</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.

The top surface can form a convex shape <b>144</b> that extends along the tubing passage, between the first and second ends <b>120</b>, <b>122</b> of the anchor body. A portion of the top surface can also form a concave shape <b>146</b> that is adjacent to the tubing passage. The convex shape <b>144</b> can extend between the first and second ends <b>120</b>, <b>122</b> of the anchor body, and be positioned between portions of the outer surface that have a concave shape <b>146</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The bottom surface can form a profile shape with convex and concave shapes that mirror the top surface. In some embodiments of the present disclosure, the top and bottom surfaces can have the same or different profile shapes. For example, the top surface can include a convex shape and the bottom surface can form a concave shape, where the convex shape of the top surface can provide for an anchor body with a low profile to avoid being bumped or pulled unintentionally while providing a large surface area relative to the height of the anchor body. The concave shape of the bottom surface that corresponds with curved surface defined by a patient's body thereby increasing patient comfort.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The top and bottom ends <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> of the anchor body <b>102</b> define a height H<b>1</b> of the anchor body therebetween, and the apex <b>128</b>, <b>138</b> of the first and second sidewalls define a width W<b>1</b> of the anchor body therebetween.
