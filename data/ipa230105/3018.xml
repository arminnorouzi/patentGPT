Therefore, on the outside one only sees a glass surface or other infill elements and nothing of the structure in any material.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Such wall elements are suspended in their entirety to the basic structure of the building and connect to each other to form one continuous outer wall, whereby a wall element spans at least the height of one storey and typically contains two infill elements glued one on top of the other on the frame, namely one single infill element that is non-translucent or opaque and that covers the rough floor structure between the floors and a see-through infill element forming a window on the relevant floor.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">From U.S. Pat. No. 8,991,121, non-thermally broken fa&#xe7;ade elements are known, which consist of a frame of assembled aluminium profiles on the inside of the curtain wall and infill elements, e.g. glass or other infill elements on the outside of the curtain wall.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">This curtain wall is made watertight using silicones, which is at odds with the aim of the current invention where no silicones have to be used.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In this U.S. Pat. No. 8,991,121, silicones are indeed applied on different levels.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">For example, the wall elements of U.S. Pat. No. 8,991,121 at the top and bottom are provided with complementary male and female coupling parts thanks to which the wall elements slide into each other in a vertical and lateral direction, whereby e.g. the horizontal coupling parts are sealed using horizontal seals which are interrupted between two sideways adjacent wall elements.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The openings between the seals which extend horizontally in each other's extension are filled with silicones when the curtain wall is assembled on site.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The vertical gap between two sideways adjacent wall elements is also sealed at the top by a horizontal layer of silicones which is smeared out at the adjacent top corners of the wall elements to bridge the vertical gap.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">These silicone sealants should not be used in wall building in view of the fact they are not durable and as a result can tear off when the wall elements move, e.g. following expansion and contraction due to changes in temperature. If that happens it is no longer possible to repair or replace the silicone sealant.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Moreover, applying silicones in at times unfavourable working conditions on site increases the risk of a bad installation because the adhesion of the silicones on the 30 profiles is more likely to be bad quality and therefore can be a possible cause of later leaks and moisture infiltrations.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Moreover, in this curtain wall described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,991,121, screws are used in a certain embodiment for the attachment relative to each other of horizontal profiles, and these screws go straight through the layer of silicones and thus can also cause the necessary leakages. The fact that in this application a joint gutter with weep holes is provided shows that leakages are to be expected in this curtain wall.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Moreover, the aforementioned screws go through the insulation profiles between the frame profiles to be connected and thus form unwanted thermal bridges.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The profiles used in U.S. Pat. No. 8,991,121 for the transoms comprise several profiles which in the corners of the wall elements connect differently on each other and the mullions resulting in a complex assembly which is impossible or difficult to automate.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In other known walls, traditionally the profiles of the frames are, at the level of the corners of the wall elements, mitred with each other using corner pieces the legs of which are stuck in the aluminium profiles and the frames are connected to each other and made watertight using seal rubbers that sit in the recesses of two adjoining wall elements. Such wall elements are known from EP 0.569.876 for instance. In these traditional systems seal rubbers are cut to size on site to the height and the width of a wall element and subsequently pushed into the aforementioned recesses.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In these known traditional systems seal rubbers are cut at the level of the ends to a half thickness, so that at the level of the corners these ends overlap each other and connect. This is a very delicate operation requiring great professionalism and is often done badly, which can have dire consequences in terms of leak, particularly in case of high wind pressure as is often the case for floors at great height. In addition, special tools need to be used to couple the wall elements.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Consequently, all this requires considerable working hours and professionalism to build a curtain wall and the chances of an incorrect assembly are also greater.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Moreover, traditional wall systems have a large number of different parts.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In addition, the tightness of the curtain wall against water infiltration is realised by a multiple cascade system whereby the rainwater is drained down vertically, which means you have no control over the drainage. Also, such cascade system requires cuts or recesses to be made in certain places in the seal rubbers</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the case of EP 0.569.876, the glass infill elements are clamped in the frame between support profiles on the inside of the wall and cover profiles on the outside of the wall. The cover profiles are visible on the outside of the wall.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Moreover, in the case of this EP 0.569.876 the assembly by sliding two adjacent wall elements sideways into each other with intermediate seals, more specifically three seals in every direction, is extremely difficult and delicate to impossible.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The present invention aims to provide a solution for at least one of the aforementioned and other disadvantages.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0030" num="0029">To this end, the invention relates to a curtain wall of the modular type, constructed from prefabricated connecting wall elements mounted in rows next to and above each other, characterised in that the wall elements consist of a frame of assembled profiles on the inside of the curtain wall and of one or more infill elements on the outside of the curtain wall whereby the frame contains mullions and transoms along the perimeter which are provided with female coupling parts and male coupling parts which allow the adjacent mullions and adjacent transoms in an assembled condition in the curtain wall to engage telescopically with each other with their coupling parts to form composite basic profiles whereby between two rows of connecting wall elements a horizontal seal is applied, which extends continuously in a horizontal direction over several wall elements along the length of an underlying row, whereby the horizontal seal is a continuous flexible sealing profile, from EPDM or similar material, with a part with which the horizontal seal rests on an underlying wall element and an upstanding edge which in an assembled condition extends into the female coupling part of the lowest transom of the wall elements above and which with this upstanding edge clamps and seals between this male coupling part of an underlying row of wall elements on which the horizontal seal rests and the female coupling parts of the row of wall elements above.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In this way, the frames of the wall elements can be simply slid into each other telescopically with their coupling parts, without the time-consuming application of seal rubbers and they can be made airtight and waterproof in one go.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">By the uninterrupted horizontal seal between two rows of wall elements, the wall elements are segmented and insulated from each other row per row in terms of water drainage, whereby the disadvantages of the traditional cascade system can be avoided.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Furthermore, the construction of such a curtain wall is very simple, whereby first a full row of wall elements is mounted, after which the uninterrupted horizontal seal above this row is applied to then be able to install the next row of wall elements. In so doing, the curtain wall is built up row per row and the construction of a high curtain wall is thus reduced to stacking on top of one another horizontal rows of modules guaranteeing complete wind and water tightness relative to one another.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Preferably, the horizontal seal is executed as a profile made from rubber or the like with a substantially flat part with which the horizontal seal rests on an underlying wall element and an upstanding edge which in an assembled condition of the curtain wall extends into the female coupling part of the bottom transom of the wall elements above.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The upstanding edge thus forms a barrier for the possible infiltration of water from the outside to the inside.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">According to a preferred embodiment, the upstanding edge is sealed and clamped between the male coupling parts of an underlying row of wall elements and the female coupling parts of the row wall of elements above. The upstanding edge thus forms a seal between the profiles.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Preferably, the upper transom of the wall elements is fitted with a U-shaped male coupling part with upstanding legs that extend into the female coupling part of a higher wall element and the upstanding edge of the horizontal seal is fitted with a hook-shaped bent end that grips over one of the upstanding legs and that prevents the upstanding edge from being pushed down when a wall element, when assembling the curtain wall, is placed on an underlying wall element.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The flat part of the horizontal seal preferably slopes down to the outside to allow a good transit of water in case of rain or the like.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The wall elements are fitted along their perimeter with thermal insulation profiles which are attached to the frame and overlap towards the outside reaching over the edges of the infill elements, with the insulation profiles being sealed against the infill elements using silicones or another sealing kit.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Preferably, the wall elements are sealed relative to each other on four different levels, whereby each level is realised at a different distance from the outside of the curtain wall.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Preferably, the wall elements consist of mullions and transoms with perpendicular ends, whereby the transoms extend between the mullions and are connected to them using screws.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The sealing on four levels in combination with the technique of thermal break means infiltration moisture from outside can never come into contact with the screwed corner connections of the wall elements.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">This simplifies the assembly of the frames of the wall elements compared to the frames with mitre connections and also allows the assembly to be automated.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">According to another special aspect of the invention, the infill elements are attached on the frame using aluminium slats which on assembly of the wall elements can be slid with a foot lengthways in a complementary groove of the profiles and against which the infill elements can be attached using structural glue.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">This aspect also allows the production of the wall elements to be automated.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The slats against which the infill elements are glued structurally are anodised and technically certified for application of structural silicone in accordance with the applicable laws and standards.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The invention also relates to a wall element to construct a curtain wall according to the invention and which allows application of the aforementioned advantages of a curtain wall according to the invention.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Essential elements of the invention can thus be summarised as follows:</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">1/A continuous horizontal seal, across several modules and applied AFTER installation of such a row of modules and this on the top thereof, whereby this seal extends from a surface behind the coupling of the modules or wall elements to the front of these modules, due to which the following characteristics are simultaneously achieved:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0049">The corner connections of the modules are completely shielded by means of the central seal rubber, resulting in an additional proofing guarantee;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0050">At the top of the modules there is no free &#x201c;seam&#x201d; or joining of profiles in contact with the outside. The continuous seal rubber acts like a continuous sill at the top of the modules due to which perfect waterproofing is guaranteed;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0051">Any infiltration water that might possibly infiltrate via the vertical joints can SOLELY be carried away per row of modules and MUST therefore leave per module. Infiltration water CANNOT cascade down via gravitation or so-called cascade;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0052">On the &#x201c;back&#x201d;, this seal is fitted with a high vertical ridge, which de facto also continues uninterruptedly over a row of several modules, which as a result of the telescopic technique of the module connection, connects seamlessly with and perfectly sits between the hanging down leg of the female coupling part of the row of modules above, on the one hand, and the upstanding leg of the male coupling part of the underlying row, thus achieving perfect waterproofing;</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0050" num="0053">The seal is clamped in several places in an underlying wall element such that a good connection and fixation is ensured, preferably on three different levels.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0054">2/ the seal is placed as a continuous sealing profile from EPDM or the like whereby the fitters do NOT have to make cut-outs or local recesses, which is the case in all classic existing systems with the major risk of a faulty execution. The supplied profile can be rolled out and clamped WITHOUT any modification into the provided grooves. This means no special tools need to be used or any special installation instructions need to be followed either. The fitter does not need any expertise to apply the seal and mistakes are impossible.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0055">The invention also relates to a method to produce such wall elements in an automated production line.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0056">The method comprises the following steps:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0057">a/ sawing all the profiles of the mullions and transoms and the insulation profiles to the right length;</li>    <li id="ul0003-0002" num="0058">b/ machining, and if necessary grinding, the profiles using an automated machining device</li>    <li id="ul0003-0003" num="0059">c/ positioning the profiles on the production line with the inside of the mullions and transoms facing downwards in a position relative to a frame under fabrication of the wall element</li>    <li id="ul0003-0004" num="0060">d/ sliding in the aluminium slats to allow structural gluing of the infill elements;</li>    <li id="ul0003-0005" num="0061">e/ assembling the frames by placing the screws to connect the mullions with the transoms and installing all seals;</li>    <li id="ul0003-0006" num="0062">f/ installing the infill elements on the aluminium slats</li>    <li id="ul0003-0007" num="0063">g/ applying the structural silicone to attach the infill elements to the aluminium slats;</li>    <li id="ul0003-0008" num="0064">h/ placing and securing the insulation profiles for the thermal break;</li>    <li id="ul0003-0009" num="0065">i/ sealing the insulation profiles along the edges of the infill elements with the help of a silicone or other sealing kit.</li></ul></p><p id="p-0054" num="0066">The advantage of this method is that wall elements can be produced in an automated way in a much shorter time compared to the known systems and that the wall elements have already been fitted with all the seals beforehand in a controlled way, with the exception of the horizontal seal between two consecutive rows wall elements.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0067">In this way, the use of any form of silicones can be avoided, which for decades was a problem in the technology of curtain walls, and the wall elements can be simply slid into each other with their complementary male and female coupling parts without requiring screws or other mechanical connections.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention"

is a curtain wall of the modular type constructed from individual prefabricated rectangular wall elements <b>2</b> in the form of separate modules placed in rows next to and above one another to create a level wall, forming the supporting structure of the curtain wall <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0086">As is apparent in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> the wall elements <b>2</b> or modules are composed of a basic frame <b>3</b> of assembled one-piece profiles <b>4</b> on the inside <b>5</b> of the curtain wall <b>1</b> and of rectangular infill elements <b>6</b> on the outside <b>7</b> of the curtain wall <b>1</b> which almost entirely cover the basic frame <b>3</b>, whereby the basic frame <b>3</b> is therefore hidden behind the infill elements <b>6</b> so that it appears as if the outside <b>7</b> of the curtain wall <b>1</b> consists entirely of infill elements in glass or the like.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0087">The wall elements <b>2</b> are suspended on a basic structure at floor height <b>8</b>, whereby a wall element <b>2</b> spans the height of a storey.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0088">Preferably, the wall elements <b>2</b> are fitted with two infill elements, being a see-through infill element <b>6</b><i>a </i>at floor level and preferably a non-translucent or opaque infill element <b>6</b><i>b </i>to conceal the thickness of the floors <b>8</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0089">In the example in the figures the infill elements <b>6</b> are formed by triple glazing although this is not essential.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0090">Frame <b>3</b> is constructed from one-piece mullions <b>9</b> and one-piece transoms <b>10</b>, whereby the transoms <b>10</b> have perpendicular ends and are connected with the mullions <b>9</b> using screws <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0091">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> the basic frame <b>3</b> contains two types of mullions <b>9</b> that fit inside each another telescopically, respectively a mullion <b>9</b><i>a </i>with an open U-shaped female coupling part <b>12</b> and a mullion <b>9</b><i>b </i>with a complementary open U-shaped male coupling part <b>13</b>, whereby the two types of mullions <b>9</b><i>a </i>and <b>9</b><i>b </i>slide with their coupling parts telescopically inside each other and whereby these mullions <b>9</b><i>a </i>and <b>9</b><i>b, </i>with the exception of the coupling parts, are as good as symmetrical relative to a median plane <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0092">The mullions <b>9</b><i>a </i>and <b>9</b><i>b </i>of adjacent wall elements <b>2</b> are coupled to each other as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> and thus form in their coupled state a composite rectangular beam-shaped basic profile <b>4</b>, as it were, consisting of two predominantly symmetrical semi-profiles <b>9</b><i>a </i>and <b>9</b><i>b </i>for the mullions and <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i>for the transoms <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0093">In the example the male coupling part <b>13</b> is formed by two parallel legs <b>15</b> which grasp between parallel walls of the female part <b>12</b> and are sealed off using seals <b>16</b> and <b>17</b> on the free end of the legs <b>15</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0094">These seals are preferably formed by co-extrusion of one or two materials, respectively a rubber or the like and a stiff material to form a stiff foot <b>16</b>&#x2032; and <b>17</b>&#x2032; which allows the seal to be slid in the lengthways direction into the appropriate detailing during assembly of the frame <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0095">In the example of the figures, the basic frame <b>3</b> contains three transoms <b>10</b>, featuring a lower transom <b>10</b><i>a, </i>an upper transom <b>10</b><i>b </i>and one or more intermediate transoms <b>10</b><i>c, </i>in this case just one intermediate transom <b>10</b><i>c, </i>whereby the lower transom <b>10</b><i>a </i>and the one or more intermediate transoms <b>10</b><i>c </i>are mounted between the mullions, while the upper transom <b>10</b><i>b </i>is mounted on the mullions <b>9</b>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0096">In terms of profiling the upper transom <b>10</b><i>a </i>and the lower transom <b>10</b><i>b </i>are identical to the profiles of the mullions <b>9</b><i>a </i>and <b>9</b><i>b </i>and fit together in the same telescopic manner as shown in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, whereby the lower transom <b>10</b><i>a </i>features a downward facing female coupling part <b>12</b> and the upper transom <b>10</b><i>b </i>features an upward facing male coupling part <b>13</b> that, when assembled, extends into the female coupling part <b>12</b> of a higher wall element <b>2</b>. Just as the mullions <b>9</b><i>a </i>and <b>9</b><i>b, </i>the transoms <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i>unite to form a composite profile <b>4</b> that, in terms of shape, is predominantly in line with the aforementioned basic profile <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0097">The intermediate transom <b>10</b><i>c </i>divides the frame <b>3</b> into two compartments <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b </i>and has a cross-section as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> which in profiling terms, with the exception of the female and male coupling parts, is predominantly aligned with the composite basic profile <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0098">The frame structure of the curtain wall <b>1</b> consequently appears to be composed exclusively of identical basic profiles <b>4</b>, regardless of whether it is composed for the composite mullions <b>9</b><i>a </i>and <b>9</b><i>b </i>and transoms <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i>or for the intermediate transoms <b>10</b><i>c. </i></p><p id="p-0087" num="0099">The basic profile <b>4</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> in line with an intermediate transom <b>10</b><i>c </i>is a rectangular tube profile with an inside wall <b>18</b> and an outside wall <b>19</b>, i.e. an inside wall <b>18</b> facing the inside <b>5</b> of the curtain wall <b>1</b> and an outside wall <b>19</b> facing the outside <b>7</b> of the curtain wall <b>1</b> against which the infill elements <b>6</b> are attached, whose walls <b>18</b> and <b>19</b> are connected to each other by two parallel side walls <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0100">The basic profile <b>4</b> is divided into two chambers using a partition <b>21</b> at a distance from the inside wall <b>18</b> and from the outside wall <b>19</b>, respectively an inside chamber <b>22</b> on the inside <b>5</b> of the curtain wall <b>1</b> and an outside chamber <b>23</b> on the outside <b>7</b> of the curtain wall <b>1</b>, whereby the outside chamber <b>23</b> is subdivided using two connecting walls <b>24</b> between the outside wall <b>19</b> and the partition <b>21</b> into three internal chambers, respectively into a middle chamber <b>23</b><i>a </i>and two internal side chambers <b>23</b><i>b </i>on each side of the middle chamber <b>23</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0089" num="0101">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref> the composite mullions <b>9</b> and transoms <b>10</b> substantially contain the same characteristics with the difference that the inside chamber <b>22</b> is now formed by the female and male coupling parts <b>12</b> and <b>13</b> which engage with each other and that the middle chamber <b>23</b><i>a </i>is now open and the partition <b>21</b> is realised with a double wall and divided into two parts.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0102">The internal side chambers <b>23</b><i>b </i>are thus contained by <b>4</b> walls, namely by an outside wall <b>19</b>, a side wall <b>20</b>, a partition <b>21</b> and a connecting wall <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0103">The connecting walls <b>24</b> of the internal side chambers <b>23</b><i>b </i>feature identical yet symmetrical detailing <b>25</b> on the sides facing each other for the attachment of seals or other components plus a protruding part <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0104">Also, the outside wall <b>19</b> is fitted with detailing <b>25</b> at the level of the middle chamber <b>23</b><i>a </i>and, at the level of each internal side chamber <b>23</b><i>b, </i>with detailing <b>25</b> in the form of T-shaped recesses provided for the attachment of the infill elements <b>6</b> using aluminium slats <b>27</b> which are glued all the way around the inside of the infill elements <b>6</b> with structural silicone <b>28</b>, for example structural silicone, whereby the slats <b>27</b> feature a T-shaped foot <b>29</b> which can be slid to fit into an aforementioned T-shaped recess.
