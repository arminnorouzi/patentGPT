of specific embodiments. However, the innovations described herein can be embodied in a multitude of different ways, for example, as defined and covered by the claims. In this description, reference is made to the drawings where like reference numerals can indicate identical or functionally similar elements. It will be understood that elements illustrated in the figures are not necessarily drawn to scale. Moreover, it will be understood that certain embodiments can include more elements than illustrated in a drawing and/or a subset of the elements illustrated in a drawing. Further, some embodiments can incorporate any suitable combination of features from two or more drawings.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Described herein are various examples related to film bulk acoustic resonators (FBARs) and related devices having an improved quality factor Q and/or improved electromagnetic coupling factor k<sup>2</sup>. For example, FBARs and related devices described herein can have increased mode reflection and reduced mode conversion. Although such examples are described in the context of FBARs, it will be understood that one or more features of the present disclosure can also be implemented in other types of resonators, including solidly mounted resonators (SMRs) or devices that are similar to FBARs but referred to in different terms.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">According to certain aspects, FBARs can include a raised frame to improve quality factor Q above a resonance frequency fs. Generally, in FBARs, leakage of laterally propagating modes out of an active region can cause the quality factor Q to decrease. In addition, mode conversion from the main mode to lateral modes can also cause the quality factor Q to decrease. A raised frame can act as a reflector that reflects lateral modes back to the active region and can improve the quality factor Q. However, having only one raised frame may not be sufficient to reflect all the lateral modes. To strengthen the reflection and achieve maximum mode reflection, one may form multiple reflectors, such as two or more raised frames, for example, by forming different unmatched acoustic impedance interfaces. However, forming multiple reflectors can create a number of discontinuous boundaries, which can increase mode conversion.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">One embodiment of a FBAR device is illustrated in plan view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> and in cross-sectional view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, indicated generally at <b>100</b>. The FBAR device <b>100</b> can include a first metal layer <b>120</b> forming a top electrode, a second metal layer <b>110</b> forming a bottom electrode, and a piezoelectric layer <b>130</b> between the first metal layer <b>120</b> and the second metal layer <b>110</b>. A resonator can be formed by positioning the piezoelectric layer <b>130</b> between the first metal layer <b>120</b> and the second metal layer <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, a portion of the piezoelectric layer <b>130</b> that overlaps with the first metal layer <b>120</b> and the second metal layer <b>110</b> can be referred to as a &#x201c;resonator.&#x201d; In some embodiments, a metal layer <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> may be referred to as an &#x201c;electrode.&#x201d; A radio-frequency (RF) signal can be applied to one of the metal layers <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> and can cause an acoustic wave to be generated in the piezoelectric layer <b>130</b>. The acoustic wave can travel through the piezoelectric layer <b>130</b> and can be converted to an RF signal at the other one of the metal layers <b>110</b>, <b>120</b>. In this way, the FBAR device <b>100</b> can provide filtering functionality. In the FBAR device <b>100</b>, acoustic waves can travel in a vertical direction (e.g., perpendicular to the metal layers <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> and the piezoelectric layer <b>130</b>). For example, the vertical direction can be a Z-direction. Some acoustic waves may travel in a horizontal direction (e.g., parallel to the metal layers <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> and the piezoelectric layer <b>130</b>). For example, the horizontal direction may be a X-direction, Y-direction, or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The FBAR device <b>100</b> can include one or more raised frames (&#x201c;RaFs&#x201d;). In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, the FBAR device <b>100</b> includes a metal raised frame <b>140</b> formed of a metal layer and a dielectric or oxide raised frame <b>150</b> formed from a dielectric layer which may be, for example, silicon dioxide.

Each raised frame <b>140</b>, <b>150</b> surrounds a central active region of the FBAR, referred to as a main frequency domain <b>160</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In different embodiments, a raised frame can be made of or from any suitable material. In some embodiments, a raised frame can be made of or from a similar or the same material as the second metal layer <b>110</b> and/or the first metal layer <b>120</b>. For example, a raised frame can be made of a heavy material. In certain embodiments, a raised frame can be made of or from a low acoustic impedance material. For example, a raised frame can be made of silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, etc. A raised frame may be made of any low density material. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, for example, the metal raised frame <b>140</b> may be formed of a metal, and the oxide raised frame <b>150</b> may be formed of silicon dioxide.

The oxide raised frame <b>150</b> may formed of a material with a lower acoustic impedance than a material of which the metal raised frame <b>140</b> is formed and a lower acoustic impedance than the material of the piezoelectric layer <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, the FBAR device <b>100</b> is shown to include two raised frames for illustrative purposes, but the number of raised frames included in the FBAR device <b>100</b> can vary as appropriate, depending on the embodiment. For example, in some embodiments, the FBAR device <b>100</b> can include one raised frame or more than two raised frames. One or more raised frames can be positioned in various configurations. One or more raised frames can be placed at various positions along the vertical direction (e.g., perpendicular to the metal layers <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> and the piezoelectric layer <b>130</b>). For example, one or more raised frames can be placed at a position above or below the first metal layer <b>120</b>, above or below the second metal layer <b>110</b>, between the first metal layer <b>120</b> and the second metal layer <b>110</b>, or any combination thereof.

The passivation layer <b>180</b> can be on top of the metal raised frame <b>140</b> and an exposed portion of the first metal layer <b>120</b>. The exposed portion of the first metal layer <b>120</b> can be a portion that is not covered by the metal raised frame <b>140</b>. In certain embodiments, the FBAR device <b>100</b> may also include recessed frame (ReF) regions <b>185</b> that may be defined by thinned portions of the passivation layer <b>180</b> and that define outer boundaries of the main frequency domain <b>160</b>. The passivation layer <b>180</b> may be thinner in the recessed frame regions <b>185</b> than in the main frequency domain <b>160</b>. The thickness of the passivation payer <b>180</b> in the recessed frame regions <b>185</b> can be similar to or the same as the thickness of the passivation layer <b>180</b> over the metal raised frame <b>140</b>. In some embodiments, the recessed frame region <b>185</b> can be a contiguous ring structure surrounding the main frequency domain <b>160</b>. The passivation layer <b>180</b> may be formed of a dielectric material, for example, silicon dioxide or silicon nitride. In some embodiments, the FBAR device <b>100</b> can include a support substrate <b>170</b> formed of, for example, silicon, and an air cavity <b>190</b> below the second metal layer <b>110</b>.
