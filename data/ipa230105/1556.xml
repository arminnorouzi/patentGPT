More precisely, the present invention relates to a tacker with improved efficiency of assembly and operation.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Staple gun tackers and the like with energy storage via a power spring are known. A spring is deflected to store energy for sudden release to impact and drive a fastener into a work piece. Most commonly associated with manually operated hand tools such as a staple gun, a power spring based driving tool may also operate with a motorized system. A power spring may include a compression type, elongated bar, or torsion wire spring. With manual staple guns, a tool housing may include formed sheet metal, die cast, or resin molded. The sheet metal construction has most often been associated with compression springs and, less often, bar springs. One example of a sheet metal bodied staple gun is the T-50 brand of tacker, while many other such tackers are also known. Torsion springs are generally associated with molded or die cast housings; these are effective for providing the supports and guides for operating torsion springs.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The various springs may be used in a low start tacker, wherein the striker starts an operating cycle from a normal rest position in front of the staple or fastener track, and a high start where the striker normally rests above the staple track to start an operating cycle. In either case, there must be a release system to suddenly release the striker to instantly move down under the spring bias to eject a fastener. It is common that the release for one or both are imprecise and a source of force-adding friction.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A guide track for staples or fasteners is located along a bottom of the tool. Staples may be inserted from the rear or at the bottom among other known arrangements. Rear loading designs are prone to jamming since the staples cannot be easily accessed near the track front where jams may occur. Bottom loading exposes the full staple storage area for access as the track slide out rearward. A track pull with a latching structure is required to hold the track in its operative position. Such latches can be unwieldy and require aesthetic compromise.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In various preferred embodiments, the present invention is directed to a spring energized fastening tool with compact, low friction working elements. In the preferred high start embodiment, a torsion power spring includes at least two forward extending arms with the arms pressing each other proximate a front distal end of the spring. One embodiment has a rigid and movable four bar assembly that links the handle to the power spring and deflects the spring to separate and deflect the arms immediately upon pressing the handle. A further embodiment has a cantilevered lever engaging the spring adjacent to the striker. A release link preferably nests within a front portion of the handle whereby the release moves directly with the handle about a common pivot hinge during a release portion of the handle stroke. This structure provides reliable and repeatable release action.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Various preferred structures are provided to enable fitment with a formed sheet metal handle and housing. The illustrated structures are compatible to fit within the confines of a standard T-50 type tacker, for example, while also being well suited to other sheet metal, molded and die cast bodied tackers. As fitted, the fastening tool is particularly simple to assemble, powerful, and of low operating effort.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the preferred embodiment, a bottom loading staple track is compatible with a sheet metal housing among other housing structures. The track unlatches and opens through a simple pulling-out action.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief

end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The present invention is directed to a compact, efficient spring energized tacker that may operate and be fitted within a formed sheet housing body or like standardized body. The drawings show a preferred embodiment tacker that has a body sized and shaped similarly to a known commercially available tacker operable with T-50 style staples up to &#xbd;&#x2033; or 9/16&#x2033; long. However, the features of the present invention function with tackers of other shapes, sizes, and constructions including molded resin and die cast. For example, one or both of housing <b>10</b> and handle <b>20</b> may include sheet metal, molded resin, and/or die cast metal. In describing a tacker, such term may include staple guns, nail guns and equivalent fastening tools whether motorized or manually powered to energize a power spring.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the preferred embodiment tacker of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, for example, the length of the tool from the rear end to front end is 7&#xbc; inches long. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, housing <b>10</b> totals approximately 0.9 inch wide at the dimension W (W being doubled from approximately 0.45 inch to include the opposed housing side that is not shown). Other sizes, shapes and dimensions of the housing, handle, and other operating parts are contemplated.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In the assembly drawings <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, a right side of the housing is removed and handle <b>20</b> is depicted in cross-section to show internal components. Housing <b>10</b> has a front (right side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), a rear, a top, and a bottom. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a rest condition of the tacker. Handle <b>20</b> is in an upper position above housing <b>10</b>, and it is pivotally attached to housing <b>10</b> at a handle/housing pivot, here hinge pin <b>110</b> near the top of the housing. At the bottom of housing <b>10</b> is a staple track <b>180</b> that supports staples biased forward by spring-driven pusher <b>400</b>. Handle link pivot support <b>28</b> includes pivot hinge <b>22</b>. Link <b>30</b> has pivot <b>32</b> fitted to hinge <b>22</b> defining an upper end or equivalent location of a linkage assembly. A lower end of link <b>30</b> includes slot <b>33</b> to engage hinge <b>43</b> of lever <b>40</b>. See also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> to <b>15</b></figref> for the individual components. Lever <b>40</b> includes pivot tab <b>45</b> to engage groove <b>65</b> of link bar <b>60</b>. Link bar <b>60</b> engages pivot, hinge pin or hinge element <b>96</b> of power spring <b>90</b> at link bar hole <b>66</b>. Hole <b>66</b> may define a lower end or equivalent structure of the linkage assembly that begins at hinge <b>22</b>. The linkage lower end is below and substantially forward from the linkage upper end. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, imaginary vertical line L between the pivot structures of hinge pin <b>110</b> and element <b>96</b> is well forward of hinge <b>22</b>; as illustrated, line L is close to the forward structure or blade of striker <b>70</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, the power spring <b>90</b> pivots about mandrel <b>106</b>. Power spring arm <b>94</b> extends from spring coil <b>93</b> to spring arm tip <b>95</b>. Tip <b>95</b> engages opening <b>79</b> of striker <b>70</b>, preferably directly as shown or through another linking member in the immediate local position. Latch <b>50</b> is preferably pivotally attached to the tool assembly by recess <b>57</b> at handle hinge pin <b>110</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, tab <b>54</b> of the latch <b>50</b> engages opening or edge <b>74</b> of the striker <b>70</b> to selectively immobilize the striker.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The motions of the parts described above are shown by comparing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>3</b></figref>. Pressing handle <b>20</b> about hinge pin <b>110</b> causes link <b>30</b> to move downward. Lever <b>40</b> pivots about hinge <b>41</b> to cause link bar <b>60</b> to move downward. The linkage assembly thus forces spring arm <b>92</b> to deflect downward or equivalent direction. Striker <b>70</b> cannot move downward from the action at latch <b>50</b>, so spring arm <b>94</b> remains in an upper position as seen in the pressed position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. Power spring <b>90</b> becomes deflected with spring arm <b>92</b> spaced away from spring arm <b>94</b>. Power spring <b>90</b> is thereby energized for an operating cycle to eject fasteners from track <b>180</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, hinge pin <b>22</b> has just made contact with tab <b>53</b> of latch <b>50</b> while handle <b>20</b> is in a low but not lowest position. Moving the handle farther toward the lowest position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> starts the latch <b>50</b> rotating to disengage striker <b>70</b> as described next.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>4</b>A</figref>, the pre-release condition has latch <b>50</b> disengaged from striker <b>70</b>. Tab <b>54</b> is moved away from opening <b>74</b> so striker <b>70</b> is now free to move down. It is preferred that the release of striker <b>70</b> occur as close as possible to the handle's lowest position. This handle lowest position, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, is defined by contact to bumper <b>25</b> of handle <b>20</b> against a surface of housing <b>10</b> or equivalent action. Thus, there is minimal jump or jerking of the handle <b>20</b> upon release for reduced operator fatigue. Further, the force of an operator's hand presses directly on the housing body <b>10</b> through bumper <b>25</b> to help hold down the tacker as it fires. To move the latch <b>50</b> as described, the pin or equivalent structure of hinge <b>22</b> presses tab <b>53</b> of the latch. The latch <b>50</b> rotates about hinge pin <b>110</b> to slide tab <b>54</b> out from the striker <b>70</b>. The preferred latch motion is precise, reliable and repeatable since it is directly tied to a short portion of the handle motion; the latch begins to move only during a late part of the handle stroke so its release motion is relatively fast during the relevant handle motion. Specifically, the latch release motion occurs only between the pressed handle position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> and the pre-release position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, this being about &#xbd;&#x2033; at the handle rear for the exemplary model shown. With all of the latch release motion concentrated near the end-of-stroke, any tolerance variation of the pre-release handle position will be confined to a pre-determined position within this small portion of the handle motion. The latch <b>50</b> operates about a common pivot to the handle <b>20</b> so there is no tolerance variation of intervening components; the latch and handle move in unison during release. There is also minimal net vertical force on hinge pin <b>110</b> since handle <b>20</b> and latch <b>50</b> pull oppositely on the pin. Therefore, the pin <b>110</b> can rotate with handle <b>20</b> about its mounting on housing <b>10</b> with little force and friction at the housing mounting. This unified motion reduces friction between the latch <b>50</b> and the pin <b>110</b> as demonstrated in a working model and through empirical testing.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A, <b>9</b></figref>, the exemplary embodiment tab <b>54</b> has a preferred acute angle of approximately 89 degrees relative to an imaginary radial line extending from hinge pin <b>110</b>. An angle within approximately 2 to 5 degrees of 90 degrees can be suitable to hold the latch <b>50</b> stable on the striker with minimal force on the latch required to move the latch as described. Through empirical observation, with the exemplary angle of 89 degrees, in the release action, rotating latch <b>50</b> under load as between <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, adds less than 1 lb., being about &#xbd; lb., to a peak handle force. This force is effectively undetectable to a user. When measured at the handle rear in the position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the required total force is approximately 15 to 16 lbs. to provide power sufficient to drive &#xbd;-inch T-50 type staples flush in common construction wood applications, for example, Douglas fir wood. Therefore, the tacker provides tremendous staple driving energy while the handle deflection effort as perceived by the user is very low and smooth.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The linkage between handle <b>20</b> and striker <b>70</b> is substantially rigid through the structures described here. In the spring rest condition of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>14</b>A and <b>14</b>C</figref>, pivot/support element <b>96</b> presses spring arm <b>94</b> to hold power spring <b>90</b> preloaded. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>14</b>B</figref> show the power spring deflected and energized. Pivot element <b>96</b> is preferably a laterally extending portion of a spring arm and may be referred to as a &#x201c;location of preload&#x201d; or of preload force for the spring, such location being spaced from coil <b>93</b> to enable a preload torque on the coil. The lateral direction is into the page in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>18</b></figref>, being preferably, but not necessarily, perpendicular to arm <b>94</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>C</figref>. This spring arm crossing, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>C</figref>, may be at shallower angles. The pressing is preferably directly between the respective arms <b>92</b>, <b>94</b> while the arms may also press in the local area through further elements. Pivot element <b>96</b>, preferably but not necessarily along with tip <b>91</b>, forms a hook to hold the spring in the preloaded condition at the location of preload. As the handle is pressed by the user, pivot element <b>96</b> is forced downward. The force on striker <b>70</b> at tip <b>95</b> increases from near zero to a final maximum at the pre-release position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. This force is a torque on spring arm <b>94</b>. The spring arms <b>92</b>, <b>94</b> are of a functionally and intentionally resilient material being normally of a same wire as the coil. However, flexing forward of the location of preload is not useful as discussed below; hence the length of the portion forward of pivot element <b>96</b> is minimized in the preferred embodiment.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">To demonstrate this minimized forward portion length, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>14</b>A to <b>14</b>C</figref>, spring arm <b>94</b> flexes in proportion to the length of the unsupported cantilevered segment between pivot/support element <b>96</b> and the striker location at tip <b>95</b>. This effect is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>B</figref>: in phantom lines, support element <b>96</b> is pressed down slightly from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref> until element <b>96</b> no longer presses spring arm <b>94</b>. Spring arm <b>94</b> flexes as shown until support element <b>96</b> is no longer in contact at S<b>1</b>. With the loss of support at S<b>1</b>, the support shifts farther forward to the striker at S<b>2</b>. This flexing to remove the preload translates to handle <b>20</b> as a mushy start to the stroke and lost energy input as discussed below relative to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>35</b></figref>. It is thus desirable to have S<b>1</b> be as close as practicable to S<b>2</b> as shown and separately discussed to minimize the effect of this flexing.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a distance between mandrel pin <b>107</b> or equivalently a central axis of the coil, or a spring coil central location, and striker <b>70</b> is approximately 2.06 to 2.11 inches. Most preferably, this is a distance of approximately 2.11 inches, and is denoted by dashed line L<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In this context, the striker location is defined as the rear plane of the blade of the striker at engaged opening <b>79</b>. From support element <b>96</b> to striker <b>70</b> is a distance of approximately 0.43 inch, as denoted by line L<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. L<b>3</b> is the distance between mandrel pin <b>107</b> and support element <b>96</b>, and L<b>3</b> in this embodiment is approximately 1.70 inch. There is a distance ratio L<b>3</b>/L<b>1</b> of about 80% (i.e., 1.70 in./2.11 in.). Therefore, the location of preload is forward of the coil location about 80% of the length of dashed line L<b>1</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> this distance places support element <b>96</b> adjacent to striker <b>70</b> in the pressed spring condition, preferably clear of sidewalls <b>72</b> or other striker structure by not more than one spring wire diameter, although other spacings to the striker are contemplated. A distance ratio L<b>3</b>/L<b>1</b> of more than 50% is preferable, while a distance ratio of more than about 60 or 70%, is more preferable to have spring arm <b>92</b> terminate adjacent the striker and thereby see the benefits described below, based on empirical observation. Other dimensions are contemplated in proportion to other overall tool sizes. The foregoing ratios or proportions are with reference to the rest position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> although they are not substantially different in the released position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Flexing of cantilevered spring arm <b>94</b> as described above is felt as a &#x201c;dead bounce&#x201d; at the handle&#x2014;a mushy feel that is minimized in the present invention as discussed above regarding <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>B</figref>. Based on empirical observation and mechanical principles, this flex is a waste of handle travel and useable energy input as illustrated in the x-y plot of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>35</b></figref> discussed in further detail below. With such flex minimized, handle <b>20</b> is effectively rigidly linked to power spring <b>90</b> at a location just approximately 0.43 inch from striker <b>70</b> through the four bar style cantilevered linkage, or an alternative linkage arrangement, discussed below. With the short cantilever L<b>2</b> of the &#x201c;beam&#x201d; of spring arm <b>94</b> as described, there is minimal beam flexing and no perceived dead bounce. Therefore, user effort on the handle is perceptibly reduced, and the smooth operation of the handle greatly improves the feel of the tool for the user.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>A to <b>14</b>C</figref> show various views of a preferred embodiment power spring <b>90</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>A and <b>14</b>C</figref> power spring <b>90</b> is in a preloaded rest condition. Pivot/support element <b>96</b> is pressing spring arm <b>94</b> in proportion to a preload selected for the particular power spring characteristics. Accordingly, there is a free position (i.e., unflexed) for the spring wherein spring arm <b>92</b> is preferably angled upward and pivot element <b>96</b> is spaced above arm <b>94</b> relative to the view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref>. A pre-assembly step has link bar <b>60</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>12</b></figref>) assembled to power spring <b>90</b> with pivot element <b>96</b> passing through hole <b>66</b> in link bar <b>60</b>. In the pre-assembly step, the spring arms are then forcibly moved from the free position to the position depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>A and <b>14</b>C</figref> to form a sub-assembly of link bar <b>60</b> and power spring <b>90</b> wherein the spring is preloaded. Tip <b>91</b> of power spring <b>90</b> preferably passes beside spring arm <b>94</b> to secure spring arm <b>94</b> on pivot element <b>96</b> and to hold the assembly stable. The assembly preferably has tip <b>91</b>, link bar <b>60</b>, and spring arm <b>94</b> laterally adjacent each other along pivot element <b>96</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">An alternative embodiment tool may use a power spring in the form of a single or assembly of flat bar springs instead of a coiled wire torsion spring. The bar spring includes cantilevered legs and is preloaded similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>A to <b>14</b>C</figref>. The bar spring is mounted to a mandrel <b>107</b> or like fixture inside the housing.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In the present embodiment tool, a &#x201c;four bar&#x201d; or equivalent rigid linkage forms the linkage assembly to connect the rigid steel handle or equivalent rigid structure to pivot element <b>96</b> of power spring <b>90</b>. In the four bar assembly, lever <b>40</b> is pivotally mounted at its rear at hinge <b>41</b>, depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Link <b>30</b> presses lever <b>40</b> toward a central portion of lever <b>40</b> at hinge <b>43</b> and the lever presses link bar <b>60</b> at a front distal end of lever <b>40</b>. Lever <b>40</b> is cantilevered forward from its links at hinges <b>41</b> and <b>43</b> and therefore lever <b>40</b> can extend forward to a striker proximate position. In this manner, a vertical linear motion from the handle at link hinge <b>22</b> may be enhanced at pivot tab <b>45</b>, and thus on pivot element <b>96</b> or equivalent structure, through cantilevered lever <b>40</b>. As shown between <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, the vertical travel at link hinge <b>22</b> is about doubled at pivot tab <b>45</b> since the lever is pressed near its center. However, if hinge <b>41</b> were located farther rearward in housing <b>10</b>, this doubled travel decreases, with a factor of 1.1 still allowing usable lever geometries. Spring pivot element <b>96</b> and lever pivot tab <b>45</b> are substantially vertically aligned so pivot element <b>96</b> maintains the preferable, at least 80% distance ratio discussed above. Thus, pivot element <b>96</b> is also proximate the striker as described.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">All of the linking elements of the linkage assembly described here may be made of steel so there is no obvious or perceptible give or play in the system beyond that used to store spring energy. It is apparent from the above geometries that handle <b>20</b> should rigidly link to power spring <b>90</b> at a most forward position of the power spring. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, this link at the location of preload adjacent to pivot element <b>96</b> is substantially aligned vertically with handle hinge <b>110</b>, indicated by vertical line L in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, whereby there is a position of line L that passes through or near tangent with both pivot element <b>96</b> and hinge <b>110</b>. Described another way, line L is substantially vertically coincident with each of hinge <b>110</b> and pivot element <b>96</b> (preload location). Similar considerations apply to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> for example. Similarly, link bar <b>60</b> extends vertically in or near alignment below handle hinge <b>110</b>, being vertically coincident in this alignment as shown wherein a top view has some structures of hinge <b>110</b> overlapping structures of element <b>96</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In the four bar system depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>2</b></figref> and discussed above, there is a rear bar including the structure of housing <b>10</b> supporting spring mandrel <b>106</b> and hinge <b>41</b>, a front bar in the form of link bar <b>60</b>, a top bar being lever <b>40</b>, and a bottom bar being spring arm <b>92</b>. Link bar <b>60</b> is pivotally guided within this four-bar system by pivot element <b>96</b> of the power spring, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>. The torsion spring as described is thus particularly suited for the present four bar system. Spring arm <b>92</b> provides both an interface to energize the spring and also a functionally rigid member of the four bar system to guide the lower end of link bar <b>60</b>. These combined functions are not possible, for example, with a compression spring which is inherently unstable in lateral directions.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>35</b></figref> is an x-y plot depicting empirical observations of unexpected results and benefits of the rigid structure described above. The plot shows comparative test results from working models of torsion spring tackers with similar tacking performance. It is based on measurements of force F at the distal or rear end of a handle (y axis) versus the distance D (x axis) that the handle moves, with initial handle free play omitted, but &#x201c;dead bounce&#x201d; included. The areas under the respective curves correspond to energy stored in the power spring. The &#x201c;Long Arm&#x201d; sample plot has a first spring arm pressed in preload by a second arm about halfway between the coil and the striker, an arrangement that would have L<b>2</b> and L<b>3</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> being close in value. In contrast, the &#x201c;Short Arm&#x201d; sample plot has the &#x2dc;80% ratio discussed above, being pressed in preload closer to the striker. A steep initial slope in the Short Arm plot indicates a stiff linkage with reduced dead bounce and a quick start to energy storage (as shown in phantom in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>B</figref> and discussed above). The shallower slope of the Long Arm plot shows extra flexing or give between the handle and the power spring. As seen, there is substantial wasted handle motion up to about 0.4 inches of travel for the Long Arm, so the Long Arm tacker requires a higher handle force for similar performance. Accordingly, the exemplary embodiment Short Arm tacker enjoys measurable performance advantages over Long Arm tacker designs.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The exemplary embodiments disclosed herein include a tensile link between the striker and the handle while enabling easy assembly of the tacker tool. This is further advantageous in that if the striker becomes stuck in a lower position, it is possible to forcibly move the striker upward by pulling the handle with a tensile force. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the link between link bar <b>60</b> and power spring <b>90</b> at hole <b>66</b> is inherently multi-directional. The next connection is between link bar <b>60</b> and lever <b>40</b>. This connection is between pivot tab <b>45</b> and groove <b>65</b> of link bar <b>60</b>. During assembly, lever <b>40</b> is rotated counterclockwise about this connection to engage tab <b>68</b> above catch <b>48</b>. The tab and catch remain engageable for all operative positions&#x2014;compare <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>3</b>A</figref> for example. There is a small clearance to tab <b>68</b> to ensure normal compressive operation has only pivot tab <b>45</b> and groove <b>65</b> engaged. When lever <b>40</b> is pulled upward, catch <b>48</b> presses tab <b>68</b> from below to pull link bar <b>60</b>, and thus the power spring and striker, upward.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Re-set spring <b>190</b> biases the relevant moving parts toward the rest condition, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, in normal use. The re-set spring <b>190</b> pivots about leg <b>194</b> in hole <b>157</b> of absorber <b>150</b>, as per <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>15</b></figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, absorber <b>150</b> is omitted to show underlying elements. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, at its upper end, angled leg <b>193</b> engages opening <b>67</b> of link bar <b>60</b>, with an angle of leg <b>193</b> biasing spring arm <b>192</b> to be retained in the opening.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The components including everything below link <b>30</b> are preferably initially assembled so that the lower tacker structure is complete, including both housing halves and front cover <b>12</b>. Only parts associated with the handle remain to be attached so that there is no need to hold various lower parts in position as the handle is manipulated into the assembly. This eases assembly effort for volume production.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">An upper subassembly includes handle <b>20</b>, bumper <b>25</b>, link support <b>28</b>, latch bias spring <b>130</b>, and link <b>30</b>, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>2</b></figref>. Latch bias spring <b>130</b> is supported about hinge pin <b>22</b> at spring coil <b>133</b> and held in position at rear end <b>134</b>, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>. These parts are pre-assembled to handle <b>20</b>. Link <b>30</b> hangs loosely from handle <b>20</b> about link hinge <b>22</b> before installation to the lower tool structure. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, link hinge pin <b>22</b> naturally forms a multidirectional link within respective holes of the two connected parts. Pin <b>22</b> also supports latch bias spring <b>130</b> in this pre-assembly. As the handle sub-assembly is installed, the elements of the lower structure are in the rest condition of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Latch <b>50</b> is placed atop lever <b>40</b> to rest against angled face <b>75</b> of striker <b>70</b>, in the approximate position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The tacker body and handle are positioned with the tool front angled upward to allow a lower end of link <b>30</b> to drop over hinge <b>43</b> at slot <b>33</b> of the link. Hinge pin <b>43</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A, <b>10</b></figref>) is a pre-installed pin of lever <b>40</b>. Rotating the link allows the handle to line up at hinge pin <b>110</b> at which point pin <b>110</b> is installed to support both latch <b>50</b> and handle <b>20</b>. This process is demonstrated to be effective in a working model. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, it is seen that rib <b>37</b> of the link now cooperates with lever tab <b>47</b> so that pulling up on handle <b>20</b> causes rib <b>37</b> to press tab <b>47</b> from below to transmit a jam-releasing tensile force. Therefore, the preferred embodiment tacker benefits from an anti-jam tensile force available to link striker <b>70</b> to handle <b>20</b> operated by the user. Optionally, some or all the functions of link support <b>28</b> may be integrated into a handle structure, for example, in association with a molded polymer composite handle. For example, recesses in sidewalls of the handle could support link hinge pin <b>22</b> with latch bias spring <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The staple is driven from the present invention tool, and now in a re-set action, striker <b>70</b> moves from its low released position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> to its upper rest position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, it is seen that moving striker face <b>75</b> upward will cause latch <b>50</b> to rotate counterclockwise in the view. This cam action persists until latch tab <b>54</b> lines up with striker opening <b>74</b>, such as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>. Latch <b>50</b> then rotates clockwise under the bias of re-set spring <b>130</b> as the tab enters opening <b>74</b> to assume the position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Latch <b>50</b> now selectively holds striker <b>70</b> in its upper position. Tabs <b>55</b> contact face <b>75</b> to hold latch <b>50</b> in a position in opening <b>74</b> that clears a radius at the base of tab <b>54</b>, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In the conditions shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>6</b></figref>, striker <b>70</b> is down and out of engagement to latch <b>50</b>. As handle <b>20</b> rises in the re-set stroke, the latch tends to rotate clockwise from re-set spring <b>130</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, latch <b>50</b> has a stop against the housing formed by housing notch <b>11</b> against latch tab <b>56</b> to limit this rotation to the operative position shown in the drawing when the striker is not present. Thus, tab <b>54</b> of latch <b>50</b> remains in a position forward of face <b>75</b> whereby the re-set cam action of the latch and striker may occur.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, striker <b>70</b> includes a blade or plane defined by its position at <b>78</b> immediately in front of track <b>180</b>. It is preferable to minimize any element of the tool that extends forward past this position <b>78</b> to ensure a staple can be installed reasonably near a confining wall, corner, or like obstruction. Further, a compact front of the tool maintains a beneficial line of sight for the user for aiming the tool. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>5</b>A and <b>13</b></figref>, the tool includes an optional hump <b>12</b><i>b </i>in front cover <b>12</b> to clear power spring arm tip <b>95</b>. Also handle <b>20</b> extends forward in its pressed position, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, but no farther than hump <b>12</b><i>b</i>.

These extensions <b>72</b><i>a </i>provide a direct force path from the moving bodies of striker <b>70</b> and power spring tip <b>95</b> to tabs <b>71</b> to reduce bending stresses on the blade structure where the tabs meet side walls <b>72</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">It is common in a torsion spring tacker design that an absorber acts directly on an arm of the power spring&#x2014;in particular, that a dry fire, without staples, has the absorber directly stopping an arm of the spring rather than the striker. This causes an undesirable reversal of forces in the spring arm type absorber. In normal use when the tool is fired, spring arm tip <b>95</b> presses down at the striker hole <b>79</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>, <b>11</b></figref>) to install staples. But with the spring arm to absorber contact structure in a dry fire there is a reversal of force at the spring arm/striker interface. The spring arms stops first, and the striker overshoots the spring arm a small distance at hole <b>79</b> and impacts the spring arm at the top of the hole to be indirectly stopped by the absorber.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">This overtravel action causes wear at hole <b>79</b> from both top and bottom, leading to a stretched, distorted, or enlarged hole, added tensile stress on the striker, and increased vertical free play of the striker about the spring arm. In the extreme, the hole is so ovoid that spring arm will not be able to raise striker high enough to set the latch or reach a release height. As described herein, absorber <b>150</b> acts directly on striker <b>70</b>. Therefore, striker <b>70</b> is always one of accelerating, pressing a staple, or pressing the absorber. Spring arm <b>94</b> at tip <b>95</b> thereby always presses down within hole <b>79</b> and thus wears the hole in only one direction with minimal tensile stress on the striker in this area. From empirical observations, this arrangement improves longevity and operating life of the tool.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Further, in the case of a spring wire/absorber interface, the wire spring arm provides a small impact target for the absorber leading to high stress in that contact area. In the present preferred embodiment, any target area on power spring arm <b>94</b> is further interrupted by the useful forward location of pivot element <b>96</b> at the front distal end of spring arm <b>92</b>, corresponding to a short L<b>2</b> length in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. While keeping this segment L<b>2</b> short, which is useful as discussed, it provides a small absorber target. With the absorber contact being against a structure of or affixed to the striker, the absorber can directly vertically underlie the distal end of arm <b>92</b>, for example, at pivot element <b>96</b>. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, absorber <b>150</b> extends rearward of pivot element <b>96</b>. This structure may be described as having an alignment along a vertical line of at least absorber <b>150</b> and the distal end of arm <b>92</b> with handle hinge <b>110</b> also preferably so aligned above absorber <b>150</b>, and with spring coil <b>93</b> rearward of this alignment. In an alternative embodiment, there may be an additional or only absorber contacting arm <b>94</b> or other structures that move with the striker.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the impact stop (horizontal tabs <b>71</b>) are bent directly from the material of the striker <b>70</b> to preferably minimize weight and inertia of the reciprocating impact parts, although separate components may be used. It is desirable that the mass of the striker and any other parts that move in the impact or firing stroke be minimized. When these parts are kept light weight, the tacker installs staples and the like more effectively, especially when the tacker is actuated with a single hand. Consequently, the body including housing <b>10</b> will not jump substantially upward as the staple exits since the body is very heavy compared to the fast moving but light weight striker. This gives the user a damped, less jarring feel from the tool with reduced hand fatigue. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, striker <b>70</b> includes optional openings above and below spring opening <b>79</b> to further reduce its weight.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Housing <b>10</b> preferably includes two halves. A left half is shown in the views of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>6</b></figref>. The halves must be secured in a properly spaced relation for effective tool function. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, mandrel <b>106</b> is supported by pin <b>107</b>. This pin <b>107</b> may be a screw or rivet to compress the housing about the mandrel. Mandrel <b>106</b> thus holds the housing securely spaced apart for operating clearance for spring <b>90</b> and further holds the housing halves from sliding relative to each other. At the lower front of the housing in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, plate <b>155</b> holds the housings apart while front cover <b>12</b> clamps the housing from in front. Housing plate <b>155</b> preferably supports rubber absorber <b>150</b> in an absorber assembly, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>. In the cut away cross-section of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, track chamber tab <b>129</b> extends within slot <b>156</b> of plate <b>155</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> also shows these parts with absorber <b>150</b> omitted for clarity. Tab <b>129</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> provides an accurate rear limit position relative to track chamber <b>120</b> for striker <b>70</b> in its upper rest position. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, striker <b>70</b> is laterally positioned by edges <b>158</b> of plate <b>155</b>. To register plate <b>155</b> to track chamber <b>120</b> laterally, tab <b>129</b> is a close fit in notch <b>156</b>. Thus, there is essentially no tolerance build up from a more indirect link of the plate to the striker and track through the housing enclosure.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">At the front top there is minimal room for a similar plate since, for example, latch <b>50</b> is advantageously located there. Preferably, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>13</b></figref>, front cover <b>12</b> includes registration notches <b>19</b> to cooperate with housing tabs <b>17</b> during assembly. With tabs <b>17</b> secure in notches <b>19</b>, the housing is held accurately spaced part in this area.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In the drawings and disclosure, a single power spring is shown. In alternative embodiments, there may be two or more of such springs. For example, two coiled power springs <b>90</b> may be vertically stacked with a second mandrel <b>106</b> below the first mandrel, in front of grip opening <b>18</b> in housing <b>10</b>. Pivot element <b>96</b> of this second spring engages a second link bar hole <b>66</b> (not shown) below the first. In this alternative embodiment, the horizontal distance between mandrel pin <b>107</b> and hole <b>66</b> (for both springs) is close to the same as that between hinge <b>41</b> and pivot tab <b>45</b>. This ensures that pivot tab <b>45</b> and both holes <b>66</b> remain aligned through their motions to prevent binding. In another alternative embodiment, two power springs <b>90</b> may be installed side by side axially on a common mandrel <b>106</b>. As with the other disclosed embodiments, power spring <b>90</b> is pivotally attached to the housing near or forward of a front of grip opening <b>18</b> whereby arms <b>92</b> and <b>94</b> form torque arms and extend from this position to striker <b>70</b>. With relatively short torque arms, there is high force available at striker <b>70</b> for useful work, and further there is minimal vibration in the arm action as the short arms operate. If desired, longer arms may be used, with a more rearward mounting. Arm <b>94</b> may be described as a first spring arm while arm <b>92</b> may be described as a second spring arm.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>13</b></figref>, front cover <b>12</b> includes raised bottom front edge <b>12</b><i>a</i>. This raised portion may extend along the side walls of cover <b>12</b> rearward across striker slot <b>13</b>. In use, a tacker is often held at an angle to the work with the rear end held up. With the clearance described here, the striker end <b>78</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) can still extend close to the work piece with front cover <b>12</b> out of the way. This front edge <b>12</b><i>a </i>may be raised by approximately 0.020 inch for example. With the light weight reciprocating compact parts discussed above and the tight contact here, ordinary stapling will easily produce driven staples that are flush with the work surface. Workpieces having such fully installed staples will hold the work more tightly and have a higher quality workmanship.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b> to <b>23</b></figref> show a second exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Many elements may be shared with the first embodiment described above and the mechanical actions of power spring <b>90</b>, striker <b>70</b> and latch <b>50</b><i>a </i>are or may be equivalent. Distance ratios described in connection with the first embodiment may be employed in this second embodiment as well. Also, the geometries that the handle should rigidly link to the power spring at a most forward position, proximate vertical line L, may be applied in this embodiment. Finally, the part count, friction, and complexity are or may be reduced in the second exemplary embodiment.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, handle <b>20</b> to lever link <b>330</b> pivotally connects handle link support <b>328</b> to lever <b>340</b>. Lever <b>340</b> directly engages pivot element <b>96</b> of power spring <b>90</b> at opening <b>366</b>. Opening <b>366</b> may be elongated to provide for longitudinal (left-right on the page) motion of power spring <b>90</b> relative to lever <b>340</b> at this location. Lever pivot <b>341</b> operates rearward of spring coil <b>93</b> while lever <b>340</b> extends along a lever length forward past spring coil <b>93</b> to be disposed adjacent to striker <b>70</b>. Link <b>330</b>, at hinge <b>333</b>, presses lever <b>340</b> at central lever pivot <b>343</b> toward a central location of the length of lever <b>340</b>. Lever <b>340</b> is thus cantilevered forward from central lever pivot <b>343</b> to the spring location of preload on pivot element <b>96</b>. In this manner, opening <b>366</b> is proximate the location of preload, being laterally adjacent (into the page of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>) along pivot element <b>96</b>. At least one of spring arms <b>92</b> and <b>94</b> are likewise cantilevered forward from spring coil <b>93</b> whereby each of power spring <b>90</b> and lever <b>340</b> are cantilevered forward to the location of preload. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b>-<b>18</b></figref>, both spring arms <b>92</b>, <b>94</b> are so cantilevered.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The second exemplary embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b> to <b>23</b></figref> may provide further reduced friction and increased rigidity over that of the first exemplary embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>6</b></figref>. While the first embodiment is substantially rigid, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>35</b></figref>, the second embodiment has one less component between handle <b>20</b> and power spring <b>90</b>, and thereby fewer pivotal or other connections to introduce flex or free play motions. Lever <b>340</b> is also longer than lever <b>40</b> and therefore rotates through a smaller angle about its rear pivot <b>341</b> to move power spring <b>90</b>. From empirical observations, it is about 12 degrees for the second embodiment versus 20 degrees of pivoting for the first embodiment. With less motion there is less friction at the hinge of the rear pivot.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">A similar effect operates when comparing the central pivots of <b>43</b> and <b>343</b>, respectively. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, lever front opening <b>366</b> rotates in a same direction as spring pivot element <b>96</b> to reduce sliding there between, thereby reducing friction over the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> where link bar <b>60</b> does not substantially pivot along with pivot element <b>96</b>. Whether considering the second embodiment, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b> to <b>23</b></figref>, or the first embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>6</b></figref>, each provides substantial improvements and benefits in function and utility over the prior art, for example, through a rigid linking system as disclosed. According to this rigid linkage system, the lever front end presses the second arm at a lengthwise position substantially closer to the striker than to the spring mandrel center. This pressing occurs at a front end of lever <b>40</b>, seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, or lever <b>340</b>, seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">The second embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b> to <b>23</b></figref> further enjoys simplified assembly. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>19</b> and <b>23</b></figref>, link <b>330</b> is installed at hem <b>332</b> or equivalent structure into slots <b>329</b> of handle link support <b>328</b> while the parts are loose as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b> and <b>21</b></figref>. Link support <b>328</b> is then fastened to handle <b>20</b> by riveting or the like, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>. Link <b>330</b> is thereby pivotally confined on handle <b>20</b>. Hem or top end <b>332</b> presses and pivots against an underside of the handle as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>. This pivoting is minimal, about 4 degrees as shown, so friction is low and slot <b>329</b> can be narrow. With the upper and lower respective assemblies prepared, seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, the handle assembly is lowered into position as shown. Link <b>330</b> is held about at the angle shown to align with the front wall of notch <b>344</b>. Link <b>330</b> is held out of the page in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, and/or lever <b>340</b> pressed in, so that the link may pass beside lever <b>340</b> to assume the position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>. In both <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b> and <b>19</b></figref>, handle <b>20</b> to body pivot <b>27</b> is forward of its final position. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b> and <b>22</b></figref>, tab <b>335</b> of link <b>330</b> can be seen able to enter notch <b>344</b> of lever <b>340</b>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, handle <b>20</b> is then moved rearward to its final position at pivot <b>27</b> as link <b>330</b> rotates to be guided by edge <b>348</b>. Edge <b>348</b> then locks link <b>330</b> laterally, in a notch of the link at tab <b>335</b>, to a pivoting relation on the lever with respect to the side views. Link <b>330</b> holds lever <b>340</b> stable laterally through a triangular geometry &#x201c;T&#x201d;, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>. Hem <b>332</b> presses inside handle <b>20</b> to form a stable base of the triangle. The pivoting is at link hinge <b>333</b> against central lever pivot <b>343</b>, as seen comparing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b> and <b>17</b></figref>. A tensile link between handle <b>20</b> and power spring <b>90</b> operates through link <b>330</b> at slot <b>329</b> and edge <b>348</b> to enable the handle to pull up on the spring and striker in an event of a staple jam or the like.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">Spring arm tip <b>95</b> is preferably on center with respect to a front view to press striker <b>70</b> at its center line, although an off-center alignment can also be functional. Lever <b>340</b> therefore presses spring element <b>96</b> off center at pivot <b>366</b> in a similar position as link bar <b>60</b>; see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> for this analogous position at <b>66</b> in the first embodiment. Lever <b>340</b> is therefore preferably off center, into the page in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, at its three operative pivots <b>341</b>, <b>343</b>, and <b>366</b> to form a stable plane of action. Segment <b>349</b> may be on center, out of the page in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, to keep its optionally exposed portion at a clean joint line of housing <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, latch <b>50</b><i>a </i>operates similarly to latch <b>50</b> as disclosed with the first embodiment. Rear end <b>53</b><i>a </i>selectively contacts handle <b>20</b> to cause the release action. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, link tab <b>322</b> supports latch bias spring <b>130</b> at coil <b>133</b>.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>24</b> to <b>34</b></figref> show an exemplary embodiment staple guide track and loading system preferably used with the first and second embodiment tackers described above while also providing advantage for use with other tacker devices. The subassembly shown provides for bottom loading staples or other fasteners, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>31</b>-<b>33</b></figref>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b></figref>, track <b>180</b> selectively extends rearward to expose staple holding channel <b>128</b>. The track can extend farther wherein track guide tab <b>188</b> contacts stop rib <b>125</b> of track chamber <b>120</b> or equivalent structure. Preferably, the full extension has tabs <b>188</b> at least about 4 inches rearward of front cover <b>12</b> to fit a standard staple rack <b>405</b> of that length. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b></figref>, staple rack <b>405</b> is shown in position to be placed in track chamber <b>120</b>. Rack <b>405</b> is shown as about half standard length corresponding to the partially extended track shown.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">This exemplary embodiment bottom loading system is advantageous over a rear staple insertion system, because bottom loading keeps any staple readily accessible when needed. For example, it is much simpler to clear a staple jam or malfunction because, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b></figref>, the staple channel may be exposed for easy manipulation or extraction of such staples. In contrast, a rear loading system requires dismantling the track subassembly to access any jammed staples at the front of the tool.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">The structure of the present track subassembly is suited for use with a sheet metal bodied tacker, although it is not limited to that application. For example, it may be used with die cast or molded bodied tackers. The preferred embodiment track subassembly includes closely integrated track pull <b>160</b> which de-latches track <b>180</b> from its operative position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>24</b> and <b>31</b></figref>, for example, to its de-latched position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref> through a simple pull rearward. Grasping and pulling track pull <b>160</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b></figref>) causes it to rotate about pivot <b>161</b> against a bias from latch spring <b>140</b>, discussed below, to the position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>25</b> and <b>32</b>A</figref>. Continuing the same pulling action causes track <b>180</b> to move to the extended position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b></figref> while the track pull preferably returns to its normal upright or equivalent position under the latch spring bias. Pushing track pull <b>160</b> inward, to the right in the views, moves track <b>180</b> to its closed, operative position as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b></figref>. The track becomes latched to be retained in position while the track pull remains upright or otherwise in its normal position relative to the track through a latching action.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">The views of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>24</b> and <b>25</b></figref> have track <b>180</b> and track chamber <b>120</b> shown in lengthwise cross-section to expose the internal workings. The latched track condition is seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>24</b> and <b>24</b>A</figref>. Rib <b>184</b> of track <b>180</b> (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b></figref>) engages detent <b>124</b> of track chamber <b>120</b> or equivalent structure (housing <b>10</b>, for example). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>24</b> and <b>28</b></figref>, spring front end <b>146</b> is held on at track support <b>181</b> and held centrally at spring loop <b>143</b> by fulcrum <b>186</b>. See also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b></figref> for fulcrum <b>186</b>. Latch spring <b>140</b> is therefore cantilevered at rear end <b>147</b>. Cantilevered spring rear end <b>147</b> presses downward (upward in the page of the inverted views of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>31</b>-<b>33</b></figref>) on track spring contact tab <b>126</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>. This is beneficial because track <b>180</b> is thus resiliently urged upward relative to the track chamber to press track rib <b>184</b> against detent <b>124</b>. Upward in this context means toward the handle from the track area for any view orientation. Preferably, track pull arm <b>167</b> also contacts spring end <b>147</b> in the fully closed track condition so that the track pull does not rattle.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">Track pull <b>160</b> is pulled rearward to open track <b>180</b> to the position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>33</b>, <b>34</b></figref>. It is natural to squeeze and pull it at sides <b>166</b> or pull the front edge in this area, near part number &#x201c;<b>166</b>&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b>A</figref>. Track pull <b>160</b> rotates about hinge <b>161</b> to the position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>25</b>, <b>25</b>A</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref>, arm <b>167</b> has deflected spring <b>140</b> upward at end <b>147</b>. Pulling outward on track <b>180</b>, indicated by an arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref>, causes a downward bias on the track by a cam action from the angle of detent <b>124</b> and rib <b>184</b>. Spring <b>140</b> does not resist this down motion since the spring is deflected off of tab <b>126</b> by arm <b>167</b>. As a result, track <b>180</b> clears detent <b>124</b> as shown and is free to slide rearward to the position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">It is not required that the track pull rotate to deflect the latch spring. Optionally, the track can be directly pulled down to deflect the spring and clear detent <b>124</b> before pulling out, for example, through a track pull interface that cannot rotate. While this optional structure does function, it requires two steps. In contrast, the preferred track pull <b>160</b> provides an automatic cam action that provides the down motion automatically through a single step of an intuitive outward pull. These features have been demonstrated in a working model.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b>A</figref>, track pull <b>160</b> is positioned laterally by arm edges <b>167</b><i>a </i>within track wall portions <b>185</b>. The track pull is preferably a closely integrated fit to the housing body as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>31</b></figref>. The tool maintains a clean profile in the rear area, being absent any track release access cavity, for example. Track pull <b>160</b> may include or comprise sheet metal, die cast, plastic molded construction, or any combination thereof. In any embodiment, the staple track remains easy to operate by a simple pulling action as discussed.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">As track <b>180</b> is closed, following the arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>B</figref>, latch spring <b>140</b> is deflected by the cam action at detent <b>124</b> and rib <b>184</b><i>b </i>causing the track to move down toward tab <b>126</b>. The tab deflects the spring and moves the spring away from arm <b>167</b>. In this manner track pull <b>160</b> remains, or at least may remain, in its upright position as an operator pushes the track pull in a normal manner. If, for example, the track pull required rotating outward during this motion it would oppose the operator's inward pushing force and would tend to lock up the system. Instead, the track pull remains stable, the action intuitive, and the closing operation ends in a satisfying and positive click.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Latch spring <b>140</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref> may be a simple wire form as shown. As discussed above, front spring end <b>146</b> rests on track support <b>181</b>. Notch <b>186</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b></figref> forms a fulcrum to hold spring loops <b>143</b> whereby spring <b>140</b> is preferably preloaded in its rest condition of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref> to keep the track pull rattle free and to hold the track securely in the closed position. As further seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>24</b>, <b>25</b>, <b>25</b>B</figref>, latch spring <b>140</b> is slightly bent concave upward from the preload so that it is in contact or near contact with both arm <b>167</b> and tab <b>126</b>. Pusher spring <b>200</b> biases staple rack pusher <b>400</b> toward the front of the track, thus urging the staple rack toward the striker.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Pusher spring <b>200</b> is attached in a known manner to pusher <b>400</b>. The rear end of pusher spring <b>200</b> is preferably fitted to latch spring <b>140</b> at loop <b>202</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref>. To install the latch spring to the track, track spring <b>140</b> is inserted to loop <b>202</b> and then guided by grasping pusher spring <b>200</b>. Latch spring <b>140</b> is pressed into the channel of track <b>180</b> to deflect the cantilevered arms of spring <b>140</b> toward each other. When loops <b>143</b> are aligned with notches <b>186</b>, the latch spring snaps into position. This has been demonstrated in a working model. A pulley at recess <b>189</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b></figref>) may guide the pusher spring at front. Recess <b>189</b> forms an upward facing edge to support a shaft of the pulley in the track channel. In this manner, the pulley can be installed from top into the channel to rest on the edges of recess <b>189</b> rather than being installed from a side.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">In track <b>180</b>, notches <b>182</b> provide clearance for stop ribs <b>125</b> as the track is deflected downward, this being up on the page in the inverted tool view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b></figref>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b></figref>, stop ribs <b>125</b> have entered notches <b>182</b>. Similar clearance is created at notches <b>183</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b>A</figref>) to clear spring contact tab <b>126</b> as the track pull is deflected. Notches <b>182</b> and <b>183</b> preferably include a ramp at the front as shown so that ribs <b>125</b> and tabs <b>126</b> are guided out of the notch as the track moves outward.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">In a front most position track foot <b>187</b> contacts stop edge <b>123</b><i>a</i>, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>29</b> to <b>32</b></figref>. Preferably, this contact is configured to hold pressure at the cam contact area of rib <b>184</b> and detent <b>124</b>, i.e., the rear cam feature presses foot <b>187</b> against edge <b>123</b><i>a</i>. Track chamber tab <b>127</b><i>a </i>engages an opening of front cover <b>12</b> to hold a position of the track chamber at front, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>127</b><i>a</i></figref>. At rear the chamber is held to the housing by a fastener in hole <b>127</b>. Side channels <b>122</b> of the track chamber guide track feet <b>187</b>. At the rear end of the track, tabs <b>187</b><i>a </i>preferably fold across the track and may be spot welded or the like to reinforce the track structure. Ribs <b>125</b> and tabs <b>126</b> are formed as part of track chamber <b>120</b>. The features of the track chamber may instead be formed from a structure of housing <b>10</b>, for example, a sheet metal tab of the housing and the like for a steel housing.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">Staples are normally and properly installed into bottom-positioned staple channel <b>128</b>, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b></figref>. However, it is possible that an operator may attempt to load the staples from top onto the exposed track of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>34</b></figref>. In particular, if the staples are able to enter the housing or tool interior on the track from here, an operator may reasonably assume it is supposed to function this way. Of course, it cannot, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref>; the staples would be rearward of pusher <b>400</b> with no way to reach the front of the track for use. Negative user reviews of products that have this defect affirm this issue.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">To address improper staple loading, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>34</b></figref>, there is an optional staple blocker <b>16</b> that protrudes into the channel of track <b>180</b>. It is an element of housing <b>10</b> although other structures are contemplated. Also, it is both physically and visually clear to the user that installing staples from the rear is impossible, and the reason is readily seen. Installing this way is clearly improper, informing the user that the staples &#x201c;go somewhere else&#x201d; upon which the bottom staple channel is readily discovered. A blocking tab of the housing, or track chamber, may extend inward from a side to abut the outer side face of track <b>180</b> in this area. This is seen as tab <b>16</b><i>a </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>34</b></figref>. It is preferable that a blocker be visible at the tool exterior so that there is no ambiguity to the staple exclusion. Further, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>34</b></figref> shows optional track tab <b>184</b><i>a</i>. Track tab <b>184</b><i>a </i>extends outward whereby a staple rack cannot fit upon or past it. In the case of a full 4-inch staple rack, tab <b>184</b><i>a </i>makes it obviously impossible to place staples on the track from this direction. A shorter rack such as 2 inches may fit in the track portion in front of tabs <b>184</b><i>a</i>, but with tabs <b>184</b><i>a </i>and 16 collectively making placement here clearly impractical, the message to the user to look elsewhere in reinforced.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">While the particular forms of the invention have been illustrated and described, it will be apparent that various modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
