id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">Systems and methods are provided for authentication of a device via a mobile application. The systems and methods are related to any apparatus or device requiring security, and more particularly, but not exclusively, to a biomedical device.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Biomedical devices and other therapeutic apparatuses often require user authentication in order to access and use the machines. The devices deliver life-giving or life-supporting therapy to treat diseases or otherwise improve the functioning of the human body. One example of a medical treatment that may be provided by a medical device is dialysis. The devices usually contain sensitive and private medical and health data. Administration of the wrong treatment, or administration of an unauthorized treatment, can have catastrophic life-threatening and legal consequences. To limit access to authorized users, the available systems and methods rely on authentication hardware, tokens, or other custom components such as a radio frequency identification (RFID) card. However, hardware, tokens or other components can be lost and are inconvenient to carry around. Also, the existing systems and methods sometimes require typing in a complicated password.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">As such, there is need for quickly and easily providing secured access to patients, doctors, nurses, device administrators, and other authorized persons of a medical device. The need includes authenticating the right people to perform the right operations on the machine at the right time. The need includes configuring the machine, authorizing treatment, setting up treatment parameters, loading data, and administering the treatment using a simple and commonly available device that does not impose additional burdens on a user. The need includes providing a common authentication mechanism that avoids the need for a traditional username/password combination, a hardware token (such as a USB thumb drive with a hardware and/or software key, or an RFID card), biometric authentication, or two-factor authentication. The need includes confirming that a user is authorized to use the machine. The need still further includes loading a correct patient profile with correct information, so that the correct treatment is administered.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The first aspect relates to a system.

In this context, patient <b>104</b> may need to authenticate and/or provide data to a medical device. In any embodiment, the medical device ecosystem <b>100</b> can be used to authenticate a patient using a medical device such as a heart-lung machine, CPAP machine, insulin pump, neural stimulator, sleep monitor, intravenous (IV) drug machine, or others medical devices. In one nonlimiting embodiment, the medical device ecosystem <b>100</b> can be used to authenticate a user of a hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis machine that removes toxins such as urea from a patient. In any embodiment, the medical device ecosystem <b>100</b> can be used to authenticate a device, including but not limited to a biomedical device, using a mobile device.

Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts a hemodialysis machine, any machine performing a type of dialysis such as peritoneal dialysis, hemodiafiltration, and ultrafiltration can be used. GUI <b>112</b> can permit patient <b>104</b> to interact with the machine <b>108</b>, (as depicted in this particular non-limiting embodiment) and provide inputs and view outputs. In some cases, GUI <b>112</b> can include a touch-sensitive display, so that patient <b>104</b> can directly interact with GUI <b>112</b>, via the display. The machine <b>108</b> can include various sensors that provide feedback to monitor the success and safety of the dialysis operation. For example, a real-time blood pressure monitoring circuit (RT BP MON) <b>114</b> can be provided, so that the patient's blood pressure can be monitored in real-time, or near real-time, and so that the system can detect whether the patient's blood pressure drops dangerously low. Machine <b>108</b> can require authentication for certain modes of operation. For example, machine <b>108</b> could provide an administrative mode, in which a system administrator can configure the machine. This can require unrestricted access to machine <b>108</b>.

This instant authentication can be facilitated by a mobile application running on mobile device <b>105</b>, which can be provided, for example, by a vendor of machine <b>108</b>.

For example, a smart scale <b>116</b> could be used to measure the patient's dry weight, and/or the patient's weight after dialysis.

A cloud data service <b>132</b> can communicatively couple to home gateway <b>120</b> via internet <b>124</b>, and can provide services to patient <b>104</b>. The home gateway <b>120</b> can provide for communication between the home gateway <b>120</b> and a cloud data service <b>132</b>. The cloud data service <b>132</b> can have various software modules to connect to the home gateway <b>120</b>. Notably, the cloud data service <b>132</b> can establish a data communication channel with the home gateway <b>120</b> through a TCP/IP protocol or other suitable process, where a terminal is connected to the home gateway <b>120</b>. The home gateway <b>120</b> software can send a first software message to the cloud data service <b>132</b> through the data communication channel so that the home gateway <b>120</b> establishes connection with cloud data service <b>132</b>.

This simple one-touch authentication advantageously uses a device that patient <b>204</b> or healthcare professional <b>210</b> can already have.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">In this example, within the clinic there can be an enterprise gateway <b>220</b>, which provides connectivity between various devices. Similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, enterprise gateway <b>220</b> connects either via an intranet or via the internet to cloud data service <b>240</b>. Enterprise gateway <b>220</b> can also provide connections to a lab terminal <b>238</b> and a doctor terminal <b>236</b>. A physician can use doctor terminal <b>236</b> to input parameters, such as a treatment prescription and other recommendations. Lab terminal <b>238</b> can provide lab results, as well as access to electronic health records (EHR) and other data. Cloud data service <b>240</b> can be configured to collect and store various inputs. Other inputs can be collected via smart devices around the clinic, such as a smart scale <b>224</b>, a blood pressure kit <b>228</b>, and a pulse oximeter <b>232</b>, by way of illustrative and nonlimiting example. As before, these devices, along with machine <b>208</b>, can communicatively couple to enterprise gateway <b>220</b> via a wired or wireless network. Thus, while healthcare professional <b>210</b> is administering treatment to patient <b>204</b> via machine <b>208</b>, healthcare professional <b>210</b> can operate GUI <b>212</b> to select treatment options. As before, a real-time or near real-time blood pressure monitoring circuit <b>214</b> can be provided on machine <b>208</b>, and can monitor patient <b>204</b> to ensure that patient <b>204</b>'s blood pressure does not drop below a danger threshold.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In embodiments, devices can be enrolled by the health care provider, and can be associated with individual users, such as patient <b>204</b> or healthcare professional <b>210</b>. Enterprise gateway <b>220</b> can provide (or communicate with) a cloud service, which optionally can maintain communicative contact with machine <b>208</b>. This allows the healthcare provider to enroll, revoke, authorize, or otherwise manage authorized users and devices. This is different from, for example, a more traditional consumer solution where the end user &#x201c;owns&#x201d; his or her own credentials.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Enrollment can authorize the patient <b>204</b> or healthcare professional <b>210</b> to use a particular device for therapy, as well as authorizing individual users (via their associated mobile devices) to perform given functions. For example, patient <b>204</b> can be authorized to administer (including self-administer) treatment via an authorized device <b>208</b>, whereas healthcare professionals <b>210</b> or administrators can be authorized to perform other functions, as further illustrated in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b</i></figref>. In any embodiment, authentication can provide mutual assurance. For example, not only can the patient <b>204</b> or healthcare professional <b>210</b> can be an authorized user, but also the machine <b>208</b> can be authorized as the correct device (e.g., programmed with the correct prescription and/or other treatment parameters). Thus, enrollment can include either the machine <b>208</b> and the device <b>208</b>, or both, receiving from enterprise gateway <b>220</b> (or some other cloud service) authentication data that associate a user with an authorized mobile device <b>205</b> that can be used to identify the user. Machine <b>208</b> can also receive (during enrollment, or at some other time) a patient profile, including treatment parameters for patient <b>204</b>. When mobile device <b>205</b> is brought into operational contact with machine <b>208</b>, machine <b>208</b> can also authenticate mobile device <b>205</b>, determine which user is associated with mobile device <b>205</b>, ensure that machine <b>208</b> is the correct device for that user (e.g., by ensuring that machine <b>208</b> includes a profile for patient <b>204</b>), and then unlock certain functions or features if the authentication is successful.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">In any embodiment, device <b>205</b> can also help prevent medical errors, by ensuring that the correct patient is being treated. For example, healthcare professional <b>210</b> can go through discrete or separate enrollments on a per-patient basis. Authentication can then include healthcare professional <b>210</b> accessing a particular patient-specific screen or mode within mobile device <b>205</b>, tablet of any other suitable hand-held device. This can be done, for example, by using a camera or infrared scanner to scan a bar code on a wrist band worn by patient <b>204</b>. This can place mobile device <b>205</b> in a mode where providing an authentication code that is specific to the combination of patient <b>204</b> and medical professional <b>210</b>. When machine <b>208</b> authenticates mobile device <b>205</b>, device <b>205</b> can thus authenticate not only healthcare professional <b>210</b>, but can also provide a contextual authentication that is unique to the treatment context (e.g., unique to the patient being treated). Device <b>205</b> can then ensure that it has a profile loaded for patient <b>204</b>, and that healthcare professional <b>210</b> is authorized to treat patient <b>204</b> on machine <b>208</b>. This can be superior to a more generic authentication that merely determines that healthcare professional <b>210</b> is authorized to use machine <b>208</b>.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Authentication Via Mobile Device</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b </i></figref>are a flowchart of a method <b>300</b> for operating a mobile device according to the system of this specification.

The medical device then cryptographically verifies this key or token, for example, using a previously provisioned certificate on the medical device.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">In decision block <b>420</b>, the medical device determines whether authentication was successful, and if so, in block <b>490</b>, access is granted.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">If authentication was unsuccessful, then this could mean that the device is an unauthorized device, and there will be no authentication. Alternatively, it's possible that the device is authentic, but that some other issue has prevented authentication. Thus, in block <b>424</b>, the user can verify the user credentials, and in block <b>428</b>, the user can verify that the NFC transceiver for the mobile device is turned on. After performing these checks, the user can again attempt authentication in block <b>416</b>.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a block diagram of selected elements of authentication ecosystem. The authentication ecosystem includes a medical device <b>502</b>, to which a user can authenticate via a mobile device <b>522</b>. A network <b>540</b> connects medical device <b>502</b> and/or mobile device <b>522</b> to certain cloud-based services, such as a cloud service <b>544</b>, and a CA <b>538</b>.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">In this illustrative example, medical device <b>502</b> includes a processor <b>504</b> and a memory <b>508</b>. Processor <b>504</b> and memory <b>508</b> together provide a hardware platform on which software can run. This can include software for authenticating the user, for controlling and configuring the device, for controlling access to the device, for providing a plurality of modes, and for performing other functions.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">Medical device <b>502</b> includes a medical apparatus <b>512</b>, which provides a medical function such as, by way of illustrative and nonlimiting example, a dialysis machine, an insulin pump, a sleep apnea machine, a pulse oximeter, an external neural simulator, and intravenous device, a noninvasive blood measurement device, a smart thermometer, or other home healthcare or clinic-based medical apparatus.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">Network circuit <b>520</b> provides the hardware, software, and/or firmware to communicatively couple medical device <b>502</b> to a network <b>540</b>. Network circuit <b>520</b> could provide a wired network such as an ethernet, a wireless network such as WiFi, or some other communication protocol such as USB, FireWire, or other.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">Medical device <b>502</b> includes a transceiver <b>516</b>, which can provide local communication via for example WiFi, RF, BTLE, or other. Transceiver <b>516</b> enables medical device <b>502</b> to make a local connection <b>518</b> to mobile device <b>522</b>.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">Mole device <b>522</b> includes a processor <b>532</b> and memory <b>536</b>, which can be used to provide a hardware platform for executing software. A transceiver <b>524</b> allows mobile device <b>522</b> to make a local connection <b>518</b> to transceiver <b>516</b> of medical device <b>502</b>. Mobile device <b>522</b> includes a network circuit <b>528</b>, which allows mobile device <b>522</b> to communicatively couple to network <b>540</b>.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">In some cases, cloud service <b>544</b> provides centralized credentials for users, including their associated mobile devices such as mobile device <b>522</b>. Cloud service <b>544</b> can push authentication data to medical device <b>502</b>, including providing definitions for a plurality of modes. When a user uses mobile device <b>522</b> to authenticate to medical device <b>502</b>, medical device <b>502</b> can authenticate the mobile device, and then grant access to one or more functions of the medical device if authentication is successful. The one or more functions could include, by way of illustrative and nonlimiting example, initiating a dialysis session, modifying treatment parameters, accessing a function of the medical apparatus, accessing administrative functions of the medical device, accessing a treatment history, retrieving one or more patient alerts, communicating with the patient associated with medical device, communicating with the healthcare professional, or configuring device settings.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">Alternatively, if authentication fails, then medical device <b>502</b> can deny access to the one or more functions of the medical device.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">In some embodiments, medical device <b>502</b> can determine that mobile device <b>522</b> is associated with a patient of the medical apparatus, and can retrieve one or more stored treatment parameters for the patient. The treatment parameters can include, by way of illustrative and nonlimiting example, treatment time, blood flow rate, dialysis flow rate, sodium prescription, bicarbonate prescription, magnesium prescription, calcium prescription, potassium prescription, glucose prescription, ultrafiltration rate, and/or patient dry weight. For an intravenous device, the parameters could include, for example, intravenous device type, indicated intravenous drug, drug dose, and drug delivery flow rate.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">Medical device <b>502</b> could retrieve these parameters from a local database, or could query cloud service <b>544</b> for the treatment parameters. In another embodiment, particularly if medical device <b>502</b> lacks always-on network connectivity, medical device <b>502</b> could query mobile device <b>522</b> via local connection <b>518</b> for the parameters. Mobile device <b>522</b> could retrieve the treatment parameters from a local database, or from cloud service <b>544</b>.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">Authentication via mobile device <b>522</b> can be managed by cloud service <b>544</b>, and also via CA <b>538</b>. Certificate authority (CA) <b>538</b> can be any trusted certificate authority, which could be a well-known certificate authority that is publicly trusted, or a CA that has established a private trust with cloud service <b>544</b>, such as a certificate authority operated by cloud service <b>544</b> specifically for the benefit of medical device <b>502</b> or a class of medical devices similar to medical device <b>502</b>.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">Cloud service <b>544</b> can instruct medical device <b>502</b> to authorize certain mobile devices, or to not authorize other mobile devices. This authorization could include an expiry, which can in some cases be enforced by a certificate with its own expiry. For example, CA <b>538</b> can issue a certificate to mobile device <b>522</b>, which certificate can have an expiration date. CA <b>538</b> can also issue validation data to medical device <b>502</b>, such as information necessary to authenticate the certificate provided by mobile device <b>522</b>. Thus, when mobile device <b>522</b> authenticates to medical device <b>502</b>, mobile device <b>522</b> can be authenticated only after providing a valid certificate and the certificate has not expired. Furthermore, cloud service <b>544</b> can define an authorized access level associated with mobile device <b>522</b>, or more particularly for a user associated with mobile device <b>522</b>. For example, if mobile device <b>522</b> is owned by an administrative user, then cloud service <b>544</b> can instruct mobile device <b>502</b> via network <b>540</b> to authorize administrative access after medical device <b>502</b> has authenticated mobile device <b>522</b>. Because such administrative access can be both powerful and dangerous, the authorization can include an expiration date.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">In some cases, medical device <b>502</b> can receive authorization credentials from cloud service <b>544</b>, and store a local database of authorized users or devices, including authorized access levels for those authorized users and devices. Furthermore, medical device <b>502</b> can receive from cloud service <b>544</b> instructions to revoke authorization of a mobile device, and thereafter cease authenticated authenticating the revoked mobile device.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">One skilled in the art will understand that various combinations and/or modifications and variations can be made in the described systems and methods depending upon the specific needs for operation.
