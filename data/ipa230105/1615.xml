confirming the dispersion state of PTFE in the fluoroelastomer layer is not limited, but in Examples and Comparative Examples of the present disclosure, the dispersion state of PTFE was confirmed by specifying the cross-section of PTFE shown in an electronic micrograph with reference to element mapping images of carbon elements and fluorine elements (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>B and <b>2</b>B</figref>) and observing the cross-section. Since the content of the carbon element in the PTFE is lower than the content of the carbon element in the fluoroelastomer used in the Examples and the Comparative Examples, and the content of the fluorine element in the PTFE is higher than the content of the fluorine element of the fluoroelastomer used in the Examples and the Comparative Examples, a region where the carbon element is distributed less than other regions and the fluorine element is distributed more than other regions in the element mapping image can be specified as the cross-section of the PTFE dispersed in the fluoroelastomer layer. A scanning electron microscope SU 8020 (manufactured by Hitachi High-Tech Corporation) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray analyzer (EDS) was used to acquire electron micrographs and element mapping images.</p><p id="p-0330" num="0315">As shown in the electron micrographs of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, the fluoroelastomer sheet produced in Example 2 contains PTFE <b>10</b> dispersed in the fluoroelastomer, and when the cross-section of the PTFE <b>10</b> is observed, it can be seen that the particles are single particles. As shown in the electron micrographs of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>, PTFE <b>20</b> dispersed in the fluoroelastomer was observed in the fluoroelastomer sheet produced in Comparative Example 1 as in the fluoroelastomer sheet produced in Example 2. However, when the cross-section of the PTFE <b>20</b> in the fluoroelastomer is observed, a large number of fine particles bonded to each other via elongated branches can be confirmed. In addition, it can be seen that the fluoroelastomer sheet of Example 2 in which PTFE <b>10</b> is dispersed in the state of single particles in the fluoroelastomer has a very low shrinkage rate of the fluoroelastomer sheet during crosslinking as compared with the fluoroelastomer sheet of Comparative Example 1 in which PTFE <b>20</b> is dispersed such that a large number of fine particles form one lump in the fluoroelastomer.</p><p id="p-0331" num="0316">Furthermore, also in Examples other than Example 2, it was confirmed that PTFE was dispersed in a state of single particles in the fluoroelastomer as in Example 2. It can be seen that the fluoroelastomer sheet of each Example has a very low shrinkage rate during crosslinking as compared with the fluoroelastomer sheet of each Comparative Example.</p><p id="p-0332" num="0317">From the above results, it can be seen that by dispersing PTFE in the state of single particles in the fluoroelastomer layer, it is possible to provide a laminate in which the polymer layer and the fluoroelastomer layer are adhered to each other with sufficient adhesive strength and the shrinkage of the fluoroelastomer layer during crosslinking of the fluoroelastomer can be suppressed.</p><p id="p-0333" num="0318">In addition, from the above results, it can be seen that by dispersing PTFE in the state of single particles in the fluoroelastomer layer, it is possible to provide an extruded article capable of suppressing shrinkage during crosslinking.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00001" cdx-file="US20230001616A1-20230105-C00001.CDX" mol-file="US20230001616A1-20230105-C00001.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00002" cdx-file="US20230001616A1-20230105-C00002.CDX" mol-file="US20230001616A1-20230105-C00002.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00003" cdx-file="US20230001616A1-20230105-C00003.CDX" mol-file="US20230001616A1-20230105-C00003.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00004" cdx-file="US20230001616A1-20230105-C00004.CDX" mol-file="US20230001616A1-20230105-C00004.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00005" cdx-file="US20230001616A1-20230105-C00005.CDX" mol-file="US20230001616A1-20230105-C00005.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00006" cdx-file="US20230001616A1-20230105-C00006.CDX" mol-file="US20230001616A1-20230105-C00006.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00007" cdx-file="US20230001616A1-20230105-C00007.CDX" mol-file="US20230001616A1-20230105-C00007.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00008" cdx-file="US20230001616A1-20230105-C00008.CDX" mol-file="US20230001616A1-20230105-C00008.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00009" cdx-file="US20230001616A1-20230105-C00009.CDX" mol-file="US20230001616A1-20230105-C00009.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00010" cdx-file="US20230001616A1-20230105-C00010.CDX" mol-file="US20230001616A1-20230105-C00010.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00011" cdx-file="US20230001616A1-20230105-C00011.CDX" mol-file="US20230001616A1-20230105-C00011.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00012" cdx-file="US20230001616A1-20230105-C00012.CDX" mol-file="US20230001616A1-20230105-C00012.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00013" cdx-file="US20230001616A1-20230105-C00013.CDX" mol-file="US20230001616A1-20230105-C00013.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00014" cdx-file="US20230001616A1-20230105-C00014.CDX" mol-file="US20230001616A1-20230105-C00014.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00015" cdx-file="US20230001616A1-20230105-C00015.CDX" mol-file="US20230001616A1-20230105-C00015.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00016" cdx-file="US20230001616A1-20230105-C00016.CDX" mol-file="US20230001616A1-20230105-C00016.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00017" cdx-file="US20230001616A1-20230105-C00017.CDX" mol-file="US20230001616A1-20230105-C00017.MOL"/><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
