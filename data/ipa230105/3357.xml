The reverse guide lamp of the reverse guide lamp and the turn signal lamp is turned on with a reverse lamp, the light emitted from the reverse guide lamp is projected onto the road surface positioned in back of a host vehicle to deliver the intention of a driver to back up the vehicle, to a surrounding vehicle and a pedestrian, and a forward direction of the vehicle is notified to another vehicle, thereby preventing an accident in advance.

Accordingly, light sources are required in number corresponding to the number of the patterns to be realized. Accordingly, costs are increased, and a weight is increased.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Further, in the imaging optical system employing the guide lamp, an amount of light is decreased farther away from the central portion of the optical axis. Accordingly, it is difficult to ensure an amount of light in the longer-distance pattern. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, when the beam pattern <b>4</b> includes a plurality of patterns <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, and <b>7</b>, an amount of light is more degraded at a longer distance, such that an image of the longer-distance pattern <b>5</b> is not cleared.
