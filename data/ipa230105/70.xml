FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application relates to a method for freezing cell aggregates including neural cells.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Transplantation of dopamine-producing (DA) neurons has been considered as a promising therapeutic method for Parkinson's disease (PD) based on reports on clinical trials using fetal mesencephalic cells (Non Patent Literature 1). In addition, a method for inducing differentiation of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) such as embryonic stem cells (ES cells or ESCs) or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells or iPSCs) into dopamine-producing neurons, or progenitor cells thereof has been reported. The group of the present inventors has already reported a method for preparing dopamine-producing neurons, or dopamine-producing neuron progenitor cells from human induced pluripotent stem cells (Non Patent Literature 2). Other groups have also reported preparation of PSC-derived dopamine-producing nerves (Non Patent Literatures 3 and 4).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">For drugs having cells as active ingredients, cryopreservation of a final product is an essential element for the dissemination of cell therapies (Patent Literatures 1 to 4). Unlike cell biology research, it is preferable that cryopreserved cells, when used in clinical practice, be transplanted immediately after thawing without recovery culture. Therefore, it is important for frozen cells to maintain their engraftment capacity, function or activity, and cell viability after thawing.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It has been suggested that transplantation of solid tissue induces a stronger immune response than transplantation of cell suspension because of the remaining donor blood vessels and antigen-presenting cells (Non Patent Literature 5). On the other hand, if the immune response is suppressed by isogeneic transplantation or an immunosuppressive agent, this problem is eliminated, and transplantation of ventral midbrain (VM) tissue shows dopamine-producing nerves having a higher survival rate and behavioral recovery than transplantation of cell suspension (Non Patent Literature 6). In addition, mechanical and enzymatic dissociation processes to obtain a cell suspension can alter cell properties to cause cell injury. Therefore, in clinical applications, it is desirable that cells to be transplanted should be administered as a sphere rather than a cell suspension. However, spheres are more difficult to cryopreserve than single cells.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">When cryopreserved PSC-derived dopamine-producing nerves as a single cell suspension is transplanted into rat corpus striatum, the survival ratio of TH<sup>+</sup> cells is reduced to about 60% compared to unfrozen cells (Non Patent Literature 7). On the other hand, in most researches with human or rat ventral midbrain (VM) tissue cryopreserved, the dopamine-producing nerves in vivo have a survival rate reduced to less than 20% compared to unfrozen tissue (Non Patent Literatures 8 to 10). Therefore, there has been a need to develop a freezing method that can maintain the survival of a PSC-derived dopamine-producing neuron sphere.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In general, there are two cell cryopreservation methods (Non Patent Literatures 11 to 13). The slow cooling method of these methods is a method in which cells are frozen together with a low concentration of cryoprotectant (CPA) (such as 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)) at about 1&#xb0; C./min (Patent Literature 5, Non Patent Literatures 14 and 15). On the other hand, the vitrification method is an ultra-fast cooling method in which cells are transferred into liquid nitrogen immediately after a high concentration of cryoprotectant is added (Patent Literature 6, Non Patent Literature 16). Since the vitrification method requires strict time control, its application to clinical cell production has been technically difficult (Non Patent Literature 17).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the slow cooling method, on the other hand, ice formation begins first in the extracellular space, leading to the concentration of extracellular fluid. As a result, water is withdrawn from the cells by an osmotic gradient across the cell membrane. This dehydration of the cells avoids intracellular ice formation. However, if cells are excessively dehydrated, they are injured by the concentrated intracellular fluid and by the CPA in the cryopreservation solution. Because of the need for precise control of ice formation and cell dehydration, no clinical cryopreservation method for a sphere has been established.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0008">[Patent Literature 1]</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0009">JP2017-104061A</li>    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0010">[Patent Literature 2]</li>    <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0011">WO2017/159862</li>    <li id="ul0001-0005" num="0012">[Patent Literature 3]</li>    <li id="ul0001-0006" num="0013">JP2015-521469A</li>    <li id="ul0001-0007" num="0014">[Patent Literature 4]</li>    <li id="ul0001-0008" num="0015">JP2008-501320A</li>    <li id="ul0001-0009" num="0016">[Patent Literature 5]</li>    <li id="ul0001-0010" num="0017">JP2011-103885A</li>    <li id="ul0001-0011" num="0018">[Patent Literature 6]</li>    <li id="ul0001-0012" num="0019">JP2013-110988A</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Non Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0000"><ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0020">[Non Patent Literature 1]</li>    <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0021">Piccini et al; Nature Neuroscience, 2(12), 1137-1140, 1999</li>    <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0022">[Non Patent Literature 2]</li>    <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0023">Doi et al., Stem Cell Reports, 2(3), 337-350, 2014</li>    <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0024">[Non Patent Literature 3]</li>    <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0025">Sundberg et al., Stem Cells 31, 1548-1562, 2013</li>    <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0026">[Non Patent Literature 4]</li>    <li id="ul0002-0008" num="0027">Nolbrant et al., Nature Protocols, 12(9), 1962-1979, 2017</li>    <li id="ul0002-0009" num="0028">[Non Patent Literature 5]</li>    <li id="ul0002-0010" num="0029">Redmond et al., Neurobiology of Disease, 29(1), 103-116, 2008</li>    <li id="ul0002-0011" num="0030">[Non Patent Literature 6]</li>    <li id="ul0002-0012" num="0031">Fricker et al., PLoS ONE, 7(10), e47169, 2012</li>    <li id="ul0002-0013" num="0032">[Non Patent Literature 7]</li>    <li id="ul0002-0014" num="0033">Nolbrant et al., Nature Protocols, 12(9), 1962-1979, 2017</li>    <li id="ul0002-0015" num="0034">[Non Patent Literature 8]</li>    <li id="ul0002-0016" num="0035">Frodl et al., Brain Research, 647(2), 286-298, 1994</li>    <li id="ul0002-0017" num="0036">[Non Patent Literature 9]</li>    <li id="ul0002-0018" num="0037">Sautter et al., Journal of Neuroscience Methods, 64(2), 173-179, 1996</li>    <li id="ul0002-0019" num="0038">[Non Patent Literature 10]</li>    <li id="ul0002-0020" num="0039">Sautter et al., Experimental Neurology, 164(1), 121-129, 2000</li>    <li id="ul0002-0021" num="0040">[Non Patent Literature 11]</li>    <li id="ul0002-0022" num="0041">Chong et al., Stem Cells, 27(1), 29-39, 2009</li>    <li id="ul0002-0023" num="0042">[Non Patent Literature 12]</li>    <li id="ul0002-0024" num="0043">Smith et al., Fertility and Sterility, 94(6), 2088-2095, 2010</li>    <li id="ul0002-0025" num="0044">[Non Patent Literature 13]</li>    <li id="ul0002-0026" num="0045">Jang et al., Integrative Medicine Research, 6(1), 12-18, 2017</li>    <li id="ul0002-0027" num="0046">[Non Patent Literature 14]</li>    <li id="ul0002-0028" num="0047">Schwartz et al., Journal of Neuroscience Research, 74(6), 838-851, 2003</li>    <li id="ul0002-0029" num="0048">[Non Patent Literature 15]</li>    <li id="ul0002-0030" num="0049">Woods et al., Cryobiology, 59(2), 150-157, 2009</li>    <li id="ul0002-0031" num="0050">[Non Patent Literature 16]</li>    <li id="ul0002-0032" num="0051">Fahy and Wowk., Methods in Molecular Biology (Methods and Protocols), vol 1257.

It has been reported that number of cells reduces after thawing due to necrosis and subsequent persistence of delayed apoptosis and delayed necrosis (Milosevic et al., 2005). It is known that the proliferative capacity begins to recover during this process and number of cells bottoms out about 24 to 48 hours after thawing (Malpique et al., 2010; Mitchell et al., 2014; Baust et al., 2017). It has also been reported that neurotoxic compounds or diseases related to genetic aberration can cause neurite abnormality (Radio et al., 2008; Reinhardt et al., 2013; Ryan et al., 2016). These phenomena suggest that neurite morphology is a good indicator of characteristics of a neuron. Therefore, the recovery rate of viable cells one day after thawing was evaluated as cell viability, and also the area of neurite extension was examined as a new functional evaluation. The results are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0245">In all cryopreservation solutions, the cell viability and neurite extension significantly reduced after freezing (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>).

Bambanker hRM (BBK) and Synth-a-Freeze (SaF) showed a tendency of relatively greater neurite extension than the other freezing conditions (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>). 8&#xb1;17%, 50&#xb1;43%, and 13&#xb1;25% of the spheres did not adhere to the plate in the SCB DMSO free condition, CS5 condition, and CryoStor CS10 condition, respectively. Since BBK was already registered in the Drug Master File in Japan, BBK was used in following experiments.</p><heading id="h-0035" level="2">(2) Effects of Intermediate Speed Cooling and Suppression of Supercooling</heading><p id="p-0213" num="0246">The unsorted spheres in BBK were then cryopreserved using six different protocols. The temperature profile for each protocol is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. In addition, a shock cooling method having a process of transient temperature drop (Morris and Acton., 2013) was also examined in order to verify the effect of controlling ice nucleation and latent heat at the freezing point. Proton freezers have the distinctive cooling profile in addition to magnetic field and electromagnetic waves. Proton freezers cool a sample from &#x2212;4&#xb0; C. to &#x2212;30&#xb0; C. at about 5&#xb0; C./min without supercooling. This cooling rate is intermediate between the conventional slow cooling method and the vitrification method. Specifically, in the case of cooling in a proton freezer, the sample in the chamber is cooled at about 2 to 7&#xb0; C./rain as an actual value.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0247">The conditions of the proton freezer and 0.5&#xb0; C./min and 1&#xb0; C./min without shock cooling process resulted in relatively higher cell viability than the other conditions (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>). In particular, the conditions of the proton freezer and 0.5&#xb0; C./min showed about 80% cell viability compared to unfrozen cells. Also, the proton freezer showed significantly greater neurite extension than the other freezing conditions, except for the condition of 1&#xb0; C./min with the shock cooling process, which was about 60% extension compared to that of the unfrozen cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>). These results demonstrate the maintenance of cellular functions in the condition of the proton freezer. When the time for immersion in the cryoprotectant before freezing was extended to 1 hour, good results for cell viability and neurite extension was obtained under the proton freezer condition as in the case of the immersion time of 15 minutes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A</figref> and B). In addition, the cell viability was reduced under the condition of 0.5&#xb0; C./min, but no significant differences were observed for cell viability or neurite extension under the other conditions (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref>).

A total of 21,882 probe sets containing significant signals were used for the analysis. The PC1 and PC2 contributions were 48.0% and 15.7%, respectively. PC score plots were clustered into three main groups (day 0 (iPSC), day 12, and after day 28) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>H</figref>). The PCA plots for both unfrozen samples and cryopreserved samples shifted in the positive direction on the PC1 and PC2 axes, regardless of cryopreservation on day 28 and after day 28.

Twenty four weeks after the transplantation, abnormal rotations were reduced in both of the groups (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>). Immunofluorescent staining at 24 weeks confirmed cell engraftment in all rats that showed behavioral recovery. 55996&#xb1;3603 HNA<sup>+</sup> cells were survived in the graft derived from the unfrozen spheres, and 36486&#xb1;3578 HNA<sup>+</sup> cells were survived in the graft derived from the cryopreserved spheres (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>B</figref>, C).
