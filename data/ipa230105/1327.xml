In particular, the present disclosure relates to a modified column where the cross-sectional area of the column increases in an area near the end of the column in a flared manner.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Expanded Bed Adsorption (EBA) is a chromatographic process where desired proteins are purified from feed material. A column containing adsorbent particles is expanded by applying an upward liquid flow to the column such that a stable fluidized bed is formed with the adsorbent particles suspended in equilibrium between the particle sediment velocity and upward liquid flow velocity. Feed material is applied to the expanded bed and target proteins bind to the adsorbent while cell debris, cells and contaminants pass through.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Simulated Moving Bed (SMB) chromatography is a chromatographic technique based on a flow of liquid (mobile phase) moving countercurrent to a constant flow of solid (stationary phase). Countercurrent flow increases the potential for the separation thereby enhancing the efficiency of the process compared to traditional batch chromatography. It also allows a continuous flow of feed material to be separated. As a result, large quantities of highly purified material can be produced at a significantly reduced cost.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Traditional EBA columns, which require manual operation, including raising and lower the outlet collector as the height of the fluidized bed moves up and down to avoid the particles exiting the column, can be difficult to use in a continuous SMB process. An improved version of an EBA column which can be used, for example, in a continuous SMB process is desired.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A modified chromatography column having a variable cross-sectional area has been developed. The column may be used in an Expanded Bed Adsorption (EBA) and/or a Simulated Moving Bed (SMB) chromatography process.

Columns</heading><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the field of Expanded Bed Adsorption (EBA) chromatography, chromatographic media may be sensitive to linear flow velocity. In particular, as the chromatographic media expands (increases in volume), the fluid level of the column can rise. A &#x201c;flared&#x201d; end portion of the column can reduce changes in fluid level height as expansion occurs. Such a design can minimize the amount of operator interference required during chromatography. It can also reduce the likelihood of resin and or fines (low density and/or highly mobile small or fragmented resins) from exiting the column.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Accordingly, the present disclosure provides a modified column for performing chromatography (also referred to herein as a &#x201c;chromatography column&#x201d;). In particular, the modified column has a uniform cross-sectional area for a portion of the column, then the cross-sectional area increases near the end of the column in a &#x201c;flared&#x201d; manner, such that the end of the column is of a larger cross-sectional area than the rest of the column. Portions of the column with increased cross-sectional areas may have a reduced internal linear flow rate.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an aspect of a column of the present disclosure.

The method optionally further comprises fluidizing the resin to provide an expanded bed (e.g., expanding the settled bed to the expanded bed) prior to providing the fluid. The resin is optionally fluidized by providing a fluidization buffer to the column. Various fluidization buffers are known in the art and include, but are not limited to, 1M NaOH; WFI; 1M NaCl; 2M NaCl; 3M NaCl; 0.1 M NaOH; 0.5 M NaCi; 20 mM NaCi; 20 mM NaCi, 0.6 M NaCl; 0.1 M KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>; 5 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>; 10 mM NCP, 10 mM EACA; 0.2 M KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 0.5 M NaCl, 10 mM EACA (pH 7.80); 0.2 M KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 0.5 M NaCl, 10 mM EACA (pH 4.50); 265 mM glycine (pH 4.15); 5 mM NaOAc (pH 5.75); 5 mM NaOAc, 1 M NaCl; 0.5 M NaOAc (pH 5.25); 0.15 M NaOAc (pH 5.25); 10 mM NaOAc, 300 mM NaCl; 25 mM NaOAc (pH 5.20); 5 mM NaAce (pH 4.50); 10 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 80 mM NaCl; 0.1 M NaOH, 1 M NaCl; 50 mM NaCl and 60 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">In one embodiment, the method further comprises rinsing the chromatography column to remove at least some of the unwanted materials prior to eluting the target molecules. This step may be performed after contacting the fluid with the chromatographic media and before eluting the target molecules from the chromatographic media. Examples of rinsing fluids which may be used to rinse the column include, but are not limited to, 20 mM NaCi; 5 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>; 10 mM NCP, 10 mM EACA; 0.15 M NaOAc (pH 5.25) and 25 mM NaOAc (pH 5.20).</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">In one embodiment, &#x201c;eluting the target molecule&#x201d; comprises providing a suitable elution buffer to the column and subsequently collecting eluate comprising the target molecule from the column. The eluate may be collected for example from an outlet collector such as outlet collector <b>8</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. In one embodiment, eluate is collected from a fixed position in the column. In other words, a collector with an adjustable height is not required.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">In the present methods, liquids including, but not limited to, fluidization buffers, rinsing fluids, elution buffers and fluid comprising the target molecules and the unwanted components, are provided to the column using a distributor, optionally a static distributor.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">The column of the present disclosure can allow operation of the column with a constant, or relatively constant expansion ratio (expanded bed height/settled bed height). In one embodiment, the expansion ratio of the chromatographic media is maintained between 1.8 to 2.5, optionally 2 to 2.3 during operation.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">Keeping the height of the expanded bed constant, or relatively constant, means that the height of the collector can be maintained at a fixed height throughout the process. Thus, in another embodiment, collector <b>8</b> is maintained at a fixed height of 1 to 6 centimeters, optionally 2 to 5 centimeters, above the expanded bed.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">The flow rate of the liquids which are provided to the column can be varied such that the expansion ratio remains constant, or relatively constant throughout the separation process.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">In another embodiment, prior to providing the fluid, a buffer is provided to the column to fluidize the chromatographic media.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">In one embodiment, the method is performed on a continuous basis. For example, the method may be performed without any manual adjustment of the height of the collector. For example, the method may optionally be performed as part of a simulated moving bed (SMB) system.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">As is known in the art, a SMB system combines a series of columns in a contiguous flowpath whereby feedstocks are added to the system and target molecules collected in a continuous operation. This operation may be achieved through timed injection and flowpath diversion of product and buffers through a series of columns in a sequential fashion.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">The following non-limiting examples are illustrative of the present disclosure:</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading><p id="p-0105" num="0104">A flared top Expanded Bed Adsorption (EBA) chromatography column was found to reduce the probability of chromatographic medium (resin) and fines making their way into the outlet line during operation and reduce the risk of overexpansion when there is an increase in flow rate or increase in fluid viscosity running through the column. The effects of different head space volumes for buffer exchange were also investigated.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">I. Introduction</heading><p id="p-0106" num="0105"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an example of a large scale EBA column design, which was used for clinical manufacturing of PlasmaCap IG. The outlet collector is submerged in the liquid above the expanded bed. Throughout the process, liquids with varying physical and chemical properties are passed through the column. The height of the expanded bed is permitted to increase and decrease as the liquid properties change.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">The outlet tube is manually raised and lowered to maintain approximately 3-5 cm of liquid above the changing bed height. If the outlet is not raised in conjunction with the expanded bed, chromatographic media will exit through the column via the outlet and be contained in product pools. If the outlet is not lowered in conjunction with the expanded bed, higher volumes would be required to recover product, resulting in the product being excessively diluted. Furthermore, fines of chromatographic media that are of the lowest size and density can also leave the column if there is a disturbance in the bed. This is of particular concern during liquid changeover when buffers are of different viscosities are used. A cloud of fines can persist above the main bed height for a longer duration of time which can enter the outlet line.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">An improved version of the original EBA column is desired for use in a continuous simulated moving bed (SMB) system. To use an EBA column in an SMB system, two main issues need to be dealt with. First, the manual nature of running an EBA column will need to change to an autonomous nature. Secondly, the probability of resin being able to enter the outlet line needs to be reduced.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a modified commercial scale EBA column with a flared top design may be seen. The top of the column is a closed system where the top is physically closed from the external environment and directed to a closed tubing flowpath without being exposed to air. This eliminates the need for a secondary pump on the outlet line.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">Operating the column with constant expansion and variable flow in place of variable expansion also eliminates the need for a collector with adjustable height. It is easier to operate the column, without having to manually increase or decrease the height of the outlet line during the operation and minimizes the risk of human error in the adjustment. This design is more suitable for use on a continuous SMB system since no parts will need to be manually adjusted.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">The top flared region (also referred to herein as the &#x201c;upper outwardly flared region&#x201d;) of the column is shaped like a truncated cone with the diameter of the top being larger than the diameter of the bottom.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">As described below, the increase in diameter caused a decrease in linear flow from the shaft area to the top of the column where collection occurs. It was also shown that with a decrease in linear flow rate, the likelihood of resin fines rising up to the opening area is reduced. Additionally, the introduction of a horizontal flow vector reduced the risk of overexpansion with changes to flow or fluid properties. It was also shown that a smaller headspace leads to a better exchange efficiency.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">Procedure</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">The standard and flared column designs were compared using the available lab scale columns and EBA DEAE resin. The standard EBA column was a 2 cm diameter column, modified columns were 2.2 cm diameter columns with a 3.3 cm diameter flared top regions with flare angles of 3&#xb0; and 10&#xb0; (specifications shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>).</p><heading id="h-0012" level="2">Procedure:</heading><p id="p-0115" num="0114">1.

Shown by the circle markers, the standard EBA column had the highest expansion ratio levels. The modified EBA column with a 3&#xb0; flare angle, shown by the square markers, had the second highest expansion ratios. Shown by the triangle markers, the modified EBA column with a 10&#xb0; flare angle had the lowest expansion ratios. The larger the flare angle the faster the column diameter increases, and the smaller the expansion ratio of the resin bed. Some properties about the sequence of buffers used may be seen in Table 4 below. The most reliable factor for determining how much the resin will expand was the conductivity. The expansion ratio reliably increased when the conductivity increased. Density and viscosity had a clear linear and increasing trend on bed height as well when 1 M NaCl to 3 M NaCl were analysed, but the trend was not as reliable when 1 M NaOH accounted for.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00004" num="00004"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 4</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Buffer Properties</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="56pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="70pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Density</entry><entry>Viscosity</entry><entry>Conductivity</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Buffer</entry><entry>(g/mL)</entry><entry>(cP)</entry><entry>(mS/cm)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="56pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="70pt" align="char" char="."/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>1M NaOH</entry><entry>1.52</entry><entry>0.74</entry><entry>176</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>1M NaCl</entry><entry>1.07</entry><entry>0.91</entry><entry>93</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>2M NaCl</entry><entry>1.08</entry><entry>1.01</entry><entry>148</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>3M NaCl</entry><entry>1.25</entry><entry>1.03</entry><entry>188</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><heading id="h-0017" level="2">The Expansion Ratio of the Resin Fine Cloud</heading><p id="p-0135" num="0130">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, data may be seen for the expansion ratio of the resin bed and fine clouds caused during liquid changeover for the modified EBA column with a 3&#xb0; flare angle. Looking at the black and grey data sets which represent resin bed height and conductivity respectively, a trend may be seen. The trend is that as the conductivity increases, bed height also increases. The higher the conductivity the higher the bed height. When the conductivity is low, the bed height is also low. However, when a high conductivity buffer is immediately followed by a low conductivity buffer an interesting phenomenon happens at the interface of the resin bed and the liquid in the column. Small fines of resin get swept up in the upward flow and circulate around the top of the column. The cloud of fines (visualized by the yellow points) persists for 7-8 minutes until it slowly thins out and disperses.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0131">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, data may be seen for the expansion ratio of the resin bed and fine clouds caused during liquid changeover for the modified EBA column with a 10&#xb0; flare angle. Similarly, to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, during liquid changeover from a high conductivity liquid to WFI a fine cloud rose up to the top of the column for 7-8 minutes. The additional flare angle did not appear to have any significant difference on the amount of resin in the cloud.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0132">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, data may be seen for the expansion ratio of the resin bed and fine clouds caused during liquid changeover for the standard EBA column. The conductivity data set is slightly broken at certain points due to bubbles entering the system. However, the trend is the same as previous column deigns. The fine cloud rose to the top of the column during liquid changeover.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0133">The amount of fines which made their way out of the column and into the waste beaker was also observed. There was minimal difference between the 3&#xb0; flare column and the 10&#xb0; flare column as a similar amount of resin made its way out of the outlet line for the modified columns. For the standard column marginally more resin was seen is in the waste container. Without being bound by theory, it is likely that the flare design reduced the amount of resins and fines which were able to make it into the outlet line.</p><heading id="h-0018" level="2">Head Space Volume and Buffer Equilibration</heading><p id="p-0139" num="0134">The 3&#xb0; flare angle column had a headspace of 10 cm and 77.29 mL, the 10&#xb0; flare angle had a headspace of 3 cm and 35.15 mL, and the standard column had a maintained headspace of 10 cm and 31.42 mL.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0135">The method used for analysis was comparing the estimated area under the curve (AUC) for the conductivity during liquid changeover.

The headspace difference of 3 cm versus 10 cm had the largest impact on equilibration time. In total, the 10&#xb0; flare column had a total AUC which was 34% less than the 3&#xb0; flare column and 36% less than the standard column. It should be noted that in reality when the standard column is used, a headspace of only 3-5 cm is manually maintained, so its exchange efficiency would be similar to that of the 3&#xb0; flare column.</p><heading id="h-0019" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0142" num="0137">The flare design was shown (in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) to reduce the risk of overexpansion when there is an increase in flow rate or increase in fluid viscosity running through the column. The larger the flare angle the better the column was at reducing overexpansion. The 3&#xb0; flare design was better than the standard design, and the 10&#xb0; flare design was better than the 3&#xb0; flare design. The flare design was shown to be better than standard EBA design for reducing the probability of fines making their way into the outlet line during operation. The effects of different head space volumes for buffer exchange was also investigated, and it was shown that the smaller the head space, the more efficient the buffer exchange. In a more typical use of the standard EBA column the headspace would be maintained at 3-5 cm, which would increase buffer exchange efficiency, however, it would also increase the amount of resin loss.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0138">Overall, the flare design column is an improved version of the original EBA column and can be used in a continuous simulated moving bed (SMB) system.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
