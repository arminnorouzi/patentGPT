The International Application claims the priority benefit of German Application No. 10 2019 132590.0 filed on Dec. 2, 2019. Both the International Application and the German Application are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The description below relates to a drive apparatus for a vehicle having an electric machine with a rotor shaft constructed as a hollow shaft in which a gear mechanism drive shaft is inserted and a method for producing a gear mechanism drive shaft in such a drive apparatus.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In an electrically operated, two-track vehicle, an electrically driven front axle may, for example, have an electric machine. This electric machine may, where applicable, be arranged axially parallel with the flanged shafts which are guided with respect to the vehicle wheels. In this instance, the electric machine may drive on a front axle differential and further on the flanged shafts of the vehicle front axle which are guided with respect to the vehicle wheels via a single or double spur gear transmission stage.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a generic drive apparatus, a rotor shaft of an electric machine is constructed as a hollow shaft with an internal tooth arrangement, in which a coaxial gear mechanism drive shaft with an external tooth arrangement is inserted, with a torque-transmitting spline being formed. The rotor shaft is guided outward through a bearing opening of the electric machine housing with a rotor shaft rotary bearing being interposed. In addition, the external tooth arrangement of the gear mechanism drive shaft is associated with a centering seat in order to prevent misalignment between the gear mechanism drive shaft and the rotor shaft. The centering seat is a circumferential smooth-cylindrical face which extends at the external circumference of the gear mechanism drive shaft and which is in abutment with the rotor shaft internal circumference with a tight clearance fit.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the related art, the centering seat which is formed on the gear mechanism drive shaft is spaced apart from the rotor shaft rotary bearing in the axial direction by a lever arm length. It has been found that during travel operation with a rotating and radially loaded gear mechanism drive shaft, particularly as a result of the above-mentioned lever arm length, a shaft deflection occurs. Such a shaft deflection may lead to an excessively large loading of the rotor shaft rotary bearing, noise generation and a reduction of the service-life of the rotor shaft rotary bearing.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">DE 23 54 301 A1 discloses a drive of a rail-bound electric traction vehicle. EP 1 433 975 B1 discloses a force transmission apparatus. DE 10 2010 050 217 A1 discloses an electric axle for a motor vehicle. US 2007/0131375 A1 discloses an electric steering apparatus.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Described is a drive apparatus for a vehicle in which the gear mechanism drive shaft rotates in a structurally simple manner during travel operation with improved smooth running in comparison with the related art.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The description points out the fact that a shaft deflection of the gear mechanism drive shaft in the related art occurs primarily as a result of a lever arm length between the rotor shaft rotary bearing and the centering seat which is formed on the gear mechanism drive shaft. Against this background, to reduce the bending stress of the gear mechanism drive shaft, the centering seat thereof is arranged without any axial offset (that is to say, without any lever arm length) with respect to the rotor shaft rotary bearing and in axial alignment relative to the rotor shaft rotary bearing. Therefore, the lever arm length between the centering seat of the gear mechanism drive shaft and the rotor shaft rotary bearing is reduced to zero, whereby radial forces can be introduced in a direct force introduction (that is to say, without bending stress) by the gear mechanism drive shaft via the centering seat thereof into the rotor shaft rotary bearing. The deflection of the rotor shaft in the overlapping region of the two shafts may be limited.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">To further reduce the shaft bending stress, the rotor shaft rotary bearing is not to be constructed as a fixed bearing, but instead as an axially displaceable, particularly a resiliently pretensioned floating bearing <b>10</b>. The reduction of the deflection also functions when a fixed bearing is located in place of the floating bearing. The resilient pretensioning is for the defined loading of the roller members at any time so that there is no load-free state which would reduce the smooth running.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a technical implementation, the external tooth arrangement which is formed on the gear mechanism drive shaft may be arranged offset with respect to the rotary bearing by an axial offset. The gear mechanism drive shaft may protrude with the electric machine-side shaft end face thereof into the rotor shaft. The centering seat may terminate directly at the electric machine-side shaft end face. In this manner, the largest possible axial spacing between the centering seat and a bearing seat (which will be described below) of the gear mechanism drive shaft may be achieved, which limits the deflection of the rotor shaft in the overlapping region of the two shafts. The centering seat which may be arranged directly on the electric machine-side shaft end face can initially merge in the direction toward a gear-side shaft end face into a shaft portion which has a reduced diameter. In the further axial path, the shaft portion which has a reduced diameter may be adjoined by the external tooth arrangement which has a larger diameter.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a technical implementation, the gear mechanism drive shaft may be rotatably supported in a gear mechanism housing with a gear mechanism rotary bearing being interposed. The gear mechanism housing rotary bearing is located on a corresponding bearing seat of the gear mechanism drive shaft. The bearing seat of the gear mechanism drive shaft may be arranged directly on the gear-side shaft end face, whereby the largest possible axial spacing between the bearing seat and the centering seat of the gear mechanism drive shaft is provided.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The gear mechanism drive shaft and the rotor shaft may form a shaft assembly which is rotatably supported as a whole in a three-point bearing in the drive apparatus. The three-point bearing may include, at the two shaft assembly, end faces bearing locations on which the shaft assembly is rotatably supported by a fixed bearing on the electric machine housing and on the gear mechanism housing, whilst at the shaft assembly center the rotor shaft rotary bearing may be positioned as a central floating bearing. In comparison with conventional four-point bearings, such a three-point bearing involves significantly lower costs and reduced production complexity.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The rotor shaft may be a component of a rotor inner cooling system, in which a tubular oil lance protrudes into the hollow space of the rotor shaft. The oil lance may delimit an annular gap together with the rotor shaft internal circumference. During travel operation, a lubricant and/or coolant volume flow can be guided by a pressure pump through the oil lance at an overflow opening into the annular gap. From there, the lubricant and/or coolant volume flow can be guided further in the direction toward the centering seat of the gear mechanism drive shaft. In this instance, the centering seat of the gear mechanism drive shaft may have an axial flow passage. The shaft portion of the gear mechanism drive shaft which has a reduced diameter together with the rotor shaft internal circumference may delimit an axial flow groove. In this manner, the annular gap may be connected to the spline in technical flow terms via the centering seat flow passage and via the axial flow groove. As a result of the tooth arrangement play, a small volume flow of lubricant and/or coolant can flow through the spline in order to ensure the discharge of fretting corrosion particles.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The gear mechanism drive shaft may be in form of a hollow shaft. In order to produce the gear mechanism drive shaft, a shaft blank made from a hardenable steel may first be provided. Both the centering seat and the bearing seat may already be formed in the shaft blank. Subsequently, there a thermal processing may be carried out in which the shaft blank is hardened, with component distortion with corresponding shaft deflection. In order to minimize the component distortion, there may be an orientation process in which the hardened shaft blank is clamped by clamping tools at two axially spaced-apart clamping locations. In the clamped state, the shaft blank is plastically deformed with a process force in order to reduce the component distortion. The process force engages between the two clamping locations which are axially spaced apart from each other.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">With regard to a correct orientation of the shaft blank, the two clamping locations which are axially spaced apart from each other may be spaced apart from each other by the largest possible axial spacing. Against this background, the two clamping locations may be the bearing and centering seats which are formed on the shaft end faces of the gear mechanism drive shaft.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">These and other aspects and advantages will become more apparent and more readily appreciated from the following description of the example embodiments, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings of which:</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a gear mechanism structure of a drive apparatus;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a half-sectioned partial view of a shaft assembly including the gear mechanism drive shaft and rotor shaft according to a comparative form in the related art;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a view according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> according to an example;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows an orientation station in which a gear mechanism drive shaft is clamped according to a comparative form in the related; and</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a view according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> according to an example.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a drive apparatus in which the front axle VA of a two-track vehicle can be driven.
