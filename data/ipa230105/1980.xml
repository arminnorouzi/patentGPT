and furthermore, to a speed shifting apparatus, a transmission control method, a steering system, and a steering control method.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A gearbox is a very important part of a vehicle, and has main functions including changing a transmission ratio to increase torque and a rotation speed of a drive wheel; changing a direction of vehicle power transmission to achieve reverse; interrupting power transmission to achieve neutral gear, and the like. After more than 100 years of development, the gearbox has changed from an original manual gearbox, to a hydraulic automatic gearbox and an electronically controlled mechanical automatic gearbox, and then to a current continuously variable gearbox. This has made the gearbox change smoother, a system more fuel-efficient, and impact during shifting smaller, while implementing functions and reducing operating intensity of a driver.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Currently, there are mainly two types of existing speed shifting apparatuses. One type is a gear meshing speed shifting apparatus, including an automatic transmission (AT), a manual transmission (MT), an electronically controlled automated mechanical transmission (AMT), and a dual-clutch transmission (DCT). This type of speed shifting apparatus mainly realizes transmission of power through mutual meshing of gear sets, and a transmission ratio and a transmission direction are changed through meshing of gear sets of different specifications. Because a quantity of teeth of each gear is fixed, the transmission ratio between the gear sets is fixed. This easily causes impact in shifting of gears. Through arrangement of more gear sets, a transmission ratio difference between gears can be reduced, and the impact in shifting of gears can be reduced. However, due to the limitation of the size of a gearbox, it is impossible to add more gear sets in the limited space. As a result, development of the gear meshing speed shifting apparatus has encountered a bottleneck. The other type is a friction-type continuously variable speed shifting apparatus, mainly a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a </i></figref>and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref><i>b, </i>the CVT speed shifting apparatus includes two pairs of pulley assemblies and steel belts. To be specific, a main pulley assembly includes a first movable pulley <b>011</b> and a first fixed pulley <b>012</b> arranged opposite to each other in a V-shaped structure.

This causes an operating radius of the steel belt <b>03</b> on the main pulley assembly to be increased, and the speed shifting apparatus is in a high-speed state. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref><i>b, </i>when the oil pressure in the first pressure chamber <b>041</b> acts on the first movable pulley <b>011</b>, the first movable pulley <b>011</b> approaches the first fixed pulley <b>012</b>, pushing the steel belt <b>03</b> to move in a direction approaching outer edges of the first movable pulley <b>011</b> and the first fixed pulley <b>012</b>, and the second movable pulley <b>021</b> moves away from the second fixed pulley <b>022</b>. This causes the operating radius of the steel belt <b>03</b> on the main pulley assembly to be reduced, and the speed shifting apparatus is in a low-speed state. Because changes in the spacing between the first movable pulley <b>011</b> and the first fixed pulley <b>012</b> are continuous, and changes in the spacing between the second movable pulley <b>021</b> and the second fixed pulley <b>022</b> are also continuous, the CVT speed shifting apparatus is a speed shifting apparatus that can continuously obtain any transmission ratio within a transmission range, that is, a continuously variable speed shifting apparatus. When the continuously variable speed shifting apparatus is applied to an automobile, gear shifting can be very smooth without sudden jump feeling, thereby improving comfort.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, in the continuously variable speed shifting apparatus, the main pulley assembly and the secondary pulley assembly are driven by the steel belt, that is, power is transmitted by a frictional force between the steel belt and the main pulley assembly and the secondary pulley assembly, and when transmitted torque is relatively large, slippage easily occurs on a friction surface. As a result, the continuously variable speed shifting apparatus cannot transmit large torque power.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Embodiments of this application provide a speed shifting apparatus, a transmission control method, a steering system, and a steering control method. A main objective is to provide a speed shifting apparatus that uses mesh transmission, to increase transmission power compared with friction transmission, and prevent slippage from easily occurring in a power transmission process.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">To achieve the foregoing objective, the following technical solutions are used in the embodiments of this application:</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to a first aspect, an embodiment of this application provides a speed shifting apparatus. The speed shifting apparatus includes:</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">an outer rotating wheel;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">an inner rotating wheel, located inside the outer rotating wheel, where a rotation axis of the inner rotating wheel is parallel to and different from a rotation axis of the outer rotating wheel; and</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">a plurality of meshing members, located between opposite side surfaces of the inner rotating wheel and the outer rotating wheel and arranged along a circumferential direction of the inner rotating wheel or the outer rotating wheel.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Either the outer rotating wheel or the inner rotating wheel is provided with a plurality of sliding grooves, and the plurality of sliding grooves are in a one-to-one correspondence with the plurality of meshing members. The other rotating wheel is provided with a plurality of fixed meshing teeth for meshing with the meshing members. Each of the plurality of fixed meshing teeth extends in a direction consistent with an extension direction of the corresponding sliding groove.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The meshing member is capable of sliding along a corresponding sliding groove, and a distance between the meshing member and the rotation axis of the inner rotating wheel gradually decreases when the meshing member slides from a first end to a second end of the sliding groove.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In the speed shifting apparatus provided in this embodiment, the outer rotating wheel and the inner rotating wheel achieve internal meshing transmission by using the meshing members and the plurality of fixed meshing teeth that are meshed with each other, and the meshing members may slide along the sliding grooves. In addition, the distance between each of the meshing members and the rotation axis of the inner rotating wheel gradually decreases when the meshing member slides from the first end to the second end of the sliding groove. To be specific, when the meshing member slides to the first end, a transmission ratio between the inner rotating wheel and the outer rotating wheel is i=1+X/L<b>1</b>, where X is a distance between the rotation axis of the inner rotating wheel and the rotation axis of the outer rotating wheel, and L<b>1</b> is a distance from a position of the first end to the rotation axis of the inner rotating wheel. When the meshing member slides to the second end, the transmission ratio between the inner rotating wheel and the outer rotating wheel is i=1+X/L<b>2</b>, where L<b>2</b> is a distance from a position of the second end to the rotation axis of the inner rotating wheel. In other words, the transmission ratio between the inner rotating wheel and the outer rotating wheel is i=1+X/Lx, where Lx is a distance from any position between the first end and the second end to the rotation axis of the inner rotating wheel. When the meshing member moves between the first end and the second end, a distance between a position of the meshing member and the rotation axis of the inner rotating wheel continuously changes. Therefore, the transmission ratio between the inner rotating wheel and the outer rotating wheel continuously changes. In other words, from the first end to the second end, the transmission ratio between the inner rotating wheel and the outer rotating wheel gradually increases. In this case, the speed shifting apparatus can achieve a continuously variable speed. In addition, power transmission between the inner rotating wheel and the outer rotating wheel of the speed shifting apparatus is transmitted through meshing transmission. Compared with existing friction transmission, the meshing transmission not only has higher speed shifting efficiency, but also is less prone to slippage in a process of transmitting relatively large power. Therefore, the speed shifting apparatus provided in this embodiment is applicable to a torque environment with a relatively large load.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In a possible implementation of the first aspect, along the first end to the second end of the sliding groove, both a radial size of the inner rotating wheel and a radial size of the outer rotating wheel gradually decrease, and along the first end to the second end of the sliding groove, a groove depth of the sliding groove gradually becomes shallower. The radial size of the inner rotating wheel and the radial size of the outer rotating wheel are both designed to gradually decrease, so that the distance from the meshing member to the rotation axis of the inner rotating wheel gradually decreases along the direction from the first end to the second end. In addition, along the first end to the second end, the groove depth of the sliding groove gradually becomes shallower, so that the meshing member can achieve meshing transmission with the fixed meshing teeth regardless of being located at the first end, the second end, or another position between the first end and the second end.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a possible implementation of the first aspect, the speed shifting apparatus further includes: a plurality of speed shifting rods, where the plurality of speed shifting rods are in a one-to-one correspondence with the plurality of meshing members; and an adjusting ring, disposed inside the inner rotating wheel, where a central axis of the adjusting ring is coaxial with the rotation axis of the inner rotating wheel, the adjusting ring is connected to a first drive source, an axis of an output shaft of the first drive source is coaxial with the rotation axis of the inner rotating wheel, and the first drive source is capable of driving the adjusting ring to move along a direction of the rotation axis of the inner rotating wheel. The sliding groove is provided on the inner rotating wheel, one end of each of the plurality of speed shifting rods is connected to a corresponding meshing member, and the other end is connected to the adjusting ring. When the first drive source drives the adjusting ring to move along the direction of the rotation axis of the inner rotating wheel, the speed shifting rod and the adjusting ring move synchronously along the direction of the rotation axis of the inner rotating wheel. The speed shifting rod is relatively fixed to the adjusting ring along a circumferential direction of the adjusting ring, and the adjusting ring and the speed shifting rod is capable of rotating synchronously around a circumferential direction of the output shaft of the first drive source.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The plurality of speed shifting rods are connected to the plurality of corresponding meshing members in a one-to-one correspondence, and the speed shifting rod is connected to the adjusting ring that is connected to the first drive source, so that one first drive source can drive the adjusting ring to move. Further, the plurality of speed shifting rods drive all the meshing members to move synchronously in the corresponding sliding groove. Compared with use of a plurality of drive sources to respectively correspondingly drive a plurality of meshing members to move, this implementation can simplify a structure of the entire speed shifting apparatus, and can easily control all the meshing members to move synchronously.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In addition, in a running process of the speed shifting apparatus, the meshing member not only slides in the sliding groove, but also needs to rotate synchronously with the inner rotating wheel. To achieve synchronous rotation of the meshing member and the inner rotating wheel, this application provides the following embodiment: The speed shifting rod is relatively fixed to the adjusting ring along the circumferential direction of the adjusting ring. The adjusting ring and the speed shifting rod are capable of rotating synchronously around the circumferential direction of the output shaft of the first drive source. In other words, the adjusting ring is driven by the first drive source, and the speed shifting rod, the meshing member connected to the speed shifting rod, and the adjusting ring rotate synchronously around the circumferential direction of the output shaft of the first drive source. In this way, synchronous rotation of the meshing member and the inner rotating wheel can be achieved.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In a possible implementation of the first aspect, the speed shifting apparatus further includes: a shaft sleeve, disposed inside the inner rotating wheel, where the shaft sleeve is relatively fixed to the inner rotating wheel, and an axis of the shaft sleeve is coaxial with the rotation axis of the inner rotating wheel; and a sliding shaft, slidably disposed inside the shaft sleeve, where the sliding shaft is connected to the output shaft of the first drive source, the adjusting ring is rotatably sleeved outside of the shaft sleeve and is connected to the sliding shaft by using a connecting pin, and a first end of the connecting pin is relatively fixed to the adjusting ring. A clamping groove for a second end of the connecting pin to slide is provided in a circumferential direction of the sliding shaft. The connecting pin rotates along the clamping groove when the speed shifting rod and the adjusting ring rotate synchronously around the shaft sleeve. The shaft sleeve is provided with a guiding groove for the second end of the connecting pin to move along an axial direction of the shaft sleeve. The connecting pin moves along the guiding groove when the first drive source drives the sliding shaft to move along the axial direction of the shaft sleeve, so that the adjusting ring and the speed shifting rod move synchronously along the axial direction of the shaft sleeve, and the first end of the connecting pin is opposite to the second end of the connecting pin.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">When the adjusting ring is disposed inside the inner rotating wheel, the first drive source is usually disposed outside of the inner rotating wheel because a mounting space in the inner rotating wheel is limited. In this way, the adjusting ring is still ensured to move along the direction of the rotation axis of the inner rotating wheel through the shaft sleeve and the sliding shaft matching the shaft sleeve, and the speed shifting rod and the adjusting ring rotate synchronously along the circumferential direction of the sliding shaft through the rotation of the connecting pin along the clamping groove.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In a possible implementation of the first aspect, the speed shifting rod includes: a first connecting rod, where one end of the first connecting rod is connected to the meshing member, the other end of the first connecting rod is connected to a fixing base through a first hinged shaft in a hinged manner, and the fixing base is relatively fixed to the shaft sleeve; and a second connecting rod, where one end of the second connecting rod is connected to a middle part of the first connecting rod through a second hinged shaft in a hinged manner, and the other end of the second connecting rod is connected to the adjusting ring through a third hinged shaft in a hinged manner. Axes of the first hinged shaft, the second hinged shaft, and the third hinged shaft are all perpendicular to a first plane. A straight line on which the first connecting rod is located is a first straight line. A plane in which the first straight line and the axis of the shaft sleeve are co-located is the first plane. The sliding groove is an arc-shaped groove. A circle center of a circle in which the arc-shaped groove is located coincides with a rotation center of the first connecting rod relative to the fixing base. Because each first connecting rod is connected to the fixing base in a hinged manner, it can be ensured that all the meshing members rotate synchronously around the axial direction of the shaft sleeve. In addition, the sliding groove is disposed as an arc-shaped groove, so that the first connecting rod can be ensured to smoothly drive the meshing member to slide in the sliding groove.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In a possible implementation of the first aspect, the speed shifting apparatus further includes: a plurality of speed shifting rods, where the plurality of speed shifting rods are in a one-to-one correspondence with the plurality of meshing members; and an adjusting ring, sleeved outside of the outer rotating wheel, where a central axis of the adjusting ring is coaxial with the rotation axis of the outer rotating wheel, the adjusting ring is connected to a first drive source, an axis of an output shaft of the first drive source is coaxial with the rotation axis of the outer rotating wheel, and the first drive source is capable of driving the adjusting ring to move along a direction of the rotation axis of the outer rotating wheel. The sliding groove is provided on the outer rotating wheel, one end of each of the plurality of speed shifting rods is connected to a corresponding meshing member, and the other end is connected to the adjusting ring. When the first drive source drives the adjusting ring to move along the direction of the rotation axis of the outer rotating wheel, the speed shifting rod and the adjusting ring move synchronously along the direction of the rotation axis of the outer rotating wheel. The adjusting ring is relatively fixed to the output shaft of the first drive source, and the speed shifting rod is capable of rotating around a circumferential direction of the adjusting ring.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The plurality of speed shifting rods are connected to the plurality of corresponding meshing members in a one-to-one correspondence, and the speed shifting rod is connected to the adjusting ring that is connected to the first drive source, so that one first drive source can drive the adjusting ring to move. Further, the plurality of speed shifting rods drive all the meshing members to slide synchronously in the corresponding sliding grooves. Compared with use of a plurality of drive sources to respectively correspondingly drive a plurality of meshing members to move, this implementation can simplify a structure of the entire speed shifting apparatus, and can easily control all the meshing members to move synchronously.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In addition, in a running process of the speed shifting apparatus, the meshing member not only slides in the sliding groove, but also needs to rotate synchronously with the outer rotating wheel. To achieve synchronous rotation of the meshing member and the outer rotating wheel, this application provides the following embodiment: The adjusting ring is relatively fixed to the output shaft of the first drive source, and the speed shifting rod is capable of rotating around the circumferential direction of the adjusting ring. In other words, the adjusting ring does not rotate around the output shaft of the first drive source, but the speed shifting rod rotates around the adjusting ring, to drive the meshing member to rotate around the rotation axis of the outer rotating wheel.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In a possible implementation of the first aspect, a speed shifting groove is provided at one end of the speed shifting rod close to the adjusting ring. A groove depth of the speed shifting groove is greater than or equal to a distance between the first end and the second end along a radial direction of the outer rotating wheel. The adjusting ring is clamped in the speed shifting groove along a radial direction of the adjusting ring. The speed shifting rod is slidably engaged with the adjusting ring through the speed shifting groove, so that the speed shifting rod is capable of rotating along the circumferential direction of the adjusting ring. That the speed shifting groove is provided at the end of the speed shifting rod close to the adjusting ring, and the groove depth of the speed shifting groove is greater than or equal to the distance between the first end and the second end along the radial direction of the outer rotating wheel is: When the meshing member slides along the first end to the second end, through use of the speed shifting groove, a distance between a position at which the speed shifting rod is connected to the meshing member and a position at which the speed shifting rod is connected to the adjusting ring can gradually increase. This can ensure that the speed shifting rod and the meshing member connected to the speed shifting rod smoothly slide in the sliding groove. In addition, use of the speed shifting groove ensures that the speed shifting rod rotates along the circumferential direction of the adjusting ring.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In a possible implementation of the first aspect, a part of the meshing member extends to one side of the outer rotating wheel away from the inner rotating wheel. A rail ring is further included. The rail ring is relatively fixed to the outer rotating wheel. A plurality of rail grooves are provided along a circumferential direction of the rail ring. An extension direction of the rail groove is consistent with the extension direction of the sliding groove. One end of each of the plurality of speed shifting rods away from the meshing member passes through a corresponding rail groove in sequence and is connected to the adjusting ring. When the part of the meshing member extends to the side of the outer rotating wheel away from the inner rotating wheel, it is possible that not all the speed shifting rods can move synchronously along the direction of the rotation axis of the outer rotating wheel, and consequently, not all the meshing members can slide synchronously along the corresponding sliding grooves. However, the rail ring is disposed, and all the speed shifting rods pass through the rail grooves provided in the rail ring and are connected to the adjusting ring. This ensures that all the speed shifting rods slide synchronously.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In a possible implementation of the first aspect, a limiting structure is disposed at a position at which the rail ring is engaged with the speed shifting rod, and the limiting structure is configured to prevent the speed shifting rod from moving in a direction away from the rail ring. During rotation of the outer rotating wheel, the speed shifting rod and the meshing member have a centrifugal force correspondingly. The limiting structure prevents the speed shifting rod from moving in the direction away from the rail ring, to ensure that the meshing member is always in the sliding groove, and finally ensure performance of the entire speed shifting apparatus.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In a possible implementation of the first aspect, the limiting structure includes: a rail block, connected to and relatively fixed to the speed shifting rod, where the rail block is located on one side of the rail ring away from the outer rotating wheel, and the rail block abuts against the rail ring; and a pressure plate, pressed on one side of the rail block away from the rail ring, and relatively fixed to the rail ring. The pressure plate is provided with an avoidance groove. An extension direction of the avoidance groove is consistent with the extension direction of the rail groove. One end of the speed shifting rod away from the meshing member passes through the rail groove and the avoidance groove in sequence and is connected to the adjusting ring. The pressure plate is pressed against the rail block to exert pressure on the rail block towards the inside of the outer rotating wheel, to prevent the speed shifting rod from moving in the direction away from the rail ring.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In a possible implementation of the first aspect, the speed shifting apparatus further includes: a first rotating shaft, connected to the inner rotating wheel and extending to the outside of the outer rotating wheel, where an axis of the first rotating shaft is coaxial with the rotation axis of the inner rotating wheel; and a second rotating shaft, connected to the outer rotating wheel and extending to the outside of the outer rotating wheel, where an axis of the second rotating shaft is coaxial with the rotation axis of the outer rotating wheel.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to a second aspect, an embodiment of this application further provides a transmission control method. The transmission control method is applied to the speed shifting apparatus according to any one of the first aspect and the implementations of the first aspect, either the inner rotating wheel or the outer rotating wheel is an input wheel, and the other rotating wheel is an output wheel. The transmission control method includes:</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">when a rotation speed of the output wheel is greater than a preset rotation speed, controlling the meshing member to slide in a direction toward the first end of the sliding groove until the rotation speed of the output wheel is equal to the preset rotation speed; and</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">when the rotation speed of the output wheel is less than the preset rotation speed, controlling the meshing member to slide in a direction toward the second end of the sliding groove until the rotation speed of the output wheel is equal to the preset rotation speed.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">According to the transmission control method provided in this embodiment, because the transmission control method uses the speed shifting apparatus according to any one of the foregoing technical solutions, when the rotation speed of the output wheel is greater than the preset rotation speed, the meshing member is controlled to slide in the direction toward the first end, and when the rotation speed of the output wheel is less than the preset rotation speed, the meshing member is controlled to slide in the direction toward the second end, until the rotation speed of the output wheel is equal to the preset rotation speed, to implement speed shifting of the output wheel. Meshing transmission exists between the inner rotating wheel and the outer rotating wheel, and compared with existing friction transmission, the meshing transmission not only has higher speed shifting efficiency, but also is less prone to slippage in a process of transmitting relatively large power. Therefore, the transmission control method provided in this embodiment is applicable to a torque environment with a relatively large load.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">According to a third aspect, an embodiment of this application further provides a steering system, including:</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">a second drive source;</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">a steering transmission mechanism, where the second drive source drives the steering transmission mechanism to enable a steering wheel to steer, an input end of the steering transmission mechanism is connected to an output end of the second drive source, and an output end of the steering transmission mechanism is connected to the steering wheel; and</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">a speed shifting apparatus, where the speed shifting apparatus is the speed shifting apparatus according to any one of the first aspect and the implementations of the first aspect, either the inner rotating wheel or the outer rotating wheel is connected to the output end of the second drive source, and the other rotating wheel is connected to the input end of the steering transmission mechanism.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the steering system provided in this embodiment, because the steering system uses the speed shifting apparatus according to the implementations of the first aspect, the steering system provided in this embodiment and the speed shifting apparatus according to the foregoing technical solutions can resolve a same technical problem and achieve a same expected effect.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">According to a fourth aspect, an embodiment of this application further provides a steering control method. The steering control method is applied to the steering system according to the third aspect. The steering control method includes:</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">detecting steering torque of the output end of the second drive source, and determining whether the steering torque is less than preset steering torque; and</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">when the steering torque is less than the preset steering torque, controlling the meshing member to move in a direction approaching the first end of the sliding groove, to reduce a transmission ratio between the inner rotating wheel and the outer rotating wheel, until the steering torque is greater than or equal to the preset steering torque, and controlling the second drive source to drive the steering transmission mechanism, to drive the steering wheel to steer.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">According to the steering control method provided in this embodiment, when the detected steering torque is less than the preset steering torque, the meshing member is controlled to slide in the direction toward the first end, so that the steering torque is greater than or equal to the preset steering torque, thereby ensuring that the steering wheel steers based on the preset steering torque.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In a possible implementation of the fourth aspect, when the steering torque is greater than or equal to the preset steering torque, the second drive source is controlled to drive the steering transmission mechanism, to drive the steering wheel to steer. If the steering torque is greater than or equal to the preset steering torque, the meshing member does not need to be driven to slide, and the second drive source drives the steering wheel to steer.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In a possible implementation of the fourth aspect, the second drive source includes a first motor and a second motor, and an output end of the first motor and an output end of the second motor are both connected to the inner rotating wheel or the outer rotating wheel of the speed shifting apparatus. Before the detecting steering torque, the method further includes: detecting an output power of the first motor and an output power of the second motor; detecting the steering torque when either the first motor or the second motor has no output power; and when both the first motor and the second motor have output powers, controlling the steering transmission mechanism to drive the steering wheel to steer. In other words, when neither the first motor nor the second motor fails, the second drive source directly drives the steering wheel to rotate. When the first motor or the second motor fails, the steering torque is detected. Therefore, in this embodiment, even if the first motor or the second motor fails, it can still be ensured that the steering wheel is mounted at a preset angle for steering.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">According to a fifth aspect, an embodiment of this application further provides a steering control method. The steering control method is applied to the steering system according to the third aspect. The steering control method includes: detecting a traveling speed of the steering wheel, and determining whether the traveling speed is greater than a preset speed; and when the traveling speed is greater than the preset speed, controlling the meshing member to move in a direction approaching the second end of the sliding groove, to increase a transmission ratio between the inner rotating wheel and the outer rotating wheel, so that the traveling speed of the steering wheel is less than or equal to the preset speed.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In other words, when the traveling speed of the steering wheel is greater than the preset speed, the meshing member is controlled to move in the direction approaching the second end, to increase the transmission ratio between the inner rotating wheel and the outer rotating wheel, and reduce torque. In this way, steering sensitivity of the steering wheel in a high-speed traveling state can be reduced, thereby improving a safety factor.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In a possible implementation of the fifth aspect, when it is determined that the traveling speed is less than or equal to the preset speed, a position of the meshing member is controlled, so that the transmission ratio between the inner rotating wheel and the outer rotating wheel is equal to 1. When the traveling speed of the steering wheel is less than or equal to the preset speed, the meshing member is controlled to slide, so that the transmission ratio between the inner rotating wheel and the outer rotating wheel is equal to 1, that is, the torque of the steering wheel is not changed, and it is ensured that the steering wheel is mounted at the preset angle for steering.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings"

with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">According to one aspect, the embodiments of this application provide a speed shifting apparatus. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref><i>a, </i>and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref><i>b, </i>the speed shifting apparatus includes an inner rotating wheel <b>1</b>, an outer rotating wheel <b>3</b>, and a plurality of meshing members <b>5</b>. A rotation axis P<b>1</b> of the inner rotating wheel <b>1</b> is parallel to and different from a rotation axis P<b>2</b> of the outer rotating wheel <b>3</b>. The plurality of meshing members <b>5</b> are located between opposite side surfaces of the inner rotating wheel <b>1</b> and the outer rotating wheel <b>3</b> and arranged along a circumferential direction of the inner rotating wheel <b>1</b> or the outer rotating wheel <b>3</b>. Either the outer rotating wheel <b>3</b> or the inner rotating wheel <b>1</b> is provided with a plurality of sliding grooves <b>7</b>, and the plurality of sliding grooves <b>7</b> are in a one-to-one correspondence with the plurality of meshing members <b>5</b>. The other rotating wheel is provided with fixed meshing teeth <b>8</b> meshing with the meshing member <b>5</b>. The fixed meshing teeth <b>8</b> extend in a direction consistent with an extension direction of the sliding groove <b>7</b>. The meshing member <b>5</b> is capable of sliding along a corresponding sliding groove <b>7</b>. A distance between the meshing member <b>5</b> and the rotation axis P<b>1</b> of the inner rotating wheel <b>1</b> gradually decreases when the meshing member <b>5</b> slides from a first end to a second end of the sliding groove <b>7</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In other words, a meshing region and a non-meshing region are formed in a region between an outer surface of the inner rotating wheel <b>1</b> and an inner surface of the outer rotating wheel <b>3</b>. In the meshing region, the fixed meshing teeth <b>8</b> mesh with the meshing members <b>5</b>. In the non-meshing region, the fixed meshing teeth <b>8</b> are disengaged from the meshing members <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">A working principle of the speed shifting apparatus is as follows: When either the outer rotating wheel <b>3</b> or the inner rotating wheel <b>1</b> rotates, the other rotating wheel is driven to rotate through meshing transmission between the plurality of meshing members <b>5</b> and the fixed meshing teeth <b>8</b>, to finally output torque. That is, the speed shifting apparatus uses meshing power transmission, and compared with the existing friction power transmission, can transmit large torque power and is less prone to slippage. Therefore, the speed shifting apparatus can be applied to heavy-load large-torque transmission, and the meshing power transmission has greater transmission efficiency compared with the friction power transmission, so that advantages of fast speed increase and large power can be achieved. A speed shifting principle of the speed shifting apparatus is as follows: As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref><i>a, </i>when the meshing member <b>5</b> is at the first end A of the sliding groove <b>7</b> and the rotating inner rotating wheel <b>1</b> drives the outer rotating wheel <b>3</b>, because a linear velocity V<b>1</b> of the inner rotating wheel <b>1</b> is equal to a linear velocity V<b>2</b> of the outer rotating wheel <b>3</b>, W<b>1</b>L<b>1</b>=W<b>2</b>O<b>1</b>.

In this way, steering sensitivity of the steering wheel in a high-speed traveling state can be reduced, thereby improving a safety factor.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0159">When it is determined that the traveling speed is less than or equal to the preset speed, a position of the meshing member is controlled, so that the transmission ratio between the inner rotating wheel and the outer rotating wheel is equal to 1. When the traveling speed of the steering wheel is less than or equal to the preset speed, the meshing member is controlled to slide, so that the transmission ratio between the inner rotating wheel and the outer rotating wheel is equal to 1, that is, the torque of the steering wheel is not changed.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0160">In the present disclosure, the described specific features, structures, materials, or characteristics may be combined in a proper manner in any one or more of the embodiments or examples.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0161">The foregoing descriptions are merely non-limiting example embodiments and are not intended to limit the protection scope of the present invention, which is intended to cover any variation or replacement readily determined by a person skilled in the art.
