Such compositions are useful for treating infection and reducing or degrading biofilms both in vivo and in vitro. In particular, such compositions are useful in the treatment of biofilm-related disorders, including but not limited to mastitis, digital dermatitis, and chronic wound infections.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The health condition of the udder plays an essential role in dairy animals both from a health and wellness perspective as well as from an economic perspective. The infection in mammary glands of dairy animals, such as cows, known as mastitis, has a significant economic impact on dairy farms worldwide. The overall global loss per year is estimated to be four to five billion Euros. In dairy mastitis, the udder is incapable of mounting an efficacious defence response to invading microorganisms. Several factors are known to disrupt the balance at the level of the udder which can compromise the ability of the dairy animal to kill microorganisms causing mastitis. Consequently, host response mechanisms may be incapable of triggering an efficient defence response to eliminate invading pathogens leading to bacterial colonization of the udder and the onset of clinical or subclinical mastitis.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Bacterial colonization and especially the formation of bacterial reservoirs in the udder of dairy cattle are generally difficult to combat, leading to chronic infections that can persist despite certain treatment strategies with or without antibiotics. Important factors associated with the persistence of bacterial infections of the udder in dairy cattle are epithelial adhesion, the production of biofilm and the susceptibility of bacteria to phagocytosis.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Several strategies have been employed in order to control or prevent mastitis in dairy cows, such as antibiotic treatment and vaccination, to name a few, and to reduce the clinical and economic consequences of the disease. However, most treatments and strategies have little or no effect for ameliorating the disease. Several reasons could account for the lack of efficacy. First, although a number of virulence factors have been suggested as potential antigens for single-component vaccines, experimental trials have demonstrated that induction of immunity to single factors is not sufficient to confer robust protection against bacteria causing mastitis in dairy cows. Second, bacterial antigens suffer from low immunogenicity and require adequate adjuvantion.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Third, a major challenge in the control of mastitis are effective antibiotics able to reach bacterial pools in the udder for instance as a result of the formation of biofilms by bacteria.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Microorganisms, such as bacteria, do not necessarily need to produce a biofilm, but they have much better possibilities to survive in the host if they can adhere, for instance, to epithelial cells. Adhesion is an active process, involving a series of attachments and detachments, with resulting biofilm formation which is accompanied by significant genetic and subsequent physiological changes in the microorganisms resulting, inter alia, in a loss of sensitivity to virtually all classes of antibiotics. Hence, the management of bacterial udder infections is becoming increasingly difficult due to the emergence and increasing prevalence of bacterial pathogens that are resistant to antibiotics. In some cases, low doses of antibiotics can even enhance biofilm formation suggesting a natural defence mechanism of bacteria in avoiding the lethal effects of antibiotics. Due to this complex and problematic situation, mastitis remains one the most important diseases in dairy cattle despite the progress made in improving general udder health in recent years.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In addition, when cattle are frequently or continuously treated with antibiotics the antibiotics and degradation products are also found in the manure. The manure comprising the antibiotics and degradation products are spread over soil. The presence of the antibiotics is shown to affect the bacterial diversity in the soil. This is an undesirable effect to the environment. An alternative composition to treat infections in cattle will prevent the spread of antibiotics through the environment and recovery of the microbiome of the soil.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Although the description of bacterial biofilms can be found in the scientific literature much earlier, the meaning of biofilms became known in 1982, when Costerton observed that <i>Staphylococcus aureus </i>had formed a biofilm on a cardiac pacemaker lead. Subsequent research and clinical observations revealed that bacterial biofilms can be found on implants and catheters, prosthetic devices and other implanted biomaterials. Even more relevant was the observation that microbial biofilms can be formed also on biological surfaces is human and animal tissues such as the periodontal mucosa in the oral cavity (dental plaque), nasal sinuses (chronic sinusitis), the inner ear (otitis media), blood vessels and heart valves (endocarditis), the alveolar surface (multiple lung diseases) or the biliary and urinary bladder.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The first stage of biofilm formation comprises the attachment of cells to a surface. In the second stage, cell multiplication occurs accompanied by the formation of mature structures have many layers of cells. A slime layer is also formed which further protects the bacteria. See, e.g., Melchior et al. Veterinary Journal 2006 171:398-407. Once a critical mass is reached, the outermost cell layer of a biofilm may release &#x2018;planktonic organisms&#x2019;. These organisms may further colonize other surfaces. Biofilms may form on a wide variety of surfaces, including living tissues, indwelling medical devices, industrial or potable water system piping, or natural aquatic systems. As will be understood by a skilled person, not all infections lead to the development of biofilms.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Research in the last 20 years revealed that collective biofilm formation is facilitated by bacterial communication system, denoted as quorum sensing (QS). QS occurs by means of small chemical molecules (so called auto-inducers, AI) permanently excreted by bacteria into their environment. These signalling molecules (for example oligopeptides (AIP) or N-acetyl homoserine lactones (AHL)) are recognized and monitored via specific receptors by other bacteria in their neighbourhood. When a specific density of AIs is reached (a quorum), bacterial cells collectively alter gene expression and either produce virulence factors to attack body cells, or to activate metabolic pathways to form a biofilm at tissue surfaces. Biofilm formation involves the formation of an extracellular matrix consisting of large polymers, initially predominantly polysaccharides, which upon maturation are stabilized by proteins and lipids, resulting in three-dimensional structure.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Once a biofilm infection has been established, it can be very difficult to eradicate. Mature biofilms will intermittently release planktonic cells. This can lead to chronic infections with intermittent exacerbations. While antibiotics or the host's immune response may resolve the symptoms due to planktonic cells, the mature biofilms may remain.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Microbial cells under the protection of a biofilm are often more resistant to antibiotics as well as the body's natural immune responses. Dormant bacteria are metabolically inactive and hence do not express the typical targets of many antibiotics such as synthesis of bacterial cell wall constituents (target for beta-lactam antibiotics such as penicillins and cephalosporins and Vancomycin) and rapid protein (target for Aminoglycosides, Tetracyclines, Macrolides and Linezolid) and DNA synthesis (Fluoroquinolones and Rifampicin) or Folic acid synthesis (Sulfonamides, aminopyrimidines (such as Trimethoprim). Therefore, antibiotic treatment alone is generally not sufficient to eradicate biofilm infections (see also Wu et al. Int J Oral Sci. 2015 March; 7(1): 1-7). While antibiotics may be effective against dispersed (planktonic) bacteria, it is difficult to reach within a biofilm the minimal concentration of antibiotic necessary to eradicate the microorganisms within the biofilm. It has been demonstrated in various in vitro experiments that bacteria growing in a biofilm are 10 to 1,000 times more resistant to various antimicrobial agents when compared to the planktonic bacteria of the same strain (see, e.g., Amorena et al. 1999 J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 44:43-55; Ceri et al., 1999 J. Clin. Microbiol. 37:1771-1776; and Olson et al., 2002 Can. J. Vet. Res. 66:86-92). Olsen et al. reviews various mechanisms of biofilm-induced antibiotic resistance and tolerance (Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis 2015 34:877-886).</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">For bovine mastitis, this has been reported in a study with field strains of <i>Staphylococcus aureus </i>(Melchior, Gaastra &#x26; Fink-Gremmels, J. Vet. Med. 2006 53:326-332). The MIC50, Minimum bacterial concentration (BMIC) and MBEC (minimal biofilm eradicating concentration) were determined for 7 strains isolated from mastitis infected cows. Antibiotics tested included those that are commonly used in the treatment of bovine mastitis such as Penicillin, Amoxycillin, Cloxacillin, Cephalothin, Cefoperazone, Cefquinome, Cloxacillin/Penicillin combination, Cloxacillin/Penicillin combination, Lincomycin, Pirlimycin, Tyrosine, Neomycin, Gentamycin, Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole, Florfenicol, and Danofloxacin. For all antibiotics tested the difference between MIC (planktonic bacteria) and MBEC (biofilm eradication concentrations) differed by more than a factor of 256, and very often more than a factor of 2048.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">There is also evidence that antibiotics may stimulate biofilm formation. For example, some antibiotics (such as tetracyclines, quinopristine-dalfopristins, and erythromycin) may stimulate the expression of genes (e.g, the ica genes) in bacteria which promotes the adherence of the bacteria (Melchior et al., supra). Interestingly, it has been shown that there is a high prevalence of ica genes among <i>S. aureus </i>mastitis isolates (reviewed in Melchior et al., supra). These results support the hypothesis that mammary infections are associated with biofilm formation.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Biofilms can also comprise dormant bacteria. Biofilms employ a number of mechanisms to evade a host's immune response including activating regulators/suppressors that affect immune cell activity and acting as a physical barrier to immune cells (Gonzalez Pathog Dis. 2018 April; 76(3)), but can transit out of dormancy and become active. In general, the immune system only acts against active bacteria and therefore the dormant bacteria can escape the immune system of an individual. Dormant bacteria are able to detach from the biofilm and quickly become active and harmful to the host.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Fungal related biofilms are also known to be more resistant to antifungal drugs as compared to planktonic cells (see, e.g., Fanning and Mitchell PLOS Pathog 2012 8:e1002585 for a review). Accordingly, compounds having antimicrobial effects are not always suited for the treatment or prevention of biofilms.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In a mature biofilm a dormant stage is adopted by downregulating (gene-shift) of primary metabolism. Dormancy encompasses that biofilm bacteria almost entirely suppress the expression of the typical targets for antibiotics, such as protein and DNA synthesis and cell-wall rebuilding. Subsequently biofilms are inherently insensitive to antibiotics and are often upwards 1000-fold more resistant to them than planktonic (free-floating) bacteria. Furthermore, the higher cell densities found in biofilms considerably increases the probability of horizontal gene transfer, which increases the likelihood of the emergence of strains with increased resistance or altered virulence profiles. The clinical outcome is a phenotypic resistance to common (even modern) antibiotics.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the protective environment of such a biofilm, bacterial survival time increases. Moreover, the self-constructed inert polysaccharide-rich matrix is non-immunogenic, protecting the biofilm-embedded bacteria from recognition (via PAMPS&#x2014;pathogen associated molecular patterns) and engulfment by immune cells of the host.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The formation of biofilms can have serious negative consequences in medical, industrial, and natural settings. In particular biofilm-associated infections (i.e., biofilm related disorders) are a serious problem in both humans and animals. Such disorders may be characterized by a chronic inflammatory response with recurrent acute episodes and resistance to antimicrobial therapy and/or host defenses. Wound biofilms delay tissue repair resulting in chronic wounds. It has been suggested that biofilm infections account now for up to 80% of all human microbial infections (Bartell J A et al., 20 Evolutionary highways to persistent bacterial infection. Nature Communications (2019) 10:629 and Sharma et al. 2019 Antimicrobial Resistance and Infection Control 8:76). Jamal et al. reported that the National Institute of Health indicated that 65% of microbial infections and 80% of chronic infections are associated with biofilm formation (Journal of Chinese Medical Association 81:7-11). Biofilms and biofilm-related disorders have been extensively discussed in the literature; see, e.g., Sharma et al. 2019 Antimicrobial Resistance and Infection Control 8:76; Roy et al. 2018 Virulence 9:522-554; and Jamal et al. 2018 Journal of the Chinese Medical Association 81:7-11. Vestby et al. reviews bacterial biofilms and their role in disease (Antibiotics (Basel). 2020 February; 9(2): 59). A comprehensive overview of biofilm infections was presented in 2014 by the European Clinical Society of Microbiology and Infectious Disease, see also David Lebeaux et al. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2014; doi:10.1128/MMBR.00013-14.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">For example, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, an organism that causes nosocomial infections, forms biofilms on surfaces as diverse as cystic fibrosis lung tissue, contact lenses, and catheter lines. <i>P. aeruginosa </i>growing as biofilms have also been found in chronic wounds and can lead to impaired healing of wounds. Biofilms, in particular, <i>P. aeruginosa </i>biofilms, also cause chronic infections in the respiratory diseases such as bronchiectasis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and in chronic rhinosinusitis. Biofilms formed on medical devices serve as a reservoir of bacteria that can be shed into the body, leading to a chronic systemic infection. <i>Candida albicans </i>(a yeast) is the most common fungal biofilm found in hospitals, but is extremely difficult to treat and do not respond well to typical antifungal treatments.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The pioneering studies in bacterial biofilm formation focused on <i>Staphylococcus aureus </i>(Gram-positive) and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </i>(Gram-negative) because of their involvement in recurrent mastitis in dairy cattle and complicated wound infections. In addition, biofilm formation of <i>Streptococcus </i>ssp., avian pathogenic <i>E. coli </i>(APEC) and <i>C. jejuni </i>biofilm gained attention, as these bacterial species are of public health relevance. Subsequently, other important animal pathogens, including <i>Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae </i>(severe lung infections in swine that might become lethal), <i>Escherichia coli </i>(local and systemic infections and systemic septicaemia, which often is a lethal in poultry), skin and enteric diseases in dogs and cats and wound infections and endometritis in horses were recognized as biofilm infections. This list is non-exclusive as biofilm formation is a general trait of almost all micro-organisms.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Accordingly, a need exists for alternative treatments of biofilm-related disorders.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The disclosure provides the following preferred embodiments.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">1.

Both compounds PTS and PTSO are also commercially available.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0075">In some embodiments, the compounds are obtained from natural sources such as plants. Compounds can be extracted from plant material in various ways. The appropriate method depends on the chemical properties of the compounds. For example, the extraction can start with a non-polar solvent and follow that with solvents of increasing polarity. Alternatively, the compounds of the plant can be extracted in alcohol. Such extractions may contain e.g., around 80% PTSO and around 20% PTS. In preferred embodiments, the compositions disclosed herein comprise PTSO and PTS at a ratio of at least 3:1, preferably at around 4:1 by weight. While not wishing to be bound by theory, the disclosure provides that the anti-biofilm activities are primarily due to PTSO.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0076">Garlic extracts have previously been described for use in dietary supplements. Garlic is an herb that is grown around the world. It is related to onion, leeks, and chives. Garlic extracts and especially the compounds allicin have been studied for its potential to treat various kinds of diseases. It is most commonly used for conditions related to the heart and blood system. These conditions include high blood pressure, high levels of cholesterol or other fats in the blood, and hardening of the arteries.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0077">For example, Garlicon is a tablet comprising garlic extract. It is described as a garlic powder dried under controlled temperature, in a special dosage form, namely enteric coated tablets. This coating protects the tablet during the passage through the stomach and dissolves in the small intestine to release the content. Garlicon is presented as to protect from the risk of high serum cholesterol levels and heart diseases. In addition, EP 2110128 discloses the use of Alliaceae derived compounds as natural additive in animal feed as an alternative for antibiotics.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0078">In contrast to garlic extracts which comprise a large number of different compounds, with PTSO being a minor component, the compositions provided herein preferably comprises PTSO at a higher concentration than natural garlic extracts. In addition, while natural garlic extracts contain a large number of different substances, each having a different (sometimes unwanted) effect, the compositions provided herein are useful to provide PTSO without any unwanted side effects of other components in garlic extract. In addition, compositions that are enriched for PTSO allow higher dosing.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0079">For example, garlic extract has a strong odor. When animals are provided with such garlic extracts, these odors are also found in animal products such as milk and eggs. Consumers perceive products having these odors as spoiled and such odors can also influence the taste of such products. In practice, animal products collected while using garlic extract would normally need to be disposed of. Ingestion of garlic extract by humans can lead to body odor and bad breath.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0080">In contrast, the therapeutic compounds disclosed herein preferably do not have the negative effects of garlic extract described above. For example, for farm animals this had a large commercial advantage in that the resulting animal products (such as milk and eggs) are suitable for consumers. In some embodiments, the disclosure provides methods comprising administering to an individual in need thereof a composition as disclosed herein, wherein said treatment does not result in body odor, bad breath, the presence of abnormal odors in bodily fluids (such as milk), or in the case of avians, does not result in abnormal odors in eggs, or at least to a lesser extent as garlic extract.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0081">The disclosure provides compositions comprising the compounds as disclosed herein, in particular compositions comprising compounds having formula I and/or compounds having formula II. Preferably, such compositions are substantially free of diallyl thiosulfinate. Diallyl thiosulfinate is better known under the name Allicin. Allicin is an organosulfur compound. When fresh garlic is chopped or crushed, the enzyme alliinase converts alliin into allicin, which is responsible for the aroma of fresh garlic. The allicin generated is unstable and quickly changes into a series of other sulfur-containing compounds such as diallyl disulfide. A single garlic clove has about 5 mg to 18 mg of allicin.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0082">As used herein, &#x201c;substantially free&#x201d; refers to compositions comprising less than 5 wt % of diallyl thiosulfinate. In some embodiments the compositions comprise less than 1 wt % of diallyl thiosulfinate, preferably less than 0.5 wt % diallyl thiosulfinate. In some embodiments, the composition comprises a ratio of therapeutic thiosulfur compounds (e.g., PTSO and PTS) to diallyl thiosulfinate by weight of at least 10:1, more preferably of at least 100:1.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0083">The compositions of the present disclosure are also preferably substantially free of diallyl-disulfide. In some embodiments the compositions comprise less than 1 wt % of diallyl thiosulfinate, preferably less than 0.5 wt % diallyl thiosulfinate. In some embodiments, the composition comprises a ratio of compounds having formula I and/or formula II (e.g., PTSO and PTS) to diallyl-disulfide by weight of at least 10:1, more preferably of at least 100:1.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0084">In some embodiments, compositions are provided wherein at least 50%, preferably at least 90% by weight of the active ingredients are compounds according to formula I, II, or III as disclosed herein.

In some embodiments, compositions are provided wherein the only active ingredients are compounds according to formula I or II, optionally including further antimicrobial agents and/or anti-inflammatory agents.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0085">The compounds disclosed herein and compositions comprising same are useful in the treatment or prevention of infection. For example, particular uses are for the treatment or prevention of respiratory infection, bowel infection, breast infection, udder infection, skin infection, bladder infection, ear infection, systemic infection, joint infection, brain infection.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0086">As used herein, &#x201c;infection&#x201d; refers to, e.g., pathogenic infections which can lead to disease. In particular, such infections are bacterial or fungal infections. In a preferred embodiment, the infection is a bacterial infection. Bacteria and fungi are found almost everywhere and exist in very diverse forms. Most are not harmful and are actually indispensable for life on earth and essential for plant, animal and human health. For example, the microbiome in the intestines of humans and animals where bacteria and fungi live as symbionts with their host is the so-called gut flora. Also, bacteria are naturally present on the skin, which form part of the immune system. Another example is the soil biology, which for the most part consists of bacteria and fungi. Some bacteria and fungi can cause pathogenic infections, for example in animals, or humans. These pathological infections can lead to disease and illness of the infected individual.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0087">As used herein, &#x201c;treatment of infection&#x201d; refers to a reduction in the severity and/or duration of the infection and/or a reduction of the severity and/or duration of symptoms from the infection. Preferably, said treatment results in restoration of the health of an individual. Preferably, the individual has less disease symptoms or for a shorter time. As used herein, &#x201c;prevention of infection&#x201d; refers to the prevention of or alternatively delaying the onset of infection or of one or more symptoms associated with infection.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0088">Some microorganisms, such as bacteria, microalgae, fungi, etc., can form biofilms. The compounds disclosed herein are also useful in the prevention or reduction of biofilm formation or growth and/or for degradation or reduction of biofilms. Preferably, the compounds, and compositions comprising same, are useful in the treatment or prevention of biofilm-related disorders.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0089">The term biofilm was initially used in technical and environmental microbiology to describe a community of sessile bacteria and other microorganisms attached to natural or artificial surfaces. The formation of a microbial biofilms is initiated by the colonization of bacteria on a surface to which they attach and produce a slimy film consisting of organic polymers. This primary bacterial film attracts other microorganisms such as algae and protozoa, fungi and protozoa resulting in the formation of a visible multispecies biofilm. Such three-dimensional biofilms are ubiquitous in nature and found on all surfaces that are in contact with water. Of public health concern are microbial biofilms in municipal water supplies and household water pipelines and devices. The efficacy of compounds according to formula I, II, and III on such multispecies environmental biofilms is demonstrated in examples 2 and 3.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0090">As used herein, the term &#x201c;biofilm&#x201d; refers to a population of microorganisms that are concentrated at an interface (usually solid/liquid) and typically surrounded by an extracellular polymeric slime matrix. Biofilms may form on living or non-living surfaces and are found in natural, industrial and hospital settings. Biofilms can contain many different types of micro-organisms, e.g. bacteria, archaea, protozoa, fungi and algae. Preferably, such biofilms comprise bacteria, microalgae (such as <i>Prototheca </i>spp.) or fungi.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0091">As used herein, &#x201c;treatment of a biofilm-related disorder&#x201d;, also referred to herein as a &#x201c;biofilm associated disorder&#x201d;, refers to a reduction in the severity and/or duration of the disorder and/or a reduction of the severity and/or duration of symptoms from the disorder, in particular the symptoms of infection. Preferably, said treatment results in restoration of the health of an individual. Preferably, the individual has less disease symptoms or for a shorter time.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0092">As used herein, &#x201c;prevention or reduction of biofilm formation or growth&#x201d; refers to the prevention, delay, or reduction of biofilm formation or growth. As will be understood by a skilled person, such reduction of biofilm formation or growth may slow the growth of biofilms as compared to the growth of untreated biofilms. Preferably, the compositions are useful for reducing biofilm formation or growth. As used herein, &#x201c;degradation or reduction of biofilms&#x201d; refers to the elimination, either partially or completely, of a biofilm. As will be understood by a skilled person, after such treatment, planktonic bacteria may still be present.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0093">The compounds disclosed herein may be capable of disrupting the structure of the biofilm, for example the extracellular mucous matrix. In some embodiments, the compounds are useful for inhibiting cell adhesion. In particular, the compounds may prevent the adhesion (without killing bacteria) to a static or live surface of all cell types encountered in microbial biofilms in particular free living microbes.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0094">While not wishing to be bound by theory, the present disclosure proposes that the therapeutic compounds disclosed herein may exert part of their effects by affecting quorum sensing. Quorum Sensing (QS) signalling plays an important role in the control of e.g. the expression of bacterial virulence factors. QS involves the accumulation of signalling molecules in the surrounding environment which enables a single cell to sense the density of the number of bacteria and the signalling molecules, and therefore the bacterial population as a whole, can make a coordinated response.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0095">These cell-cell communication systems regulate various functions of the bacteria such as motility, virulence, sporulation, antibiotic production, DNA exchange, and development of more complex multicellular structures such as biofilm. Therefore, the interference with QS signalling systems might offer a new strategy to combat persisting (chronic) bacterial infections. The ability of certain substances, such as naturally occurring compounds that have Quorum Quenching (QQ) abilities can be used as anti-adhesive compounds and as compounds that interfere with biofilm formation.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0096">The compounds disclosed herein are particularly useful for treating biofilm-related disorders, wherein the disorder is characterized by a chronic and/or persistent infection. Persistent infection and chronic infection are often used interchangeably, but are based on different mechanisms. Persistent infections are normally held in check by immune defenses but may be activated when such immune defenses are weakened. Persistent infections are often asymptomatic and become clinically visible only when the immune defense fails to control the pathogen. Although persistent infections are often asymptomatic, a skilled person is well aware of means to detect such persistent infections, including e.g., detecting microorganisms from patient samples (e.g., blood or urine). In a chronic infection, pathogens remain in a group of cells/parts of tissue (e.g., joints or lung tissue). The patient always has symptoms of disease, although these might be milder that in the acute phase of infection.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0097">The most prominent examples of a biofilm disease remain bovine mastitis. Bovine mastitis is the clinical term for infections of the mammary gland of cows and can be caused by multiple pathogens, the most prevalent forms are <i>Staphylococcus aureaus, Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus agalactia, Streptococcus dysgalactiae </i>as well as <i>Serratia marescens </i>and other facultative pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae and <i>Prototheca </i>spp, the latter considered as an emerging pathogen causing an aggressive, non-curable mastitis in many regions of the world. The invention encompasses treating biofilms comprising such microorganisms with the compounds and compositions disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0098">The examples herein describe the surprising efficacy of PTSO in various field trials in cows demonstrating its broad activity in biofilm infections. Another prominent example of biofilm infection are chronic non-healing wound infections. Digital dermatitis, a known biofilm associated disease in cattle serves as an example for such a delayed wound healing process and was successfully treated with PTSO (see example 7). In some embodiments, the wounds treated by the compound of the inventio comprise, for example, <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>; Streptococci; gram negative bacteria, for example <i>Treponema </i>spp., <i>Escherichia coli, Yersiania pestis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>; or yeast/fungi, for example <i>Candida </i>spp (<i>albicans</i>), <i>Cladosporidium herbarum, Trichosporum, Rhodosporidium</i>, and <i>Malassezia. </i></p><p id="p-0122" num="0099">It is now generally recognized that biofilm-associated microorganisms cause a large number of infections including endocarditis, osteomyelitis, sinusitis, urinary tract infections, chronic prostatitis, periodontitis, chronic lung infection in cystic fibrosis patients, middle ear infections, and various nosocomial infections, especially those related to all known indwelling devices (catheters, implants). The burden of biofilm-disease is significant and represents a major concern in medical care.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0100">While almost all bacterial species are now known to be able to form biofilms under conditions of stress, in current clinical practice several bacterial and fungal species are of major interest, as the associated infections are almost entirely therapy-resistant even if the non-biofilm, planktonic form of the same species and strains show a very good sensitivity to common therapeutic agents (antibiotic and antimycotics/fungicidal agents).</p><p id="p-0124" num="0101">Examples of pathogens which are of major clinical concern due to their biofilm associated therapy-resistance are listed below:</p><p id="p-0125" num="0102"><i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i>&#x2014;Lung aspergillosis (fungal disease)</p><p id="p-0126" num="0103"><i>Burkholderia </i>cepacian&#x2014;pulmonary cystic fibrosis superinfections</p><p id="p-0127" num="0104"><i>Candida </i>spp (Yeast)&#x2014;mucosal surfaces of the gastro-intestinal and urogenital tract</p><p id="p-0128" num="0105"><i>Gardnerella vaginalis </i>(urogenital tract)</p><p id="p-0129" num="0106"><i>Escherichia coli </i>(multiple organs and septicaemia)</p><p id="p-0130" num="0107"><i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </i>(multiple organs and lung infections including cystic fibrosis)</p><p id="p-0131" num="0108"><i>Staphylococcus aureus </i>(multiple tissues and wound infections, nosocomial infections)</p><p id="p-0132" num="0109"><i>Staphylococcus epidermidis </i>(multiple tissues and wound infections)</p><p id="p-0133" num="0110"><i>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia </i>(chronic respiratory tract diseases).</p><p id="p-0134" num="0111">The treatment of such biofilm-related disorders and biofilm-associated microorganisms is encompassed by the invention.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0112">Microbial biofilms are not only formed by bacteria, but also by other microorganisms, particularly pathogenic fungi (<i>Aspergillus fumigatus </i>a major cause of multiple <i>Aspergillus</i>-related lung diseases) and yeasts (<i>Candida </i>spp) colonizing of mucosal surfaces of the gastro-intestinal and uro-genital tract. The most prevalent implant-related biofilms are formed by <i>Staphylococcus aureus </i>(MSSA and MRSA), <i>Candida albicans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia</i>, and <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i>.

Int J Oral Sci. 2015 March; 7(1): 1-7). Such biofilm disorders may lead to chronic infections. The determination of acute versus chronic infection is also known to the practitioner. For example, according to the Mayo Clinic, the occurrence of a yeast infection 4 or more times within a year indicates the presence of a chronic yeast infection whereas the occurrence of two or more bladder infections during a 6-month period indicates the presence of a chronic bladder infection (also referred to as recurrent urinary tract infection).</p><p id="p-0145" num="0122">The most common method to treat a pathological infection of bacteria is the use of antibiotics. Current antibiotics operate primarily through growth-dependent mechanisms and target rapidly-dividing bacteria. However, non-replicative or slower growing bacteria (e.g., dormant persister cells, biofilms) display high levels of antibiotic tolerance and/or resistance contributing to persistent and recurring infection. The compounds disclosed herein are suitable for the use in infections or biofilms comprising antibiotic resistant bacteria, antibiotic tolerant bacteria, and antibiotic persistent bacteria. The compounds disclosed herein are also suitable as a second-line therapy, or rather for individuals that did not response to previous treatment (e.g., antimicrobial treatment) or the disorder returned within e.g., one year or 6 months.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0123">The disclosure further provides the compounds as disclosed herein and compositions comprising same for treating any disorder induced by or relating to biofilms.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0124">Disorders induced by or relating to biofilms are well-known to a skilled person. In particular, such disorders are biofilm-related infections. Suitable disorders for treatment include, for example, bacterial prostatitis, bacterial vaginosis, biliary tract infections, chronic sinusitis, chronic lung disease, dental caries, endocarditis, kidney stones, laryngitis, lung infection in cystic fibrosis, gingivitis mastitis, middle ear infections, nonsocomial (bloodstream) infections, obstructive pulmonary diseases, osteomyelitis, otitis media, periodontitis, pneumonia prostatitis, rhinosinusitis, sinusitis, tonsillitis, tuberculosis, urinary tract infections, and wound infections. For example, <i>Mycoplasma Bovis </i>is known to cause udder infection and joint infection. Biofilm-related disorders also include disorders caused by biofilms formed on indwelling devices (e.g., medical implants, catheters, etc.). Generally, such disorders are treated by removing/replacing the implant. In a preferred embodiment the disorder is mastitis. In some embodiments, the disorder is not mastitis. In some embodiments the treatment is not for inflammatory bowel disease and in particular is not colitis.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0125">The compounds and compositions as disclosed herein are also useful for treating and preventing infections of implanted medical devices such as joint prosthesis and heart valves as disclosed further herein.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0126">The compounds of the invention are shown to have an effect in the udder of the cow. This indicates that the compounds can pass the blood-milk barrier. The blood-milk barrier if formed by less-permeable tight junctions between mammary epithelial cells to prevent the leakage of milk. Passing the tight barrier between the blood stream and milk indicates that the compounds can also pass the blood-brain barrier and treat infections of the brain and pass the intestinal epithelium allowing for treatment of biofilm-related disorders systemically. The data from the examples also demonstrates the safety and efficacy in vivo, including pharmacokinetic properties that make the compounds suitable for therapy.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0127">The disclosure further provides the compounds as disclosed herein and compositions comprising same for preventing or reducing a inflammation in response to bacterial infection or biofilms. Inflammation is part of the complex biological response of body tissues to harmful stimuli, such as pathogens, and is a protective response involving immune cells and molecular mediators. A function of inflammation is to eliminate the pathogens.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0128">In a preferred embodiment treatment of an individual with the compounds as disclosed herein or compositions comprising same prevents or reduces a clinical inflammation in an animal, preferably a cow. Preferably the treatment prevents or reduces a (clinical) inflammation of the udder. In another embodiment, treatment of an individual with the compounds and compositions comprising same prevents or reduces a (clinical) inflammation in a human. For example, the treatment prevents or reduces inflammation of the skin, preferably prevents eczema.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0129">While not wishing to be bound by theory, treatment of an individual with the compounds as disclosed herein, or compositions comprising same, reduces biofilm formation or growth and/or causes degradation or reduction of biofilms Therefore, the individual no longer responds with an inflammatory reaction in the presence of the pathogens. With other words, clearance of the biofilms and pathogens within these biofilms reduces the inflammation response and prevents a clinical inflammation.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0130">During treatment of a biofilm, the microorganisms (such as bacteria and fungi) are released from the biofilm. In some cases, the individual's immune system will respond to the active microorganism. This may result in inflammation of the tissue. The activated immune cells and the inflammatory response can also damage the tissue, for example in the milk gland. Suppression of the inflammatory response may therefore prevent or reduce damage to the tissue. For example, the milk gland is less damaged and the milk production of the cow will recover faster.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0131">Furthermore, after tissue has been damaged and the inflammation has ended, the body starts the repair. The macrophages still present stimulate the production of new blood vessels. They also ensure the attraction of fibroblasts. These fibroblasts ultimately cause the formation of granulation tissue. For example, in the case of treatment of a dairy cow, scar tissue may be formed instead of milk producing tissue. The milk production of the cow may therefore be lower than before the inflammation.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0132">In addition to the compounds described herein, further anti-inflammatory drugs can be administered to suppress the inflammatory response and reduce the tissue damage, for example in the milk gland. In a preferred embodiment, the treatments disclosed herein (both therapeutic and prophylactic) further comprise the administration of an anti-inflammatory agent. Anti-inflammatory agents include, for example, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (cox/lox inhibitors) such as ibuprofen, paracetamol, aspirin, diclofenac, ketoprofen, tolmetin, etodolac, and fenoprofen. Natural anti-inflammatory agents such as Curcumin, Ginger, <i>Spirulina</i>, Cayenne, Cinnamon, Clove, Sage, Rosemary, Black Pepper, natural aspirins, Boswelia, <i>Sanguinaria</i>, and/or Green Tea may also be used. In some embodiments, the methods and uses disclosed herein comprise the combined treatment of the therapeutic thiosulfur compounds disclosed herein with an anti-inflammatory agent.

These examples do not limit the scope of the invention, but merely serve to clarify the invention.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading><p id="p-0184" num="0161">Several compounds isolated from <i>Allium </i>have been studied in vitro in order to determine their effect on bacteria with the aim to develop alternatives for antibiotics. For example, Sorlozano-Puerto et al. (Biomed Research International 2018 Article ID 7861207) describes the antibacterial activity of PTS and PTSO against a large number of human pathogens (212 gram-negative bacilli and 267 gram-positive cocci isolated from clinical samples obtained from 479 different patient) using the recommended standard method (CLSI) to determine the MIC50 and MIC90 values, as well as the MBC50 and MBC90 values (the latter are used to demonstrate a direct bactericidal effect) as measure of antibacterial potency. Data for PTSO and PTS were compared against a range of antibiotics used in clinical practice against such pathogens. Results show that for all bacterial strains, several antibiotics out of the test panel were more effective than PTSO or PTS as indicated by lower MIC values of the antibiotic. Based on these in vitro findings, a skilled person would not consider PTSO or PTS as a useful alternative to common antibiotics in the treatment of bacterial infections.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0162">The in vitro assays described in Sorlozano-Puerto et al. measure growth inhibition of planktonic microorganisms. As will be appreciated by a skilled person, the effect of a compound against planktonic microorganisms is not indicative of the effect of such compounds against a biofilm. This has been demonstrated for a number of antimicrobials as previously discussed herein and is also well-known in the literature. See, e.g., Roy et al. which indicates that bacteria in biofilms have increased resistance against conventional antibiotics by around 1000 fold (2018 Virulence 9:522-554).</p><p id="p-0186" num="0163">In contrast to studies concerned with planktonic microorganisms, the present experiments demonstrate for the first time the effect of PTSO and PTS on biofilms. In such assays media and culture conditions (constant agitation of the plates to induce stress by shear force comparable to what happens in a blood stream) stimulate microorganisms, such as bacteria, to rapidly form a biofilm. Such a biofilm assay can be conducted in two ways: by adding the test compound (e.g., PTSO) from the beginning of the experiment to assess its potential to prevent biofilm formation, or by adding the test compound to a mature biofilm to evaluate the biofilm dissolution effect (corresponding to, e.g., example 2 in which an existing biofilm was treated with PTSO).</p><p id="p-0187" num="0164">The main mechanisms of action of a compound in a biofilm assay is related to either its inhibition of quorum sensing and the following collective gene switch resulting in adhesion of bacteria and the synthesis or to the assembly of extracellular matrix to form the 3-dimensional structure of a biofilm. These mechanisms are entirely different from a pure antibacterial/antimicrobial &#x201c;killing&#x201d; effect. If a compound, tested effectively in a biofilm assay, but has no antibacterial effect (such as certain antibodies developed against specific biofilm proteins to destabilize the biofilm structure), then the compound may be combined with an antibiotic to ensure that the bacteria released from the biofilm are killed. This is especially the case if the immune system of the animal is compromised. If a substance, such as PTSO, has some antibacterial efficacy (albeit by other mechanisms) this would be a considered as a desirable additional effect in clinical therapy, supporting the eradication of a bacterial population by the innate immune system.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0165">Examples 2-4 describe the effect of compounds of the invention using in vitro biofilm assays. Such assays are quite different from assays such as those described in Sorlozano-Puerto et al. which measure growth inhibition of planktonic microorganisms. The present examples surprisingly demonstrate that compounds of the invention have an effect on biofilm eradication.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Example 1 Isolation of PTSO and PTS</heading><p id="p-0189" num="0166">Scope: PTSO and PTS was isolated from a plant extract comprising 56% PTSO and 14% PTS (herein referred to as &#x201c;PTSO/PTS enriched plant extract&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0190" num="0167">Study design: the order of elution of compounds according to their polarity is estimated from HPLC and the condition for separation are developed on TLC using heptane and ethylacetate as mobile phase.

The disease is caused by a variety of very different bacteria and in some cases yeasts that invade the mammary gland of lactating cows, causing a persistent infection and an inflammatory response. Bovine mastitis can be caused various Gram-positive as well as Gram-negative pathogens and the prevalence of individual pathogens may vary to some extent between countries and continents. The most prominent clinical sign of all forms of mastitis is an undesirable increase in the number of somatic cells in the milk intended for human consumption caused by a (chronic) inflammatory response of the udder tissue. This secondary inflammation decreases milk production and hence causes serious economic losses for the farmer. Over the last decades, numerous pharmaceutical products have been introduced into the marked containing different classes of antibiotics, given alone or in combination to treat the primary infectious agents diagnosed as a cause of mastitis. These pharmaceutical products are given systemically (by injection) or locally via the teat channel to fight the bacterial infections. However, despite these great efforts, bovine mastitis remains the most prevalent disease in dairy cow, as antibiotic therapy in generally only temporarily effective and, in many causes, somatic cell counts (SCC), as a clinical marker of mastitis remained high and affected adversely milk yield.</p><p id="p-0243" num="0211">Mastitis is a known biofilm-related disorder. The formation of bacterial biofilms has been demonstrated in in vitro experiments cultivating mastitis pathogen under conditions favoring bacterial biofilm formation (quantifiable after staining and by measuring the genes that drive biofilm formation) as well as in situ by staining the biofilm matrix in the infected bovine udder tissue. For example, FIG. 1 of Sch&#xf6;nborn S and Kromker V (2016 Journal Veterinary Microbiology, 30; 196:126-128) which depicts a biofilm matrix from udder tissue from cows suffering from mastitis.</p><p id="p-0244" num="0212">Biomedical research of the last decennia revealed that biofilm formation is not only occurring in cases of udder infection and bovine mastitis but is a general trait of microorganisms invading human and animal tissues and causing persistent infections and inflammation. To date, microbial biofilms are one of the major unresolved challenges in modern therapy of infectious diseases in humans and animals. Clinical evidence provided in the examples below revealed an unexpected therapeutic effect of PTSO (and to a lesser extent its derivative PTS) in the treatment of important biofilm diseases such as bovine mastitis and infected chronic wounds (e.g., digital dermatitis and UCD). Several field trails are described which demonstrate that the application of PTSO is directly related to a long-lasting stable decrease of somatic cell counts in treated cows, suggesting bacterial cure and tissue regeneration. Further examples describe the effects on biofilm-related chronic wounds (i.e., digital dermatitis and Udder Cleft Dermatitis (UCD).</p><p id="p-0245" num="0213">These findings are remarkable, as it is generally recognized that common antibiotics fail to be effective against biofilm infections. These observations are described in numerous scientific articles from human and veterinary medicine, all suggesting the formation of biofilms as the major cause of recurrent and persistent infections and tissue inflammation and damage. The presented experimental (in vitro) and in vivo (clinical observations) efficacy of PTSO and PTS against prototypical biofilm infections demonstrates that these compounds can effectively be used in clinical practice to prevent and resolve biofilm infections. Biofilm formation and resolution occurs as a direct interaction between the molecules and microbes and is therefore independent of the host (animal or human). As the mechanism involved in biofilm formation are highly conserved between bacterial species, it can be assumed also that the compounds are effective against a broad spectrum of biofilm infections in humans and animals. The examples also demonstrate that PTSO and PTS can be administered orally and exert effects at distinct sites (e.g., mammary glands and claws).</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">Example 5 Mastitis</heading><p id="p-0246" num="0214">Scope</p><p id="p-0247" num="0215">Experiments were performed to examine the effect of a tablet that contains 3.84 g PTSO plus 0.96 gram PTS on the cell count or somatic cell count (SCC) in milk. The SCC is related with the amount of pathogens that are in the quarter visible for the immune system. The cell count of each cow was measured with the milk production registration (MPR). This MPR is done periodically every 30-40 days at all farms.</p><p id="p-0248" num="0216">The Somatic Cell Count (SCC) is a main indicator of milk quality. The majority of somatic cells are leukocytes (white blood cells)&#x2014;which become present in increasing numbers in milk usually as an immune response to a mastitis-causing pathogen&#x2014;and a small number of epithelial cells, which are milk-producing cells shed from inside of the udder when an infection occurs. Inflammation often takes place in one of the udder quarters, resulting in the cell count to rise in this udder. However due to the dilution with the other quarters of the udders the total increase in cell count will be lower. The SCC is quantified as the number of cells per ml of milk. SCC gives an indication of the presence of an (subclinical) udder infection with pathogens causing for instance mastitis and a main indicator of milk quality. The relationship of SCC and mastitis is reviewed in Sharma et al., 2011 Asian-Aust J Anim Sci 24:429-438.</p><p id="p-0249" num="0217">SCC and MPR</p><p id="p-0250" num="0218">The SCC data was extracted from milk production registrations (MPRs). MPRs are databases showing all details (e.g. SCC) of the produced milk per individual cow. MPRs of the selected farms were available periodically every 30-40 days. SCC is quantified as the number of cells per ml of milk. In general terms: an individual cow with a value for SCC of 100,000 or less indicates an &#x2018;uninfected&#x2019; cow and there were no significant production losses due to subclinical mastitis. A threshold SCC of 150,000 would determine whether a cow is infected with mastitis. Cows with a result of greater than 150,000 are highly likely to be infected on at least one quarter. Cows infected with significant pathogens have an SCC of 300,000 or greater.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">Examples 5.1</heading><p id="p-0251" num="0219">Examination on cell count in 18 cows with the above described tablet.</p><p id="p-0252" num="0220">Examination on cell count in 9 cows with the above described tablet and a comparison with 11 non-treated cows.</p><p id="p-0253" num="0221">Three farms were selected for the study.

It was very surprising because this clearly showed that that PTSO/PTS is absorbed by the intestine, followed by entering the bloodstream. PTSO/PTS was given orally in the mastitis clinical trials described herein. As a clinically significant effect was observed in the udder tissue, this suggest that PTSO/PTS is not only passing the rumen (indicating stability to rumen microorganisms), but also reaches the post-hepatic blood stream (indicating minor or insignificant hepatic biotransformation and inactivation), and ultimately the mammary gland in a concentration that is therapeutically effective. This example that the tablet is reducing effectively the SCC and therefore a good therapeutic effect on udder related infections. Furthermore, all cows showed a lower SCC than 150,000 cell/ml after MPR 3, which indicates the effectiveness on all individual cows in this study.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="1">Example 5.2</heading><p id="p-0262" num="0231">For the analysis Farm 1 and Farm 2 were used as indicated below.

After treatment, from the infections on t is 0 pathogen reduction was observed from 10 quarters with pathogen detection on day 1, to 7 quarters on day 14/15. Pathogens were still observed (reduction by 3 quarters, corresponding to 30%) and on day 42/43/44 the original pathogens were still detected in 3 quarters that corresponded to a reduction by 7 quarters (is 70%) of the originally infected quarters. However, in the time interval of the experiment 7 cows were infected with other pathogenic bacteria and these cows had to be retreated (results not shown). In all cows the somatic cell counts decreased on day 7 after the treatment. Since the SCC is a generally accepted measure for the level of inflammation, the treatment had a clear inhibiting effect on the inflammation. Interestingly, the SCC numbers were already significantly lowered on day 7 after the treatment and after 36-55 days, an average reduction in the number of cells by 45% (from 685,000 to 378,000 cells/ml) was demonstrated.</p><p id="p-0322" num="0295">However, in most of the cases the pathogens were still detectable. Furthermore, clods of biofilm were leaving the udder from day 2 in a high rate and was (completely removed. This strongly indicated that biofilm is responsible for the inflammation, and not the planktonic cells that were still present in the udder. The number of planktonic cells decreased with time until they are not detectable any more, and this decrease can only be caused by the response of the action of the immune system. This demonstrated that removing the biofilm without killing the cells, is sufficient to control inflammation, and the immune system is responsible for controlling the infection.</p><p id="p-0323" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00020" num="00020"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 20</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Development of somatic cell counts per cow and presence </entry></row><row><entry>of pathogens per udder quarter after treatment with tablets </entry></row><row><entry>that contains 3.84 g PTSO plus 0.96 gram PTS.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="6"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="28pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>cow </entry><entry>MPR*</entry><entry>MPR</entry><entry>MPR</entry><entry>MPR</entry></row><row><entry>Farm</entry><entry>number</entry><entry>&#x2212;2</entry><entry>&#x2212;1</entry><entry>&#x2212;0</entry><entry>+1**</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="6" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="6"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="35pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="42pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="35pt" align="char" char="."/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>1</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>70</entry><entry>137</entry><entry>456</entry><entry>382</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>2</entry><entry>38</entry><entry>238</entry><entry>388</entry><entry>126</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>3</entry><entry>195</entry><entry>356</entry><entry>366</entry><entry>264</entry></row><row><entry>2</entry><entry>4</entry><entry>25</entry><entry>40</entry><entry>2244</entry><entry>553</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>5</entry><entry>292</entry><entry>1726</entry><entry>1320</entry><entry>1076</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>6</entry><entry>31</entry><entry>262</entry><entry>733</entry><entry>491</entry></row><row><entry>3</entry><entry>7</entry><entry>173</entry><entry>1303</entry><entry>453</entry><entry>251</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>8</entry><entry>233</entry><entry>423</entry><entry>403</entry><entry>342</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>9</entry><entry>92</entry><entry>598</entry><entry>445</entry><entry>263</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>10</entry><entry>93</entry><entry>123</entry><entry>407</entry><entry>275</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>11</entry><entry>56</entry><entry>26</entry><entry>579</entry><entry>317</entry></row><row><entry>4</entry><entry>12</entry><entry>2540</entry><entry>749</entry><entry>502</entry><entry>348</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>13</entry><entry>n.r.***</entry><entry>577</entry><entry>636</entry><entry>224</entry></row><row><entry>5</entry><entry>14</entry><entry>369</entry><entry>466</entry><entry>658</entry><entry>374</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="6" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="6" align="left" id="FOO-00002">*MPR (milk production record) &#xd7; 1000; **MPR on day 7</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0324" num="0296">Furthermore, an evaluation of the pathogen (pathogen) detection or the pathogen persistence in the individual quarters was carried out. 20 quarters with cell elevation from 19 cows from 6 farms were examined (milk sample, cultural approach).

Valessa et al, Cienc. Rural vol. 49 no. 2 Santa Maria Feb. 28, 2019). Mastitis caused by <i>Prototheca zopfii </i>has been described in various countries and is increasing worldwide and represents a serious problem due to the inherent resistance to routine therapy of these microalgae (Pieper et al., 2012. J. Dairy Sci. 95:5635-5644). This resistance is associated with the ability to infect and survive in macrophages and to invade mammary tissue, making them responsible for a persistent infection with regular occurrence of <i>P. zopfii </i>in milk (Marques et al., 2006, J. Dairy Sci. 89:4202-4204). Furthermore, it is observed that they can form biofilms in the udder (Shahid et al. 2020<i>, Sci Rep </i>10, 698).</p><p id="p-0327" num="0299">Transmission of <i>Prototheca </i>spp. takes place between infected and healthy cows during milking, the regular and intensive treatment with antibiotics (Pieper et al., 2012), and lack of hygiene during premilking preparation of cows. Furthermore, <i>P. zopfii </i>survive in feces and contaminates every environment.</p><p id="p-0328" num="0300">In the dairy environments, surfaces such as stainless steel, glass, rubber and polypropylene are contaminated by microorganisms.

Therefore, culling cows infected with <i>P. zopfii </i>is one of the recommended, if not the only control measure to reduce the disease.</p><p id="p-0330" num="0302">Scope: in a practical study to (sub)clinical mastitis, carried out in Upper Bavaria, a total of 14 cows with mastitis were presented for changes with respect to the development of cell numbers before and after the administration of a tablet that contains 4.8 g PTSO plus 1.2 gram PTS.

In all cows the somatic cell counts decreased on day 7 after the treatment. Since the SCC is a measure for the level of inflammation as a consequence of infection, the treatment had a clear inhibiting effect on the inflammation. Interestingly, the SCC numbers were already significantly lowered on day 7 after the treatment and after 36-55 days, an average reduction in the number of cells by 45% (from 685,000 to 378,000 cells/ml) was demonstrated.</p><p id="p-0337" num="0308">Furthermore, an evaluation of the pathogen (pathogen) detection or the pathogen persistence in the individual quarters was carried out. 20 quarters with cell elevation from 19 cows from 6 farms were examined (milk sample, cultural approach).

Digital Dermatitis</heading><p id="p-0339" num="0310">Another category of chronical infections are wounds that are infected by biofilm-forming microorganisms. Once the wound is infected, the microorganisms start to form a biofilm that remains attached to the wounds. The production of microbial EPS (Extracellular Polymeric Substances) helps the biofilm to form a complex, three-dimensional structure within a few hours. These complex structures are resistant to defence mechanisms in the wound. When antibiotics are applied to attack bacteria, they may only partially eradicate the biofilm and the wound and underlying tissues remain infected. These biofilms are known to lead to chronic infections and non-healing wounds. In the United States, around 16 million new biofilm-based infections are diagnosed every year. Hence biofilms constitute a major obstacle to wound healing. Examples of such wounds infecting pathogenic microorganisms are bacteria (Gram positive bacteria, for example <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>; Streptococci; gram negative bacteria, for example <i>Treponema </i>spp., <i>Escherichia coli, Yersiania pestis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>; yeast/fungi, for example <i>Candida </i>spp (<i>albicans</i>), <i>Cladosporidium herbarum, Trichosporum, Rhodosporidium, Malassezia. </i></p><p id="p-0340" num="0311">One example of a wound infection that has a negative effect on milk production of cows is digital dermatitis (Schlafer et al, 2008 Veterinary Microbiology 128, Issues 1-2: 118-125). Digital dermatitis (synonyms are hairy heel warts, strawberry foot rot, mortellaro disease, Italian foot rot, papillomatous digital dermatitis) is an infection that causes lameness with cattle. Digital dermatitis lesions are ulcerative or proliferative masses between the bulbs (Beninger, 2018 et al, Vet Res 49:111). Costs of digital dermatitis are $75 per cow per year for a farm of 65 cows (Bruijnis et al., 2010, J. of Dairy Science Volume 93, Issue 6, 2419-2432). Costs are based premature culling, milk loss and decreased fertility.</p><p id="p-0341" num="0312">Digital dermatitis is caused by aerophilic or anaerobic bacteria (Beninger, 2018 et al, Vet Res 49:111) and in particular <i>Treponema </i>spp (Demirkan et al. 2018 J. of Dairy Science vol 101 (11) p. 10317-10326). Generally, the infection is started by <i>Treponema </i>spp. that penetrate the skin around the claws. <i>Treponema </i>spp. are anaerobic gram-negative bacteria and belong to the spirochaetes. These microorganisms are able to penetrate the skin of the cows nearby the claws, preferentially between the claw in the interdigital cleft. The biofilms that develop from these dermatitis lesions comprise a that a heterogenous microbiological community.</p><p id="p-0342" num="0313">Bacteria, like <i>Treponema</i>, are present in cow pat or in the dung of ruminants and are considered the source for digital dermatitis. A cow with a well-functioning immunity system is less sensitive for digital dermatitis. Housing, hygiene, ventilation and nutrition are also important.</p><p id="p-0343" num="0314">Formalin foot baths have a preventive effect on digital dermatitis and are often applied. However, from formalin it is known that it is unfavourable for health for the cow and farmer. If digital dermatitis is present on the claws, the claws must be thoroughly dried and cleaned after trimming, followed by disinfecting the claws in a foot bath once every two weeks. Furthermore, the affected skin is usually treated with an antibiotic-containing spray afterwards and in this manner positive results may be achieved. However, often in the wound a thin layer or spots of biofilm are formed in which microbial cells are present in a dormant state. Only a part of the bacterial population is killed by the (antibiotic) treatment whereas the remaining cells start to multiply after the treatment was ended. Furthermore, usually the infection penetrates deep in the corium skin where local biofilms are formed and the large molecules of the antibiotics have little effect. Moreover, a selective pressure is applied to other forms of antibiotic resistance than cell dormancy in tissue and biolayers. For those reasons, most treatments and strategies have little or no effect for ameliorating digital dermatitis.</p><p id="p-0344" num="0315">Study Design</p><p id="p-0345" num="0316">Experiments are performed on three individual farms to examine the effect of two sprays developed for treating wounds and injuries (Spray #1 and Spray #2-PTSO). Both sprays have the same composition, with the exception that Spray #2-PTSO also includes PTSO (3,2% PTSO w/w). 0.35 ml is sprayed on a wound per treatment.</p><p id="p-0346" num="0317">Cows on 13 farms are selected on the presence of digital dermatitis. These cows with digital dermatitis were selected and scored on locomotion and their M-scores. To classify a digital dermatitis infection, 6 classes were described (Dopfer et al., 1997) (Berry et al., 2012). The description of the M-scores are as follows: M0, healthy; M1 (early stage), small red and sensitive but active inflammation, minimal injury 0-2 cm; M2, strawberry-like red and very sensitive injury with white epithelial edge and upright hair, so a very active inflammation &#x3e;2 cm; M3 (healing stage), an ulcerative lesion covered by a scab; M4, alteration to a chronic ulcer; M4.1, a combination of M4 and M1, a chronic phase with swollen claw cleft. The locomotion scores are defined as following: 1, not lameness, walks with straight back; 2, slightly lameness, walks with a slightly bowed back; 3, strongly lameness and bowed back during standing and walking; 4, strongly lameness and bowed back during standing and walking, affected leg is only used for standing and 5, strongly lameness and bowed back during standing and does not stand on the leg any more, prefers lying.</p><p id="p-0347" num="0318">When an M2 lesion is treated, healing takes place as follows: an intermediate step (M3) leads to a healed stage (M0) or it turns into a chronic phase with swollen interclaw cleft (M4.1). The M4.1 heals via M4 to M3 after effective treatment. See, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0348" num="0319">After scoring the wounds, the selected cows are randomly distributed over five groups as follows: Group 1: no treatment (control); Group 2: treatment with Spray #1; Group 3: treatment with Spray #2-PTSO; Group 4: treatment with Spray #1 and administration of a tablet that contains 4.8 g PTSO plus 1.2 gram PTS; and Group 5: treatment with Spray #2-PTSO and administration of a tablet that contains 4.8 g PTSO plus 1.2 gram PTS and treated with either Spray #1 or Spray #2-PTSO. The claws were scored on M-score and locomotion after two weeks. Each claw, if possible, was lifted up again and a picture was taken again.</p><p id="p-0349" num="0320">Data Processing</p><p id="p-0350" num="0321">Scores of cows were compared between Groups 1 and 3 and Groups 2 and 3. A Fisher's Exact Test was applied to calculate the statistical significance. M1, M2, M4 and M4.1 were considered as &#x201c;not healed&#x201d;. M3 is indicated as &#x201c;healing&#x201d; and M0 for &#x201c;healed&#x201d;. For the test &#x201c;healing&#x201d; and &#x201c;healed&#x201d; were combined.</p><p id="p-0351" num="0322">Results</p><p id="p-0352" num="0323">M scores per treatment group are shown in table 22. Most of the treated cows with an M4-score has a locomotion score of 1 or 2 before treatment with either spray. All of these cows have locomotion scores 1 after treatment, and the skin was after treating suppler. The cow from Group 5 scored 3 for locomotion, but directly after treatment it scored 2 for locomotion, so an immediate improvement was observed. Results on digital dermatitis were determined by M-scores. All cows with active (painful) lesions M1, M2 and M4.1 were moved to M3.</p><p id="p-0353" num="0324">Cows that were treated with both the tablet that contains 4.8 g PTSO plus 1.2 gram PTS and Spray #1 showed that 93% of the M4 scores moved to M3 and the rest to M0 after treatment. When Spray #2-PTSO was used, the M2 scores of t=0 moved to M3. Cows with M4-scores moved to M0 (23%), M3 (56%) or remained in M4 (21%) after the treatment, so significant improvements were observed by use of Spray #2-PTSO whereas additional treatment with the PTSO/PTS tablet showed an additional effect. The control group showed higher M-scores because this group was not treated and the situation deteriorated as expected. Most of the cows remained in the chronic group (M4).</p><p id="p-0354" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00022" num="00022"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 22</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>M-score prior before and after respective treatments.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="8"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="14pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="14pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="14pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>group</entry><entry><b>0</b></entry><entry>1</entry><entry>2</entry><entry><b>3</b></entry><entry>4</entry><entry>4.1</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="7" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="8"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="14pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="14pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="42pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="14pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>1A</entry><entry/><entry>2</entry><entry/><entry><b>5</b></entry><entry>26</entry><entry>9</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>1B</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry><b>8</b></entry><entry>34</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>2A</entry><entry/><entry>1</entry><entry>1</entry><entry><b>4</b></entry><entry>59</entry><entry>3</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>2B</entry><entry><b>6</b></entry><entry/><entry/><entry><b>42</b></entry><entry>20</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>3A</entry><entry/><entry>3</entry><entry>1</entry><entry><b>16</b></entry><entry>52</entry><entry>4</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>3B</entry><entry><b>10</b></entry><entry/><entry/><entry><b>44</b></entry><entry>22</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>4A</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>6</entry><entry>3</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>4B</entry><entry><b>1</b></entry><entry/><entry/><entry><b>7</b></entry><entry>1</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>5A</entry><entry/><entry/><entry>1</entry><entry><b>1</b></entry><entry>14</entry><entry>2</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>5B</entry><entry><b>4</b></entry><entry/><entry/><entry><b>9</b></entry><entry>5</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="7" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="7" align="left" id="FOO-00004">M3 (bold) is indicated as &#x201c;healing&#x201d; and M0 for &#x201c;healed&#x201d; (bold).</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0355" num="0325">Group 1: Control; Group 2: Spray #1; Group 3: Spray #2-PTSO; Group 4: Spray #1 plus PTSO/PTS tablet; Group 5: Spray #2-PTSO plus PTSO/PTS tablet.

Cows treated with Spray #1 showed better results when the treatment was combined with the PTSO/PTS tablet. The examples demonstrate that topical administration of PTSO is useful for the treatment of chronic biofilm-related wounds like digital dermatitis.</p><p id="p-0358" num="0328">For cows treated with Spray #2-PTSO, we observed a larger impact on the infected stages M1 and M2 than for the chronic lesions (M4, M4.1). It is very plausible that further improvement is achieved by prolonging this treatment. One of the cows with a locomotion score 4 was treated, walks before treatment on 3 legs, the claw of the remaining leg was strongly affected by digital dermatitis that it could not be used. After treatment, the cow walks away on 4 claws and a locomotion score of 2 that clearly showed the pain killing effect of the treatment.</p><heading id="h-0029" level="1">Example 8. Udder Cleft Dermatitis</heading><p id="p-0359" num="0329">Another example of a biofilm-related chronic wound is Udder Cleft Dermatitis (UCD) (Sorge et al, 2019. J. Dairy Sci. 102:11470-11475; Waller et al, 2014, J. Dairy Sci. 97:310-318). UCD is a skin lesion located at the anterior junction between the udder and the abdominal wall or between the front quarters of the udder. The lesions vary in appearance and size, but thickened skin, crusts, pus, and wounds that easily bleed are common findings. Udder cleft dermatitis can be difficult to detect due to its anatomical position and the fact that affected cows seldom show general signs of disease. Few studies on UCD prevalence have been published, and most have included only one or a few herds, mainly categorized as problem herds. The within-herd prevalence in those studies varied between 0 and 22%. In a recent Dutch study, however, 20 herds were included, of which 3 had no UCD, whereas the within-herd prevalence in the other herds varied between 2.5 and 13% (Amersfort et al., 2012). The etiology of UCD is unclear, but several factors, such as udder conformation and udder edema have been suggested to play a role. Cow factors such as parity and DIM (days in milk) have also been associated with UCD (Beattie and Taylor, 2000, J. Brit. Cattle Vet. Assoc. 8, 377-380).</p><p id="p-0360" num="0330">Lesions are most commonly identified on the plantar aspect of the interdigital cleft of the hind limbs. <i>Treponema </i>spp are routinely present in large numbers of active lesions. Lesions are painful to the touch and can result in clinical lameness. The infectious nature generally results in endemic infection of cattle herds (Plummer et al 2017, Vet Clin North Am Food Anim Pract 33(2): 165-181) and is responsible for large economical loses.</p><p id="p-0361" num="0331">Study design: Two cows were selected with clear characteristics of chronic UCD and were treated with the sprays described in Example 7. Cow 1 (3076) was treated with Spray #2-PTSO on day 0 and day 7. Cow 2 (2934) was treated with a Spray #1 on t=0 and Spray #2-PTSO at day 7.
