This recommendation can be difficult if the sample is obtained at the point of care but the test is to be performed at an external laboratory. Therefore, many doctors and veterinarians prefer to have point-of-care (POC) systems to analyze fresh samples. On the other hand, medical diagnostic systems rely on quality control procedures to confirm system functionality and assure result accuracy. However, quality control procedures may not be familiar to POC offices, and this lack of familiarity can be a significant reason for doctors and veterinarians to send samples to external laboratories.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Hematology diagnostic systems have some of the most difficult requirements for quality control and performance. Quality control (QC) for hematology systems can be especially difficult because there is a general belief in the medical and veterinary fields that hematology QC must use fixed cells in order to accurately gauge system performance. Fixed cell quality control generally involves cells that have been stabilized and mixed in predetermined concentrations. The cells can be human or veterinary cells, which are commonly used to represent different cell types in whole blood.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The primary approach for hematology QC using fixed-cells generally requires refrigerated storage, with the fixed cells having a shelf-life of about eight-weeks. Additionally, fixed-cells have limited stability at room temperature, and thus, the operator must warm the sample prior to use and then return them to cold storage as soon as possible thereafter. Also, after opening, fixed cells generally remain stable for about two-weeks or less. The short shelf life and strict thermal requirements of fixed cells often create doubt about the material when a QC test fails, requiring reruns with a separate lot of control material to confirm the result. Another disadvantage of fixed cells is that hematology systems are designed to interact with cells in a particular chemical manner, and such interactions can be inhibited by techniques used to stabilize cells for fixed-cell controls.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">For veterinary diagnostic systems, fixed-cell quality control approaches often have deficiencies when several veterinary species are supported. For veterinary diagnostics, there can be significant differences between cells of different species, and therefore, each species will generally have its own cell recognition algorithm in the diagnostic system. In such systems, fixed cell quality control materials may not be able to confirm system performance for all supported species. For example, canine sample analysis could satisfy quality control parameters, while feline sample analysis may not. In particular, fixed-cell quality control approaches may not be able to confirm the performance of certain system components, such as species-specific reagent reactions and species-specific fluidic and detection system problems.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, there is continuing interest in improving medical diagnostic systems.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present disclosure relates to quality control for point-of-care diagnostic systems.

As used herein, point-of-care refers to a location where care is provided to human or animal patients, and a medical diagnostic system refers to a system that can analyze a sample obtained from a patient to diagnose a medical condition of the patient. Accordingly, a medical diagnostic system includes a patient sample analyzer, such as, but not limited to, a flow cytometer.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Quality control in general involves having a diagnostic system demonstrate its performance on quality control (QC) materials, such that appropriate performance on the QC materials correlates to appropriate performance on patient samples. As will be described in detail herein, the proposed systems and methods relate to quality control operations using synthetic QC materials, patient-based quality control, and/or blank runs. Portions of the present disclosure will focus on veterinary hematology analyzers, but the description herein applies to other types of medical diagnostic systems as well, including, but not limited to, chemistry analyzers, coagulation analyzers, and urine analyzers.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, there is shown a block diagram of an embodiment of exemplary quality control procedures <b>100</b> for a medical diagnostic system. The quality control procedures <b>100</b> include a QC operation <b>102</b>, a blank run operation <b>104</b>, and/or a patient-data operation <b>106</b>. Each of these operations <b>102</b>-<b>106</b> will be described in more detail later herein. The results of these operations <b>102</b>-<b>106</b> are stored in a database <b>108</b>, and the information in the database <b>108</b> is then used to generate control charts <b>110</b>. Control charts will be described in more detail later in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Based on the control charts <b>110</b>, the quality control procedures can determine whether various components of the medical diagnostic system are operating within intended parameters <b>112</b>. If the system is operating within intended parameters <b>114</b>, no adjustments are needed, and the system can run the quality control operations <b>102</b>-<b>106</b> again when scheduled or requested to do so. If the system is not operating within intended parameters <b>116</b>, the system can automatically make adjustments where possible <b>118</b>, and/or can alert an operator to manually make adjustments when automatic adjustments are not possible <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The following describes the quality control run <b>102</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The blank run <b>104</b> and then patient run <b>106</b> will be described later herein.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">A quality control run <b>102</b> involves the use of quality control (QC) materials. In accordance with aspects of the present disclosure, a QC material is provided that is a synthetic non-biological material, but still provides sensor responses that mimic or that are similar to sensor responses for biological materials. In various embodiments, because the QC materials are synthetic, they can have longer shelf life than fixed cells. In various embodiments, the QC material is stable at room temperature and can be stored on-board the diagnostic system at room temperature. In various embodiments, the diagnostic system can store the on-board QC material at specified environmental conditions (such as refrigeration or otherwise), and then handle them appropriately (e.g., warm the material) when an automated run is desired. In various embodiments, no action from the operator is needed to perform the quality control operations other than replenishing the on-board control material as needed.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In various embodiments, the QC material can be polymer beads for standardization and calibration of a hematology flow cytometer. An example of polymer beads is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,074,879, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, and which persons skilled in the art will understand. In various embodiments, the polymer beads can include latex, polystyrene, polycarbonate, and/or methacrylate polymers.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In a fixed-cell quality control material, even though the cells are surrogates for natural patient cells, they have different chemical behavior compared to actual cells in natural samples. Accordingly, in the medical diagnostic system, the classification of fixed-cells is performed differently than the classification of patient samples, to account for these differences. In contrast, in accordance with aspects of the present disclosure, the QC material can mimic or substantially resemble the cellular or chemical features that the medical diagnostic system is intended to count, measure, or analyze, such that the same classification methodology can be used for natural samples as well as for the QC materials of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In accordance with aspects of the present disclosure, the diagnostic system can automatically run the quality control operations <b>102</b>-<b>106</b>. For example, the diagnostic system can include a feedback sub-system <b>100</b> that works with the QC materials housed within the diagnostic system. Based on the QC materials and the feedback sub-system, the diagnostic system can determine whether its components are functioning within intended parameters or whether adjustments are required. In various embodiments, some adjustments can be performed automatically <b>118</b> by the diagnostic system. Such automatic adjustments can beneficially maintain diagnostic accuracy and preempt significant diagnostic errors. Other adjustments may require user interaction, and the diagnostic system can provide an indication to the user regarding any such actions <b>120</b>. Thus, the user receives the benefits of automated alerts with actionable guidance to maintain the diagnostic system. In various embodiments, the diagnostic system can provide an indication to the user regarding the diagnostic system's performance based on the quality control operations <b>102</b>-<b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In various embodiments, for adjustments that cannot be automatically performed, the diagnostic system can communicate an electronic message or report to the manufacturer or servicer for the diagnostic system. The manufacturer or servicer can use such electronic messages/reports in various ways. In various embodiments, the electronic messages can be used to schedule service for the diagnostic system. In various embodiments, the electronic messages can be aggregated for multiple diagnostic systems and can be analyzed to determine performance trends of various components of the diagnostic systems. Such information can be useful for identifying areas that may benefit from design modifications or improvements.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In various embodiments, quality control procedures <b>100</b> can be automatically performed each day to keep the diagnostic system well-maintained. For example, the quality control procedures <b>100</b> can automatically be performed at 2:00 AM each day, or at another time. Automated hematology analyzers in human medicine can perform quality control procedures <b>100</b> at least once per 8-hour shift, which is the frequency generally required by governing agency regulation. Veterinary hematology analyzers do not have regulatory requirements for quality control. Accordingly, veterinary offices may perform quality control procedures <b>100</b> less often. In various embodiments, the frequency of running the quality control procedures <b>100</b> may depend on how often or how seldom patient samples are analyzed. For example, veterinary offices may run very few patient samples in a day, or as few as one sample per day. In such offices, running quality control procedures <b>100</b> once per day would double the cost of reagents used by the office. Accordingly, for such offices, the frequency of running the quality control procedures <b>100</b> may be less frequent. In various embodiments, veterinary hematology analyzers may perform quality control analyses as infrequently as once per month.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In accordance with aspects of the present disclosure, information relating to the quality control tests <b>102</b>-<b>106</b> can be stored in the database <b>108</b>. The database can be any type of database, such as a SQL database, a NoSQL database, or another type of database.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In various embodiments, QC results can be plotted in control charts <b>110</b>, such as a Levey-Jennings chart as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, and can be compared with target values or ranges. In various embodiments, control chart rules can determine whether the system is in control or not <b>112</b>. In various embodiments, a control chart <b>110</b> can be generated for multiple parameters to determine which parameter or parameters may be out of control and require corrective action <b>116</b>, and which parameters are in control and require no changes <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In various embodiments, the quality control materials can be provided in predetermined concentrations that enable three levels of control, including normal, high, and low levels. Having three levels allows the user to confirm whether the diagnostic system is functioning properly to detect the normal range and the abnormal ranges. In various embodiments, each level can be shown in the control chart. The control charts can demonstrate the historical performance of the analyzer, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, and can provide a way to detect when changes are needed, including relatively small changes. In various embodiments, the operator can have the ability to access and view the control charts. In various embodiments, a control chart need not be in the form of a chart as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, and can be implemented in different ways. For example, in various embodiments, a control chart can be implemented as an organization of stored data values that are correlated with time or correlated with data sample number.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In various embodiments, calibration needs can be determined from the control chart data. A technician can determine if an out-of-control parameter requires a diagnostic system component to be re-calibrated, or whether other actions should be taken instead, such as cleaning the component. Generally, calibration changes are performed last, after all other functionality is confirmed.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Accordingly, described above herein are various aspects of quality control for medical diagnostic systems in general. The following will describe aspects of flow-cytometry-based diagnostic systems in particular, and quality control for such systems. An example of a flow-cytometry-based analyzer is shown and described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,324,194, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, and which persons skilled in the art will understand.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Flow cytometry systems include sub-systems such as fluidics, optics, and electronics sub-systems. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a fluidics sub-system arranges a sample into a stream of particles, such as a stream of cells. The optics sub-system examines each cell by directed a laser beam to each cell and detecting scattered light using photo-detectors. Light is scattered according to size, complexity, granularity, and diameter of the cells, which form a &#x201c;fingerprint&#x201d; of each cell type. An example is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. The electronics sub-system can process the fingerprints to classify, count, and/or otherwise analyze the cells/particles in the sample stream.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Flow cytometry systems have a series of settings and parameters that tune the fluidics, optics, and electronics sub-systems so that specific scatter patterns and positions will be produced from input samples. When these sub-systems all function properly, the system is able to correlate the scatter outputs with particular cells using recognition algorithms. However, if these parameters shift, the recognition algorithms can fail. Another level of tuning is part of the calibration process, where various calibration parameters are used to tune output results to match reference values for a given set of samples. As the diagnostic system drifts or shifts, the calibration parameters may need to be adjusted to ensure that output results continue to match reference values.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In accordance with aspects of the present disclosure, a flow cytometer for hematology can utilize quality control procedures (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>, <b>100</b></figref>) to ensure that the major functions of the diagnostic system are operating in a controlled manner, including yielding accurate and precise results. The following aspects and parameters of a hematology system can be tested and trended by the quality control procedures of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0040">Preanalytic: is the sample appropriately mixed. In various embodiments, mixing of a quality control material can be performed by an internal vortex mixer in the medical diagnostic system. The vortex mixer can mix the quality control material from several seconds, such as 15 seconds, to several minutes, such as 15 minutes.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0041">Dilution: does the system make the correct dilution, including sample volume, reagent volume, and mixing. In various embodiments, aspects of a flow cytometry system such as optical density can be tested. In various embodiments, optical density can be tested using a colored dye sample, such as red dye.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0042">System Chemistry: do the reagents interact appropriately with the sample.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0043">Fluidics: does the diluted sample present to the detection method appropriately.

In various embodiments, aspects of a flow cytometry system such as extinction channel (EXT), low angle forward light scatter channel (FSL), right angle scatter channel (RAS), high angle forward light scatter channel (FSH), and/or time-of-flight channel (TOF), can be tested.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0045">Signal Processing: do the cell signals present with appropriate signal to noise.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0046">Classification Algorithm: do the cells present appropriately to the detection system so that the algorithm identifies the populations correctly.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0008" num="0047">Results: does the system provide precise and accurate results.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0041" num="0048">The following will now describe the blank run operation <b>104</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The fluidic sub-system of a flow cytometer is responsible for combining whole blood samples with reagents, mixing them, and moving them to the laser optics sub-system. The fluidic sub-system of a flow cytometer always contains reagents and generally requires maintenance procedures to ensure it is ready to run a sample. When a diagnostic system has one run per day or one run every few days, the fluidic sub-system is at risk of becoming &#x201c;dirty&#x201d; from, for example, protein, bacteria, stain, or salt concentrations in the fluid lines. In accordance with aspects of the present disclosure, periodic flushes can be performed to keep the fluidic sub-system clean. In various embodiments, the periodic flushes can be performed by using &#x201c;blank&#x201d; runs, which are diagnostic system runs that are performed as though a sample is present, but without any sample actually being present. The results of these blank runs can be recorded <b>108</b> and charted <b>110</b> to determine cleanliness of the fluidic sub-system and to evaluate any trends in the recorded data. In various embodiments, blank run operations <b>104</b> can be performed automatically by the diagnostic system on a regular basis or as scheduled or requested. Because blank runs are performed as though a sample is present, reagents are used in blank runs and are consumed more quickly.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0049">Blank runs <b>104</b> can measure cleanliness of the diagnostic system and ensure there is no sample carryover from one run to the next. In particular, in a blank run, diagnostic system sensor values will shift if there is buildup in the optical path or other wear conditions in various components. Trending of the blank run data allows for an ongoing cleanliness checks using historical trends. Some cleanliness problems can be corrected. For example, operator can run a bleach sample in the diagnostic system to remove buildup in the optical path, or can run a biocide sample to kill bacteria colonies that may have infiltrated the diagnostic system. Thus, the blank run <b>104</b> can identify such conditions and alert an operator to actions to address such conditions. In various embodiments, some diagnostic system measurements can use the blank run as a reference to self-calibrate results, such as in the transmittance measurement for hemoglobin where the blank value is used in a ratio with the sample value to determine the optical transmittance in accordance with Beer's Law.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0050">The following will describe aspects of the patient data run <b>106</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Non-fresh sample control approaches have limited capacity to evaluate reagent chemistry and algorithm effects. In view of such limitations, and in accordance with aspects of the present disclosure, quality control procedures can be augmented with feedback control approaches based on patient-data of multiple patients. An example of using patient data to determine normal and abnormal data ranges is described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2015/0025808, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, and which persons skilled in the art will understand.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0051">In various embodiments, the patient run operation <b>106</b> involves averaging sequential patient samples using various averaging techniques to determine data ranges and trends based on patient samples. This data can be stored in the database <b>108</b> and can be used to generate control chart <b>110</b>. In various embodiments, control chart rules <b>112</b> can be applied to determine if the diagnostic system is in or out of control by comparing a patient sample result to the patient-data-based control chart. In various embodiments, patient run operations <b>106</b> for quality control purposes can be performed automatically by the diagnostic system on a regular basis or as scheduled or requested.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0052">In various embodiments, a separate control chart <b>110</b> can be generated for each animal species supported by the diagnostic system, such as a canine control chart, or a feline control chart.
