When anode parts of a plurality of capacitor elements that are stacked are welded to each other, larger voids (voids) may be formed in the porous region. Thus, electrical resistance in the anode parts increases, and ESR tends to increase. Furthermore, a strength of the capacitor elements in the welded part may decrease. In addition, oxygen entering from the anode parts easily reaches a cathode formation part through the void, and deterioration of a solid electrolyte layer proceeds.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In a capacitor element according to the present exemplary embodiment, a porous region of an anode part is thinned to form a thin-thickness region, and a dense metal substrate is stacked on a part of the thin-thickness region. By welding the capacitor elements to each other in the stacked part, an occupation ratio of voids in the welded part is reduced, or the voids themselves are reduced. Hence, an increase in electrical resistance is suppressed, and movement of oxygen is also suppressed. Furthermore, since the thin-thickness region is reinforced by the metal substrate, the strength of the capacitor element is increased.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">A cathode layer (for example, a solid electrolyte layer and a cathode lead-out layer) is formed on a cathode formation part of an anode body. Thus, a thickness of the cathode formation part of the capacitor element is greater than that of the anode part. When a plurality of the capacitor elements are stacked and the anode parts are joined to each other, the anode body is bent in the vicinity of a boundary between the anode part and the cathode layer. Hence, the anode body is easily damaged at the bent part. When the thin-thickness region is provided in the anode part, a degree of bending is further increased. In the present exemplary embodiment, since the metal substrate is stacked on at least a part of the thin-thickness region, the plurality of capacitor elements can be stacked and joined without increasing the degree of bending.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The thicker the porous region, the lower the strength of the capacitor element. However, in the present exemplary embodiment, since the thin-thickness region is reinforced by the metal substrate, the porous region can be thickened. That is, the porous region of the cathode formation part can be thickened. Hence, an increase in electrostatic capacity is expected. In the cathode formation part, a thickness of the porous region may be 95% or more of a thickness of the entire anode body. From the viewpoint of strength, the thickness of the porous region in the cathode formation part is preferably 98% or less of the thickness of the entire anode body.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The thin-thickness region may be formed in a part of the anode part. From the viewpoint of blocking oxygen, the thin-thickness region is preferably formed in a band shape along a boundary between the anode part and the cathode formation part. The thin-thickness region is more preferably formed in a band shape in the vicinity of the boundary between the anode part and the cathode formation part. This is because penetration of solid electrolyte into the anode part is easily suppressed by the thin-thickness region in a step of forming the solid electrolyte layer. The thin-thickness region may be formed over the entire anode part.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The thin-thickness region may be formed by removing a part of the porous region, or may be formed by compressing a part of the porous region. Among them, it is preferable that the thin-thickness region is formed by compressing the porous region. Since a compression layer having a smaller porosity is formed in the thin-thickness region by the compression of the porous region, an effect of suppressing electrical resistance and an effect of suppressing oxygen transfer are further enhanced.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The metal substrate is stacked on at least a part of the thin-thickness region. The part where the metal substrate is stacked is suitable as a welded part. From the viewpoint of blocking oxygen, the metal substrate is preferably stacked in a band shape along the boundary between the anode part and the cathode formation part. From the viewpoint of strength, the metal substrate is preferably stacked on the entire thin-thickness region.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Hereinafter, a capacitor element according to the present exemplary embodiment will be specifically described with reference to the drawings.

The porous region of the thin-thickness region is thinner than the porous region of the cathode formation part. Thus, oxygen entering from the anode part is less likely to reach the cathode formation part through the thin-thickness region. The thin-thickness region also suppresses penetration of the solid electrolyte into the anode part from the porous region of the cathode formation part in the step of forming the solid electrolyte layer.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The thickness of the porous region of the thin-thickness region is not particularly limited. The thickness of the porous region of the thin-thickness region is preferably equal to or less than 50%, preferably equal to or less than 40%, and preferably equal to or less than 30% of the thickness of the porous region of the cathode formation part. There may be no porous region in the thin-thickness region.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The thickness of the porous region of the thin-thickness region is obtained by averaging distance values at arbitrary three points in the cross section of the capacitor element. The distance value is obtained by measuring, in the thin-thickness region, a distance from a principal surface of the anode body to a boundary between the core region and the porous region near the principal surface. Similarly, the thickness of the porous region of the cathode formation part is obtained by averaging distance values at arbitrary three points in the cross section of the capacitor element. The distance value is obtained by measuring, in the cathode formation part, a distance from one principal surface of the anode body to a boundary between the core region and the porous region near the principal surface.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The thin-thickness region is formed, for example, by compressing the porous region of the anode body. In this case, the thin-thickness region has a compression layer obtained by compressing the porous region. The thin-thickness region may be formed by removing at least a part of the porous region by cutting, laser machining, or the like. The thin-thickness region may be formed by removing the entire porous region and exposing the core region. In particular, the thin-thickness region is preferably formed by compressing the porous region of the anode body. This is because the process is simple, and further improvement in oxygen blocking property can be expected.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">(Metal Substrate)</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The metal substrate is stacked on at least a part of the thin-thickness region. The metal substrate is denser than the porous region in the cathode formation part. By disposing a dense metal substrate instead of the porous region, an increase in electrical resistance of the anode part due to welding is suppressed, and the oxygen blocking property is improved. Furthermore, it is possible to avoid a decrease in strength of the capacitor element due to the formation of the thin-thickness region.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The description that the metal substrate is dense means that an apparent density of the metal substrate is greater than an apparent density of the porous region of the cathode formation part. The apparent density is calculated by dividing the actual mass by the apparent volume including a void part.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Further, the description that the metal substrate is denser than the porous region of the cathode formation part also means that the porosity of the metal substrate is smaller than the porosity of the porous region of the cathode formation part. The porosity of the metal substrate may be, for example, equal to or less than 90%, equal to or less than 80%, or equal to or less than 60% of the porosity of the porous region of the cathode formation part. The metal substrate may have no hole therein. The porosity of the metal substrate is not particularly limited. The porosity of the metal substrate may be, for example, equal to or more than 0% and equal to or less than 55%.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The porosity can be calculated from an SEM image of a cross section obtained by cutting the capacitor element in a thickness direction. The SEM image of the porous region of the cathode formation part is binarized in the void part and the other part so that an area proportion of the void part in the porous region is calculated. The obtained area proportion of the void part is defined as the porosity of the porous region of the cathode formation part. Similarly, an area proportion of a void part in the metal substrate is calculated from the SEM image, and the obtained area proportion of the void part is defined as the porosity of the metal substrate.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The metal substrate is a plate-shaped or foil-shaped member containing a metallic material. The thickness of the metal substrate is not particularly limited. The total thickness of the metal substrate and the anode body in the thin-thickness region may be smaller than, larger than, or the same as the thickness of the anode body in the cathode formation part. In particular, in view of easily welding the plurality of capacitor elements, the total thickness is preferably equal to or larger than the thickness of the anode body in the cathode formation part. The total thickness is preferably equal to or more than 100% and equal to or less than 120% of the thickness of the anode body in the cathode formation part.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The metallic material constituting the metal substrate is not particularly limited. The metal substrate preferably contains the same metallic material or valve metal as the anode body. In this case, electrical resistance, ease of welding, and the like between the anode body and the metal substrate are substantially the same, so that connection reliability is hardly impaired.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">A surface (hereinafter, it may be referred to as a facing surface) facing the thin-thickness region of the metal substrate to be stacked is preferably roughened. This is because adhesion to the porous region is enhanced. The roughness of the facing surface is not particularly limited. The arithmetic average roughness Ra of the facing surface only has to be, for example, equal to or more than 20 nm. The arithmetic average roughness Ra is measured in accordance with JIS B 0601:2013. Similarly to the anode body, the metal substrate may have a porous region on a surface thereof. Similarly, a surface of the metal substrate opposite to the facing surface may be roughened. As a result, when a plurality of the capacitor elements are stacked, adhesion to an adjacent anode part tends to be increased.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The method of roughening is not particularly limited. The facing surface may be etched or roughened by a conventionally known surface treatment such as a plasma treatment or a blast treatment.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">(Anode Body)</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The anode body includes a foil (metal foil) containing a valve metal. Examples of the valve metal include titanium, tantalum, aluminum, niobium, or the like. The anode body contains one or more types of the valve metals. The anode body may contain the valve metal in the form of an alloy or an intermetallic compound. A thickness of the anode body is not particularly limited. The thickness of the anode body in a region other than the thin-thickness region ranges, for example, from 15 &#x3bc;m to 300 &#x3bc;m, inclusive, and may range from 80 &#x3bc;m to 250 &#x3bc;m, inclusive.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">A principal surface of the anode body is roughened by electrolytic etching or the like. Thus, the anode body includes a porous region formed at a side close to the principal surface. An entirety of the anode body may be porous. From the viewpoint of strength, however, the anode body preferably includes the porous regions disposed at both principal surface sides, and a core region interposed between the porous regions. The core region has a lower porosity. The porous region is a region having a large number of fine pores. The core region is, for example, a region that has not been subjected to electrolytic etching. The porous region and the core region can be distinguished from the cross section of the capacitor element.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The porosity of the porous region is not particularly limited. The porosity of the porous region may be, for example, equal to or more than 35% and equal to or less than 65%.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">A thickness of the porous region is not particularly limited. As described above, from the viewpoint of increasing electrostatic capacity and strength, the thickness of the porous region of the cathode formation part is preferably equal to or more than 95% and equal to or less than 98% of the thickness of the entire anode body.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">(Dielectric Layer)</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The dielectric layer is formed on at least a part of the surface of the anode body. The dielectric layer is formed, for example, by anodizing the surface of the anode body with an anodizing treatment or the like. Hence, the dielectric layer can contain an oxide of the valve metal. When aluminum, for example, is used as the valve metal, the dielectric layer can contain Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. Note that the dielectric layer is not limited thereto, and only has to be any one that functions as a dielectric material.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">(Cathode Layer)</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The cathode layer includes a solid electrolyte layer covering at least a part of the dielectric layer, and a cathode lead-out layer covering at least a part of the solid electrolyte layer.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The solid electrolyte layer only has to be formed to cover at least a part of the dielectric layer, and may be formed to cover the entire surface of the dielectric layer.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The solid electrolyte layer contains, for example, a manganese compound and a conductive polymer. Examples of the conductive polymer include polypyrrole, polythiophene, polyfuran, polyaniline, polyacetylene, polyphenylene, polyphenylene vinylene, polyacene, and polythiophene vinylene.
