However, it can be difficult to desirably control the temperature of the devices during testing. For example, variations of a few degrees Celsius during testing can make results inaccurate in some instances.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Devices may produce heat during testing. This heat may be referred to as &#x2018;self-heat.&#x2019; The devices may be provided with a thin heater which is turned on to heat the devices. However, when the devices begin producing heat, the thin heater may be turned down or off. For example, as the device produces an increasing amount of heat, the thin heater may be gradually turned off. To test the devices at a particular temperature, air with liquid nitrogen and/or compressed dry air may be provided to the devices.

The method includes providing a temperature control system including a controller, a first contactor assembly having a first channel system, a plurality of first contacts, each of the first contacts including a portion that is disposed within the first channel system, and one or more of a first exhaust valve or a first inlet valve, and a second contactor assembly having a second channel system, a plurality of second contacts, each of the second contacts including a portion that is disposed within the second channel system, and one or more of a second exhaust valve or a second inlet valve. The method also includes receiving, by the first contactor assembly, a fluid at a first temperature. The method also includes receiving, by the second contactor assembly, the fluid at the first temperature. The method also includes determining, by the controller, a temperature of the first contacts within the first channel system. The method also includes comparing, by the controller, the temperature of the first contacts to a setpoint temperature.

The temperature control system includes a testing device, a contactor assembly, and a controller. The testing device includes a plurality of contactor receiving locations. The contactor assembly is positioned within one of the contactor receiving locations. The contactor assembly includes a channel system, a plurality of contacts, a sensor, a first port, and at least one of a first exhaust valve or an inlet valve. The channel system is configured to receive a fluid. Each of the contacts includes a portion that is disposed within the channel system. The sensor is configured to provide a signal. The first port is configured to provide the fluid from the contactor assembly. The first exhaust valve is in fluid communication with the first port. The first exhaust valve is operable between an open position and a closed position. The first exhaust valve facilitates flow from the contactor assembly in the open position and inhibits flow from the contactor assembly in the closed position. The inlet valve is operable between an open position and a closed position. The inlet valve facilitates flow to the sensor in the open position and inhibits flow to the sensor in the closed position. The controller is configured to receive a setpoint temperature associated with testing of a target device.

For example, flow of fluid through a first contactor assembly may be based on a temperature of contacts of a second contactor assembly and/or a temperature of contacts of the first contactor assembly. As a result, throughput of the temperature control system may be greater than other systems which do not control flow in these ways.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying Figures and the description below.

The various concepts introduced above and discussed in detail below may be implemented in any of numerous ways, as the described concepts are not limited to any particular manner of implementation. Examples of specific implementations and applications are provided primarily for illustrative purposes.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In order to test a device at a setpoint temperature, it may be desirable to control the flow of a fluid that is used to heat or cool contacts attached to a device. This may be done by using one or more valves. The valves may be located on a contactor. The valves may control the flow of a fluid through the contactor. Various devices may be used to control the flow of the fluid through a contactor so that the contacts may be maintained at the setpoint temperature.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Implementations discussed herein are directed to a temperature control system that includes contactor assemblies, each of which includes at least one of an inlet valve or one or more exhaust valves. The inlet valve and the exhaust valves can be repositioned by a controller to control flow of fluid past the contacts, and therefore the heat provided to the contacts by the fluid. A sensor is used to facilitate determination of a temperature of the contacts. The controller may, for example, utilize the temperature of the fluid proximate the sensor in a first contactor assembly to control valves of a second contactor assemblies. The controller may also, for example, account for the temperature of the contacts sensed by a sensor in the second contactor assembly when controlling the at least one of the inlet valve or the one or more exhaust valves of the second contactor assemblies. Various processes for controlling the valves of the various contactor assemblies are discussed herein.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a temperature control system <b>100</b> (e.g., testing system, etc.). As explained in more detain herein, the temperature control system <b>100</b> is configured to supply a fluid (e.g., air, dry air, compressed air, ambient air, etc.) to a contactor assembly to control a temperature (e.g., socket-side temperature, etc.) of one or more sets of contacts, where each set of contacts provides signals to a target device <b>101</b> (e.g., socket, device under testing (DUT), tested device, semiconductor, electrical device, etc.), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. In general, when a target device <b>101</b> is attached to a contactor array for testing using the contactor array, power consumed by the target device <b>101</b> during testing is dissipated as heat, thereby causing the temperature of the contacts to fluctuate. However, testing of some target devices <b>101</b> requires careful control over the temperature of the contacts, and it is desirable to avoid undesirable fluctuations. The temperature control system <b>100</b> described herein provides a fluid to a contactor assembly which tests a target device <b>101</b> and uses the fluid to control a temperature of the contacts so as to mitigate undesirable fluctuations of the temperature of the contacts. The temperature control system <b>100</b> may additionally assist in facilitating thermal contact on a top side of each of the target devices <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The temperature control system <b>100</b> includes a fluid source <b>102</b> (e.g., compressed air source, fan, air intake, evaporated nitrogen source, etc.). The fluid source <b>102</b> is configured to contain the fluid. In some applications, such as those where testing of the target devices <b>101</b> at relatively cold temperatures is desired, the fluid source <b>102</b> is an evaporated nitrogen source. The temperature control system <b>100</b> also includes a plumbing system <b>104</b> (e.g., conduit system, line system, etc.). The plumbing system <b>104</b> is configured to receive the fluid from the fluid source <b>102</b> and transport the fluid throughout the temperature control system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The plumbing system <b>104</b> includes a first conduit <b>106</b> (e.g., pipe, line, etc.). The first conduit <b>106</b> is configured to receive the fluid from the fluid source <b>102</b>. In some embodiments, the pressure of the fluid allows for the fluid to transport from the fluid source <b>102</b> to the first conduit <b>106</b>. In some embodiments, the temperature control system <b>100</b> may also include a fluid pump (e.g., air pump, fan, rotary pump, positive displacement pump etc.).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The temperature control system <b>100</b> includes a temperature controller <b>112</b> (e.g., control circuit, driver, etc.). As is described in more detail herein, the temperature controller <b>112</b> is configured to control various portions of the temperature control system <b>100</b>. The temperature controller <b>112</b> is configured to electrically transmit information (e.g., commands, temperature readings, target temperature values, setpoint temperatures, etc.) to, and electrically receive information from, various portions of the temperature control system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The temperature controller <b>112</b> includes a processing circuit <b>114</b>. The processing circuit <b>114</b> includes a processor <b>116</b> and a memory <b>118</b>. The processor <b>116</b> may include a microprocessor, an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), etc., or combinations thereof. The memory <b>118</b> may include, but is not limited to, electronic, optical, magnetic, or any other storage or transmission device capable of providing a processor, ASIC, FPGA, etc. with program instructions. This memory <b>118</b> may include a memory chip, Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EEPROM), Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory (EPROM), flash memory, or any other suitable memory from which the temperature controller <b>112</b> can read instructions. The instructions may include code from any suitable programming language. The memory <b>118</b> may include various modules that include instructions, which are configured to be implemented by the processor <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The temperature control system <b>100</b> includes a heat exchanger <b>120</b> (e.g., temperature controller, etc.). The heat exchanger <b>120</b> is fluidly coupled to the fluid source <b>102</b> via the first conduit <b>106</b> and is configured to receive the fluid from the first conduit <b>106</b>. The heat exchanger <b>120</b> is electrically connected to the temperature controller <b>112</b> and configured to alter (e.g., increase, decrease) the temperature of the fluid received from the fluid source <b>102</b> prior to the fluid being provided to downstream portions of the temperature control system <b>100</b>. The plumbing system <b>104</b> also includes a second conduit <b>122</b>. The second conduit <b>122</b> receives the fluid from the heat exchanger <b>120</b> (e.g., after the temperature of the fluid has been altered by the heat exchanger <b>120</b>, etc.).</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In operation, the processor <b>116</b> provides the heat exchanger <b>120</b> with a setpoint temperature (e.g., desired temperature, target temperature value etc.), and the heat exchanger <b>120</b> is operated to cause the temperature of the fluid to attain the setpoint temperature. In operation, the heat exchanger <b>120</b> is operable to heat or cool the fluid. The setpoint temperature may be received by the temperature controller <b>112</b> from a user (e.g., operator, etc.) and stored in the memory <b>118</b>. In some embodiments, the setpoint temperature is a preset value stored on the memory <b>118</b> for various target devices <b>101</b>. In some embodiments, the setpoint temperature accounts for heat provided by an ambient environment within which the temperature control system <b>100</b> is located. For example, where the ambient environment provides heating sufficient to raise a temperature of the target device <b>101</b> by 10 Kelvin (K) and it is desired to cause the temperature of the fluid to be 400 K, the setpoint temperature may be 390 K.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In various embodiments, the heat exchanger <b>120</b> includes a cooling device <b>124</b> (e.g., liquid nitrogen supply, coiling coil, fan, Peltier cell, etc.). The cooling device <b>124</b> is electrically connected to the temperature controller <b>112</b> and is configured to cool the fluid received from the first conduit <b>106</b> prior to the fluid being provided to the second conduit <b>122</b>. In some embodiments, the cooling device <b>124</b> is a liquid nitrogen supply which facilitates cooling of the fluid (e.g., by causing evaporation of nitrogen through the mixing of liquid nitrogen and air, etc.). In some applications, the cooling device <b>124</b> includes a liquid to gas heat exchanger or another similar device capable of cooling the fluid.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In these embodiments, the setpoint temperature may be between approximately equal to (e.g., within 5% of, etc.) between 233 K and 206 K (e.g., 244 K, 240 K, 236 K, 233 K, 228 K, 226 K, 222 K, 218 K, 214 K, 210 K, 206 K, 208 K, 197 K etc.). Of course, a temperature of the fluid within the heat exchanger <b>120</b> is different from a temperature of the fluid downstream of the heat exchanger <b>120</b>, such as at the contactor assemblies.

In these embodiments, the tube forms part of the first port <b>174</b> and facilitates physical separation of the first exhaust valve <b>176</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The first exhaust valve <b>176</b> is configured to regulate the flow of the fluid as the fluid flows from the first exhaust channel <b>170</b> through the first outlet <b>175</b>. By regulating the flow of the fluid within the contactor assembly <b>138</b>, the temperature of the contacts <b>167</b> may be controlled. In some embodiments, the contactor assembly <b>138</b> includes the first exhaust valve <b>176</b> and the inlet valve <b>158</b>. In other embodiments, the contactor assembly <b>138</b> includes only one of the first exhaust valve <b>176</b> or the inlet valve <b>158</b>. In some embodiments, the first exhaust valve <b>176</b> of a first contactor assembly <b>138</b> is controlled based on a temperature of the contacts <b>167</b> within a second contactor assembly <b>138</b> (e.g., in addition to the temperature of the contacts <b>167</b> of the first contactor assembly <b>138</b>, instead of the temperature of the contacts <b>167</b> of the first contactor assembly <b>138</b>, etc.).</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">For example, in an example embodiment, if a target device <b>101</b> is being tested at a relatively high setpoint temperature, and the processor <b>116</b> determines that the temperature of the contacts <b>167</b> is, for example, 120% or more of the setpoint temperature (e.g., too hot), the processor <b>116</b> causes the first exhaust valve <b>176</b> to be repositioned to a closed position such that the fluid flow is increasingly impeded by the first exhaust valve <b>176</b>. In this way, fluid flow through the channel system <b>152</b>, and therefore across the contacts <b>167</b>, is decreased (e.g., relative to when the flow of the fluid is not impeded by the first exhaust valve <b>176</b>, etc.). This decrease in flow to the contacts <b>157</b> causes decreased heat transfer from the fluid to the contacts <b>167</b> because the fluid has a relatively low thermal capacity and less flow to the contacts <b>157</b> results in less heat transfer to the contacts <b>157</b>. However, in an example where the target device <b>101</b> is being tested at a relatively high setpoint temperature, and the processor <b>116</b> determines that the temperature of the contacts <b>167</b> is, for example, 80% or less of the setpoint temperature (e.g., too cold), the processor <b>116</b> causes the first exhaust valve <b>176</b> to be repositioned to an open position such that the fluid flow is decreasingly impeded by the first exhaust valve <b>176</b>. In this way, more of the fluid flows through the contacts <b>167</b> and provides more heating to the contacts <b>167</b>. As a result, the first exhaust valve <b>176</b> may be controlled to enable the fluid, and therefore the contacts <b>167</b>, to cause the temperature of the contacts <b>167</b> to be changed towards the setpoint temperature.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In some embodiments, when the processor <b>116</b> determines that the temperature of the contacts <b>167</b> is greater than the setpoint temperature, the processor <b>116</b> operates the first exhaust valve <b>176</b> to be repositioned to a closed position or a semi-closed position. In the closed position, the flow of the fluid is inhibited such that none of the fluid flows through the first outlet <b>175</b>. In the semi-closed position, the flow of the fluid is impeded by the first exhaust valve <b>176</b> such that only a portion of the fluid flows through the first outlet <b>175</b>. By impeding the flow of the fluid using the first exhaust valve <b>176</b>, the heat exchange with the contacts <b>167</b> is decreased (e.g., relative to when the flow of the fluid is not impeded by the first exhaust valve <b>176</b>, etc.) due to the relatively low thermal capacity of the fluid and less flow to the contacts <b>157</b> results in less heat transfer to the contacts <b>157</b>. In an example embodiment, if a target device <b>101</b> is being tested at a high setpoint temperature (e.g., 363 K to 423K, etc.), and the processor <b>116</b> determines that the temperature of the contacts <b>167</b> is substantially greater (e.g., 15%, 20%, 40%, 60%, etc.) than the setpoint temperature (e.g., too hot), the processor <b>116</b> causes the first exhaust valve <b>176</b> to be repositioned to be closed (e.g., to be in the closed position, to transition from a 20% closed position to a 60% closed position, etc.) such that the fluid flow is impeded. By impeding the flow of the fluid towards the contacts <b>167</b>, the heat exchange with the contacts <b>167</b> is decreased. In an example embodiment, if a target device <b>101</b> is being tested at a high setpoint temperature (e.g., 363 K to 423 K, etc.), the processor <b>116</b> determines that the temperature of the contacts <b>167</b> is substantially less (e.g., 15%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, etc.) (e.g., too cold) than the setpoint temperature, the processor <b>116</b> causes the first exhaust valve <b>176</b> to repositioned to be open (e.g., to be in the open position, to transition from a 20% open position to a 60% open position, etc.) such that the fluid flow is less impeded. By reducing impedance of the fluid flow towards the contacts <b>167</b>, the heat exchange with the contacts <b>167</b> is increased.

When 80% of the fluid flows through first port <b>174</b> and out of the first outlet <b>175</b>, the heat transfer between the fluid and the contacts <b>167</b> will be substantially greater, however, if the electrical connect device <b>188</b> operatively rotates the connecting rod <b>186</b> such that the butterfly valve member <b>184</b> is rotated to allow 20% of the fluid flows through first port <b>174</b> and out of the first outlet <b>175</b>, the heat transfer between the fluid and the contacts <b>167</b> will be substantially less.

The contactor assembly sensor <b>168</b> is configured to facilitate measurement of a property associated with the contacts <b>167</b> and the measurement is then transmitted to the contactor terminal <b>160</b>. The contactor terminal <b>160</b> transmits the measurement to the testing device terminal <b>131</b>, which is then transmitted to the temperature controller <b>112</b>. The temperature controller <b>112</b> receives the measurement and in some embodiments, displays the measurement to a user. The user then adjusts the rotatable insert.

Here, the first exhaust valve <b>176</b> is in a closed position as to inhibit the flow of the fluid from the first exhaust channel <b>170</b> to the first port <b>174</b>.

Additionally, it may be desirable to physically separate the second exhaust valve <b>194</b> from the housing <b>140</b> where space constraints limit an overall size or shape of the housing <b>140</b>.

In the closed position, the flow of the fluid is inhibited such that none of the fluid flows through the second outlet <b>192</b>. In the semi-closed position, the flow of the fluid is impeded by the second exhaust valve <b>194</b> such that only a portion of the fluid flows through the second outlet <b>192</b>. By impeding the flow of the fluid using the second exhaust valve <b>194</b>, the heating or cooling provided from the fluid to the contacts <b>167</b> is decreased (e.g., relative to when the flow of the fluid is not impeded by the second exhaust valve <b>194</b>, etc.). The heat transfer is decreased because the fluid may be restricted in the channel system <b>152</b> and due to the relatively low thermal capacity of the fluid, the fluid experiences a loss of heating or cooling before flowing through the contacts <b>167</b>.

By impeding the flow of the fluid towards the contacts <b>167</b>, the fluid provides less heating to the contacts <b>167</b>.

When the connecting rod is in the closed position, the second port <b>191</b> and the second outlet <b>192</b> are no longer fluidly coupled. In some embodiments, the butterfly valve member is considered to be in a closed position when the butterfly valve member is parallel to the mounting body as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. By restricting the fluid to flow through the second port <b>191</b> and out of the second outlet <b>192</b>, the heat transfer at the socket <b>162</b> is decreased (e.g., relative to when the flow of the fluid is not impeded by the butterfly valve member, etc.). The fluid is restricted from flowing through the connectors to the second exhaust channel <b>172</b> through the second port <b>191</b> and out of the second outlet <b>192</b> and remains within the channel system <b>152</b>, which decreases heat transfer.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">In some embodiments, the processor <b>116</b> transmits a command to the electrical connect device <b>188</b> to operate the connecting rod such that the butterfly valve member is in a semi-closed position. When the butterfly valve member is in a semi-closed position, that flow of the fluid is partially restricted. The electrical connect device <b>188</b> receives a command from the processor <b>116</b> and operatively rotates the connecting rod such that the butterfly valve member is partially rotated. When the butterfly valve member is partially rotated, the second port <b>191</b> and the second outlet <b>192</b> are partially fluidly coupled. In some embodiments, the butterfly valve member is considered partially rotated when the butterfly valve member is offset by an angle (e.g., 20&#xb0;, 25&#xb0;, 30&#xb0;, 40&#xb0;, 45&#xb0;, 50&#xb0;, 60&#xb0;, 70&#xb0;, 75&#xb0;, 80&#xb0;, etc.) with respect to the mounting body. By partially restricting the flow of the fluid, the rate at which heat transfer between the fluid and the contacts <b>167</b> varies based on the rotation of the butterfly valve member with respect to the mounting body. For example, in some embodiments, the electrical connect device <b>188</b> operatively rotates the connecting rod such that the butterfly valve member is rotated to allow 80% of the fluid flows through second port <b>191</b> and out of the second outlet <b>192</b>. When 80% of the fluid flows through second port <b>191</b> and out of the second outlet <b>192</b>, the heat transfer between the fluid and the contacts <b>167</b> will be greater than when 20% of the fluid flows through second port <b>191</b> and out of the second outlet <b>192</b>. In some embodiments, the inlet valve <b>158</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) is configured as a butterfly valve and operatively works in a similar fashion as described above.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">In some embodiments, the second exhaust valve <b>194</b> is a rotatable insert.

In operation, the fluid flows through the contacts <b>167</b> to the contactor assembly sensor <b>168</b>. The contactor assembly sensor <b>168</b> is configured to facilitate measurement of a physical property associated with the contacts <b>167</b> and the measurement is then transmitted to the contactor terminal <b>160</b>. The second contactor assembly terminal transmits the measurement to the testing device terminal <b>131</b>, which is then transmitted to the temperature controller <b>112</b>.
