In particular, UAVs are used to support a wide range of real-world applications including surveillance, reconnaissance, exploration, item transportation, disaster relief, aerial photography, large-scale agriculture monitoring, and others. In many cases, a UAV may be equipped with a variety of different devices, such as different types of sensors and navigation devices, and may be configured to address a broad variety of operational needs. However, equipping such devices has traditionally been limited as UAVs are generally configured to have specific/custom configurations (e.g., a set of specific/custom devices) that do not allow for functionality changes of the UAV without significant reconfiguration of the UAV by a user. Thus, there exists a need for systems and methods that provide greater UAV versatility, such as in terms of future expansion and capabilities.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In one or more embodiments, a UAV includes an accessory port configured to interchangeably attach a plurality of accessory device to the UAV.

The appended drawings are incorporated herein and constitute a part of the detailed description. The detailed description includes specific details for the purpose of providing a thorough understanding of the subject technology. However, it will be clear and apparent to those skilled in the art that the subject technology is not limited to the specific details set forth herein and may be practiced using one or more embodiments. In one or more instances, structures and components are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the concepts of the subject technology. One or more embodiments of the subject disclosure are illustrated by and/or described in connection with one or more figures and are set forth in the claims.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">UAVs generally do not have ancillary ports that allow for versatile attachment of various accessory devices to improve, enhance, and scale a UAV's capabilities. Existing UAV systems are configured to have specific/custom configurations (e.g., are limited to a certain set of specific/custom accessory devices), which do not allow for functionality changes of the UAV system by a user. Oftentimes accessory devices in existing UAV systems are limited by a main payload interface configuration and require reconfiguration of the UAV system. In accordance with various embodiments described herein, an accessory device may be developed and attached to a UAV without disrupting/using a main payload interface or requiring significant reconfiguration of a UAV system. Various systems and methods related to interchangeable and field-replaceable accessory device attachment interfaces (e.g., accessory ports and accessory port interfaces) are disclosed herein to provide greater UAV versatility, such as in terms of future expansion and capabilities for UAV systems.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">For example, in an embodiment, an accessory device may be connected to an accessory port of a UAV. The accessory port may be configured for interchangeable attachment of a plurality of accessory devices to the UAV. The accessory port may have a mechanical interface configured to engage with the accessory device and physically secure the accessory device to the accessory port (e.g., by using a locking member of the mechanical interface). The accessory port may have an electrical interface configured to electrically connect the accessory device to the UAV, where the mechanical interface aligns the accessory device relative to the electrical interface when the accessory device is connected to the accessory port. The accessory port may automatically provide a detection signal to the UAV indicating that the accessory device has been connected to the accessory port. In response to the automatic detection of the accessory device, the UAV may automatically identify the accessory device (e.g., by retrieving identification information from the accessory device) and automatically or selectively adjust its functionality based on the identification of accessory device. For example, the UAV may have different embedded functional parameter set(s) and change/adjust its functional parameters based on the identity of the accessory device that has been attached to the UAV. In some embodiments, different/new functional parameter set(s) could be introduced to the UAV by attaching an accessory device to the UAV. For example, functional parameter set(s) may be downloaded from the accessory device upon detection and identification of the accessory device, and the downloaded functional parameter set(s) may be integrated into an operation of the UAV. In various embodiments, a user may be able to control which functional parameter set(s) are integrated into an operation of the UAV through a base station user interface. For example, the UAV may send the detection and identification information to the base station and in turn may receive instructions, selected by the user, for integrating certain functional parameters into the operation of the UAV. Further embodiments and details are described below in reference to the accompanying figures of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a block diagram of a survey system <b>100</b> including a UAV <b>110</b> in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present disclosure.
