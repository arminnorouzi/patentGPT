The X-ray limiter includes four diaphragm blades. Four physical operating units that correspond to the four diaphragm blades are placed at four positions on the console. When viewed from side of operator of the console, the four operating units are placed on far side, near side, left side, and right side. Far-side operating unit, near-side operating unit, left-side operating unit, and right-side operating unit correspond to upper diaphragm blade, lower diaphragm blade, left-side diaphragm blade, and right-side diaphragm blade, respectively, with reference to an X-ray image displayed in a display. An operation of moving the far-side operating unit in far-side direction results in movement of the upper diaphragm blade in upward direction of the X-ray image displayed in the display, and an operation of moving the far-side operating unit in near-side direction results in movement of the upper diaphragm blade in downward direction of the X-ray image displayed in the display. An operation of moving the near-side operating unit in far-side direction results in movement of the lower diaphragm blade in upward direction of the X-ray image displayed in the display, and an operation of moving the near-side operating unit in near-side direction results in movement of the lower diaphragm blade in downward direction of the X-ray image displayed in the display. An operation of moving the left-side operating unit in leftward direction results in movement of the left-side diaphragm blade in leftward direction of the X-ray image displayed in the display, and an operation of moving the left-side operating unit in rightward direction results in movement of the left-side diaphragm blade in rightward direction of the X-ray image displayed in the display. An operation of moving the right-side operating unit in leftward direction results in movement of the right-side diaphragm blade in leftward direction of the X-ray image displayed in the display, and an operation of moving the right-side operating unit in rightward direction results in movement of the right-side diaphragm blade in rightward direction of the X-ray image displayed in the display.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Exemplary embodiments of the X-ray diagnosis apparatus and the console are described below in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Firstly, the explanation is given about a first embodiment. In the first embodiment, the explanation is given with reference to an X-ray diagnosis apparatus <b>1</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary configuration of the X-ray diagnosis apparatus <b>1</b> according to the first embodiment.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the X-ray diagnosis apparatus <b>1</b> includes an X-ray high-voltage generator <b>11</b>, a first X-ray tube <b>12</b>, a first X-ray limiter <b>13</b>, a first X-ray detector <b>14</b>, a first arm <b>15</b>, a second X-ray tube <b>16</b>, a second X-ray limiter <b>17</b>, a second X-ray detector <b>18</b>, a second arm <b>19</b>, a tabletop <b>20</b>, a memory <b>21</b>, a display <b>22</b>, an input interface <b>23</b>, and processing circuitry <b>24</b>. That is, the X-ray diagnosis apparatus is a biplane device including the first arm <b>15</b> and the second arm <b>19</b>. Moreover, the input interface <b>23</b> includes a console (described later).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The X-ray high-voltage generator <b>11</b> supplies a high voltage to the first X-ray tube <b>12</b> and the second X-ray tube <b>16</b> under the control of the processing circuitry <b>24</b>. For example, the X-ray high-voltage generator <b>11</b> includes electrical circuitry such as a transformer and a rectifier; includes a high-voltage generation device that generates a high voltage to be applied to the first X-ray tube <b>12</b> and the second X-ray tube <b>16</b>; and includes an X-ray control device that controls the output voltage according to the X-rays bombarded from the first X-ray tube <b>12</b> and the second X-ray tube <b>16</b>. The high-voltage generation device can be of the transformer type or of the inverter type.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The first X-ray tube <b>12</b> as well as the second X-ray tube <b>16</b> is a vacuum tube including a cathode (a filament) that generates thermions and an anode (a target) that generates X-rays in response to the collision of thermions. The first X-ray tube <b>12</b> as well as the second X-ray tube <b>16</b> generates X-rays by bombarding thermions from the cathode toward the anode using the high voltage supplied from the X-ray high-voltage generator <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The first X-ray limiter <b>13</b> as well as the second X-ray limiter <b>17</b> includes a collimator that narrows down the X-ray irradiation range and a filter that regulates the X-rays.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The collimator in the first X-ray limiter <b>13</b> includes, for example, four slidable diaphragm blades that, when slid, results in sharp focusing of the X-rays generated by the first X-ray tube <b>12</b> and irradiation of a subject P with the X-rays. The diaphragm blades are plate-like members made of lead, and are disposed near the X-ray irradiation hole of the first X-ray tube <b>12</b> for enabling adjustment of the X-ray irradiation range. In an identical manner, in the collimator of the second X-ray limiter <b>17</b>, when the diaphragm blades are slid, it results in sharp focusing of the X-rays generated by the second X-ray tube <b>16</b> and irradiation of the subject P with the X-rays.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The filters provided in the first X-ray limiter <b>13</b> and the second X-ray limiter <b>17</b> adjust the radiation dose and the radiation quality of the transmissive X-rays with the aim of reducing the exposure dose of the subject P and enhancing the image quality of the X-ray image data. For example, the first X-ray limiter <b>13</b> and the second X-ray limiter <b>17</b> include various X-ray filters such as a radiation quality adjustment filter, compensating filters, and a radiation dose reduction filter. The radiation quality adjustment filter enables varying the radiation quality of the transmissive X-rays depending on the material and the thickness of the filter, and enables achieving reduction in the soft ray components that are easily absorbable by the subject P and reduction in the high-energy components that cause deterioration in the contrast of the X-ray image data. The compensating filters attenuate some of the X-rays, which are irradiated from the X-ray tube, with the aim of suppressing halation. The radiation dose reduction filter attenuates some of the X-rays, which are irradiated from the X-ray tube, in such a way that the X-rays bombarded onto other sites have a lower radiation dose than the X-rays bombarded onto the region of interest, with the aim of reducing the exposure dose of the subject P.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">For example, the first X-ray limiter <b>13</b> and the second X-ray limiter <b>17</b> have a drive mechanism such as a motor and an actuator, and control the X-ray irradiation by operating the drive mechanism according to an input operation received from the operator via the input interface <b>23</b>.

Moreover, since the operating units corresponding to compensating filters have a different shape than the operating units not corresponding to compensating filters; the operator becomes able to understand, even without looking, for example, whether the operator unit that he or she is touching is an operating unit corresponding to a compensating filter. Furthermore, instead of giving a simple quadrangular shape to the stick <b>2321</b><i>b</i>, since the shape has a combination of straight lines and curved lines; the corner portions of the quadrangle are eliminated thereby preventing jamming of fingers of the operator at the corner portions.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, the explanation is given about the case in which the operating units corresponding to compensating filters have a different shape than the operating units not corresponding to compensating filters. However, the embodiment is not limited by that case. That is, in the diaphragm operation console <b>232</b>, the operating units corresponding to the compensating filters and the operating units not corresponding to the compensating filters can be different from each other in aspects other than the shape. For example, the operating units corresponding to the compensating filters and the operating units not corresponding to the compensating filters can be different from each other in the color, in the design pattern, or in the texture either in place of the shape or in addition to the shape. Apart from that, for example, using an arbitrary method such as illuminating only the operating units corresponding to compensating filters so as to enable the operator to recognize those operating units, it is possible to differentiate the operating units corresponding to compensating filters from the operating units not corresponding to compensating filters.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">The open button <b>2323</b> is meant for causing retraction of the four diaphragm blades all at once.

As an example, when the open button <b>2323</b> is operated, the acquisition function <b>241</b> moves the diaphragm blade <b>131</b><i>a </i>in the upward direction with respect to the X-ray image IM displayed in the display <b>22</b>; moves the diaphragm blade <b>131</b><i>b </i>in the downward direction with respect to the X-ray image IM displayed in the display <b>22</b>; moves the diaphragm blade <b>131</b><i>c </i>in the leftward direction with respect to the X-ray image IM displayed in the display <b>22</b>; moves the diaphragm blade <b>131</b><i>d </i>in the rightward direction with respect to the X-ray image IM displayed in the display <b>22</b>; and thus causes retraction of the four diaphragm blades all at once. That is, when the open button <b>2323</b> is operated, the four diaphragm blades that surround the X-ray image IM, which is displayed in the display <b>22</b>, from four directions are retracted in the four directions to move away from the X-ray image IM.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, the open button <b>2323</b> is surrounded by the four operating units (the sticks <b>2321</b><i>a</i>, <b>2321</b><i>b</i>, <b>2321</b><i>c</i>, and <b>2321</b><i>d</i>). Moreover, the X-ray image IM that is displayed in the display <b>22</b> is surrounded by the four diaphragm blades. In this way, the positional relationship of the open button <b>2323</b> with the four operating units is similar to the positional relationship of the X-ray image IM, which is displayed in the display <b>22</b>, with the four diaphragm blades. Moreover, when the diaphragm operation console <b>231</b> is viewed while facing it, the open button <b>2323</b> has the outer periphery made of four straight lines and four curved lines that join the straight lines.

The first area R<b>3</b> corresponds to the hole formed in the radiation dose reduction filter. That is, the X-ray image IM displayed in the first area R<b>3</b> is acquired based on the X-rays that pass through the hole formed on the radiation dose reduction filter and fall onto the subject P without getting attenuated due to the radiation dose reduction filter. On the other hand, the X-ray image IM displayed in the second area R<b>4</b> is acquired based on the X-rays that get attenuated because of transmitting through the radiation dose reduction filter.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">Subsequently, the acquisition function <b>241</b> receives an operation with respect to the first area R<b>3</b> from the operator. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, the operator operates the operation stick <b>2325</b><i>c</i>. In response to the operation of the operation stick <b>2325</b><i>c</i>, the acquisition function <b>241</b> makes the radiation dose reduction filter perform translational movement. As a result, as illustrated in a display example D<b>5</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, the first area R<b>3</b> that corresponds to the hole formed on the radiation dose reduction filter also moves.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">For example, when an operation of inclining the operation stick <b>2325</b><i>c </i>in the far side is performed, the acquisition function <b>241</b> moves the first area R<b>3</b> in the upward direction. That is, when an operation of inclining the operation stick <b>2325</b><i>c </i>in the far side is performed, the acquisition function <b>241</b> moves the radiation dose reduction filter in the upward direction of the X-ray image IM displayed in the display <b>22</b>. Thus, it becomes intuitively easy to understand that an operation of inclining the operation stick <b>2325</b><i>c </i>in the far side results in the upward movement of the radiation dose reduction filter. The same is the case when an operation is performed to incline the operation stick <b>2325</b><i>c </i>in the near-side direction, or the leftward direction, or the rightward direction, or some other arbitrary direction. That is, the operation stick <b>2325</b><i>c </i>enables intuitive operations with respect to the radiation dose reduction filter.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">As described above, in the spot ROI mode, the position of the first area R<b>3</b> can be adjusted using the operation stick <b>2325</b><i>c</i>. For example, according to the position of the region of interest in the subject P, the operator adjusts the position of the first area R<b>3</b>. As a result, regarding the region of interest, the X-ray images IM of high image quality can be acquired using the X-rays that are bombarded onto the subject without any attenuation attributed to the radiation dose reduction filter.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">Regarding the second area R<b>4</b> that is the surrounding area of the first area R<b>3</b>, the X-ray images IM are acquired using the X-rays that are attenuated as a result transmitting through the radiation dose reduction filter, and thus the radiation exposure of the subject P can be reduced. Moreover, in the spot ROI mode, unlike in the spot fluoroscopy mode, real-time images can be displayed regarding the first area R<b>3</b> as well as the second area R<b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">As described above, according to the first embodiment, the first X-ray limiter <b>13</b> includes four diaphragm blades. On the diaphragm operation console <b>232</b>, four operating units corresponding to the four diaphragm blades are placed at four positions. The four operating units are placed on the far side, the near side, the left side, and the right side when viewed by the operator of the diaphragm operation console <b>232</b>. The far-side stick <b>2321</b><i>a</i>, the near-side stick <b>2321</b><i>b</i>, the left-side stick <b>2321</b><i>c</i>, and the right-side stick <b>2321</b><i>d </i>correspond to the upper diaphragm blade <b>131</b><i>a</i>, the lower diaphragm blade <b>131</b><i>b</i>, the left-side diaphragm blade <b>131</b><i>c</i>, and the right-side diaphragm blade <b>131</b><i>d</i>, respectively, with reference to the X-ray image IM displayed in the display <b>22</b>. That is, the far-side stick <b>2321</b><i>a</i>, the near-side stick <b>2321</b><i>b</i>, the left-side stick <b>2321</b><i>c</i>, and the right-side stick <b>2321</b><i>d </i>receive operations for moving the upper diaphragm blade <b>131</b><i>a</i>, the lower diaphragm blade <b>131</b><i>b</i>, the left-side diaphragm blade <b>131</b><i>c</i>, and the right-side diaphragm blade <b>131</b><i>d</i>, respectively, with respect to the X-ray image IM displayed in the display <b>22</b>. Thus, the X-ray diagnosis apparatus according to the first embodiment enables intuitive operations of the diaphragm blades and enables achieving enhancement in the operability related to the diaphragm blades.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">For example, the sticks <b>2321</b><i>a</i>, <b>2321</b><i>b</i>, <b>2321</b><i>c</i>, and <b>2321</b><i>d </i>are placed in four directions of the far side, the near side, the left side, and the right side as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. Such an arrangement of the operating units is similar to the arrangement of the four diaphragm blades, thereby enabling the operator to intuitively understand which operating unit corresponds to which diaphragm blade.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">For example, an operation of inclining the far-side stick <b>2321</b><i>a </i>in the far-side direction results in the movement of the upper diaphragm blade <b>131</b><i>a </i>in the upward direction of the X-ray image IM displayed in the display <b>22</b>, and an operation of inclining the far-side stick <b>2321</b><i>a </i>in the near-side direction results in the movement of the upper diaphragm blade <b>131</b><i>a </i>in the downward direction of the X-ray image IM displayed in the display <b>22</b>. Similarly, an operation of inclining the near-side stick <b>2321</b><i>b </i>in the far-side direction results in the movement of the lower diaphragm blade <b>131</b><i>b </i>in the upward direction of the X-ray image IM displayed in the display <b>22</b>, and an operation of inclining the near-side stick <b>2321</b><i>b </i>in the near-side direction results in the movement of the lower diaphragm blade <b>131</b><i>b </i>in the downward direction of the X-ray image IM displayed in the display <b>22</b>. Moreover, an operation of inclining the left-side stick <b>2321</b><i>c </i>in the leftward direction results in the movement of the left-side diaphragm blade <b>131</b><i>c </i>in the leftward direction of the X-ray image IM displayed in the display <b>22</b>, and an operation of inclining the left-side stick <b>2321</b><i>c </i>in the rightward direction results in the movement of the left-side diaphragm blade <b>131</b><i>c </i>in the rightward direction of the X-ray image IM displayed in the display <b>22</b>. Furthermore, an operation of inclining the right-side stick <b>2321</b><i>d </i>in the leftward direction results in the movement of the right-side diaphragm blade <b>131</b><i>d </i>in the leftward direction of the X-ray image IM displayed in the display <b>22</b>, and an operation of inclining the right-side stick <b>2321</b><i>d </i>in the rightward direction results in the movement of the right-side diaphragm blade <b>131</b><i>d </i>in the rightward direction of the X-ray image IM displayed in the display <b>22</b>. In this way, since the directions of operating the operating units match with the directions of movement of the corresponding diaphragm blades with respect to the X-ray image IM displayed in the display <b>22</b>, the operator becomes able to intuitively understand the manner in which the operating units need to be operated in order to move the diaphragm blades in the desired directions.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">As described above, according to the first embodiment, the diaphragm operation console <b>232</b> includes four sticks (the sticks <b>2321</b><i>a</i>, <b>2321</b><i>b</i>, <b>2321</b><i>c</i>, and <b>2321</b><i>d</i>) that receive inclination operations. That is, the diaphragm operation console <b>232</b> includes four physical operating units corresponding to four diaphragm blades. Hence, the operator of the diaphragm operation console <b>232</b> can recognize the operating units visually as well as tactually, and can operate the four operating units corresponding to the four diaphragm blades with more ease.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">Moreover, as described above, according to the first embodiment, the four diaphragm blades can be individually moved. For example, the operator can operate any one of the sticks <b>2321</b><i>a</i>, <b>2321</b><i>b</i>, <b>2321</b><i>c</i>, and <b>2321</b><i>d</i>, and can independently operate each of the four diaphragm blades. Thus, the X-ray diagnosis apparatus according to the first embodiment enables achieving enhancement in the degree of freedom in operating the diaphragm blades.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">Meanwhile, if the movement of two opposite diaphragm blades is to be coordinated while adjusting the diaphragm blades, then the operator can simultaneously operate the two corresponding operating units. For example, the operator can hold the far-side stick <b>2321</b><i>a </i>and the near-side stick <b>2321</b><i>b </i>at the same time with one hand, and can move the upper diaphragm blade <b>131</b><i>a </i>and the lower diaphragm blade <b>131</b><i>b </i>in a symmetrical manner and shorten the distance therebetween. In an identical manner, the operator can hold the left-side stick <b>2321</b><i>c </i>and the right-side stick <b>2321</b><i>d </i>at the same time with one hand, and can move the left-side diaphragm blade <b>131</b><i>c </i>and the right-side diaphragm blade <b>131</b><i>d </i>in a symmetrical manner and shorten the distance therebetween. For example, the far-side stick <b>2321</b><i>a </i>and the near-side stick <b>2321</b><i>b </i>are placed at such a distance from each other that they can be commonly and easily be held with one hand. As an example, the far-side stick <b>2321</b><i>a </i>and the near-side stick <b>2321</b><i>b </i>are placed at such a distance from each other that they can be held using the thumb and the index finger of the same hand. In an identical manner, the left-side stick <b>2321</b><i>c </i>and the right-side stick <b>2321</b><i>d </i>are placed at such a distance from each other than they can be commonly and easily be held with one hand.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">As described above, according to the first embodiment, the first X-ray limiter <b>13</b> further includes the compensating filters <b>132</b><i>a</i>, <b>132</b><i>b</i>, and <b>132</b><i>c</i>. The diaphragm operation console <b>232</b> further includes the switching buttons <b>2322</b><i>a </i>and <b>2322</b><i>b </i>as switching units for switching between the diaphragm mode, which is meant for operating the four diaphragm blades, and the filter mode, which is meant for operating the three compensating filters.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">There are similarities in operating the compensating filters and operating the diaphragm blades. For example, while operating the compensating filter <b>132</b><i>a </i>and while operating the diaphragm blade <b>131</b><i>c</i>, there is movement in the left-right direction with respect to the X-ray image IM displayed in the display <b>22</b>. In that regard, in the diaphragm operation console <b>232</b>, by switching between the diaphragm mode and the filter mode, the compensating filters as well as the diaphragm blades can be operated using the stick <b>2321</b><i>c</i>. Thus, as compared to the case in which the operating units for operating the diaphragm blades are provided separately from the operating units for operating the compensating filters, the X-ray diagnosis apparatus <b>1</b> enables achieving reduction in the number of operating units and downsizing the console. Moreover, as a result of reducing the number of operating units, the X-ray diagnosis apparatus <b>1</b> enables designing the operating units of a large size thereby making it easier to operate the console.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">As described above, according to the first embodiment, when the filter mode is set; the sticks <b>2321</b><i>c</i>, <b>2321</b><i>d</i>, and <b>2321</b><i>a </i>receive operations with respect to the compensating filters <b>132</b><i>a</i>, <b>132</b><i>b</i>, and <b>132</b><i>c</i>, respectively. Thus, the X-ray diagnosis apparatus <b>1</b> according to the first embodiment enables intuitive operations with respect to the compensating filters and enables achieving enhancement in the operability related to the compensating filters.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">For example, the sticks <b>2321</b><i>c</i>, <b>2321</b><i>d</i>, and <b>2321</b><i>a </i>are placed on the left side, the right side, and the far side, respectively, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>.

Moreover, an operation of inclining the stick <b>2321</b><i>d </i>in the leftward direction results in the movement of the compensating filter <b>132</b><i>b </i>in the leftward direction of the X-ray image IM displayed in the display <b>22</b>, and an operation of inclining the stick <b>2321</b><i>d </i>in the rightward direction results in the movement of the compensating filter <b>132</b><i>b </i>in the rightward direction of the X-ray image IM displayed in the display <b>22</b>.

However, the number of compensating filters included in the first X-ray limiter <b>13</b> can be appropriately changed. For example, the first X-ray limiter <b>13</b> can include only the compensating filter <b>132</b><i>b </i>representing the right-side filter, or can include only the compensating filter <b>132</b><i>c </i>representing the upper-side filter, or can include only the compensating filter <b>132</b><i>d </i>representing the lower-side filter. Alternatively, for example, the first X-ray limiter <b>13</b> can include the compensating filters <b>132</b><i>a </i>and <b>132</b><i>c</i>, or can include the compensating filters <b>132</b><i>a </i>and <b>132</b><i>d</i>, or can include the compensating filters <b>132</b><i>b </i>and <b>132</b><i>c</i>, or can include the compensating filters <b>132</b><i>b </i>and <b>132</b><i>d</i>, or can include the compensating filters <b>132</b><i>c </i>and <b>132</b><i>d</i>. Still alternatively, for example, the first X-ray limiter <b>13</b> can include the compensating filters <b>132</b><i>a</i>, <b>132</b><i>b</i>, and <b>132</b><i>d</i>; or can include the compensating filters <b>132</b><i>a</i>, <b>132</b><i>c</i>, and <b>132</b><i>d</i>; or can include the compensating filters <b>132</b><i>b</i>, <b>132</b><i>c</i>, and <b>132</b><i>d</i>. Still alternatively, for example, the first X-ray limiter <b>13</b> can include the compensating filters <b>132</b><i>a</i>, <b>132</b><i>b</i>, <b>132</b><i>c</i>, and <b>132</b><i>d. </i></p><p id="p-0210" num="0209">In this way, the first X-ray limiter <b>13</b> includes at least a single compensating filter. Moreover, the diaphragm operation console <b>232</b> includes at least a single operating unit corresponding to the compensating filter included in the first X-ray limiter <b>13</b>, and the operating unit receives operations with respect to the compensating filter included in the first X-ray limiter <b>13</b>. For example, the at least single operating unit included in the diaphragm operation console <b>232</b> receives operations in at least one of the far-side direction, the near-side direction, the leftward direction, and the rightward direction. Thus, an operation of moving the at least single operating unit in at least one of the far-side direction, the near-side direction, the leftward direction, and the rightward direction results in the translational movement of the at least single compensating filter that is included in the first X-ray limiter <b>13</b>. Moreover, the at least single operating unit included in the diaphragm operation console <b>232</b> receives operations for rotating in at least the clockwise direction or the counterclockwise direction.

For example, when the first X-ray limiter <b>13</b> does not include any diaphragm blade, the filter mode can be set on a continuous basis. Moreover, also when the first X-ray limiter <b>13</b> includes diaphragm blades, the diaphragm operation console can be configured not to include the switching units for switching between the diaphragm mode and the filter mode. For example, the at least single operating unit included in the diaphragm operation console <b>232</b> can receive operations with respect to the compensating filter included in the first X-ray limiter <b>13</b>, and the operations with respect to diaphragm blades can be received by a separate input interface other than the diaphragm operation console <b>232</b>.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0211">In the embodiments described above, the operations with respect to the first X-ray limiter <b>13</b> are received.

However, the embodiments are not limited to that case. Alternatively, for example, the X-ray diagnosis apparatus <b>1</b> can be a single plane device. As an example, the X-ray diagnosis apparatus <b>1</b> can be configured not to include the second X-ray tube <b>16</b>, the second X-ray limiter <b>17</b>, the second X-ray detector <b>18</b>, and the second arm <b>19</b>.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0213">When the X-ray diagnosis apparatus <b>1</b> is a single plane device, the diaphragm operation console <b>232</b> can be configured not to include the switches for switching between receiving operations with respect to the first X-ray limiter <b>13</b> and receiving operations with respect to the second X-ray limiter <b>17</b>.

For example, the operating units can be arranged as illustrated on a diaphragm operation console <b>233</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b> and <b>18</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b> and <b>18</b></figref> are diagrams illustrating an example of a console according to a third embodiment.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0216">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b> and <b>18</b></figref>, the diaphragm operation console <b>233</b> has the following components arranged therein: sticks <b>2331</b><i>a</i>, <b>2331</b><i>b</i>, <b>2331</b><i>c</i>, and <b>2331</b><i>d</i>; switching buttons <b>2332</b><i>a </i>and <b>2332</b><i>b</i>; an open button <b>2333</b>; arm switching buttons <b>2334</b><i>a </i>and <b>2334</b><i>b</i>; fluoroscopy mode switching buttons <b>2335</b><i>a </i>and <b>2335</b><i>b</i>; and an operation stick <b>2335</b><i>c. </i></p><p id="p-0218" num="0217">The arm switching buttons <b>2334</b><i>a </i>and <b>2334</b><i>b </i>correspond to the arm switching buttons <b>2324</b><i>a </i>and <b>2324</b><i>b</i>, respectively, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. That is, the arm switching buttons <b>2324</b><i>a </i>and <b>2324</b><i>b </i>are switches for switching between receiving operations with respect to the first X-ray limiter <b>13</b> and receiving operations with respect to the second X-ray limiter <b>17</b>. For example, when the arm switching button <b>2334</b><i>a </i>is selected, according to the input operation received via the diaphragm operation console <b>233</b>, the acquisition function <b>241</b> controls the operations of the first X-ray limiter <b>13</b> held by the first arm <b>15</b>. On the other hand, when the arm switching button <b>2334</b><i>b </i>is selected, according to the input operation received via the diaphragm operation console <b>233</b>, the acquisition function controls the operations of the second X-ray limiter <b>17</b> held by the second arm <b>19</b>. The following explanation is given for the case in which the arm switching button <b>2334</b><i>a </i>is selected, and the operations with respect to the first X-ray limiter <b>13</b> are received.</p><p id="p-0219" num="0218">The sticks <b>2331</b><i>a</i>, <b>2331</b><i>b</i>, <b>2331</b><i>c</i>, and <b>2331</b><i>d </i>are operating units corresponding to the sticks <b>2321</b><i>a</i>, <b>2321</b><i>b</i>, <b>2321</b><i>c</i>, and <b>2321</b><i>d</i>, respectively, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. For example, when the diaphragm mode is set, the far-side stick <b>2331</b><i>a </i>receives operations with respect to the upper diaphragm blade <b>131</b><i>a</i>; the near-side stick <b>2331</b><i>b </i>receives operations with respect to the lower diaphragm blade <b>131</b><i>b</i>; the left-side stick <b>2331</b><i>c </i>receives operations with respect to the left-side diaphragm blade <b>131</b><i>c</i>; and the right-side stick <b>2331</b><i>d </i>receives operations with respect to the right-side diaphragm blade <b>131</b><i>d. </i></p><p id="p-0220" num="0219">The switching buttons <b>2332</b><i>a </i>and <b>2332</b><i>b </i>correspond to the switching buttons <b>2322</b><i>a </i>and <b>2322</b><i>b</i>, respectively, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. That is, the switching buttons <b>2332</b><i>a </i>and <b>2332</b><i>b </i>are switching units for switching between the diaphragm mode that is meant for operating the diaphragm blades and the filter mode that is meant for operating the compensating filters. For example, when the switching button <b>2332</b><i>a </i>indicated by &#x201c;BLADE&#x201d; is selected, according to the input operation received via the diaphragm operation console <b>233</b>, the acquisition function <b>241</b> controls the operations of the diaphragm blades <b>131</b><i>a</i>, <b>131</b><i>b</i>, <b>131</b><i>c</i>, and <b>131</b><i>d</i>.

That is, the open button <b>2333</b> is a button for causing retraction of the four diaphragm blades all at once. For example, when the open button <b>2333</b> is operated by the operator; the acquisition function <b>241</b> causes retraction of the diaphragm blades <b>131</b><i>a</i>, <b>131</b><i>b</i>, <b>131</b><i>c</i>, and <b>131</b><i>d </i>all at once to an external area excluded from the X-ray irradiation area. Meanwhile, the configuration can be such that, when the open button <b>2333</b> is operated, the acquisition function <b>241</b> causes retraction of the four diaphragm blades as well as the compensating filters.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0221">The fluoroscopy mode switching buttons <b>2335</b><i>a </i>and <b>2335</b><i>b </i>correspond to the fluoroscopy mode switching buttons <b>2325</b><i>a </i>and <b>2325</b><i>b</i>, respectively, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. That is, the fluoroscopy mode switching buttons <b>2335</b><i>a </i>and <b>2335</b><i>b </i>are switches for switching between the fluoroscopy modes. For example, when the fluoroscopy mode switching button <b>2335</b><i>a </i>indicated by &#x201c;SPOT.F&#x201d; is selected, the acquisition function <b>241</b> sets the spot fluoroscopy mode as the fluoroscopy mode.

When the spot ROI mode is set, the operation stick <b>2335</b><i>c </i>moves, with respect to the subject P, the area in which X-rays are bombarded onto the subject P without any attenuation attributed to the radiation dose reduction filter.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0223">In an identical manner to the case of the diaphragm operation console <b>232</b>, the hardware meant for implementing the operating units of the diaphragm operation console <b>233</b> can be appropriately changed.

However, instead of including the four sticks, the diaphragm operation console <b>233</b> can include some other hardware such as four operating units that receive sliding operations or four wheel-shaped operating units. In an identical manner, the switching buttons <b>2332</b><i>a </i>and <b>2332</b><i>b</i>, the open button <b>2333</b>, the arm switching buttons <b>2334</b><i>a </i>and <b>2334</b><i>b</i>, the fluoroscopy mode switching buttons <b>2335</b><i>a </i>and <b>2335</b><i>b</i>, and the operation stick <b>2335</b><i>c </i>can be implemented using some other hardware.</p><p id="p-0225" num="0224">Moreover, in an identical manner to the case of the diaphragm operation console <b>232</b>, some operating units of the diaphragm operation console <b>233</b> can be appropriately omitted. For example, when the first X-ray limiter <b>13</b> and the second X-ray limiter <b>17</b> respectively include three diaphragm blades, the diaphragm operation console <b>233</b> can include only three operating units, from among the four operating units (the sticks <b>2331</b><i>a</i>, <b>2331</b><i>b</i>, <b>2331</b><i>c</i>, and <b>2331</b><i>d</i>) illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b> and <b>18</b></figref>, corresponding to the three diaphragm blades.

Meanwhile, for example, when the X-ray diagnosis apparatus <b>1</b> is a single plane device, the diaphragm operation console <b>233</b> can be configured not to include the arm switching buttons <b>2334</b><i>a </i>and <b>2334</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0226" num="0225">The constituent elements of the devices illustrated in the drawings are merely conceptual, and need not be physically configured as illustrated.
