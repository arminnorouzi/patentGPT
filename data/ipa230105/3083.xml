In order to improve the ROP for drilling in the deep/ultra-deep wells, a variety of percussion drilling tools has been developed, which generates a good effect in speed enhancement. However, these tools are generally immature. The lifespan of percussion drilling tools in oil drilling applications has always been a bottleneck restricting the development of this technology.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Practice has proved that a combination of compound dual-drive drilling technology with rotary percussive drilling technology brings about a remarkable effect in speed enhancement. The compound dual-drive drilling technology preferably adopts a high-power motor drilling tool to improve rotational speed and cutting strength. In the rotary percussive drilling process, the WOB keeps cutting teeth in close contact with the rock, and the percussive load can instantly increase the rock crushing work ratio. The cracks generated are impacted under the high rotational speed of the screw, further promoting rock crushing and rotary shear breaking, thereby improving rock-breaking efficiency.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In view of some or all of the above problems, the present invention proposes a speed-enhancing drilling tool, which combines advantages of the compound dual-drive drilling technology, the rotary percussive drilling technology and the elastic energy storage principle together, achieving comprehensive functions of high-power rotary torque, adjustable percussive energy and high-speed rotary cutting, thereby generating a significant effect in speed enhancement and indicating excellent application prospect.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to the present invention, a speed-enhancing drilling tool is proposed, comprising: an upstream drill string, including a drive motor and a first driving rod coupled with the drive motor, wherein the first driving rod extends in an axial direction, and the drive motor is configured to drive the first driving rod in rotation; a downstream drilling bit; and a percussive device, which is connected between the upstream drilling string and the downstream drilling bit and configured to generate impact on the downstream drilling bit in the axial direction. The percussive device comprises: a rotary driving part, which is configured to rotate around its axis, and has an upper end engaged with the first driving rod to rotate together with the first driving rod; a rotary working part, which has an upper end engaged with a lower end of the rotary driving part and a lower end connected with the downstream drilling bit, wherein the rotary working part is configured to be driven by the rotary driving part to rotate about its axis, and axially movable relative to the rotary driving part; and a percussion generating part arranged around the rotary working part and having an upper end abutting against an elastic member, wherein the percussion generating part is configured to move along the axial direction relative to the rotary working part, so as to impact the rotary working part downwardly along the axial direction under action of the elastic member.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">With the help of the elastic member, the percussion generating part can repeatedly impact on the rotary working part, which is connected with the downstream drilling bit, along the axial direction. Accordingly, the impact energy is transmitted to the downstream drilling bit, which applies impact on the formation. In this manner, the downstream drilling bit can impact the formation while performing rotary drilling operations. This compound action facilitates to break up the formation rapidly, which can increase drilling efficiency and reduce drilling cost.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one embodiment, the rotary driving part comprises a second driving rod connected at a lower end of the first driving rod, and the second driving rod comprises an upstream segment and a downstream segment connected to the upstream segment. An outer diameter of the upstream segment is smaller than that of the downstream segment. A lower driving tooth with an upwardly facing surface is formed on an outer wall of the second driving rod at an area connecting the upstream segment with the downstream segment. The percussion generating part comprises a percussive sleeve arranged around the second driving rod. The percussive sleeve includes a first sleeve segment and a second sleeve segment located below and connected with the first sleeve segment. An inner diameter of the first sleeve segment is smaller than that of the second sleeve segment. An upper driven tooth with a downwardly facing surface is formed on an inner wall of the percussive sleeve at an area connecting the first sleeve segment with the second sleeve segment. The percussive sleeve is able to reciprocally move axially relative to the second driving rod under cooperation of the lower driving tooth and the upper driven tooth when the second driving rod rotates relative to the percussive sleeve.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one embodiment, the upper driven tooth and the lower driving tooth are each configured with an upward tooth segment that is inclined upwardly in a direction opposite to a rotating direction, and a downward tooth segment that is connected with the upward tooth segment and inclined downwardly in the direction opposite to the rotating direction, wherein an inclination of the upward tooth segment is smaller than that of the downward tooth segment.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one embodiment, the rotary working part comprises a rotary rod, which has a lower end connected with the downstream drilling bit, and an upper end connected with the lower end of the second driving rod through a key, so that the rotary rod is fixed relative to the second driving rod in a circumferential direction but moveable relative thereto in the axial direction.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one embodiment, multiple driving keys extending in the axial direction are formed at the lower end of the second driving rod, and spaced apart from each other in the circumferential direction. Multiple mating keys extending in the axial direction are formed at the upper end of the rotary rod, and spaced apart from each other in the circumferential direction. Said multiple driving keys and said multiple mating keys are alternately mated with each other in the circumferential direction.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one embodiment, the driving keys extending in the axial direction are formed on an outer side wall at the lower end of the second driving rod. Driving slots extending in the axial direction are formed on an outer side wall of the upper end of the rotary rod. Each driving key is inserted into a corresponding driving slot to move in said corresponding drive slot along the axial direction.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one embodiment, the rotary rod comprises a first rotating segment, and a second rotating segment located below and connected with the first rotating segment. An outer diameter of the first rotating segment is smaller than that of the second rotating segment. A step surface facing upward is formed at an area connecting the first rotating segment with the second rotating segment. A lower end face of the percussive sleeve is opposite to the step surface, and an axial gap exists between the upper driven tooth and the lower driving tooth when the lower end face of the percussive sleeve is in contact with the step surface.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one embodiment, an accommodating groove is formed on an outer side wall of the second rotating segment, and a limiting block protruding radially outward relative to the outer side wall of the second rotating segment is arranged in the accommodating groove. The percussive device further includes an outer shell, at least a part of which surrounds the second rotating segment, so that the limiting block is sandwiched between the second rotating segment and the outer shell. A wear-resistant joint is connected to a lower end of the outer shell, and has an upper end inserted into the lower end of the outer shell. An upper end face of the wear-resistant joint is opposite to the limiting block, for restricting axial movement range of the limiting block. The limiting block includes a first matching segment and a second matching segment located below and connected with the first matching segment. An outer diameter of the first matching segment is smaller than that of the second matching segment. An outer side wall of the second matching segment is in engagement with an inner wall of the outer shell, while a separating space is formed between the first matching segment and the outer shell. A mounting sleeve is provided between the outer shell and the second rotating segment in an area above the limiting block. The mounting sleeve extends into the separating space to maintain a radial position of the limiting block.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one embodiment, an orienting key extending in the axial direction is formed on an outer side wall of the percussive sleeve. The percussive device further includes an outer shell, at least a part of which surrounds the percussive sleeve, and an orienting slot extending in the axial direction is formed on an inner side wall of the outer shell. The orienting key is inserted into the orienting slot and moveable in the orienting slot along the axial direction, so that the percussive sleeve is fixed relative to the outer shell in the circumferential direction, but moveable relative thereto along the axial direction.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one embodiment, the elastic member is arranged above the percussive sleeve, and a washer is arranged between the percussive sleeve and the elastic member. The washer is provided with a through hole axially passing through the washer, the through hole being configured to allow fluid to pass therethrough during compression and recovery of the elastic member.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Compared with the prior arts, the present invention has the advantages as follows. The percussion generating part, with the help of the elastic member, repeatedly impacts on the rotary working part, which is connected with the downstream drilling bit, in the axial direction.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Accordingly, the impact energy is transmitted to the downstream drilling bit, which applies impact on the formation. In this manner, the downstream drilling bit can impact the formation while performing rotary drilling operations. This compound action facilitates to break up the formation rapidly, which can increase drilling efficiency and reduce drilling cost.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the following the present invention will be explained in more detail by way of embodiments with reference to the accompanying drawings.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, the lower driving tooth <b>222</b>B and the upper driven tooth <b>231</b>B may each be configured as having a wave-like shape extending along a circumferential direction.

The upward tooth segment and the downward tooth segment are smoothly connected with each other. The upper driven tooth <b>231</b>B is configured to be in engagement with the lower drive tooth <b>222</b>B. Therefore, when the second driving rod <b>22</b> rotates relative to the percussive sleeve <b>23</b>, the upward tooth segment of the lower driving tooth <b>222</b>B are in contact with the corresponding upward tooth segment of the upper driven tooth <b>231</b>B. Accordingly, the lower driving tooth <b>222</b>B can push the upper driven tooth <b>231</b>B upwardly, thereby driving the percussive sleeve <b>23</b> to move upwardly relative to the second driving rod <b>22</b>. This movement proceeds until the peak of the lower driving tooth <b>222</b>B comes into contact with the valley of the upper driven tooth <b>231</b>B. As the second driving rod <b>22</b> continues to rotate, the downward tooth segment of the lower driving tooth <b>222</b>B are in contact with the corresponding downward tooth segment of the upper driven tooth <b>231</b>B. Accordingly, the percussive sleeve <b>23</b> can drop down relative to the second driving rod <b>22</b>, so that the percussive sleeve <b>23</b> can generate axial downward impact on the rotary rod <b>26</b> connected with the lower end of the second driving rod <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In a preferred embodiment, the inclination of the above-mentioned upward tooth segment is smaller than that of the downward tooth segment. Further preferably, the inclination of the tooth face of the upward tooth segment is approximately between 0 degrees and 15 degrees, such as 8 degrees. The inclination of the tooth face of the downward tooth segment is in a range from about 75 degrees to 90 degrees, such as 83 degrees. Therefore, the friction torque consumed when the percussive sleeve <b>23</b> ascends will be less than about 20% of the actual output torque of the first rotary rod <b>15</b> and the second rotary rod <b>22</b>. At the same time, the percussive sleeve <b>23</b> is allowed to fall relatively fast to generate strong impact on the rotary rod <b>26</b>. In addition, the upper tooth segment and the lower tooth segment are connected with each other through a smooth transition, for avoiding or reducing stress concentration.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the percussive device <b>20</b> includes an outer shell <b>21</b> arranged around the second rotary rod <b>22</b>, the percussive sleeve <b>23</b> and the rotary rod <b>26</b>. An orienting key <b>231</b>A extending along the axial direction is arranged on an outer side wall of the percussive sleeve <b>23</b>. An orienting slot extending along the axial direction and in engagement with the orienting key <b>231</b>A is arranged on an inner side wall of the outer shell <b>21</b>.

For example, the elastic member <b>24</b> has a lower end abutting against the upper end of the percussive sleeve <b>23</b>, and an upper end abutting against a lower end of a support sleeve <b>25</b>. The support sleeve <b>25</b> extends along the axial direction, and has an upper end abutting against the lower end of the drill housing <b>11</b>, which is inserted into the upper end of the outer shell <b>21</b>. In this manner, the upper end of the elastic member <b>24</b> can be fixed at an appropriate position.

When the percussive sleeve <b>23</b> moves upward relative to the second driving rod <b>22</b>, the elastic member <b>24</b> will be compressed. Subsequently, the elastic member <b>24</b> can push the percussive sleeve <b>23</b> to move downward to apply impacts on the rotary rod <b>26</b>. The elastic member <b>24</b> can be, for example, a coil spring, a disc spring, or the like.
