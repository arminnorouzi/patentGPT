After being modified, the polypropylene material is improved in overall performance, and the polypropylene material is widely used in plastic exterior parts of vehicles such as a bumper, a fender, a wheel eyebrow, and a side skirt. With rapid development of the vehicle industry, consumers' requirements for vehicle styling, vehicle body colors, etc. are gradually enhanced. Vehicle body materials are mostly metal materials such as alloy steel or alloy aluminum, and are sprayed. Considering an overall aesthetic sense of vehicle appearance, plastic exterior parts of vehicles are mostly decorated by spraying metal appearance paint to match a metal spraying effect.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, the polypropylene material, as a substrate material of exterior spray parts of vehicles, has certain disadvantages. For example, polypropylene molecules are nonpolar molecules, have relatively low surface tension and relatively poor adhesion to paint, and are prone to poor corner spraying, poor adhesion, etc. In addition, the idea of environmental protection is practiced in all walks of life. Currently, water-based paint is used instead of oil-based paint in the vehicle industry. The water-based paint uses water as a solvent, which greatly reduces environmental pollution and is friendly to humans and the environment. However, adhesion of the water-based paints to plastics is slightly worse than that of the oil-based paints. Therefore, the water-based paint spraying performance of a material needs to be improved. In addition, the flow mark defects of polypropylene in injection molding mostly occur in workpieces with a relatively large area and a relatively long plastic material flow, and there is a high probability that the defects appear in vehicle bumpers, fenders, wheel eyebrows, side skirts, etc. Some spraying colors and processes determine that a paint film is relatively thin and cannot completely cover flow marks, which affects the vehicle appearance.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Currently, there are mainly two methods for improving adhesion of polypropylene composite to paint. The first method is to oxidize a surface of a polypropylene plastic part before spraying. Commonly used methods include flame treatment, corona treatment, plasma treatment, etc. to form oxidative polar groups, such as carbonyl and carboxyl, on the surface of polypropylene, so as to improve spraying performance. This method requires multi-step off-line treatment on a production line, has high costs of personnel, materials and devices and low efficiency, and cannot implement high-speed production with injection molding and spraying colinear. The second method is resin matrix modification, which improves the surface activity of a material by adding a polypropylene graft or other polar additives. Chinese patent application No. CN 106752633A discloses a polypropylene material for vehicle bumpers, which has an excellent combination of properties such as impact resistance, fluidity, rigidity, thermal stability, dimensional stability, and sprayability, and which is prepared by extruding and blending the mixture of polypropylene, polyethylene, a thermoplastic elastomer, a polar copolymer, a mineral filler, and a processing aid through twin-screw extruder. Chinese patent application No. CN 109988364A discloses a polypropylene composition which is easy to be sprayed on, and the polypropylene is prepared by extruding and blending a polypropylene resin, POE, a graft, a cyclic olefin copolymer, a stabilizer, and a colorant through twin-screw extruder. The adhesion property of paint with the polypropylene composite material in a high-pressure flushing test has been further improved through the synergistic effect of the graft and the cyclic olefin copolymer, as well as the good compatibility of the added graft and materials with the polypropylene, and the cyclic olefin copolymer. Chinese patent application No. CN106939098A discloses a polypropylene resin composition, which can suppress the occurrence of flow marks by using a heterophasic propylene copolymer, high-density polyethylene, and ethylene-&#x3b1;-olefin random copolymer. However, the impact of the content of ethylene propylene rubber in the heterophasic propylene copolymer on the property of the composition is not disclosed. Also, the added high-density polyethylene cannot inhibit crystallization of the composition.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An objective of the present invention is to provide a polypropylene composition, which overcomes the defects of poor adhesion of a surface of a polypropylene resin to paint. Further, an elastomer with a bimodal molecular weight distribution overcomes the flow mark defects of polypropylene in injection molding which occurs after the addition of an elastomer, and improves adhesion.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another objective of the present invention is to provide a method for preparing the foregoing polypropylene composition.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention is implemented by the following technical solutions:</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A polypropylene composition comprises the following components in parts by weight:</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">55-75 parts of copolymerized polypropylene; and</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">3-8 parts of branched polyethylene,</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">wherein the copolymerized polypropylene has a weight average molecular weight of 60,000-75,000 g/mol and a molecular weight distribution index less than or equal to 4.0, and wherein the mass percentage of ethylene propylene rubber in a copolymerized polypropylene resin is 8.5%-13.5%; wherein the branched polyethylene has a weight average molecular weight of 320,000-350,000 g/mol and a degree of branching in a range of 11.0-15.0; in the branches, the content of a methyl branch ranges from 45.0% to 55.0% based on the total number of the branches, the content of an ethyl branch ranges from 30.0% to 40.0% based on the total number of the branches, and the content of a propyl branch and branches containing four or more carbon atoms ranges from 15.0% to 25.0% based on the total number of the branches.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Commercial copolymerized polypropylene used for injection molding generally has a weight average molecular weight of 30,000-800,000 and a molecular weight distribution index (M<sub>w</sub>/M<sub>n</sub>, namely polydispersity index) in a range of 2.0-10.0. In the present invention, a microstructure of the copolymerized polypropylene was investigated, and features the following three aspects: I. A narrow molecular weight distribution with a molecular weight distribution index less than or equal to 4.0 can effectively reduce the content of the low-molecular-weight polypropylene part in the copolymerized polypropylene, weaken the crystallization tendency of the polypropylene polymer, improve spraying adhesion of polypropylene, and improve water-based paint spraying performance of the polypropylene. II. A weight average molecular weight of 60,000-75,000 g/mol enables the copolymerized polypropylene to have relatively good fluidity, which broadens the molding processing window and improves the molding appearance. III. The weight percentage of ethylene propylene rubber is 8.5%-13.5%, which provides a balance of rigidity and toughness of the material and reduces coalescence of the high-viscosity ethylene propylene rubber during processing, and thus improves the molding appearance.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The content of each branch in the branched polyethylene is determined by the combination of carbon nuclear magnetic resonance (13CNMR) and a two-dimensional DEPT spectrum. The combination of the polyethylene and the copolymerized polypropylene can effectively reduce regularity of the chain segments, thereby reducing crystallization and improving water-based paint spraying adhesion of the polypropylene as well as the water-based paint spraying performance of the polypropylene.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Commercial branched polyethylene generally has a molecular weight of 50,000-400,000 g/mol and a degree of branching in a range of 1.5-17.0; in the branches, the content of a methyl branch ranges from 45.0% to 75.0% based on the total number of the branches, the content of an ethyl branch ranges from 5.0% to 43.0% based on the total number of the branches, and the content of a propyl branch and branches containing four or more carbon atoms ranges from 5.0% to 27.0% based on the total number of the branches. The degree of branching in the present disclosure refers to the number of carbon atoms of the branches in every one thousand carbon atoms of the main chain. In the present invention, the microstructure of the branched polyethylene was investigated, and found to be characterized by a high degree of branching, and thus after blending with polypropylene, the chain segment regularity can be reduced so as to reduce crystallization.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The inventors found through experiments that if polyethylene with low crystallinity was used instead, the crystallinity of the copolymerized polypropylene could not be reduced synergistically.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The polypropylene composition further comprises 0-20 parts by weight of a copolymer which is at least one of an ethylene-1-octene copolymer with a bimodal molecular weight distribution and an ethylene-1-butene copolymer with a bimodal molecular weight distribution.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">It was found through experiments that the addition of an elastomer may improve spraying adhesion, but can affect the appearance, resulting in flow marks during injection molding. When the ethylene-1-octene copolymer with a bimodal molecular weight distribution and/or the ethylene-1-butene copolymer with a bimodal molecular weight distribution are used, no flow mark appears, and the spraying adhesion is improved.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Preferably, a copolymer is selected from the ethylene-1-octene copolymer with a bimodal molecular weight distribution.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The molecular weight of ethylene-1-octene copolymer and ethylene-1-butene copolymer can be in bimodal molecular weight distribution or in monomodal molecular weight distribution. A bimodal distribution ethylene-octene copolymer has a bimodal molecular weight distribution. The bimodal distribution ethylene-octene copolymer may have obvious molecular peaks in a weight average molecular weight range of 60,000-80,000 and in a weight average molecular weight range of 150,000-170,000, respectively. In the present invention, the microstructure of the foregoing elastomer was investigated, and found to be characterized by a bimodal molecular weight distribution state, which improves the appearance during molding.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">To increase strength of the polypropylene composition, a certain amount of inorganic filler may be added. The polypropylene composition further comprises 0-20 parts by weight of inorganic filler.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The inorganic filler is selected from 5000-10000 mesh talcum powder.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">To improve oxidation resistance of the polypropylene composition, the polypropylene composition further comprises 0-3 parts by weight of antioxidant, which may be at least one of a hindered phenolic antioxidant and an alcohol ester antioxidant, which specifically may be tetra[&#x3b2;-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid]pentaerythritol ester, tri[2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl]phosphite, &#x3b2;-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid n-octadecyl ester, dilauryl thiodipropionate, etc.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">A method for preparing the foregoing polypropylene composition comprises the following steps: mixing the copolymerized polypropylene, the polyethylene, an inorganic filler, and an antioxidant uniformly based on a ratio and then extruding and granulating the mixture by a twin-screw extruder to obtain the polypropylene composition; wherein the temperature along the screws is distributed as 180&#xb0; C.-210&#xb0; C.-200&#xb0; C., and the rotation speed is 400-700 revolutions per minute.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The present invention has the following beneficial effects:</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the present invention, crystallization of the resin matrix can be suppressed by melt blending the copolymerized polypropylene and the branched polyethylene having specific parameters, which improves spraying adhesion of the polypropylene composition and enhances the water-based paint spraying performance of the polypropylene.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Further, by adding ethylene-1-octene copolymer and/or ethylene-1-butene copolymer which are in specific bimodal molecular weight distribution, the occurrence of flow marks caused by the addition of elastomers can be effectively suppressed, and thus the spraying adhesion is improved, thereby further improving the appearance during molding.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The present invention is described in detail below with reference to specific embodiments.
