As such, other configurations and arrangements can be used without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. Also, the present disclosure can also be employed in a variety of other applications. Functional and structural features as described in the present disclosures can be combined, adjusted, and modified with one another and in ways not specifically depicted in the drawings, such that these combinations, adjustments, and modifications are within the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In general, terminology may be understood at least in part from usage in context. For example, the term &#x201c;one or more&#x201d; as used herein, depending at least in part upon context, may be used to describe any feature, structure, or characteristic in a singular sense or may be used to describe combinations of features, structures or characteristics in a plural sense. Similarly, terms, such as &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; or &#x201c;the,&#x201d; again, may be understood to convey a singular usage or to convey a plural usage, depending at least in part upon context. In addition, the term &#x201c;based on&#x201d; may be understood as not necessarily intended to convey an exclusive set of factors and may, instead, allow for existence of additional factors not necessarily expressly described, again, depending at least in part on context.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">It should be readily understood that the meaning of &#x201c;on,&#x201d; &#x201c;above,&#x201d; and &#x201c;over&#x201d; in the present disclosure should be interpreted in the broadest manner such that &#x201c;on&#x201d; not only means &#x201c;directly on&#x201d; something but also includes the meaning of &#x201c;on&#x201d; something with an intermediate feature or a layer therebetween, and that &#x201c;above&#x201d; or &#x201c;over&#x201d; not only means the meaning of &#x201c;above&#x201d; or &#x201c;over&#x201d; something but can also include the meaning it is &#x201c;above&#x201d; or &#x201c;over&#x201d; something with no intermediate feature or layer therebetween (i.e., directly on something).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Further, spatially relative terms, such as &#x201c;beneath,&#x201d; &#x201c;below,&#x201d; &#x201c;lower,&#x201d; &#x201c;above,&#x201d; &#x201c;upper,&#x201d; and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. The spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. The apparatus may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations), and the spatially relative descriptors used herein may likewise be interpreted accordingly.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As used herein, the term &#x201c;substrate&#x201d; refers to a material onto which subsequent material layers are added. The substrate itself can be patterned. Materials added on top of the substrate can be patterned or can remain unpatterned. Furthermore, the substrate can include a wide array of semiconductor materials, such as silicon, germanium, gallium arsenide, indium phosphide, etc. Alternatively, the substrate can be made from an electrically non-conductive material, such as a glass, a plastic, or a sapphire wafer.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">As used herein, the term &#x201c;layer&#x201d; refers to a material portion including a region with a thickness. A layer can extend over the entirety of an underlying or overlying structure or may have an extent less than the extent of an underlying or overlying structure. Further, a layer can be a region of a homogeneous or inhomogeneous continuous structure that has a thickness less than the thickness of the continuous structure. For example, a layer can be located between any pair of horizontal planes between, or at, a top surface and a bottom surface of the continuous structure. A layer can extend horizontally, vertically, and/or along a tapered surface. A substrate can be a layer, can include one or more layers therein, and/or can have one or more layers thereupon, thereabove, and/or therebelow. A layer can include multiple layers. For example, an interconnect layer can include one or more conductors and contact layers (in which interconnect lines and/or vertical interconnect access (via) contacts are formed) and one or more dielectric layers.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some 3D NAND memory devices, a semiconductor layer is selectively grown to surround the sidewalls of channel structures, e.g., known as sidewall selective epitaxial growth (SEG). Compared with another type of semiconductor layer that is epitaxial growth at the source end of the channel structures, e.g., bottom SEG, the formation of sidewall SEG avoids the etching of the memory film and the semiconductor channel at the bottom surface of channel holes (a.k.a. SONO punch), thereby increasing the process window, in particular when fabricating 3D NAND memory devices with advanced technologies, such as having 90 or more levels with a multi-deck architecture.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">However, because intrinsic (pure, undoped) semiconductor materials, such as intrinsic polysilicon, are used to form the semiconductor channel, a relatively high potential barrier exists between the semiconductor channel and the sidewall SEG or the conductive layer in contact with the semiconductor channel, thereby introducing high contact resistance therebetween. The electric performance of the 3D memory device can be affected by the high contact resistance.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">To address one or more of the aforementioned issues, the present disclosure introduces a solution in which the contact resistance between the semiconductor channel and the sidewall SEG or the conductive layer can be reduced. In some implementations, the semiconductor channel is partially doped, such that part of the semiconductor channel that forms the source contact is highly doped to lower the potential barrier while leaving another part of the semiconductor channel that forms the memory cells remaining undoped or lowly doped. In some implementations, one end of each channel structure is opened from the backside to expose the doped part of the respective semiconductor channel, and the 3D memory device further includes a doped semiconductor layer electrically connecting the exposed doped parts of the semiconductor channels to further reduce the contact resistance and sheet resistance. For example, the doped semiconductor layer may include a plug extending the channel structure by replacing part of the capping layer of the channel structure to increase the contact area and further reduce contact resistance. As a result, the electric performance of the 3D memory devices can be improved.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Consistent with the scope of the present disclosure, the doped part of the semiconductor channel and the doped semiconductor layer can be locally activated, e.g., through local annealing, to activate the dopants therein without damaging other parts on the device chip that are sensitive to heat, such as the bonding interface and copper interconnects. For example, the heat for activating the dopants may be confined in an area that excludes thermal-sensitive components on the device chip. In some implementations, the local activation process also serves as an in-situ doping process to dope part of the intrinsic semiconductor channel that is in contact with the doped semiconductor layer. This in-situ doping process can further reduce contact resistance and increase the performance of the device.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Furthermore, the doped part of the semiconductor channel may be formed and controlled in a specific location of the semiconductor channel, e.g., in a first area of the semiconductor channel corresponding to the location of a first gate electrode, or in a second area of the semiconductor channel corresponding to the location of a second gate electrode. As such, the gate-induced drain leakage (GIDL) effect can be enhanced.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b></figref> illustrate a fabrication process for forming an exemplary 3D memory device, according to some aspects of the present disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> illustrates a flowchart of an exemplary method for forming a 3D memory device, according to some aspects of the present disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>A-<b>14</b>B</figref> illustrate an exemplary 3D memory device, according to some aspects of the present disclosure.

The sacrificial layer may be removed by wet etching from a lateral side of a wafer that includes one or more first semiconductor structures. The vacancy of the sacrificial layer is then filled by depositing a doped filling layer (e.g., doped polysilicon) into the vacancy.
