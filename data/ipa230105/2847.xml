num="0002">Priority is claimed on Japanese Patent Application No. 2019-231744, filed in Japan on Dec. 23, 2019, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">RELATED ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In recent years, from the viewpoint of regulations for greenhouse gas emission in association with global warming countermeasures, there has been a demand for additional improvement in the fuel efficiency of vehicles. In addition, in order to reduce the weights of vehicle bodies and secure collision safety, the application of high strength steel sheets to components for a vehicle is becoming increasingly widespread.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, for steel sheets that are used for components for a vehicle, not only strength but also a variety of workability that is required at the time of forming components such as press formability or weldability are required. Specifically, from the viewpoint of press workability and formability, bending workability and stretch flangeability are often required for steel sheets. However, since the formability of steel sheets tends to deteriorate with the high-strengthening of the materials, it is difficult to achieve both a high strength and favorable formability.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, for the application of high strength steel sheets to components for a vehicle, it has become an important issue to realize excellent bending workability and stretch flangeability together with a high strength of a tensile strength of 980 MPa or more.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition, from the viewpoint of the resistance of components for a vehicle to distortion at the time of collision, a high proof stress is also required, and there is a desire for steel sheets to have a high proof stress in addition to the above-described formability.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is reported in Non-Patent Document 1 that bending workability is improved by controlling the structure to a single structure of ferrite, bainite, martensite, or the like by microstructure control.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Patent Document 1 discloses a method for realizing a tensile strength of 590 MPa or more and 750 MPa or less and excellent bending workability by controlling a steel sheet containing, by mass %, 0.010% to 0.055% of C, 0.2% or less of Si, 0.7% or less of Mn, 0.025% or less of P, 0.02% or less of S, 0.01% or less of N, 0.1% or less of Al, and 0.06% to 0.095% of Ti, controlling a structure including 95% or more of ferrite by an area ratio and controlling the diameters of carbide particles containing Ti in ferrite crystal grains and the structure to a structure in which only TiS having an average diameter of 0.5 &#x3bc;m or less is dispersed and precipitated as a sulfide containing Ti.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Patent Document 2 discloses a method for improving bending workability while maintaining a tensile strength of 780 MPa or more by, for a steel sheet containing, by mass %, 0.05% to 0.15% of C, 0.2% to 1.2% of Si, 1.0% to 2.0% of Mn, 0.04% or less of P, 0.0030% or less of S, 0.005% to 0.10% of Al, 0.01% or less of N, and 0.03% to 0.13% of Ti, controlling the structure inside the steel sheet to a bainite single phase or a structure including bainite in a fraction of more than 95% and setting, in the structure of the sheet surface layer area, bainite to a fraction of less than 80% and ferrite that is rich in workability to a fraction of 10% or more.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Furthermore, Patent Document 3 discloses that a high strength hot-rolled steel sheet having a high strength of a yield strength of 960 MPa or more and excellent bending workability and being excellent in terms of low temperature toughness can be obtained by making the steel sheet contain, by mass %, 0.08% to 0.25% of C, 0.01% to 1.0% of Si, 0.8% to 1.5% of Mn, 0.025% or less of P, 0.005% or less of S, 0.005% to 0.10% of Al, 0.001% to 0.05% of Nb, 0.001% to 0.05% of Ti, 0.1% to 1.0% of Mo, and 0.1% to 1.0% of Cr and controlling the structure to a structure in which a tempered martensite is a primary phase with a volume percentage of 90% or more, the average grain size of prior austenite grains in a cross section parallel to a rolling direction is 20 &#x3bc;m or less, the average grain size of prior austenite grains is 15 &#x3bc;m or less in a cross section orthogonal to the rolling direction, and the anisotropy of the prior &#x3b3;

As a result, it was found that, in a steel sheet having a predetermined chemical composition, when the microstructure is made into a structure including 80% or more of tempered martensite, and the microstructure includes 5&#xd7;10<sup>9 </sup>pieces/mm<sup>3 </sup>or more of precipitates containing Ti and having an equivalent circle diameter of 5 nm or less per unit volume, it is possible to manufacture a steel sheet having a high proof stress and a tensile strength of 980 MPa or more while ensuring workability.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0023">In addition, the present inventors intensively investigated the bending workability of high strength steel sheets. As a result, it was clarified that, as the strength of a steel sheet increases, cracks are more likely to be initiated from the inside bend during bending (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;inside bend cracks&#x201d;). In addition, regarding cracking during the bending of a steel sheet, conventionally, it is usual that cracks are initiated from the surface of the steel sheet on the outside bend or the vicinity of the end surface, but it was found that, in association with the high-strengthening of steel sheet, there is a case where minute cracks are initiated on the inside bend. From conventional knowledge, no method for suppressing such minute cracks that are initiated in the inside bend has been found.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0024">From research by the present inventors, it was found that the inside bend cracks are likely to be initiated in steel sheets having a tensile strength of 780 MPa class or higher, becomes significant in steel sheets having a tensile strength of 980 MPa class or higher, and becomes a more significant problem in steel sheets having a tensile strength of 1180 MPa class or higher.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0025">The present inventors presumed that the mechanism of the initiation of the above-described inside bend cracks is attributed to the bias of distortion and examined a method for suppressing the inside bend cracks with attention paid to texture and uniformity of hardness.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0026">As a result, it was found that, when the texture is relatively random, deformation resistance is also uniform, and thus distortion is likely to occur uniformly; however, when a specific texture develops, bias of distortion is caused between crystals having an orientation with large deformation resistance and crystals having the other orientations and a shear deformation band is likely to be generated, and, conversely, when crystals having an orientation with large deformation resistance are reduced, distortion occurs uniformly and the shear deformation band is less likely to be generated. That is, the present inventors found that the inside bend cracks can be suppressed by controlling the texture particularly in the surface layer region in the sheet thickness direction where cracks are initiated.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0027">As a result of additional studies by the present inventors, it was found that the bias of distortion also results from non-uniformity of hardness in addition to the texture. The non-uniformity of hardness is caused by the distribution of a transformation structure or a precipitate. The present inventors found that the non-uniformity of hardness, which acts as a cause for the inside bend cracks (cause for the deterioration of bending workability) can be evaluated with the standard deviation of nanohardness. That is, it was found that the effect on improvement in bending workability becomes stronger by further controlling the uniformity of hardness in addition to the control of the texture. In addition, it was found that the control of the uniformity of hardness also contributes to additional improvement in stretch flangeability.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0028">The present invention has been made based on the above-described findings, and the gist of the present invention is as follows.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0029">(1) A hot-rolled steel sheet according to one aspect of the present invention containing, as a chemical composition, by mass %, C: 0.02% to 0.12%, Si: 0.01% to 2.00%, Mn: 1.00% to 3.00%, P: 0.100% or less, S: 0.010% or less, N: 0.010% or less, Al: 0.005% to 1.000%.

Microstructure</p><p id="p-0035" num="0039">&#x3c;Microstructure including 80% or more of tempered martensite by volume percentage and remainder consisting of one or more of ferrite, bainite, pearlite, fresh martensite, and residual austenite&#x3e;</p><p id="p-0036" num="0040">First, the reasons for limiting the microstructure will be described.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0041">In the steel sheet according to the present embodiment, a primary phase of the microstructure is 80% or more of tempered martensite by a volume percentage.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0042">The steel sheet according to the present embodiment needs to be mainly made of a microstructure having as similar hardness as possible from the viewpoint of improving the stretch flangeability and the bending workability. When the fact that the hardness of individual microstructures increases in the order of approximately ferrite&#x3c;pearlite&#x3c;bainite&#x3c;residual austenite&#x3c;tempered martensite&#x3c;fresh martensite is taken into account, in a case where the steel sheet includes ferrite, pearlite, bainite, or residual austenite as the primary phase, the tensile strength (I'S) becomes less than 980 MPa. In addition, when fresh martensite included as the primary phase, there is a possibility that fresh martensite may act as a cause for a low proof stress. Therefore, in the steel sheet according to the present embodiment, tempered martensite is included as a primary phase. When the volume percentage of the tempered martensite is less than 80%, the hardness becomes non-uniform due to the difference in hardness between the other structures and the tempered martensite, and the bending workability and the stretch flangeability deteriorate.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0043">Therefore, the volume percentage of the tempered martensite is set to 80% or more. The structure other than the tempered martensite (remainder) is one or more of ferrite, pearlite, bainite, residual austenite, and fresh martensite. Particularly, the volume percentage of fresh martensite is preferably 10% or less.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0044">In the present embodiment, regarding the volume percentages of pearlite, bainite, tempered martensite, and ferrite, a sample is collected such that a sheet thickness cross section parallel to a rolling direction of the hot-rolled steel sheet serves as an observed section, the observed section is polished and Nital-etched, a range of &#x215b; to &#x215c; of the sheet thickness (&#x215b; thickness to &#x215c; thickness) from the surface in which a position of a &#xbc; depth (&#xbc; thickness) of the sheet thickness from the surface is centered is observed using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) at a magnification of 5000 times, the area ratio of each structure is measured, and the area ratio is regarded as the volume percentage. At that time, the area ratios are measured at 10 visual fields, and the average value thereof is regarded as the volume percentage.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0045">Each structure has the following characteristics. Therefore, in the measurement of the area ratio, each structure is identified based on the following characteristics, and the area ratio is obtained.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0046">Ferrite is equiaxed grains containing no iron-based carbides, and pearlite is a layered structure of ferrite and cementite.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0047">Bainite includes upper bainite and lower bainite, and the upper bainite is a aggregation of lath-shaped crystal grains and an aggregate of laths containing a carbide between the laths. The lower bainite is a aggregation of lath-shaped crystal grains and contains an iron-based carbide having a major axis of 5 nm or more therein, and the carbide belongs to a single variant, that is, a group of iron-based carbides elongated in the same direction. Here, the group of iron-based carbides elongated in the same direction means that the difference in the elongation direction of the iron-based carbide group is within 5&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0048">Tempered martensite is a aggregation of lath-shaped crystal grains and contains an iron-based carbide with a major axis of 5 nm or more therein, and the carbide belongs to a plurality of variants, that is, a group of iron-based carbides elongated in two or more directions. Usually, tempered martensite refers to structures containing an iron-based carbide such as cementite in many cases; however, in the present embodiment, martensite including a fine precipitate containing Ti is also defined as tempered martensite.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0049">Fresh martensite and residual austenite are not sufficiently etched by Nital etching and thus can be clearly distinguished from the above-described structures (ferrite, pearlite, bainite, and tempered martensite) in the observation with the lFE-SEM. Therefore, the volume percentage of the fresh martensite can be obtained as a difference between the volume percentage obtained as the area ratio of a non-etched region that is observed with the FE-SEM and the volume percentage of residual austenite measured with X-rays described below.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0050">The volume percentage of the residual austenite is obtained by an X-ray diffraction method. Specifically, in a cross section parallel to the rolling direction at the &#xbc; depth position of the sheet thickness of the steel sheet, the integrated intensities of a total of six peaks of &#x3b1;(110), &#x3b1;(200), &#x3b1;(211), &#x3b3;(111), &#x3b3;(200), and &#x3b3;(220) are obtained using Co-K&#x3b1; rays, and the volume percentage of the residual austenite is obtained by calculation using an intensity averaging method.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0051">&#x3c;Tempered martensite including 5&#xd7;10<sup>9 </sup>pieces/mm<sup>3 </sup>or more of precipitates containing Ti and having equivalent circle diameter of 5 nm or less per unit volume&#x3e;</p><p id="p-0048" num="0052">The steel sheet according to the present embodiment includes tempered martensite as a main structure as described above; however, in order to reduce non-uniformity of hardness or the like between these microstructures as much as possible, the steel sheet is hot-rolled to have a martensite (tempered martensite and fresh martensite) structure, and then a treatment is performed to reduce the hardness difference between the tempered martensite regions by a heat treatment at 450&#xb0; C. or higher. At this time, since tempering is accompanied by a decrease in strength, precipitation hardening is performed by finely dispersing precipitates.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0053">The present inventors intensively investigated the relationship between the sizes and number density of the precipitates that enables a tensile strength of 980 MPa or more to be secured. As a result, it was found that, when tempered martensite including 5&#xd7;10<sup>9 </sup>pieces/mm<sup>3 </sup>or more of precipitates containing Ti and having an equivalent circle diameter of 5 nm or less in terms of the number density is included as a primary phase, a tensile strength of 980 MPa or more can be secured. In addition, it was found that, regarding precipitates included in the conventional hot-rolled steel sheets (for example, the steel sheets of Patent Documents 5 and 6), the sizes (equivalent circle diameters) could not be controlled to 5 nm or less, and the number density was also small.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0054">As a result of additional studies by the present inventors, the causes therefor were found to be the fact that the amount of Ti or the like that formed the precipitates was small or, even when contained, Ti or the like was present as coarse precipitates in a slab stage and did not dissolve even during the heating of the slab and the fact that TIC precipitated by a long time of a heat treatment such as coiling after hot rolling (hot rolling) became coarse and thus the number density of precipitates with an equivalent circle diameter of 5 nm or less became less than 5&#xd7;1 pieces/mm<sup>3</sup>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0055">Dispersing fine precipitates as described above contributes not only to improvement in the tensile strength, but also to improvement in uniformity of hardness (reduction of non-uniformity) or improvement in proof stress.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0056">In addition, usually, it is difficult to achieve both a high proof stress and favorable bendability, but both a high proof stress and favorable bendability can be achieved by controlling the sizes and number density of precipitates and controlling the texture to be described below at the same time.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0057">The reasons for limiting the sizes and number density of the precipitates will be described.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0058">The number density per unit volume of the precipitates containing Ti and having an equivalent circle diameter of 5 nm or less is set to 5&#xd7;10<sup>9 </sup>pieces/mm<sup>3 </sup>or more in order to secure a tensile strength of 980 MPa or more. When the number density is less than 5&#xd7;10<sup>9 </sup>pieces/mm<sup>3</sup>, it is difficult to secure a tensile strength of 980 MPa or more. Therefore, the number density of the precipitates containing Ti and having an equivalent circle diameter of 5 nm or less needs to be set to 5&#xd7;10<sup>9 </sup>pieces/mm<sup>3 </sup>or more. In order to secure a tensile strength of 1180 MPa or more, the number density of the precipitates is preferably set to 5&#xd7;10<sup>11 </sup>pieces/mm<sup>3 </sup>or more. &#x201c;5 nm&#x201d; mentioned herein is an equivalent circle diameter.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0059">The reason for defining the precipitates as precipitates containing Ti is that precipitates containing Ti are easily dissolved in a large amount in a slab heating stage before hot rolling and are precipitated as fine precipitates having an equivalent circle diameter of 5 nm or less. The type of the precipitates is not limited and may be a carbide, a nitride, a carbonitride, or the like, but is particularly preferably a carbide since the carbide is precipitated as fine precipitates having an equivalent circle diameter of 5 nm or less and contributes to improvement in strength. Ti precipitates are mainly included in the tempered martensite, which is the primary phase.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0060">Nb also has a similar effect to Ti, but carbides of Nb can be dissolved in the slab heating stage only in a small amount, and, even when Nb is singly contained, a tensile strength of 980 MPa or more cannot be secured. In addition, V can be dissolved in a large amount in the slab heating stage, the sizes of precipitates are relatively large, and, even when V is singly contained, it is difficult to secure 5&#xd7;10<sup>9 </sup>pieces/mm<sup>3 </sup>or more of precipitates of 5 nm or less. Due to these facts, the precipitates need to be precipitates containing Ti. However, the precipitate may be a composite precipitate having a structure in which some of Ti is substituted with Nb, V and/or Mo ((Ti, Nb, V)C or the like) as long as 5&#xd7;10<sup>9 </sup>pieces/mm<sup>3 </sup>or more of precipitates of 5 nm or less can be secured.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0061">The reason for setting the sizes of the precipitates, which are controlled together with the above-described number density to 5 nm or less in terms of the equivalent circle diameter is to secure a tensile strength of 980 MPa or more. For precipitates having an equivalent circle diameter of more than 5 nm, it is not possible to set the number density to 5&#xd7;10<sup>9 </sup>pieces/mm<sup>3 </sup>or more, and it is not possible to secure a tensile strength of 980 MPa or more.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0062">In the steel sheet according to the present embodiment, the strength of the steel sheet is improved by utilizing precipitation hardening. Therefore, softening in a heat-affected zone, which has been a problem at the time of welding such as arc welding, can be suppressed, and the fatigue strength of a weld is also excellent. In addition, in the steel sheet according to the present embodiment, the strength is increased by the precipitates containing 71 and having an equivalent circle diameter of 5 nm or less. In such a case, the yield ratio (=YS/TS), which is the ratio of the yield strength (YS) to the tensile strength (TS), becomes as extremely high as 0.90 or more. The use of a steel sheet having a high yield ratio makes it possible to provide suspension components for vehicles that are not easily distorted at the time of driving over curb or collision.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0063">Regarding the number density of the precipitates containing 71, the number densities of precipitates that are included per unit volume of the steel sheet are measured using an electrolytic extraction residual method for individual equivalent circle diameters at pitches of 1.0 nm (for example, in a manner of the number density for equivalent circle diameters of more than 0 nm and 1.0 nm or less, the number density for equivalent circle diameters of more than 1.0 nm and 2.0 nm or less, and the number density for equivalent circle diameters of more than 2.0 nm and 3.0 nm or less . . . ). As a result of the measurement, the total of the number densities for more than 0 nm to 5.0 nm or less is defined as the number density of the precipitates having an equivalent circle diameter of 5 nm or less in the present embodiment.

The center of the sheet thickness is not preferable as the measurement position since there is a case where a coarse precipitate is present due to the influence of center segregation and the chemical composition locally differs due to the influence of segregation. Positions less than 0.20 mm from the surface are affected by high-density dislocation introduced by light rolling reduction or the like or decarburization during heating, which makes the number density of the precipitates differ from the number density in the inside, and are thus not preferable as the measurement position.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0064">At the time of measurement, it is preferable to analyze the compositions of precipitates with a transmission electron microscope (TEM) and EDS to confirm that fine precipitates are precipitates containing Ti.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0065">In the steel sheet according to the present embodiment, almost all fine precipitates are considered to be present in the tempered martensite.

As a result of additional studies, the mechanism of such inside bend cracks is presumed as follows.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0069">At the time of bending, compressive stress is generated in the inside bend. In the beginning, the working proceeds while the entire inside bend is uniformly distorted; however, as the amount of the working increases, distortion becomes too significant to be carried by uniform distortion alone, and microscopic bias of distortion is caused (the generation of a shear deformation band). As this shear deformation band further grows, cracks are initiated along the shear band from the surface of the inside bend and propagates. It is presumed that the reason for the inside bend cracks to be more likely to be initiated in association with high-strengthening is that deterioration of work hardening capability in association with high-strengthening makes it difficult for uniform distortion to proceed and makes it easy for bias of distortion to be caused, which generates a shear deformation band at an early stage of the working (or under loose working conditions).</p><p id="p-0066" num="0070">When the steel sheet is bent and deformed, the strain increases toward the surface with the center of the sheet thickness as the boundary, and the strain becomes maximum at the outermost surface. Therefore, cracks of inside bend cracks are initiated on the surface of the steel sheet. Since it is the structure of the surface layer region that is a region from the surface of the steel sheet to 1/10 of the sheet thickness to contribute to such initiation of cracks, the structure of the surface layer region is controlled.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0071">The present inventors paid attention to the texture in order to suppress the bias of distortion that acts as the cause for the inside bend cracks during bending.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0072">Specifically, when the steel sheet is distorted, the responsiveness of a slip system against distortion in each crystal orientation differs (Schmid factor). This is considered to be because deformation resistance differs in each crystal orientation. That is, when the texture is relatively random, the deformation resistance is also uniform, and thus distortion is likely to occur uniformly; however, when a specific texture develops, bias of distortion is caused between crystals having an orientation with large deformation resistance and crystals having the other orientations and a shear deformation band is likely to be generated. Conversely, it is considered that, when crystals having an orientation with large deformation resistance are reduced, distortion occurs uniformly, and the shear deformation band is less likely to be generated.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0073">In the steel sheet according to the present embodiment, based on the above-described idea, in a surface layer region that is a range from the surface of the steel sheet to a 1/10 position of the sheet thickness, the sum of the average pole density of a crystal orientation group consisting of {211}&#x3c;111&#x3e; to {111}&#x3c;112&#x3e; and the pole density in a crystal orientation off{110}&#x3c;001&#x3e; is set to 6.0 or less.

In addition, these orientations are crystal orientation groups where deformation resistance is particularly large in inside bends during bending, and thus a shear deformation band is likely to be generated due to a difference in deformation resistance from other crystal orientation groups. Therefore, the inside bend cracks can be suppressed by reducing the pole densities of these crystal orientation groups. Here, when only any one of the average pole density of the crystal orientation group consisting of {211}&#x3c;111&#x3e; to {111}&#x3c;112&#x3e; and the pole density in the crystal orientation of {110}&#x3c;001&#x3e; is reduced, the effect of the present embodiment cannot be obtained, and it is important to reduce the sum thereof.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0076">When the sum of the average pole density of the crystal orientation group consisting of {211}&#x3c;111&#x3e; to {111}&#x3c;112&#x3e; and the pole density in the crystal orientation of {110}&#x3c;001&#x3e; is more than 6.0 in the surface layer region that is a range from the surface of the steel sheet to the 1/10 position of the sheet thickness, the shear deformation band is significantly likely to be generated, which acts as a cause for the initiation of inside bend cracks.

REM is often added as mischmetal and contains, in addition to Ce, a lanthanoid-series element to form a complex in some cases. Even when the steel sheet according to the present embodiment contains lanthanoid-series elements other than La and Ce as impurities, the effect is exhibited. In addition, even when a metal is added, the effect is exhibited.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0139">The above-described steel composition may be measured by a usual analysis method of steel. For example, the steel composition may be measured using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). C and S may be measured using an infrared absorption method after combustion. N may be measured using an inert gas fusion-thermal conductivity method, and O may be measured using an inert gas fusion-nondispersive infrared absorption method.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0140">The steel sheet according to the present embodiment may further have hot-dip galvanizing layer on the surface. In addition, the hot-dip galvanizing layer may be hot-dip galvannealed layer on which an alloying treatment has been performed.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0141">Since galvanizing contributes to improvement in corrosion resistance, in the case of applying the steel sheet to uses where corrosion resistance is expected, it is desirable to perform galvanizing to produce a hot-dip galvanized steel sheet or a galvannealed steel sheet.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0142">Since there is a concern that suspension components of vehicles may be perforated by corrosion, there is a case where it is not possible to thin the steel sheet to a certain sheet thickness or less even after high-strengthening. Since one of the purposes of the high-strengthening of the steel sheet is weight reduction by thinning, even when a high strength steel sheet is developed, if the high strength steel sheet has poor corrosion resistance, regions to which the high strength steel sheet can be applied are limited. As a method for solving this problem, it can be considered to perform plating such as highly corrosion-resistant hot-dip galvanizing on the steel sheet. In the steel sheet according to the present embodiment, the steel sheet components are controlled as described above, and thus hot-dip galvanizing is possible.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0143">The plating may be electrogalvanizing or may be plating containing Si.

Mechanical Properties</p><p id="p-0141" num="0145">The steel sheet according to the present embodiment has, as a sufficient strength that contributes to the weight reduction of vehicles, a tensile strength (TS) of 980 MPa or more. The tensile strength is preferably 1180 MPa or more. The upper limit of the tensile strength does not need to be particularly specified, and, in the present embodiment, the practical upper limit of the tensile strength may be set to 1370 MPa.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0146">In addition, a target of the steel sheet according to the present embodiment is that the limit bend R/t value, which serves as an index value of inside bend cracks, is 1.5 or less. The R/t value can be obtained by, for example, cutting out a strip-shaped test piece from a &#xbd; position in the width direction of the hot-rolled steel sheet, performing bending according to JIS Z 2248: 2006 (V block 90&#xb0; bending test) for both a bend where the bending ridge is parallel to the rolling direction (L direction) (L-axis bending) and a bend where the bending ridge is parallel to the direction perpendicular to the rolling direction (C direction) (C-axis bending), and investigating cracks initiated in the inside bend. The minimum bend radii at which cracks are not initiated are obtained, and a value obtained by dividing the average value of the minimum bend radii in the L axis and in the C axis by the sheet thickness is regarded as the limit bend R/t and used as an index value of bending workability.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0147">In addition, another target of the steel sheet according to the present embodiment is that, as an index of having high stretch flangeability, the product of the tensile strength TS (MPa) and the hole expansibility &#x3bb; (%) is 35000 (MPa&#xb7;%) or more. The product is preferably 45000 (MPa&#xb7;%) or more. In the steel sheet according to the present embodiment, furthermore, the total elongation EL is desirably 7.0% or more.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0148">In addition, still another target of the steel sheet according to the present embodiment is that, as an index of having a high proof stress (high yield strength), the ratio (YS/TS) of the yield strength YS to the tensile strength TS is 0.90 or more.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0149">In a tensile test.

Manufacturing Method</p><p id="p-0148" num="0152">Next, a preferable method for manufacturing the steel sheet according to the present embodiment will be described.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0153">In order to control the microstructure, texture, and, preferably, nanohardness distribution in the surface layer region of the steel sheet within the above-described ranges, the hot-rolled steel sheet is preferably manufactured under conditions that a hot rolling step (including a heating step, a rough rolling step, and a finish rolling step), a cooling step, a coiling step, and a heat treatment step are included, a pickling step and a light rolling reduction step are included as necessary between the coiling step and the heat treatment step, and a plating step is included as necessary after the heat treatment step.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0154">Hereinafter, preferable conditions in each step will be described.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0155">A manufacturing step preceding hot rolling is not particularly limited. That is, subsequent to melting with a blast furnace, an electric furnace, or the like, a variety of secondary smelting may be performed, and then casting may be performed by a method such as normal continuous casting or casting by an ingot method. In a case of continuous casting, a cast slab may be cooled to a low temperature, then, heated again and then hot-rolled or a cast slab may be hot-rolled as it is after casting without being cooled to a low temperature. Scrap may be used as a raw material.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0156">&#x3c;Heating Step&#x3e;</p><p id="p-0153" num="0157">In the heating step, a slab having the above-described chemical composition that is subjected to the rough rolling step is heated to higher than 1280&#xb0; C. The reason for setting the heating temperature to higher than 1280&#xb0; C. is to dissolve elements that contribute to precipitation hardening such as Ti, Nb. and V contained in the slab (in many cases, present as large precipitates of more than 5 nm in the slab) and to precipitate 5&#xd7;10<sup>9 </sup>pieces/mm<sup>3 </sup>or more of precipitates containing Ti and having an equivalent circle diameter of 5 nm or less in the subsequent heat treatment step. Since a large amount of Ti, Nb, and V become necessary to secure a predetermined number density of precipitates, it is necessary to heat the slab at a high temperature. When the heating temperature is 1280&#xb0; C. or lower, Ti. Nb, and V do not sufficiently dissolve.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0158">&#x3c;Rough Rolling Step&#x3e;</p><p id="p-0155" num="0159">Next, the heated slab is rough-rolled to produce a rough-rolled sheet.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0160">In the rough rolling step, the thickness of the rough-rolled sheet after the rough rolling is controlled to more than 35 mm and 45 mm or less. The thickness of the rough-rolled sheet affects the degree of the temperature decreased from the tip end to the tail end of the rolled sheet that is caused from the start of rolling to the completion of the rolling in the finish rolling step. In addition, when the thickness of the rough-rolled sheet is 35 mm or less or more than 45 mm, the amount of strain that is introduced into the steel sheet during finish rolling, which is the next step, changes, and the worked structure that is formed during the finish rolling changes. As a result, the recrystallization behavior changes, which makes it difficult to obtain a desired texture. In particular, it becomes difficult to obtain the above-described texture in the steel sheet surface layer region.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0161">It is usual to appropriately set the thickness of the rough-rolled sheet after the rough rolling from the viewpoint of productivity or the like, and it is not usual to set the thickness to control the characteristics of the steel sheet. However, the present inventors have strictly controlled the thickness of the rough-rolled sheet in order to control the texture in the steel sheet surface layer region.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0162">&#x3c;Finish Rolling Step&#x3e;</p><p id="p-0159" num="0163">Subsequent to the rough rolling, multi-stand finish rolling is performed. The present inventors found that it is important to control the sheet thickness, the roll shape ratio, the temperature, and the Nb content and the Ti content in steel during rolling in the final two stands of rolling in the finish rolling step for hot rolling, which have usually not been positively controlled, to appropriate ranges derived by a certain calculation equation in terms of controlling the texture.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0164">Therefore, in this multi-stand finish rolling, the finish rolling start temperature is 1000&#xb0; C. or higher and 1150&#xb0; C. or lower, and the thickness of the steel sheet (thickness of the rough-rolled sheet) before the start of finish rolling is more than 35 mm and 45 mm or less. In addition, in the rolling one stand before the final stand of the multi-stand finish rolling, the rolling temperature is 960&#xb0; C. or higher and 1020&#xb0; C. or lower, and the rolling reduction is larger than 11% and 23% or smaller. In addition, in the final stand of the multi-stand finish rolling, the rolling temperature is 930&#xb0; C. or higher and 995&#xb0; C. or lower, and the rolling reduction is larger than 11% and 22% or smaller. In addition, it is preferable that each condition at the time of the final two stands of rolling is controlled and a texture forming parameter CO that is calculated by the following equation 1 satisfies 110 or less. Furthermore, the finish rolling is preferably performed under a condition that the total rolling reduction of the final three stands of the multi-stand finish rolling is 35% or more.</p><p id="p-0161"

was collected such that a sheet thickness cross section parallel to a rolling direction of the hot-rolled steel sheet served as an observed section, the observed section was polished and Nital-etched, 10 visual fields were selected from a range of &#x215b; to &#x215c; of the sheet thickness (&#x215b; thickness to &#x215c; thickness) from the surface in which a position of a &#xbc; depth of the steel thickness (&#xbc; thickness) from the surface was centered using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) at a magnification of 5000 times, the area ratios of the individual structures obtained in the individual visual fields were averaged, and the average values were regarded as the volume percentages.</p><p id="p-0258" num="0251">In addition, the volume percentage of fresh martensite was obtained as a difference between the volume percentage obtained as the area ratio of a non-etched region that was observed with the FE-SEM and the volume percentage of residual austenite measured by an X-ray diffraction method.</p><p id="p-0259" num="0252">The volume percentage of the residual austenite was obtained by, in a cross section parallel to the rolling direction at the &#xbc; depth position of the sheet thickness of the steel sheet, obtaining the integrated intensities of a total of six peaks of &#x3b1;(110), &#x3b1;(200), &#x3b1;(211), &#x3b3;(111), &#x3b3;(200), and &#x3b3;(220) using Co-K&#x3b1; rays and performing calculation using an intensity averaging method.</p><p id="p-0260" num="0253">In addition, for the obtained hot-rolled steel sheets, the number densities per unit volume of precipitates containing Ti and having an equivalent circle diameter of 5 nm or less were obtained. At that time, a test piece was collected from the vicinity of a &#xbc; position of the sheet thickness (&#xbc; thickness) from the surface, the number densities of precipitates that were included per unit volume of the steel sheet were obtained using an electrolytic extraction residual method for individual equivalent circle diameters at pitches of 1.0 nm, and the number density of precipitates containing Ti and having an equivalent circle diameter of 5 nm or less was obtained. At the time of the measurement, the compositions of precipitates were analyzed with a transmission electron microscope (TEM) and EDS to confirm that fine precipitates were precipitates containing Ti.</p><p id="p-0261" num="0254">In addition, a tensile test was performed according to JIS Z 2241: 2011 using a JIS No. 5 test piece collected from a &#xbc; position in the width direction of the hot-rolled steel sheet such that a direction perpendicular to a rolling direction (C direction) became the longitudinal direction, and the 0.2% proof stress YS (Ma), the tensile strength TS (MPa), and the total elongation (EL) were obtained.</p><p id="p-0262" num="0255">In addition, a 100 mm&#xd7;30 mm strip-shaped test piece was cut out from a &#xbd; position in the width direction of the obtained hot-rolled steel sheet and subjected to a bending test. For both a bend where the bending ridge was parallel to the rolling direction (L direction) (L-axis bending) and a bend where the bending ridge was parallel to a direction perpendicular to the rolling direction (C direction) (C-axis bending), bending workability was investigated according to Z 2248: 2006 (V block 90&#xb0; bending test), the minimum bend radii at which cracks were not initiated were obtained, and a value obtained by dividing the average value of the minimum bend radii in the L axis and in the C axis by the sheet thickness was regarded as the limit bend R/t and used as an index value of bendability.</p><p id="p-0263" num="0256">Here, regarding the presence or absence of cracks, a cross section obtained by cutting the test piece after the V block 90&#xb0; bending test on a surface parallel to the bending direction and perpendicular to the sheet surface was mirror-polished, then, cracks were observed with an optical microscope, and a case where the lengths of cracks observed in the inside bend of the test piece exceeded 30 &#x3bc;m was determined as cracks being present.</p><p id="p-0264" num="0257">In addition, from the obtained hot-rolled steel sheet, a test piece was cut out from a &#xbc; width position in the width direction of the steel sheet according to JIS Z 2256: 2010 and punched using a punch having a diameter of 10 mm and a die having an inner diameter of 10.6 mm. After that, the test piece was set such that burrs in the punched portion were present on the opposite side to a 60&#xb0; conical punch, and hole expanding was performed using the punch. The test was stopped when cracks initiated in the punched portion penetrated the sheet thickness, and the hole diameter after the hole expanding test was measured, thereby obtaining the hole expanding rate L.</p><p id="p-0265" num="0258">In addition, nanohardness was measured at a total of 100 places at intervals of 3 &#x3bc;m on lines perpendicular to the sheet thickness direction and parallel to the rolling direction at the &#xbc; thickness position of the obtained hot-rolled steel sheet using tribo-900 manufactured by Hysitron Inc. under a condition of an indentation depth of 80 nm with a diamond indenter with a Berkovich shape, and the standard deviation was obtained from the histogram of the obtained nanohardness.</p><p id="p-0266" num="0259">The individual results are shown in Table 7 to Table 9.
