More specifically, the present invention relates to a thermoplastic copolymer resin which is obtained by copolymerizing an ester oligomer of a specific structure and a polycarbonate oligomer, and shows remarkably excellent heat resistance and also has good balance of properties such as transparency, impact strength, flowability, etc., and a method for preparing the same and a molded article comprising the same.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0003">Polycarbonate resin has good heat resistance, mechanical properties (in particular, impact strength) and transparency. Thus, it has been extensively used as electric components, mechanical components and industrial resin. In the electric/electronic fields, in particular, when polycarbonate resin is used for TV housing, computer monitor housing, copier, printer, notebook battery, lithium battery case material, etc., releasing considerable heat, good heat resistance is required as well as mechanical properties.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0004">However, general polycarbonate resins are selectively eroded in a specific solvent and have no resistance thereto. Although they have good anti-creep property to static load, general polycarbonate resins are relatively easily broken when temperature and several environmental conditions are coupled, and have the problem of complicated resistance to dynamic load.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0005">Accordingly, researches to improve heat resistance of polycarbonate resins have been continuously conducted, resulting in development of highly heat-resistant polycarbonate resins (for instance, U.S. Pat. No. 5,070,177, U.S. Pat. No. 4,918,149, etc.). In general, such highly heat-resistant polycarbonates have increased hydrolyzability and improved heat deformation temperature by modifying bisphenol A to incorporate substituents having stereochemistry at ortho position.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0006">However, conventional highly heat-resistant polycarbonates as such have the problem of seriously poor impact resistance, as compared with general polycarbonate resins.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CONTENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="2">Problems to be Solved</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0007">The present invention is intended to resolve the above-stated problems of the prior arts, and has an object of providing a thermoplastic polycarbonate copolymer which has remarkably improved heat resistance as compared with conventional highly heat-resistant polycarbonate resins, and also has good balance of properties such as transparency, impact strength, flowability, etc., and a method for preparing the same and a molded article comprising the same.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="2">Technical Means</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0008">In order to resolve the above-stated problems, the present invention provides a polycarbonate block copolymer comprising, as repeating units, (A) a polyester block having a structure represented by the following chemical formula 1;
