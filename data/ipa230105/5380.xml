No. 63/218,249, filed Jul. 2, 2021, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to virtual training platforms. More specifically, the present invention is concerned with providing live replay review and coaching in a virtual environment.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Golf is one of the top recreational activities in the United States. Many golfers desire lessons from professional golfers to help improve their fundamentals and ultimately their scores. Oftentimes, these &#x2018;pros&#x2019; are Pro Golf Association (PGA) certified instructors who are highly sought after for lessons. When scheduling golf lessons with a PGA certified instructor, three things must align: One, a golfer must be able to find an instructor in the golfer's geographic area; Two, the price point must be affordable for the amateur golfers; and Three, the golfers' schedule and the pros' schedule must align in order to book a date/time in advance.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition to the recent pandemic, the above issues have contributed to online instruction becoming a rapidly growing industry in the game of golf. Platforms such as YOUTUBE and ZOOM allow golfers to seek guidance from reputable sources on how to improve their game. Other offerings allow golfers to submit videos of their swings for a certified pro to review, make notes on and send back to the player. Current applications that provide these virtual lessons only allow for submission of replays which are then reviewed by pros at a later time. However, this misses a critical aspect of golf instruction, that being the live, real-time component to instruction, especially as it pertains to mechanical issues which may be intermittent in a golfer's swing. Accordingly, it would be advantageous to provide online instruction which facilitated an instant live model, wherein pros could record and replay golfer's swings in real-time.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Moreover, because of the hurdles in scheduling a lesson with a pro, providing this real-time instruction and golf lessons from a certified instructor whenever and wherever golfers choose is a convenience that is a long-felt need in the sport of golf. Accordingly, it would be advantageous to provide a system and method for on-demand, real-time, layered, and replay able golf lessons from a certified instructor.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Similar to golfer's seeking lessons, certified instructors face difficulties related to in-person lessons. Student cancellations are frequent and leave the instructor unable to fill the now vacant time slot. Moreover, in-person lessons give rise to the possibility of being unable to conduct lessons due to weather. Certified instructors also face difficulties in marketing, as oftentimes golfers are unaware of the services provided by local instructors and of the specific areas in which the instructor specializes. This leads to an overall lack of brand awareness. Where the instructor is unable to conduct lessons for reasons outside of their control, their income suffers. Accordingly, it would be advantageous to provide a system and method for instructors to use which allowed for on-demand lessons which avoid the aforementioned pitfalls associated with current in-person lessons.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Currently, online instruction platforms only provide functionality that allows for interaction between golfer and instructor on a single-layer recording level. Oftentimes, this single layer recording is either a live, face to face chat or a pre-recorded video of the golfers swing and the follow-up analysis from the instructor. However, instruction in a virtual environment proves significantly more useful when the golfer and the instructor can utilize multiple layers of input and recording. This would provide the ability for the golfer and the instructor to be in a live lesson layer while simultaneously discussing a recorded video layer while the instructor provides another layer of information by diagramming on top of the video layer. Such multi-layered interactions are oftentimes extremely resource-intensive and are oftentimes precluded by the hardware utilized by the golfer or the instructor. Accordingly, it would be advantageous to provide a multi-layer environment which is efficient enough to be compatible with the wide range of hardware typically utilized by golfers and instructors.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention comprises a system for and method of providing instruction to golfers. A platform is provided to each of a golfer, an instructor (or pro), and an admin (each a &#x201c;user&#x201d;) which serves to store, transfer, and augment data which serves to facilitate an on-demand, live golf lesson. The platform is presented to the user in the form of a software application running on one or more device, connected through one or more data connection to a central server, a device of another user, both, or other additional devices. The platform enables golfers and instructors to register an account, engage in on-demand lesson or schedule a lesson, interact in real-time with one another, record clips (videos, layers) during a live trainings session, edits the clips during the live session, replay the clips during the live session, finish the session, and view a replay of the session.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Advantageously for the golfer, this system solves the problem of finding, scheduling, and taking golf lessons with a certified instructor as the instruction is now on-demand and the interaction is live. Moreover, the golfer can access the platform from any location and on any device. The instructor advantageously overcomes the problems of cancellations, weather, and marketing, as the instruction is on-demand and the interaction is live. The instructor also has the ability to accept or reject lesson requests and to view a student's profile to determine whether the student's level of expertise is a match for the instructor's level of expertise. From a technological perspective, the platform provide a layer management module which advantageously provides for multiple layer environment lessons without interruptions in connectivity or performance.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The layers work by providing a video call between a golfer and instructor, wherein the instructor can share a recording of the golfer's swing or body position with the golfer while maintaining the live video call. The instructor can also provide mark-up on the recording, which is then saved along with the recording. The entire lesson is saved as a lesson layer, which includes the video call, recording, and mark-up. The golfer can then replay the lesson layer to view the recording and mark-up. The layer management module monitors system resources during this process to allocate, prioritize, initiate, and terminate various tasks and layers as necessary to ensure a smooth lesson performance.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The foregoing and other objects are intended to be illustrative of the invention and are not meant in a limiting sense.

In some embodiments, the device is a mobile device with a user interface and one or more peripherals (such as a user input implement, a camera, a microphone, or the like) for intaking at least one form of data. In some embodiments, the user utilizes the device to provide a user input, the user input typically being a button press or interaction with a touchscreen which simulates a button press. In some embodiments, the interaction begins a lesson request. In some embodiments, the lesson request includes selecting a lesson timing type (on-demand/instant or scheduled).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some embodiments, where an on-demand lesson is selected, one or more algorithm is utilized to identify an instructor for performing the on-demand lesson. In some embodiments, the algorithm is running on a user device, while in other embodiments the algorithm is running on a server in data communication with one or more user device. In some embodiments, the algorithm utilizes one or more data piece to select an instructor, such as, but not limited to, user location, user availability, user rating, user specialty, user age, user time factor, user issue, user preference, user history, and the like. In some embodiments, the algorithm identifies a single instructor or user to perform the instruction. In some embodiments, the algorithm provides an ordered list of one or more instructor to perform the lesson. In some embodiments, the list is ordered by most-preferred instructor to lesser-preferred instructor. In some embodiments, once a pro has been selected or a list generated, the platform provides a notification to the selected instructor or the instructor at the top of the ordered listed. The instructor is given the opportunity to accept or reject a lesson request. In some embodiments, the instructor accepts the lesson and is given a time frame to begin the on-demand lesson. If the on-demand lesson is not started within the given time frame or the instructor rejects the lesson, then the platform selects another alternative (secondary) instructor to perform the lesson. In some embodiments, the alternative instructor is selected by performing the algorithm again, while in some embodiments the alternative instructor is selected by identifying the next preferred instructor in the ordered list. In some embodiments, the instructor notification and alternative instructor selections continue until an instructor accepts the on-demand lesson and begins the lesson within the given time frame.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some embodiments, where a scheduled lesson is selected, the user beings a lesson scheduling process. In some embodiments, the user is presented with a list of instructors to select from for the scheduled lesson. In some embodiments, the list is of all instructors, while in some embodiments the list is curated by one or more algorithm or process of the system. In some embodiments, the user is provided a filter for the list of instructors. The user identifies an instructor and time for the lesson and confirms that the lesson should be scheduled. In some embodiments, the selected instructor is notified of the lesson and is given the option to accept or reject the lesson. Where the instructor accepts the lesson, the instructor begins the lesson at the scheduled time. Where the instructor rejects the lesson, the user is notified that a different instructor must be selected. In some embodiments, the user performs the scheduling process until an instructor accepts the lesson.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring generally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, in some embodiments, the lesson begins with the golfer and instructor engaging in a communication. In some embodiments, this communication is a video call, utilizing one or more peripherals of the user devices. In some embodiments, the video call utilizes a camera and microphone of the user devices. In some embodiments, a call layer, or first layer, is initialized, the first layer displaying and/or recording the video call. In some embodiments, the first layer includes two display images. In some embodiments, the display images are a large screen and small screen. One screen displays a first user, while the other screen displays a second user. In some embodiments, the small screen is positioned within the boundaries of the large screen, such as providing a picture-in-picture style display. In some embodiments, the display images are side by side. In some embodiments, each device displays the two display images. In some embodiments, each user can provide input to the device to change the display images, such as by changing the location of the small image within the boundary of the large image, or by changing which user is displayed on which screen. In some embodiments, the first layer occurs from the start of the communication until the end of the communication. In some embodiments, the first layer audio is recorded. In some embodiments, the first layer video is recorded. In some embodiments, the first layer recording is controlled by one or more of the users and selectively displayed as part of the video call.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some embodiments, the video call is initiated through the user devices and/or through a platform, such as a mobile application or the like. In some embodiments, the video call is initiated through the platform, and the platform utilizes the user devices to complete the call. In some embodiments, the user devices utilize the platform as a conduit to facilitate the video call.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some embodiments, the instructor initiates the lesson through the platform, the platform instructing one or more user to begin the call, such as through a notification to one or more user. In some embodiments, the instructor provides a lesson time and the platform provides a notification to the user to start the call at the time of the lesson time. In some embodiments, the instructor initiates the lesson through the platform, the platform initiating the call at the start of the lesson. In some embodiments, the lesson is initiated through the platform, the platform utilizing the user devices to communicate with the instructor and establish the video call at the start of the lesson. In some embodiments, the instructor initiates the lesson through the platform, the platform utilizing the user devices to reach out to the instructor using a communication software.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some embodiments, the instructor initiates a second layer. In some embodiments, the second layer is a recording of the first layer that takes place after the start of the first layer and before the end of the first layer, creating a recording of the first layer. In some embodiments, the second layer generates a recording which is controlled by one or more user and selectively displayed as part of the first layer. In some embodiments, the instructor utilizes the second layer to record a golfer's swing or body position, which generates a recording (which may also be considered the second layer recording). In some embodiments, the instructor can then share the second layer recording with the golfer while the first layer is on-going. The instructor can then play, pause, reverse, or the like the second layer recording while maintaining live video call with the golfer. The second layer recording is saved independently in association with the lesson and stored in a database. Either user is enabled to access the second layer recording during or after the lesson.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some embodiments, the instructor can input mark-up or figures on the second layer recording while engaged in the first layer video call.

The instructor then saves the fifth recording and fifth mark-ups as an update to the lesson layer, which can be accessed by the golfer at any time.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As noted, current offerings limit the ability to do multiple layer recording. In some embodiments, the layer recording utilizes the native recording of the user devices. In some embodiments, the recording occurs directly on the server, bypassing the need for the user device to record all layers. In some embodiments, the recording is stored in the random access memory of the user device, and subsequently sent to the server for storage or to a storage associated with the device. In some embodiments, the video layer, the recording layer, and the mark-up layer run in random access memory in parallel. In some embodiments, where such parallel running causes resource deficiencies associated with the hardware of the user, the platform instead adjusts to record smaller pieces of the layer multiple times. In some embodiments, this recording is by micro-recording the layer, wherein the recording is non-continuous and the layer is broken up by rapidly recording and not recording adjoining segments of the layer, thus reducing the resource demands while still providing useful layer recording for facilitating the administration of the lesson.
