A health support apparatus <b>1</b> includes an input unit <b>100</b>, a search pattern generation unit <b>120</b>, a factor change calculation unit <b>130</b>, a risk prediction unit <b>140</b>, a loss calculation unit <b>150</b>, and a select unit <b>160</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The input unit <b>100</b> accepts the input of medical checkup data and a target value. For example, the input unit <b>100</b> may be configured to accept the input of medical checkup data and a target value by the operation of the health support apparatus <b>1</b> by the user. In this case, the &#x201c;user&#x201d; is a person who uses the health support apparatus <b>1</b>. The user may be a person subjected to a medical checkup or a healthcare professional such as a doctor. In addition, the input unit <b>100</b> may be configured to accept medical checkup data stored in a storage medium outside the health support apparatus <b>1</b> (not shown) via a communication medium. Furthermore, the input unit <b>100</b> may be configured to accept medical checkup data transferred from the storage medium in response to when the storage medium is mounted in the health support apparatus <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In this case, medical checkup data according to this embodiment includes the inspection value of a factor used for the prediction of the risk of a lifestyle-related disease. Such factors include first factors and second factors. The first factors are factors that can be directly controlled by improving the lifestyle habit of a person subjected to a medical checkup. For example, the weight of the person is directly changed by executing exercise and improving the diet. Accordingly, the weight is included in the first factors. In addition, the body fat percentage and the like are included in the first factors. In contrast, the second factors are factors that cannot be directly controlled by improving the lifestyle habit of the person subjected to the medical checkup. For example, HbA1c (hemoglobin A1c) is not directly changed by executing exercise and improving the diet. Accordingly, HbA1c is included in the second factors. In addition, various biopsy values such as GOT (Glutamic Oxaloacetic Transaminase), LDL (Low Density Lipoprotein), and a blood pressure are included in the second factors. Note that HbA1c and the like are factors that cannot be directly controlled by improving the lifestyle habit but can be indirectly changed by a change in weight or the like accompanying the improvement of the lifestyle habit. That is, the second factors include factors that are indirectly controlled by changes in the first factors.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In addition, a target value indicates, for example, to which degree the disease risk value of a specific disease such as a lifestyle-related disease is to be reduced. A target value may be designated by a relative value or absolute value. In this case, the &#x201c;disease risk value&#x201d; is the onset probability of a specific disease in a given period. For example, when the disease risk of diabetes is to be reduced from 30% to 20%, the risk reduction target value (relative value) is 10(%) when being designated by a relative value, whereas the risk reduction target value (absolute value) is 20(%) when being designated by an absolute value. Alternatively, a target value may be the one for a change in any of factors such as weight included in medical checkup data. A target value fora change in factor may be designated by an absolute value or relative value like a disease risk value reduction target value.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The search pattern generation unit <b>120</b> generates a lifestyle habit improvement search pattern. A lifestyle habit improvement search pattern includes a plurality of lifestyle habit combination patterns. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an example of lifestyle habit improvement combination patterns. The example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> indicates at least three items, namely &#x201c;exercise habit&#x201d;, &#x201c;daily walking&#x201d;, and &#x201c;alcohol drinking&#x201d; as lifestyle habits. The search pattern generation unit <b>120</b> generates a lifestyle habit improvement combination pattern by, for example, setting &#x201c;yes&#x201d; and &#x201c;no&#x201d; of these lifestyle habits. For example, setting &#x201c;yes&#x201d; for &#x201c;exercise habit&#x201d; and &#x201c;daily walking&#x201d; indicates that the lifestyle habits will be improved. On the other hand, setting &#x201c;no&#x201d; for &#x201c;alcohol drinking&#x201d; indicates that the lifestyle habit will be improved. For example, in pattern &#x201c;No. 1&#x201d;, &#x201c;exercise habit&#x201d;, &#x201c;daily walking&#x201d;, and &#x201c;alcohol drinking&#x201d; each are set to &#x201c;no&#x201d;. Pattern &#x201c;No. 1&#x201d; having such setting indicates that avoiding &#x201c;alcohol drinking&#x201d; will improve the lifestyle habits. In addition, in pattern &#x201c;No. 2&#x201d;, &#x201c;exercise habit&#x201d; and &#x201c;daily walking&#x201d; are set to &#x201c;no&#x201d;, and &#x201c;alcohol drinking&#x201d; is set to &#x201c;yes&#x201d;. Pattern &#x201c;No. 2&#x201d; having such setting indicates that the lifestyle habits will not be improved concerning &#x201c;exercise habit&#x201d;, &#x201c;daily walking&#x201d;, and &#x201c;alcohol drinking&#x201d;. In this case, &#x201c;no&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> does not indicate that &#x201c;exercise habit&#x201d;, &#x201c;daily walking&#x201d;, and &#x201c;alcohol drinking&#x201d; are not practiced at all. Note that &#x201c;no&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> may include practicing &#x201c;exercise habit&#x201d;, &#x201c;daily walking&#x201d;, and &#x201c;alcohol drinking&#x201d; to such a degree that no influence is imposed on the prediction of a disease risk value. In addition, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, setting &#x201c;yes&#x201d; and &#x201c;no&#x201d; concerning the lifestyle habits will generate a lifestyle habit improvement pattern. In contrast to this, a lifestyle habit combination pattern may be generated in additional consideration of the amounts of the respective lifestyle habits. For example, &#x201c;yes&#x201d; for exercise habit may be divided into three patterns, namely, &#x201c;little&#x201d;, &#x201c;intermediate&#x201d;, and &#x201c;much&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In this case, the lifestyle habit data used for the generation of a lifestyle habit search pattern by the search pattern generation unit <b>120</b> is stored in, for example, the search pattern generation unit <b>120</b>. Alternatively, the lifestyle habit data may be stored in a storage medium outside the health support apparatus <b>1</b>. In this case, the search pattern generation unit <b>120</b> acquires lifestyle habit data from the external storage medium as needed.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The factor change calculation unit <b>130</b> calculates the change amount of each factor included in the medical checkup data based on the lifestyle habit search pattern generated by the search pattern generation unit <b>120</b>. The factor change calculation unit <b>130</b> predicts the change amount of factor based on, for example, a factor change amount prediction model. This factor change prediction model is, for example, a machine learning model configured to receive medical checkup data and a search pattern and output the change amount of each factor.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">An example of a learning method for a factor change prediction model will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is a conceptual diagram of machine learning of the factor change prediction model as the first example. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, machine learning of the factor change prediction model is executed when learning data <b>210</b> is input to a machine learning unit <b>220</b>. Executing learning using a predetermined amount of learning data <b>210</b> will generate a learned model <b>230</b> as a factor change prediction model.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The learning data <b>210</b> includes feature amount data and teacher data. The feature amount data is the data of feature amounts that can be used for the prediction of a change in factor, more specifically, feature amounts such as gender, age, weight, biopsy value, and lifestyle habit. Biopsy values include various types of biopsy values including first and second factors such as blood pressure, GOT, and LDL. Lifestyle habits include Yes or No or amounts of &#x201c;exercise habit&#x201d;, &#x201c;daily walking&#x201d;, and &#x201c;alcohol drinking&#x201d; described above. Teacher data is the actual change amount of a prediction target factor based on a related feature amount.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Using the learning data <b>210</b>, the machine learning unit <b>220</b> learns the relationship between a lifestyle habit combination pattern and the change amount of a factor which changes in accordance with the pattern. The machine learning algorithm in the machine learning unit <b>220</b> may be an arbitrary machine learning algorithm such as neural network, decision tree, or linear regression, which allows learning of the relationship between a feature amount and the change amount of a factor. The machine learning unit <b>220</b> makes the factor change calculation unit <b>130</b> store the learned model <b>230</b> generated as a result of a predetermined amount of learning as a factor change prediction model. The machine learning unit <b>220</b> can be implemented by a computer including a processor and a memory. For example, Kazuyo Tsushita, &#x201c;Practice and Evaluation of Lifestyle Intervention on Program&#x201d;, The Journal of the Japanese Society of Internal Medicine/Volume 105/Issue 9, [Online] [Search: Apr. 28, 2021], Internet URL: https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/naika/105/9/105_1654/article/-char/ja/reports that as the weight changes accompanying an improvement in lifestyle habit, a biopsy value such as GOT, HbA1c, or LDL as a second factor significantly changes. That is, improving the lifestyle habit will change a first factor such as weight and biopsy values as second factors such as GOT, HbA1c, and LDL at given ratios. Accordingly, inputting a lifestyle habit search pattern and the values of the respective factors before an improvement in lifestyle habit to this factor change prediction model will make the factor change prediction model output a disease the values of the respective factors that change accompanying the improvement in lifestyle habit. When, for example, the machine learning algorithm is a neural network, the parameters of the neural network, such as a weight coefficient and a bias, are trained such that inputting a lifestyle habit combination pattern and the values of the respective factors before an improvement in lifestyle habit to the neural network will make it output the values of the respective factors that change accompanying the improvement in lifestyle habit. More specifically, the parameters are trained so as to minimize the error between the predicted change amount obtained by the forward propagation of the value of each factor included in the feature amount data to the neural network and the actual change amount included in the teacher data. At this time, the parameters may be trained by inputting a lifestyle habit combination pattern, together with feature amount data, to the neural network or the parameters of the neural network may be trained for each lifestyle habit combination pattern.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">A factor change prediction model can be generated for each group such as each gender group or each age group.

The medical checkup data may be input, for example, via the operation of an input device <b>303</b> by the user on the GUI displayed on a display <b>304</b> or may be input via a storage medium outside the health support apparatus <b>1</b>. The target value may be input via the operation of the input device <b>303</b> by the user on the GUI displayed on the display <b>304</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0073">In step S<b>12</b>, the processor <b>301</b> generates a lifestyle habit search pattern by referring to lifestyle habit data <b>3062</b>. The processor <b>301</b> may generate a search pattern by combining all or some of the lifestyle habits that can be generated from the lifestyle habit data <b>3062</b>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0074">In step S<b>13</b>, the processor <b>301</b> calculates the change amount of a factor used for the prediction of a disease risk for each search pattern. When a change in first factor influences a change in second factor, the processor <b>301</b> calculates the change amount of the first factor first by using a first factor change table and then calculates the change amount of the second factor by using a second factor change table.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0075">In step S<b>14</b>, the processor <b>301</b> predicts a disease risk value. For example, the processor <b>301</b> inputs the value of the factor after the change to a disease risk prediction model and predicts a disease risk value for each search pattern.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0076">In step S<b>15</b>, the processor <b>301</b> executes loss calculation. For example, the processor <b>301</b> calculates losses according to equations (1), (2), and (3) or (1), (2), and (4).</p><p id="p-0086" num="0077">In step S<b>16</b>, the processor <b>301</b> selects a lifestyle habit combination pattern presented to the user. For example, the processor <b>301</b> selects one or more lifestyle habit combination patterns in ascending order of the values of losses.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0078">In step S<b>17</b>, the processor <b>301</b> presents the result to the user. The processor <b>301</b> then terminates the processing in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. For example, the processor <b>301</b> displays the selected lifestyle habit combination pattern and the disease risk value predicted in the lifestyle habits on the screen of the display <b>304</b>. A reduction value of the disease risk value may be displayed instead of a disease risk value or the reduction target value of a factor such as weight and the biopsy value of the factor improved by a lifestyle habit may be displayed.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0079">As described above, the second embodiment is configured to calculate, based on tables, the change amounts of the first factor that can be directly controlled by improving the lifestyle habit of a person subjected to a medical checkup in accordance with a lifestyle habit combination pattern of the person subjected to the medical checkup and the second factor that cannot be directly controlled by improving the lifestyle habit of the person subjected to the medical checkup. According to the second embodiment, a disease risk value can be predicted based on the first and second factors. In this manner, as in the first embodiment, in the second embodiment, the second factor that cannot be directly controlled by improving the lifestyle habit of a person subjected to a medical checkup is properly reflected in a prediction result in the prediction of a disease risk value, and hence optimal goal setting at the individual level can be implemented in health guidance.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0080">The tables used for the calculation of changes in factor are prepared for the respective groups such as gender groups and age groups. Accordingly, the change amounts of factors can be calculated in accordance with lifestyle habit combination patterns including differences in gender and age among persons subjected to medical checkups. This makes it possible to use the change amounts of factors for the respective groups based on differences in gender, age, and the like for risk prediction in the second embodiment as in the first embodiment, thereby providing a person subjected to a medical checkup with proper guidance.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0081">[Modification]</p><p id="p-0091" num="0082">The first and second embodiments each have exemplified the stratification based on differences in gender and the stratification based on differences in age. However, stratification may be performed in a different manner. For example, stratification may be performed depending on whether a certain drug is administered. In addition, stratification may be performed based on BMI (Body Mass Index) values. Furthermore, stratification may be performed based on dietary habits such as easing a lot of meats, not eating a lot of meats, or vegetarianism. Moreover, stratification may be performed in an arbitrary manner such as stratification based on whether there is any obese person in a family. These stratifications may be singly used or in combination.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0083">While certain embodiments have been described, these embodiments have been presented by way of example only, and are not intended to limit the scope of the inventions.
