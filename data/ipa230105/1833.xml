The dipole loudspeaker is suitable for producing sound at base frequencies. The dipole loudspeaker has a diaphragm having a first radiating surface and a second radiating surface, wherein the first radiating surface and the second radiating surface are located on opposite sides of the diaphragm, and wherein the first and the second radiating surfaces each have a surface area of at least 100 cm<sup>2</sup>. The dipole loudspeaker furthermore has a drive unit which is configured to move the diaphragm at base frequencies in such a manner that the first and the second radiating surface produce acoustic sound at base frequencies, wherein the acoustic sound produced by the first radiating surface is in antiphase with the acoustic sound produced by the second radiating surface.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">Problem</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The problem addressed by the present invention is to provide a backrest for a vehicle seat having an extended integrated function and to improve backrests known from the prior art. Furthermore, a problem addressed by the invention is to provide a corresponding vehicle seat.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Solution</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The problem is solved according to the invention by a backrest for a vehicle seat, wherein the backrest comprises a backrest part, a head restraint part and an acoustic arrangement, wherein the acoustic arrangement is arranged above the backrest part and comprises at least one central loudspeaker and at least two side loudspeakers, wherein the central loudspeaker is integrated in the head restraint part and the at least two side loudspeakers are arranged on a support.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Owing to the fact that the central loudspeaker is integrated in the head restraint part and the at least two side loudspeakers are arranged on a support, a spatially local region with a controlled sound and tone reproduction can be produced in the vicinity of the head, in particular in the vicinity of an ear region, of a user of the vehicle seat. The advantages obtained with the invention consist in particular in that an improved spatial sound and tone reproduction is made possible. By a transparent configuration of the support, a view for a user of the vehicle seat laterally and/or to the rear into the region surrounding the vehicle seat can continue to be possible.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The acoustic arrangement can comprise a control unit with a noise compensation and/or noise elimination function which is configured such that undesirable noises in the vicinity can be suppressed or can be faded out, for example, by frequency superimposition. As a result, in particular simple and effective noise compensation, in particular of road noises, is made possible.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The backrest part of the backrest can be a portion of the backrest reaching substantially as far as the height of a shoulder of a user of the vehicle seat. The head restraint part can be a head restraint which can be mounted, in particular releasably, on the backrest part of the backrest. The head restraint part can be fixedly connected to the backrest part. The head restraint part and the backrest part can be an integral part of the backrest.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">For example, the control unit, in particular the noise compensation and/or noise elimination function thereof, is configured for occupants of the vehicle seat who are not drivers of the vehicle, in order to suppress or to extinguish all environmental noises, including driving and road noises and/or signals from emergency vehicles. For the driver, the control unit can be configured such that signals relevant to safety, such as signals from emergency vehicles, are not suppressed. Vehicle signals, for example status signals, in particular activated autonomous driving, vehicle at a standstill, break, parking or deactivated autonomous driving of the vehicle, can be supplied to the control unit such that, for example, the control unit can be used to also suppress substantially all environmental noises for the driver on taking into consideration the vehicle status, for example when autonomous driving is activated.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The control unit can be configured to take into consideration the position of the user of the vehicle seat, in particular the head of the user of the vehicle seat. For this purpose, the position of the head of the user in the region of the acoustic arrangement is detected and supplied to the control unit. For example, the noise compensation and/or noise elimination function can be configured so as, when it is identified that the user's head is in contact with the head restraint part, to substantially completely suppress the environmental noises and to output only desirable noises, such as music, via the acoustic arrangement. If, by contrast, the user's head is located at a distance from the head restraint part (for example is inclined forward), no environmental noises are then suppressed or faded out.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The support can be fastened to the head restraint part. The support can be fastened in the region of the head restraint part to the backrest. The support can be part of the head restraint part. The support can be elastic and/or flexible. A flexible design of the support ensures that the support is moved, in particular is bent and/or deformed, for example permanently bent or deformed, by an airbag triggered, for example, as a result of an impact or accident. Additionally or alternatively, an elastic design of the support permits a yielding and/or giving-way movement, in particular a temporary movement, of the support in the event of mechanical stressing, for example by a triggered airbag.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The support can have at least one bow, preferably two bows. The support can be configured to be transparent in portions. The support can surround open regions. The support can have transparent regions through which the user of the vehicle seat can look.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The support can be elastic and/or flexible. Preferably, at least one of the side loudspeakers is adjustable variably by the support in a position relative to the user's head. The two side loudspeakers can be adjustable variably by the support in a position relative to the user's head.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The support can be formed from an elastic and/or flexible material, in particular from a polymer material or spring steel. The polymer material can be a rubber-like polymer material, for example ethylene-propylene-diene rubber (called EPDM for short). The support can comprise a polymer material, in particular a rubber-like polymer material, for example ethylene-propylene-diene rubber (called EPDM for short), or a spring steel.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The support can have a casing made from a polymer material, in particular a soft polymer material. In particular, the spring steel can be encased by a polymer material, in particular a soft polymer material.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The acoustic arrangement, in particular the side loudspeakers, can be oriented in the direction of an ear region of a user of the vehicle seat. The acoustic arrangement can be arranged in the vicinity of an ear region of a user of the vehicle seat. At least one or more of the loudspeakers can be adjusted variably by the flexible support. This permits optimum positioning of the loudspeakers for the user and adaptation of the position of the loudspeakers to the user.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The support can protrude laterally from the head restraint part, in particular obliquely forward and outward. The two side loudspeakers can be arranged and held in a receiving opening of the support.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The two side loudspeakers can be mid-range loudspeakers. The two side loudspeakers can be tweeter loudspeakers. The two side loudspeakers can be combined mid-range and tweeter loudspeakers. The side loudspeakers can be arranged in such a manner that a directly radiating acoustic sound or an indirectly radiating acoustic sound radiates in the direction of ears of a user of the vehicle seat.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The central loudspeaker can be a low-frequency loudspeaker. The central loudspeaker can be covered by a cover element, in particular a padded cover element, or a separate padding element in the direction of a head support surface.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In summary, such an acoustic arrangement on a vehicle seat continues to permit a clear view and safe triggering of an airbag, such as a side airbag, located in the surrounding region.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">A low-frequency loudspeaker is also known as a bass loudspeaker or woofer. The low-frequency loudspeaker can be designed as a boxless and open loudspeaker, in particular a diaphragm loudspeaker or wall-mounted loudspeaker. In particular, the low-frequency loudspeaker can be designed as an acoustic dipole or as a baffle loudspeaker. For example, a baffle or a diaphragm can be held in the head restraint part, in particular inside the head restraint part, on a head restraint support. The low-frequency loudspeaker is preferably arranged in the head restraint part in such a manner that a directly radiating acoustic sound or an indirectly radiating acoustic sound radiates in the direction of a head support surface on the head restraint part. The central loudspeaker can be covered here by an open covering, in particular a lattice structure, in the direction of the head support surface. The lattice structure can furthermore be surrounded by a cover element, in particular a padded cover element, or a separate padding element.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">A mid-range loudspeaker is also known as a mid-range speaker. A tweeter loudspeaker is also known as a tweeter. The two side loudspeakers are arranged and held, for example, in a receiving opening of the support. For example, the side loudspeakers can be designed as a boxless and open loudspeaker, in particular a diaphragm loudspeaker or wall-mounted loudspeaker. In particular, the side loudspeaker can be designed as an acoustic dipole or a baffle loudspeaker. A baffle or a diaphragm can here be arranged and held in a receiving opening of a bow-shaped or wire-shaped support. The side loudspeakers are preferably arranged in such a manner that a directly radiating acoustic sound or an indirectly radiating acoustic sound radiates in the direction of ears of a user of the vehicle seat.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The side loudspeakers can be covered here by an open covering, in particular a lattice structure. The lattice structure can furthermore be surrounded by a cover element, in particular a padded cover element, or a separate padding element.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The support is in particular positioned and arranged on the vehicle seat in such a manner that the two side loudspeakers can be oriented relative to an ear region of a user of the vehicle seat. The flexible design of the support enables the latter to be set or positioned and held in a manner adapted to various user heights.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The abovementioned problem is also solved according to the invention by a vehicle seat having a backrest according to the preceding description.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In summary and described in other words, a boxless loudspeaker design can be used in a previously described backrest. An acoustic dipole can produce a near field sound cocoon. A central loudspeaker installed in a head restraint can be a boxless loudspeaker in the manner of a &#x201c;bass cocoon&#x201d; which is commercially available. The central loudspeaker is preferably located behind an occupant's head. At least two side loudspeakers, in particular two mid-range and tweeter loudspeakers, are located in the vicinity of the ears of the occupant and can be adaptable to the different occupant heights. The side loudspeakers are preferably attached to the vehicle seat or to the head restraint such that the peripheral view or view to the rear continues to be possible here. This can be made possible in particular by the use of transparent materials and/or of a design with open holders (e.g. holders of the side loudspeakers with a minimalistic design and/or use of a transparent material for the holders). The side loudspeakers are possibly located in a region in which what is referred to as a curtain airbag is triggered during a side impact. In order to reduce or to avoid a risk of injury during the use of a curtain airbag, the holder is preferably configured to be flexible (e.g. made from EPDM or spring steel).</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">FIGURES AND EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The invention is explained in more detail below with reference to advantageous exemplary embodiments which are illustrated in the figures.
