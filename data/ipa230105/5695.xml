An x-ray tube is specialized type of vacuum tube commonly used to generate and direct x-ray radiation for various purposes, such as medical imaging, radiology, diagnostics, radiography, tomography, non-destructive testing, materials analysis, security applications, and inspection.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventional x-ray tubes operate by emitting a concentrated electron beam using an energized cathode and thereafter directing the emitted electron beam toward an anode-mounted target. The emitted electrons gain energy and accelerate based on the large potential difference across the intervening space between the anode and cathode. Some of the accelerated electrons collide with the target surface on the anode, with a small portion of the incident electron beam energy being converted into useful x-ray radiation. The remaining energy largely takes the form of heat, which is dissipated from the x-ray tube, typically through some type of cooling system.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The drawings described herein are for illustrative purposes only, are schematic in nature, and are intended to be exemplary rather than to limit the scope of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an illustration of an exemplary vacuum tube insert assembly for an x-ray tube, with the assembly having feed-through pins forming a plug, and also having a mating socket as set forth herein.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective view illustration of an embodiment of the vacuum tube insert assembly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic illustration of a representative dual-filament arrangement for use with a cathode assembly depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref> are perspective view illustrations of a representative portion of a flared insert piece constructed as described herein.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref> are perspective view illustrations of a socket configured to connect to a plug of the flared insert piece shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> schematically depicts an alternative engagement feature configuration of the socket shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref> are perspective view illustrations of a pin fixture for use during assembly of the flared insert piece and vacuum tube insert of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a flow chart describing an exemplary method for constructing a vacuum tube insert in accordance with the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Embodiments of the present disclosure are described herein. The disclosed embodiments are provided as examples and illustration of the various solutions. The drawings are not necessarily to scale, with some features possibly exaggerated or minimized to show particular details of interest. Therefore, specific structural and functional details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but merely as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to variously employ disclosed structure and methodologies.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Numbers provided in flow charts and process descriptions are intended to improve clarity, and do not necessarily indicate a particular order or sequence. For purposes of the present detailed description, words of approximation, such as &#x201c;about,&#x201d; &#x201c;substantially,&#x201d; &#x201c;generally,&#x201d; &#x201c;approximately,&#x201d; and the like, may each be used herein in the sense of &#x201c;at, near, or nearly at,&#x201d; or &#x201c;within 0-5% of,&#x201d; or &#x201c;within acceptable manufacturing tolerances,&#x201d; or any logical combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Some embodiments described herein relate generally to x-ray tubes and other types of vacuum tubes, glass inserts constructed for use with such vacuum tubes, and methods for making using vacuum tubes and glass inserts as described herein. In particular, the following disclosure relates to extension of substantially-rigid, electrically-conductive feed-through posts or pins into a defined open-ended bowl-like cavity (&#x201c;concavity&#x201d;) of a flared insert piece for a glass vacuum tube, with the insert piece ultimately melted and fused with a glass enclosure or envelope. The feed-through pins are arranged to present a plug, to which an operator may removably couple a mating socket. The construction of the socket may vary with the particular temperature and other expected loads applied during testing, loading, and other stages of manufacturing and use.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In contrast with existing approaches in which flexible wires are individually welded to the ends of mating feed-through wires, the rigid feed-through pins contemplated herein, due to their increased rigidity and extension into the volume of the concavity as a predetermined spaced and oriented plug, are less susceptible to breakage, fraying, burning, and electrical short conditions. Additionally, the unique plug-and-socket coupling described below is far less prone to inadvertent wiring errors. Moreover, as the contemplated socket in certain configurations can be installed in only one specified orientation, the plug-and-socket connection reduces errors during manufacturing, installation, and servicing.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numbers refer to like components, a vacuum tube insert assembly <b>10</b> includes plug means as set forth herein, such as the representative plug <b>12</b> shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. A mating socket means, exemplified as a socket <b>14</b>, is disposed at a terminal end <b>15</b> of a flexible cable <b>16</b> is removably coupled to the plug <b>12</b>, as indicated by arrow A, e.g., to supply electrical power to the vacuum tube insert assembly <b>10</b> or to an assembled device using the same. As appreciated in the art, when the vacuum tube insert assembly <b>10</b> is used as part of an x-ray tube, the vacuum tube insert assembly <b>10</b> may be situated within a lead-lined protective alloy or machined housing (omitted for clarity), or within another suitably protective outer structure, so as to provide stable mechanical support, and thermal insulation.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The exemplary vacuum tube insert assembly <b>10</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> includes various components that, in a non-limiting x-ray tube embodiment, collectively generate and emit x-ray radiation (arrow <b>18</b>) through a window <b>20</b> toward an object <b>22</b>, e.g., a patient's chest or appendage. Such components include glass means, such as an enclosure or envelope <b>24</b> constructed of glass and defining an internal volume <b>25</b>, within which is situated a positively-charged anode assembly <b>26</b> and a negatively-charged cathode assembly <b>28</b>, as appreciated in the art. As described herein in the various example embodiments, the envelope <b>24</b> may be constructed of borosilicate glass or another hard, application-suitable glass material, and thus is referred to hereinafter as a glass envelope <b>24</b>, without limiting the materials of construction to glass.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Although simplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> for the purpose of illustration, the anode assembly <b>26</b> includes a cylindrical bearing-mounted rotor <b>30</b> having an axis of rotation <b>31</b>. A stator <b>32</b> surrounds a neck <b>33</b> of the glass envelope <b>24</b>, with the stator <b>32</b> circumscribing the rotor <b>30</b>. Thus, when the stator <b>32</b> is energized, alternating forces of electromagnetic attraction and repulsion cause the rotor <b>30</b> to rotate about the axis of rotation <b>31</b>, with such rotation in turn causing rotation of an anode target disk <b>34</b> constructed, e.g., of tungsten, mounted to the rotor <b>30</b>, e.g., via an anode stem <b>35</b>. As appreciated in the art, the target disk <b>34</b> provides a material target for interaction with electrons emitted by the cathode assembly <b>28</b>, with x-rays ultimately generated from such interaction.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The cathode assembly <b>28</b> in the simplified embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> includes a cathode head <b>36</b> to which is connected a focusing cup <b>38</b>. The focusing cup <b>38</b> in turn contains or is connected to one or more conductive filaments <b>39</b>, with each filament <b>39</b> likewise can be constructed of tungsten or another application-suitable material. When the cathode assembly <b>28</b> is energized, an electrical current flows through and heats the filament(s) <b>39</b>. The heated filament(s) <b>39</b> respond by emitting electrons via the process of thermionic emission.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">High voltages on the order of one kilovolt (kV) or more are typically applied between the anode assembly <b>26</b> and the cathode assembly <b>28</b>. The glass envelope <b>24</b> thus acts as a sealed vacuum enclosure which maintains a high vacuum, typically of less than 10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>mmHg. In addition to retaining such a strong vacuum, the glass envelope <b>24</b> also electrically isolates the anode assembly <b>26</b> from the cathode assembly <b>28</b>, with potential differences of as high as 150 kV or more maintained therebetween, without significant electric leakage or spurious discharges.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The glass envelope <b>24</b> contemplated herein includes a flared insert piece <b>40</b>, as shown in greater detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, which is disposed proximate the cathode assembly <b>28</b>. As described in detail below, the flared insert piece <b>40</b> is ultimately melted, fused to, and/or integrally formed with, and thus vacuum-sealed, to feed-through pin means, hereinafter exemplified as a plurality of feed-through pins <b>42</b>, each of which in turn passes axially through the flared insert piece <b>40</b>. The feed-through pins <b>42</b> collectively form the plug <b>12</b> within a plug concavity <b>44</b> defined by the flared insert piece <b>40</b>. The plug <b>12</b> is thus readily accessible for the purpose of receiving electrical power at various stages of production.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">To that end, the socket <b>14</b> is removably coupled to the plug <b>12</b> within the plug concavity <b>44</b>, which occurs with a corresponding minimal level of effort. After connecting the various components of the vacuum tube insert assembly <b>10</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, the flared insert piece <b>40</b> as described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>9</b></figref> is connected to the glass envelope <b>24</b>, with the internal volume <b>25</b> thereafter evacuated using pumps and other associated equipment.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring briefly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the number of the feed-through pins <b>42</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>) may vary with the construction of the vacuum tube insert assembly <b>10</b>. In some embodiments, for instance, the filament(s) <b>39</b> may include multiple filaments <b>39</b>, such as the illustrated dual focus type with filaments <b>139</b> and <b>239</b>. The filaments <b>139</b> and <b>239</b> are shown with corresponding terminals or nodes, with filament <b>139</b> having nodes <b>57</b>A and <b>57</b>B, and with filament <b>239</b> having nodes <b>57</b>B and <b>57</b>C. Also shown are a getter <b>70</b> with getter node <b>57</b>D and a grid <b>72</b> with a grid node <b>57</b>E. Corresponding notations &#x201c;S Small&#x201d;, &#x201c;C Common&#x201d;, and &#x201c;L Large&#x201d; can be used to connect a single &#x201c;small&#x201d; filament (e.g., filament <b>139</b> extending between nodes <b>57</b>A and <b>57</b>B) or connect a single &#x201c;large&#x201d; filament (e.g., filament <b>239</b> extending between nodes <b>57</b>B and <b>57</b>C). Filaments <b>139</b> and <b>239</b> may be connected in series by connecting nodes <b>57</b>A and <b>57</b>C. Filaments <b>139</b> and <b>239</b> may be connected in parallel by connecting nodes <b>57</b>A, <b>57</b>B, and <b>57</b>C. As understood in the art, use of a smaller filament results in generation of a smaller focus spot suitable, e.g., for imaging a smaller area. Conversely, use of multiple/larger filaments results in generation of a larger focal spot with a corresponding larger imaging area.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In addition to nodes <b>57</b>A, <b>57</b>B, and <b>57</b>C, the feed-through pins <b>42</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> may also include &#x201c;getter&#x201d; and &#x201c;grid&#x201d; nodes <b>57</b>D and <b>57</b>E, respectively, for a total of five associated feed-through pins <b>42</b> in this embodiment. The particular identities of the nodes <b>57</b>A-R can vary with the application, and thus the illustrated locations in the five-pin embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> are representative of just one possible implementation. As used herein and in the art, a getter absorbs off-gassed particles during manufacturing, and also helps maintain a vacuum after sealing. The getter node <b>57</b>D thus provides one of the electrical connections to the getter <b>70</b>. A grid can be used to focus the electrons, or to restrict or even cut off electron flow for fast-switching speeds, i.e., when the x-ray source is turned on and off. The grid node <b>57</b>E therefore provides one of the electrical connections to the grid <b>72</b>. It is also possible that some of the illustrated nodes are not used, or are tied together, e.g., the grid node <b>57</b>, getter node <b>57</b>E, and common node <b>57</b>B could be tied together either within the tube or external to the tube. As a result, the cable <b>16</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> may not be fed with the same number of voltage inputs as the number of feed-through pins <b>42</b>, e.g., in the example of a 4-pin or 3-pin configuration. For illustrative consistency, however, the vacuum tube insert assembly <b>10</b> will be described hereinafter as a representative 5-pin configuration.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, the flared insert piece <b>40</b> includes an annular flange <b>45</b>, e.g., a substantially flat disk as shown. The annular flange <b>45</b> is integrally formed with an axially-extending stem <b>46</b>. The axially-extending stem <b>46</b> in turn defines the plug concavity <b>44</b> having a perimeter edge <b>47</b>, which is also shown but not labeled in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The plug concavity <b>44</b> by way of example may have a generally hemispherical or rounded conical shape, such that the plug concavity <b>44</b> has a concave bowl-like appearance from the perspective of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. The annular flange <b>45</b> surrounds the perimeter edge <b>47</b> of the plug concavity <b>44</b>, with an outer diameter and thickness of the annular flange <b>45</b> matching that of the remaining structure of the glass envelope <b>24</b> to which the insert piece is ultimately fused or connected.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the feed-through pins <b>42</b> pass axially through the stem <b>46</b> and are melted or fused thereto. The feed-through pins <b>42</b> are thus integral with the surrounding glass of the stem <b>46</b> once the glass has cooled in order to provide the requisite vacuum seal integrity between a vacuum side within the evacuated internal volume <b>25</b> of the glass envelope <b>24</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), and the surrounding external/atmospheric pressure side of the vacuum tube insert assembly <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The feed-through pins <b>42</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> may include a center post <b>50</b> flanked by at least two pins <b>52</b>, with four pins <b>52</b> surrounding the center post <b>50</b> in the non-limiting exemplary construction of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. The center post <b>50</b> may have a first radial dimension, e.g., a diameter when the center post <b>50</b> is cylindrical, while each of the pins <b>52</b> may have a smaller second radial dimension. For instance, the second radial dimension may be less than about <b>80</b> percent of the first radial dimension, e.g., about <b>40</b> percent to <b>60</b> percent of the first dimension or about <b>25</b> percent to about <b>75</b> percent of the first dimension in different exemplary embodiments. Use of a more robust or thicker construction of the center post <b>50</b> facilitates construction of the vacuum tube insert assembly <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, for instance by providing a substantially rigid center indexing feature to which other components and/or fixtures may be aligned or referenced. While cylindrical feed-through pins are shown, the feed-through pins can have various cross-sections, including but not limited to circular, elliptical, rectangular, or another polygonal or other shape. An engagement feature, which is explained in greater detail below, may be formed when two or more different cross-sectional shapes (or cross-sectional areas) are used for the feed-through pins and corresponding engaging mating receptacles <b>56</b> of the socket <b>14</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>8</b></figref>) so the plug <b>12</b> is received by the socket <b>14</b> in a specified and/or unique orientation. Other engagement features may be formed by other variations of features, with examples provided below, so long as the plug <b>12</b> is received by the socket <b>14</b> in a specified and/or unique orientation.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Proper fusion and adherence of the glass materials of the stem <b>46</b> to the feed-through pins <b>42</b> may be conducted by various means, one of which is the use of a press and a heat source. As understood in the art and as used herein, such a press may be used to pinch together/concentrate heated glass material of the stem <b>46</b> so that the softened viscous glass material flows around and encompasses the feed-through pins <b>42</b>. When the glass cools, the feed-through pins <b>42</b> are integral with the stem <b>46</b>, with no intervening gaps or spaces present at interfacing surfaces of the feed-through pins <b>42</b> and surrounding glass.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">To facilitate the requisite vacuum-sealing properties, the materials used for constructing the feed-through pins <b>42</b> should be of a similar coefficient of expansion as the glass of the glass envelope <b>24</b>, such that cracking or spacing does not result upon cooling and solidification of the glass. One possible combination suitable for such a vacuum seal is borosilicate glass or another hard glass for construction of the flared insert piece <b>40</b>, and plated or non-plated metal such as tungsten (W), molybdenum (Mo), or a nickel cobalt alloy (Ni&#x2014;Co&#x2014;Fe) such as Kovar&#xae;, any of which are suitable for construction of the feed-through pins <b>42</b>. That is, the feed-through pins <b>42</b> may be constructed of a first metal, which may be optionally plated with a second metal. When plated, suitable electrically-conductive metals may be used to ensure continuity and reduce resistance, with elemental nickel (Ni), gold (Au), copper (Cu), or silver (Ag) being a few possible plating materials. The plating materials may have a high thermal resistance that reduces damage due to thermal stresses.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the feed-through pins <b>42</b> terminated position inside of the plug concavity <b>44</b> and collectively form the plug <b>12</b>. The plug <b>12</b> is thus presented at a convenient height above the stem <b>46</b> for connecting electrical power to the vacuum tube insert assembly <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> as needed, with the power composition or level possibly differing depending on the particular stage of assembly, test, or loading. For example, the length of the feed-through pins <b>42</b> exposed within the volume of the plug concavity <b>44</b> may be at least <b>4</b>mm to about <b>10</b>mm, or another suitable length sufficient for entering and securely engaging mating receptacles <b>56</b> of the socket <b>14</b> as described herein.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the flared insert piece <b>40</b> is shown as the flared insert piece <b>40</b> would appear when viewed from the outside/atmospheric pressure side of the vacuum tube insert assembly <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>. Presentation of a non-flexible/substantially rigid plug <b>12</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) within the plug concavity <b>44</b> eliminates the need for welding of individual flexible wires to each of the feed-through pins <b>42</b>, e.g., when installing the cathode assembly <b>28</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, which can be prone to manufacturing or operator error. Instead, one may simply engage the socket <b>14</b> with the exposed feed-through pins <b>42</b> of the plug <b>12</b> within the plug concavity <b>44</b>, with the annular flange <b>45</b> surrounding the perimeter edge <b>47</b> of the plug concavity <b>44</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The socket <b>14</b> terminates electrical wires <b>160</b> forming the cable <b>16</b>, with individual electrical contacts of the electrical wires <b>160</b> contained within the socket <b>14</b>. Each of the electrical wires <b>160</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> corresponds to one of the above-noted small, large, common, getter, or grid nodes in the representative 5-pin embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. To facilitate assembly, the socket <b>14</b> may define respective through-channels <b>49</b> for each of the electrical wires <b>160</b>, which would enable the electrical wires <b>160</b> to pass cleanly through the socket <b>14</b> to engage a mating receptacle <b>56</b> contained therewithin, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. For current limiting, sensing, or other beneficial purposes, any or all of the receptacles <b>56</b> may contain a resistor therein or in series therewith.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">As contemplated herein, each of the receptacles <b>56</b> can be constructed in various alternative forms and with application-suitable internal contact constructions in order to receive and thereafter securely retain a respective one of the fed-through pins <b>42</b>. That is, a resilient internal electrically-conductive connection or interference fit is provided between the mating feed-through pins <b>42</b> and the receptacles <b>56</b> to ensure a good electrical connection and continuity between the plug <b>12</b> and the socket <b>14</b>. Alternative types of plug and socket connections may be used within the scope of the disclosure, such as but not limited to male-female plug-socket configurations, hyperboloid contacts, or other suitable embodiments. Although omitted for illustrative simplicity, additional retention mechanisms may be used in other embodiments, such as keyways or similar structure, e.g., requiring a partial rotation of the connected socket <b>14</b> after insertion of the plug <b>12</b> to securely lock the plug <b>12</b> into place.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Materials of construction of the socket <b>14</b> may vary depending on the stage of manufacturing. For example, stages requiring exposure of the socket <b>14</b> to higher temperatures or power levels could be constructed of a high-temperature resin, while lower temperature or steady-state operating stages may use a lower temperature material such as polycarbonate. Lower temperature materials may be used in part due to the existence of cooling oil and other thermal regulating structure within a fully assembled vacuum tube device, e.g., an x-ray tube, which in turn lowers thermal loading of the socket <b>14</b>. Three-dimensional (3D) printing or additive manufacturing techniques may be used to construct the socket <b>14</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> in some implementations in order to form the desired geometry.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Further with respect to the socket <b>14</b>, errors during installation are reduced by an engagement feature <b>60</b> that is configured to permit the plug <b>12</b> to receive the socket <b>14</b>, and vice versa, in a specified orientation of the socket <b>14</b>. As set forth below, the socket <b>14</b> or the plug <b>12</b> can separately or together include the engagement feature <b>60</b> in different embodiments so as to permit the plug <b>12</b> to receive the socket <b>14</b> in a specified orientation of the socket <b>14</b> and vice versa. To this end, an option for the plug <b>12</b> is to form at least one of the feed-through pins <b>42</b> with a different height or length relative to the other feed-through pins <b>42</b> in order to create a defined height-broken symmetry. For instance, the engagement feature <b>60</b> may be implemented by leaving one or more of the feed-through pins <b>42</b> longer than remaining feed-through pins <b>42</b>, with such a feed-through pin <b>42</b> being referred to herein as an elongated pin <b>142</b> for clarity (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>4</b></figref>). While one such elongated pin <b>142</b> is shown for simplicity, more than one feed-through pin <b>42</b> may be elongated in other configurations.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, use of the elongated pin <b>142</b> allows the socket <b>14</b> to optionally include a radial end surface <b>340</b> connected via an axial wall <b>240</b> to a stepped-down radial mid-wall surface <b>140</b>. The radial mid-wall surface <b>140</b> may contain at least one of the receptacles <b>56</b>, with the remaining receptacles <b>56</b> contained within and opening from the radial end surface <b>340</b> as shown. The receptacle(s) <b>56</b> located in the mid-wall surface <b>140</b> may be configured to receive the elongated pin <b>142</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) in this particular exemplary embodiment, with the identity of the elongated pin <b>142</b> relative to connection to the short, long, common, getter, or grid nodes or feeds described above varying with the desired application.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Use of the elongated pin <b>142</b> or multiple such elongated pins <b>142</b> in this manner ensures that an operator is able to connect the socket <b>14</b> to the plug <b>12</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, and <b>4</b></figref> in a specified orientation. This capability in turn &#x201c;error-proofs&#x201d; the installation by reducing the chances of or preventing erroneous connections, e.g., of the type ordinarily established by individual manual connections implemented using alligator clips or direct wire splicing. However, the elongated pin <b>142</b> is just one possible implementation of the engagement feature <b>60</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring briefly to the alternative engagement feature <b>600</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> for example, the plug <b>12</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, and <b>4</b></figref> may include a keyed or splined surface <b>420</b>, for instance by forming the same on a surface of the center post <b>50</b> or another feed-through pin <b>42</b>. In such an embodiment, the socket <b>14</b> includes a mating keyed or splined surface <b>61</b>, with a specified orientation of the socket <b>14</b> permitting the center post <b>50</b> to enter the corresponding receptacle <b>56</b>. Other possibilities may exist for implementing the engagement feature <b>60</b>, and therefore the use of the elongated pin <b>142</b> and/or the keyed/splined surfaces <b>420</b> and <b>61</b> are merely exemplary means for permitting the plug <b>12</b> to be coupled to the socket <b>14</b> in the above-noted specified orientation.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the center post <b>50</b> described above may be used as an indexable feature for the purpose of ensuring proper spacing and leveling of the feed-through pins <b>42</b>, e.g., prior to melting the stem <b>46</b> and sealing the feed-through pins <b>42</b> there within. To facilitate installation, for instance, the stem <b>46</b> may be leveled using a pin fixture <b>65</b> that indexes or aligns the stem <b>46</b> in the same orientation every time. As the center post <b>50</b> is also used for alignment at later stages of manufacturing, including final seal, the stem <b>46</b> should maintain a straight axial alignment. Such alignment is enabled by the representative pin fixture <b>65</b>, e.g., a solid planar base <b>66</b> connected to or integrally formed with an axially-extending fixture post <b>68</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In operation, an operator may axially insert the individual feed-through pins <b>42</b> forming the plug <b>12</b> through the stem <b>46</b> at a fixed position relative to each other, and into mating openings <b>156</b> of the pin fixture, in this instance of the fixture post <b>68</b>, with the fixture post <b>68</b> ultimately entering the plug concavity <b>44</b>. The fixture is designed to hold the feed-through pins <b>42</b> in place while the stem <b>46</b> is being sealed, so the fixture will have the same number of openings <b>156</b> as feed-through pins <b>42</b>. A radial surface <b>69</b> of the annular flange <b>45</b> thereafter rests securely on the base <b>66</b> as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>. The cathode assembly <b>28</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> (also see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) is then electrically connected to free ends E<b>1</b> of the pass-through pins <b>42</b> extending from the stem <b>46</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. This fixturing and leveling approach may be contrasted with conventional approaches in which the stem <b>46</b> is leveled off at the radial surface <b>69</b> of the glass flare piece <b>40</b>, which is rarely if ever perfectly flat. As a result, the cathode head <b>36</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) can sometimes appear to be slightly crooked, which can create misshapen focal spots.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary method <b>100</b> for constructing the vacuum tube insert assembly <b>10</b> for a vacuum tube, e.g., an x-ray tube, as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>10</b></figref>. A possible embodiment of the method <b>100</b> commences at block B<b>102</b>, which includes providing a flared insert piece <b>44</b> having an annular flange <b>45</b> surrounding a plug concavity <b>44</b>, and a stem <b>46</b> integrally formed with the annular flange <b>45</b> and extending axially therefrom, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. The method <b>100</b> then proceeds to block B<b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Block B<b>104</b> entails axially inserting a plurality of feed-through pins <b>42</b> through the stem <b>46</b> at a fixed position relative to each other, such that the feed-through pins <b>42</b> are collectively arranged within the plug concavity <b>44</b> as the plug <b>12</b>. In some implementations of the method <b>100</b>, this may include inserting the feed-through pins <b>42</b> into the openings <b>156</b> in the pin fixture <b>65</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>), with the pin fixture <b>65</b> having fixed spacing between the openings <b>156</b>. Thereafter, the feed-through pins <b>42</b> may be pressed through the stem <b>56</b>, e.g., using a pinch press. Use of the pin fixture <b>65</b> therefore has the advantage of maintaining the plane of the annular flange <b>45</b> in a perpendicular orientation relative to the center post <b>50</b>. The method <b>100</b> then proceeds to block B<b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Block B<b>106</b> includes sealing the stem <b>46</b> to the feed-through pins <b>42</b> such that the stem <b>46</b> is vacuum-sealed to the feed-through pins <b>42</b>, thereby forming the plug <b>12</b>.Sealing may entail using a glass lathe and/or a press to form the partially molten or viscous heat-softened glass of the stem <b>46</b>, possibly while the flared insert piece <b>40</b> is oriented, leveled, and retained in the pin fixture <b>65</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> or a similar fixture. The stem <b>46</b> is thus vacuum-sealed to the feed-through pins <b>42</b>, with the feed-through pins <b>42</b> extending through the surrounding glass of the stem <b>46</b> without any vacuum-compromising intervening space therebetween. The method <b>100</b> then proceeds to block B<b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Block B<b>108</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> may include connecting the feed-through pins <b>42</b> to corresponding connections of the cathode head <b>36</b> and then setting the filament(s) <b>39</b> therewithin. As noted above, the feed-through pins <b>42</b> are integrally formed with heat-softened glass materials of the stem <b>46</b> such that all potentially vacuum-depleting leakage paths are sealed. The method <b>100</b> proceeds to block B<b>110</b> once the cathode assembly <b>28</b> has been connected in this manner.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">At block B<b>110</b>, the method <b>100</b> includes completing construction of the vacuum tube insert assembly <b>10</b>. This may entail installing the remaining components of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in the non-limiting example construction of an x-ray tube insert. For instance, the anode assembly <b>26</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> may be screwed directly into the neck <b>33</b> and an anode shank (not shown), while the cathode assembly <b>28</b> is chucked onto the center post <b>50</b>. Because the stem <b>46</b> was leveled off of the center post <b>50</b> using the pin fixture <b>65</b>, this cathode head <b>36</b> is straight during sealing. As part of this effort, the flared insert piece <b>40</b> is connected to the glass envelope <b>24</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> to thereby encapsulate the cathode assembly <b>28</b> and the remaining components of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> within the defined volume <b>25</b> of the glass envelope <b>24</b>. The glass envelope <b>24</b> may be evacuated forming the vacuum.
