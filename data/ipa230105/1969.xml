The plate <b>12</b> is configured to be positioned on a surface beneath a load <b>18</b> so that the rod <b>16</b> extends upwardly from the surface. A user is positioned to grasp and to pull the rod <b>16</b>, proximate to an upper end <b>20</b> of the rod <b>16</b>. The plate <b>12</b> may be substantially perpendicular to the rod <b>16</b>, although the present invention anticipates the plate <b>12</b> being transverse to the rod <b>16</b>. The plate <b>12</b> may be substantially rectangularly shaped, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, or alternatively shaped. For example, a leading edge <b>72</b> of the plate <b>12</b> distal from the rod <b>16</b> may be arcuate to facilitate positioning of the plate <b>12</b> between the surface and the load <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">A rearward frame <b>24</b> is engaged to and extends from the rod <b>16</b> proximate to the lower end <b>14</b> so that the rearward frame <b>24</b> is opposingly positioned on the rod <b>16</b> relative to the plate <b>12</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>. An axle <b>22</b> is rotationally engaged to the rearward frame <b>24</b> so that the axle <b>22</b> is perpendicular to the rod <b>16</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. A pair of wheels <b>26</b> is engaged singly to opposed ends <b>28</b> of the axle <b>22</b> so that a lower limit <b>30</b> of the pair of wheels <b>26</b> is coplanar with the plate <b>12</b>. The wheels <b>26</b> comprise metal and thus are rigid to support a heavy load <b>18</b>. The wheels <b>26</b> may comprise steel. The load <b>18</b> is lifted from the surface by pulling on the rod <b>16</b> to pivot the plate <b>12</b> around the axle <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The present invention is anticipated to be beneficial in lifting and moving heavy loads <b>18</b>, such as rolls of roofing material. The rod <b>16</b> is of sufficient length to provide leverage for lifting heavy loads <b>18</b> from the surface, for example 1.25 to 1.75 meters in length.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The rearward frame <b>24</b> comprises a tube <b>32</b>, a pair of upper bars <b>34</b>, and a pair of lower bars <b>36</b>. The axle <b>22</b> is positioned in the tube <b>32</b> so that the tube <b>32</b> is configured to allow positioning of a foot of the user. The user is positioned to lean away from the rod <b>16</b>, providing leverage to the user in pivoting the plate <b>12</b> around the axle <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Each of the upper bars <b>34</b> is engaged to and extends transversely between the rod <b>16</b> and the tube <b>32</b>.

Each of the lower bars <b>36</b> is engaged to and extends transversely between the lower end <b>14</b> of the rod <b>16</b> and the tube <b>32</b> so that the rearward frame <b>24</b> is substantially diamond shaped when viewed from a rear face <b>38</b> of the rod <b>16</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">A handle <b>40</b> may be engaged to the rod <b>16</b> proximate to the upper end <b>20</b> of the rod <b>16</b>. The handle <b>40</b> and the rod <b>16</b> are configured to be grasped in first and second hands of the user. The user is positioned to pull on the handle <b>40</b> and the rod <b>16</b> to pivot the plate <b>12</b> around the axle <b>22</b>, while also potentially positioning a foot on the tube <b>32</b> and leaning away from the rod <b>16</b> for additional leverage. The handle <b>40</b> also is helpful in turning the hand truck assembly <b>10</b> with the load <b>18</b> positioned on the plate <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The handle <b>40</b> comprises a first segment <b>42</b> and a second segment <b>44</b>. The first segment <b>42</b> extends laterally and substantially perpendicularly from the rod <b>16</b>. The second segment <b>44</b> extends substantially perpendicularly from the first segment <b>42</b> distal from the rod <b>16</b> and toward the plate <b>12</b>. Other configurations of the handle <b>40</b> are anticipated by the present invention, such as, but not limited to, one or more hand grips, bars extending bilaterally from the rod <b>16</b>, and the like.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">A forward frame <b>46</b> is engaged to and extends transversely between the plate <b>12</b> and the rod <b>16</b>. The forward frame <b>46</b> is positioned to brace the plate <b>12</b> and the rod <b>16</b>. The forward frame <b>46</b> is configured to stabilize the load <b>18</b> upon the plate <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The forward frame <b>46</b> may comprise an upper member <b>48</b> and a pair of side members <b>50</b>. The upper member <b>48</b> is engaged to the rod <b>16</b> above the lower end <b>14</b> and extends bilaterally from the rod <b>16</b>. Each side member <b>50</b> is engaged to and extends between a respective opposing end <b>52</b> of the upper member <b>48</b> and the plate <b>12</b>. The forward frame <b>46</b> is substantially inverted trapezoid shaped when viewed from a front face <b>54</b> of the rod <b>16</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The present invention anticipates other configurations of the forward frame <b>46</b>, for example, solid or meshed plates, additional elements extending between the side members <b>50</b>, and the like.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In use, the hand truck assembly <b>10</b> enables a method <b>56</b> of lifting and transporting a load <b>18</b>. The method <b>56</b> comprises a first step <b>58</b> of providing a hand truck assembly <b>10</b> according to the specification above. A second step <b>60</b> of the method <b>56</b> is positioning the plate <b>12</b> on a surface proximate to a load <b>18</b> so that the rod <b>16</b> extends upwardly from the surface. A third step <b>62</b> of the method <b>56</b> entails rolling, or otherwise maneuvering, the load <b>18</b> onto the plate <b>12</b>. A fourth step <b>64</b> of the method <b>56</b> is grasping and pulling the rod <b>16</b>, proximate to an upper end <b>20</b> of the rod <b>16</b>, to pivot the plate <b>12</b> around the axle <b>22</b> so that the load <b>18</b> is lifted from the surface. A fifth step <b>66</b> of the method <b>56</b> is locomoting the hand truck assembly <b>10</b> and the load <b>18</b> upon the wheels <b>26</b> to a desired location. A sixth step <b>68</b> of the method <b>56</b> is lowering the plate <b>12</b> back to the surface. A seventh step <b>70</b> of the method <b>56</b> is removing the load <b>18</b> from the plate <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">With respect to the above description then, it is to be realized that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of an embodiment enabled by the disclosure, to include variations in size, materials, shape, form, function and manner of operation, assembly and use, are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art, and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by an embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Therefore, the foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the disclosure.
