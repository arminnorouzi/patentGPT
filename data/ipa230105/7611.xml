But scenario when the UE is registered to a PLMN via two access network types simultaneously, then the single AMF is chosen for both access network type. In this scenario, the network assigns some common NAS parameters (temporary mobile identity, security parameters, etc) to the UE for both access network types.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0000">When a UE has registered to 5GC (AMF) via both non-3GPP access network and 3GPP access network at the same time, the UE maintains two independent 5GMM registration status and 5GMM contexts one for 3GPP access network and another for non-3GPP access. When the registered PLMNs for 3GPP access network and non-3GPP access network are same then the UE is connected to the same AMF. In this scenario the 5GC (AMF) assigns same NAS parameters e.g. UE temporary identity (5G-GUTI) and ngKSI to both 5GMM context for 3GPP access network and non-3GPP access network.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0004">Problem Statement 1:</p><p id="p-0007" num="0005">When the UE has registered to a PLMN via one access network type (e.g. non-3GPP access network) and thereafter an initial registration procedure via another access network type (e.g. 3GPP access network) may be failed. In detail, a failure of the initial registration procedure can occur in case there is no response from the network to the UE after maximum number of transmission of registration request message from the UE. In this failure situation, the UE behavior is not clear whether the UE temporary identity and ngKSI are deleted from both 3GPP 5GMM context and non-3GPP 5GMM context or deleted from the 5GMM context of the access network type (3GPP access network here) where the registration procedure failed over the another access network. In case the UE deletes common parameters (e.g. temporary identity and ngKSI) for both 3GPP 5GMM context and non-3GPP 5GMM context due to the registration procedure failure in one access network type, some features with the other access network type will stop working. This can be considered as a serious service degradation.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0006">Problem Statement 2:</p><p id="p-0009" num="0007">When the UE has registered to a PLMN via both a first access network type and a second access network type, the UE initiates a NAS procedure to perform mobility update procedure or periodic update procedure over one access network type. And then, the network updates a temporary parameter (e.g. 5G-GUTI) with new value by including the parameters in a NAS message sent to the UE during the current NAS procedure, then the network will wait for an another NAS message in response of the NAS message containing the temporary parameter. In this scenario, the network behavior is not clear whether the network will keep and treat the new value to the parameter as valid or the old value of the parameter. In other scenario when the network initiates a procedure to update a temporary parameter (e.g. 5G-GUTI) which is common to both the first access network type and the second access network type by sending a NAS message to UE and the network does not receive the NAS message response from the UE after certain number of retries by re-sending the NAS message to UE. In this scenario, the network behavior is not clear whether the network will use the old or the new value after certain number of retry. In case the network uses only the new value of temporary parameter (i.e. 5G-GUTI) when the network pages the UE, the paging procedure may fail since the UE may use the old value of temporary parameter (i.e. 5G-GUTI). Due to the mismatch between the UE and the network, the UE cannot be reached from the network. This can be considered as a serious service degradation.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0008">The <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates the architecture that this failure situation occurs.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0009">A method of a user equipment performing a registration procedure with a same Access and mobility Management Function (AMF) via both a 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) access and a non-3GPP access according to a first exemplary aspect of the present disclosure includes initiating the registration procedure with the AMF via one access network among the 3GPP access and the non-3GPP access, in a case where the user equipment has already been registered with the AMF via another access network that is different from the one access network, starting a timer T3510 when the registration procedure via the one access network is initiated, and counting a number of times of registration attempt via the one access network based on expiry of the timer T3510, wherein the user equipment is capable of keeping a 5G-Globally Unique Temporary Identity (5G-GUTI) that has been assigned for the another access network, even if the number of times of the registration attempt via the one access network is equal to a predetermined number, wherein the 5G-GUTI is common to both the 3GPP access and the non-3GPP access.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0010">A user equipment performing a registration procedure with a same Access and mobility Management Function (AMF) via both a 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) access and a non-3GPP access according to a second exemplary aspect of the present disclosure includes a transceiver and a processor configured to initiate the registration procedure with the AMF via one access network among the 3GPP access and the non-3GPP access, in a case where the user equipment has already been registered with the AMF via another access network that is different from the one access network, start a timer T3510 when the registration procedure via the one access network is initiated, and count a number of times of registration attempt via the one access network based on expiry of the timer T3510, wherein the user equipment is capable of keeping a 5G-Globally Unique Temporary Identity (5G-GUTI) that has been assigned for the another access network, even if the number of times of the registration attempt via the one access network is equal to a predetermined number, wherein the 5G-GUTI is common to both the 3GPP access and the non-3GPP access.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0007" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows Non-roaming architecture for 5G Core Network with non-3GPP access.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows Registration procedure over 3GPP Access and non-3GPP access connected to same AMF.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> Registration procedure over 3GPP Access and non-3GPP access connected to same AMF.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> Registration procedure over 3GPP Access and non-3GPP access connected to same AMF.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a bock diagram for UE.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a bock diagram for (R)AN node.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a bock diagram for AMF.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0008" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0018">For the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in 3GPP TR 21.905, 3GPP TS 23.501, 3GPP TS 24.501, 3GPP TS 33.800 and the following apply.
