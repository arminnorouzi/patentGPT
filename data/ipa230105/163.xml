More specifically, the invention is directed towards an aerosol generating device comprising an air flow channeling assembly with non-linear air flow channels.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Aerosol generating devices commonly employed for generating an aerosol from an aerosol generating substrate usually employ either conduction heating, convection heating or a combination of both. Furthermore, an aerosol generating device commonly comprises a chamber for receiving an aerosol generating substrate and a means for delivering air flow to the chamber. For heating both the chamber as well as the air delivered to the chamber, some configurations employ a heating unit for heating the chamber, and another heating unit for heating the means for delivering air, so that heated air is delivered to the chamber. However, since aerosol generating devices ideally need to be small enough to be hand-portable, the heating performance of aerosol generating devices for heating air delivered to the chamber is usually poor. This is because the residence time of air within the heated means for delivering air to the chamber is short since the size requirements lead to short travel distances of air within or through the heated means for delivering air and thus results in limited heat transfer to the air. Furthermore, employing two heating units makes the manufacture and design of the aerosol generating device more complicated and costly and further leads to increased size requirements of the device.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is therefore an objective of the present invention to provide an aerosol generating device that allows air that is delivered to the chamber of the device to be effectively heated in a simple, space-saving and cost-efficient manner.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The above objective is solved by the invention as defined by the features of the independent claims. Preferred embodiments of the invention are defined by the sub-features of the dependent claims.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a first aspect, the invention provides an aerosol generating device comprising a chamber configured to receive and supply heated air to an aerosol generating substrate, an air flow channeling assembly configured to deliver outside air into the chamber comprising a plurality of nonlinear air flow channels, wherein each air flow channel extends along a side wall of the chamber from an inlet opened toward the outside of the device to an outlet for discharging the delivered air to the chamber, and a heating unit configured to apply heat to the air flow channels. A first advantage of this aspect is that by having air flow channels that are non-linear, the residence time of air inside the air flow channels is increased in comparison to linear air flow channels, resulting in increased heating of the air. As yet another advantage, by providing a plurality of air flow channels, the overall air flow rate can be increased without the need to enlarge an individual channel, and the heating performance or an air flow rate may, respectively, be easily adjusted by either increasing the non-linearity of the air flow channels or by changing the number of air flow channels. Finally, the plurality of air flow channels themselves can effectively be a layer of insulation, so that they remove heat travelling outward of the device, and less insulation may be required.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a first preferred embodiment, according to the first aspect of the invention, the plurality of nonlinear air flow channels is formed by a plurality of tubes. Forming the air flow channels from tubes is cost efficient and allows the air flow channels to be easily formed and configured.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a second preferred embodiment, according to the preceding embodiment of the invention, the plurality of tubes is arranged as an n-tuple helix, with the number n matching the number of tubes. Arranging the plurality of air flow channels in helical fashion in an n-tuple helix ensures homogenous properties for each of the tubes and affords a geometrically efficient arrangement of the plurality of tubes.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a third preferred embodiment, according to the preceding embodiment of the invention, the n-tuple helix comprises at least two congruent helices.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a fourth preferred embodiment, according to any one of the second or third preferred embodiment of the invention, the windings within each of the plurality of helices are evenly spaced apart in the direction of the winding axis of the n-tuple helix and/or the distance in the direction of the winding axis of the n-tuple helix between a winding of one of the helices and a neighboring winding of another of the helices is at most 2 mm, preferably at most 1 mm, more preferably at most 0.5 mm, and most preferably substantially o. Evenly spacing the helices apart provides homogeneous heating to the air flow channels and prevents thermal hotspots if, for example, a first helix is arranged too close to a second helix. Having only a very small distance between the neighboring windings of the different helices, or substantially no gap between the windings, provides a tight insulation layer with all the heat traveling outward picked up by the helices.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a fifth preferred embodiment, according to any one of the preceding embodiments of the invention, the number of air flow channels is two. It has been found that having two non-linear air flow channels presents a balanced compromise between heating performance and air flow rate within the geometric constraints of typical aerosol generating devices.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a sixth preferred embodiment, according to any one of the preceding embodiments of the invention, an outside wall of the aerosol generating device and/or the side wall of the chamber do not form part of the confining physical boundary of the air flow channel within the aerosol generating device. This reduces manufacturing complexity and increases manufacturing flexibility as the chamber and/or housing can be independently configured and manufactured from the air flow channels.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a seventh preferred embodiment, according to any one of the preceding embodiments of the invention, the air flow channel is formed by a thermally conductive material. This is advantageous because a thermally conductive material better transfers heat from the heating unit to the air in the air flow channels, thus increasing the heating performance.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In an eighth preferred embodiment, according to the preceding embodiment of the invention, the thermally conductive material comprises material with a thermal conductivity equal or larger than 100</p><p id="p-0015" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mfrac>   <mi>W</mi>   <mrow>    <mi>m</mi>    <mo>&#xb7;</mo>    <mi>K</mi>   </mrow>  </mfrac>  <mo>,</mo> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0016" num="0000">preferably 150</p><p id="p-0017" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00002" num="00002"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mfrac>   <mi>W</mi>   <mrow>    <mi>m</mi>    <mo>&#xb7;</mo>    <mi>K</mi>   </mrow>  </mfrac>  <mo>,</mo> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0018" num="0000">more preferably 200</p><p id="p-0019" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00003" num="00003"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mfrac>   <mi>W</mi>   <mrow>    <mi>m</mi>    <mo>&#xb7;</mo>    <mi>K</mi>   </mrow>  </mfrac>  <mo>,</mo> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0020" num="0000">even more preferably 250</p><p id="p-0021" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00004" num="00004"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mfrac>   <mi>W</mi>   <mrow>    <mi>m</mi>    <mo>&#xb7;</mo>    <mi>K</mi>   </mrow>  </mfrac>  <mo>,</mo> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0022" num="0000">even more preferably 300</p><p id="p-0023" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00005" num="00005"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mfrac>   <mi>W</mi>   <mrow>    <mi>m</mi>    <mo>&#xb7;</mo>    <mi>K</mi>   </mrow>  </mfrac>  <mo>,</mo> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0024" num="0000">even more preferably 350</p><p id="p-0025" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00006" num="00006"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mfrac>   <mi>W</mi>   <mrow>    <mi>m</mi>    <mo>&#xb7;</mo>    <mi>K</mi>   </mrow>  </mfrac>  <mo>,</mo> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0026" num="0000">most preferably larger than 400</p><p id="p-0027" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00007" num="00007"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mfrac>   <mi>W</mi>   <mrow>    <mi>m</mi>    <mo>&#xb7;</mo>    <mi>K</mi>   </mrow>  </mfrac>  <mo>,</mo>  <mo>.</mo> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0028" num="0000">thermal conductivity, the better the heating performance.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0014">In a ninth preferred embodiment, according to any one of the seventh or eighth preferred embodiment of the invention, the thermally conductive material is or comprises copper, aluminum, copper-nickel, stainless steel, Hastelloy, Inconel and/or titanium. These materials are advantageous because they are thermally conductive as well as durable and suitable for being heated.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0015">In a tenth preferred embodiment, according to any one of the preceding embodiments of the invention, the aerosol generating device comprises a heating unit configured to heat the side wall of the chamber, the heating unit configured to heat the side wall of the chamber preferably being the heating unit configured to apply heat to the air flow channels. By heating the side wall of the chamber, in additional to air, an aerosol generating substrate at least partially received in the chamber may also be heated for generating aerosol. By combining the heating units into a single heating unit, manufacturing costs and complexity as well as the overall size of the aerosol generating device may be reduced.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0016">In an eleventh preferred embodiment, according to the preceding embodiment of the invention, the heating unit configured to heat the side wall is disposed on at least parts of the side wall of the chamber.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0017">In a twelfth preferred embodiment, according to the preceding embodiment of the invention, the heating unit configured to heat the side wall is disposed between the side wall of the chamber and the plurality of air flow channels. This is advantageous because it allows both the chamber and the air flow channels to be more homogeneously heated and to be heated at the same time.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0018">In a thirteenth preferred embodiment, according to any one of the tenth to the twelfth preferred embodiment of the invention, the plurality of air flow channels is arranged to at least partially adjoin the heating unit configured to heat the side wall and/or the heating unit configured to apply heat to the air flow channels. Such a configuration increases the heat transfer between the heating unit and the air flow channels, thus improving the heating performance.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0019">In a fourteenth preferred embodiment, according to any one of the tenth to the thirteenth preferred embodiment of the invention, the heating unit configured to heat the side wall and/or the heating unit configured to apply heat to the air flow channels is or comprises a film heater. A film heater is advantageous because it can conform to the sidewall of the chamber, thus ensuring improved heating efficiency and performance. Furthermore, a film heater may be provided with minimal space requirements.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0020">In a fifteenth preferred embodiment, according to the preceding embodiment of the invention, the film heater comprises a resin, the resin comprising polyimide, silicone and/or PEEK.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0021">In a sixteenth preferred embodiment, according to the preceding embodiment of the invention, the chamber has a substantially cylindrical shape comprising an opening configured to allow the aerosol generating substrate to be at least partially or fully inserted into the chamber.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0022">In a seventeenth preferred embodiment, according to any one of the preceding embodiments of the invention, the positions of the air inlets and/or air outlets of the plurality of air flow channels are, respectively, in the same plane, substantially perpendicular to the central axis of the chamber.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0023">In an eighteenth preferred embodiment, according to any one of the preceding embodiments of the invention, the air inlets and/or air outlets of the plurality of air flow channels are, respectively, arranged with a difference of substantially 360&#xb0; divided by the number n of air flow channels, in a rotation angle around the central axis of the chamber to each other.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0024">In a nineteenth preferred embodiment, according to any one of the preceding embodiments, the chamber comprises an opening at the bottom of the chamber that is in communication with each of the plurality of air outlets.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0025">In a twentieth preferred embodiment, according to any one of the preceding embodiments of the invention, the aerosol generating device comprises a diffusing element arranged at the air outlets such that air exiting the air outlets passes through the diffuser. The diffusing element is advantageous because by diffusing heated air discharged from the air outlets, the heated air is spatially distributed, resulting in a more homogeneous heating of the chamber and/or of any aerosol generating substrate at least partially received in the chamber.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0026">In a twenty-first preferred embodiment, according to the preceding embodiment of the invention, the diffusing element comprises a porous material. This is advantageous because a porous material is effective in diffusing air.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0027">In a twenty-second preferred embodiment, according to the preceding embodiment of the invention, the porous material comprises porous ceramic, porous resin, porous glass and/or porous metal.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0028">In a twenty-third preferred embodiment, according to any one of the preceding embodiments of the invention, the aerosol generating device comprises a heat insulating member configured to at least partially surround the airflow channeling assembly. The insulating member improves thermal insulation of the aerosol generating device, in particular with regards to the heat emitted from the heating unit and serves to reduce heat transfer to the outside of the aerosol generating device or to a user using the aerosol generating device.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0029">In a twenty-fourth preferred embodiment, according to the preceding embodiment of the invention, the heat insulating member has a cylindrical shape and is substantially concentric with the chamber.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0030">In a twenty-fifth preferred embodiment, according to any one of the twenty-third or twenty-fourth preferred embodiment of the invention, the air flow channeling assembly is at least partially embedded in the heat insulating member.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0031">In a twenty-sixth preferred embodiment, according to any one of the preceding embodiments of the invention, the total inner volume of the one or more heat conductive tubes is in a range of 55&#xb1;25 ml, more preferably 55&#xb1;20 ml, even more preferably 55&#xb1;15 ml, even more preferably 55&#xb1;10 ml, even more preferably 55&#xb1;5 ml, and most preferably 55&#xb1;1 ml. Having a volume in a range around 55 ml is advantageous because a single aerosol puff on average contains a volume of about 55 ml. This allows almost all of the air inhaled during one puff to be heated.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0032">In a twenty-seventh preferred embodiment, according to any one of the preceding embodiments of the invention, at least 50%, preferably 60%, more preferably 70%, even more preferably 80%, even more preferably 90%, most preferably 100% of the length of the non-linear air flow channels extends along the side wall. This is advantageous because the larger the portion of the length of the non-linear air flow channel that extends along the length of the chamber, the more optimised the use of space inside the aerosol generating device for accommodating the plurality of non-linear air flow channels. As an additional result, the thermal insulation of the heating chamber to the outside of the aerosol generating device by the non-linear air flow channels is increased.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0048" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a schematic cross-sectional view of an aerosol generating device according to embodiments of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0049" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B and <b>2</b>C</figref> illustrate a schematic perspective view, side view and top view, respectively, of a chamber with a heating unit and non-linear air flow channels of an aerosol generating device according to embodiments of the present invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0050" num="0035">Preferred embodiments of the present invention are described hereinafter and in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0036">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an aerosol generating device <b>100</b> comprises a housing <b>110</b>.
