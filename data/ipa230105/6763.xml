This phenomenon is more common in the high-frequency band or millimeter band. However, currently, signals related to some communication nodes (for example, base stations) are often directly transmitted. For example, a base station directly transmits a signal to a terminal, which results in relatively poor reliability of signal transmission of a communication node.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Embodiments of the present disclosure provide a signal transmission method, an information sending method, and a communication node, to resolve the problem of relatively poor reliability of signal transmission caused by the fact that a signal related to a communication node is often directly transmitted.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to a first aspect, an embodiment of the present disclosure provides a signal transmission method, applicable to a first node, and including:</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">obtaining first information, where the first information is used for indicating a transmission mode of the first node or a second node;</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">transmitting a signal related to the second node according to the transmission mode corresponding to the first information, where</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">the first node is a Large Intelligent Surfaces (LIS) node or a hypersurface node or an intelligent emitting surface node, and the second node is an upper-level first node or a base station;

A signal transmission method, an information sending method, and a communication node provided in the embodiments of the present disclosure are applicable to a wireless communications system. The wireless communications system may be a New Radio (NR) system, or other systems such as an Evolved Long Term Evolution (eLTE) system or a Long Term Evolution (LTE) system, or a subsequent evolved communications system. Further, the signal transmission method, an information sending method, and a communication node provided in the embodiments of the present disclosure are applicable to an unlicensed band in the wireless communications system.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a structural diagram of a network system to which an embodiment of the present disclosure is applicable. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the network system includes a terminal <b>11</b>, a first node <b>12</b>, and a second node <b>13</b>. The terminal <b>11</b> may be User Equipment (UE), or another terminal-side device such as a mobile phone, a tablet personal computer, a laptop computer, a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), a Mobile Internet Device (MID), a wearable device, or a robot. It is to be noted that the specific type of the terminal <b>11</b> is not limited in the embodiments of the present disclosure. The first node <b>12</b> may be an LIS node or a hypersurface node or an intelligent emitting surface node. The second node <b>13</b> may be an upper-level first node or a base station of the first node <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In this embodiment of the present disclosure, the terminal <b>11</b> may communicate with the second node <b>13</b> through the first node <b>12</b>. For example, the first node <b>12</b> may transmit a signal sent by the terminal <b>11</b> to the second node <b>13</b>, and may also transmit a signal sent by the second node <b>13</b> to the terminal <b>11</b>. When the first node <b>12</b> transmits a signal, the signal may be directly forwarded, transparently forwarded, amplified and forwarded, or modulated and sent, or the like. This is not limited. In this embodiment of the present disclosure, in some scenarios, the terminal <b>11</b> may directly communicate with the second node <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Moreover, in this embodiment of the present disclosure, the LIS node or hypersurface node or intelligent emitting surface node is an emerging artificial material device. The LIS node or hypersurface node or intelligent emitting surface node may dynamically/semi-statically adjust its own electromagnetic properties, affecting a reflection/refraction behavior of electromagnetic waves that enter the node. In addition, the LIS node or hypersurface node or intelligent emitting surface node may manipulate a reflected wave/refracted signal of an electromagnetic signal to implement functions such as beam scanning/beamforming.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a flowchart of a signal transmission method according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. The method is applicable to a first node. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the method includes the following steps.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Step <b>201</b>. Obtain first information, where the first information is used for indicating a transmission mode of the first node or a second node.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The obtaining first information may be receiving the first information sent by the second node. In addition, the first information may be transmitted between nodes through a radio interface or a type of wired interface.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The first node is an LIS node or a hypersurface node or an intelligent emitting surface node, and the second node is an upper-level first node or a base station.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The upper-level first node may be the upper-level first node of the signal transmitted by the first node. For example, for an uplink signal, the upper-level first node is an LIS node or a hypersurface node or an intelligent emitting surface node that transmits the uplink signal to the first node. For a downlink signal, the upper-level first node is an LIS node or a hypersurface node or an intelligent emitting surface node that transmits the downlink signal to the first node.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The LIS (or the hypersurface node or the intelligent emitting surface node) includes an artificial surface at a front end and a control module at a back end. The artificial surface at the front end includes artificial device units that are densely arranged. Device characteristics of a device unit are affected by a control signal/bias voltage of the device. Different control signals/bias voltages correspond to different device characteristics such as reflection coefficients/refraction coefficients. Changes in reflection coefficients/refraction coefficients affect a phase and/or intensity of the reflected signal/refracted signal. Microscopically, each device unit produces an independent reflected signal/refracted signal, and macroscopically, these signals are superimposed together to implement manipulation of electromagnetic waves. The control signal/bias voltage is provided by the control module at the back end.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">If the first node or the second node is an LIS node, the transmission mode indicated by the first information may correspond to one or several sets of reflection coefficients/refraction coefficients, or correspond to one or several sets of configurations of the control signal/bias voltage, or LIS forwarding signals corresponding to different transmission modes have different beams.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">If the first node or the second node is a base station, the transmission mode indicated by the first information may correspond to one or several sets of configurations of reference signals or synchronization signals, or signals corresponding to different transmission modes have different beams.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Further, the transmission mode adopted in information transmission may be determined according to the first information, that is, information is transmitted according to the transmission mode corresponding to the first information. For example, transmission is directly performed according to the transmission mode of the first node indicated by the first information, or the transmission mode of the first node is determined and the transmission is performed according to the transmission mode of the second node indicated by the first information.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Step <b>202</b>. Transmit a signal related to the second node according to the transmission mode corresponding to the first information, where</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">the transmission mode corresponding to the first information may be the transmission mode of the first node indicated by the first information. In some embodiments, the transmission mode indicated by the first information is directly adopted in a case that the first information indicates the transmission mode of the first node.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In some embodiments, the transmission mode corresponding to the first information may be: determining the transmission mode of the first node according to the transmission mode of the second node indicated by the first information. In some embodiments, in a case that the first information indicates the transmission mode of the second node, the transmission mode of the first node is determined according to the transmission mode of the second node, where a mapping relationship between the transmission mode of the second node and the transmission mode of the first node may be pre-configured or predefined in a protocol, or the like. The mapping relationship is transmitted between the first node and the second node.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In this embodiment of the present disclosure, &#x201c;Inoperative&#x201d; is also a transmission mode, such as an inoperative transmission mode.
