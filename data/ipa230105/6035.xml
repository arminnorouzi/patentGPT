If the super junction structure is used to replace an N-type drift region in a vertical double-diffused metal-oxide-semiconductor (VDMOS) device by providing a conduction path in the on-state (only the N-type column provides the path, and the P-type column does not provide the path) and withstanding the reverse bias voltage in the off-state (the PN column withstands the voltage), a super junction metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) may be formed. The super junction MOSFET can greatly reduce the on-resistance of the device by using a low-resistivity epitaxial layer under the condition that the reverse breakdown voltage is the same as that of the conventional VDMOS device.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A method for mass production of super junctions may be implemented by forming a trench in an N-type epitaxial layer and filling the trench with a P-type epitaxial layer so as to form PN columns arranged alternately.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For manufacturing a device with a higher reverse bias breakdown voltage or a device with a lower specific on-resistance, a smaller pitch of the PN column or an increase in the P-N depth of the device is required. In the process of filling the trench with the P-type epitaxial layer, the above requirements both cause the following problems. Firstly, the excessively large depth-width ratio of the P-type trench causes a problem in the etching of the trench; in particular, after the etching, the etching residue at the bottom of the trench cannot be fully removed, thereby causing a device failure. Secondly, the excessively large depth-width ratio of the P-type trench causes difficulty in epitaxial filling of the device, resulting in epitaxial voids or excessively long epitaxial filling time which increases the manufacturing cost. Therefore, in these cases, one method is to form the P-type column in a plurality of or two steps, wherein the height-width ratio of the P-type column is reduced in each step, so that the etching, cleaning, and filling processes of the trench can be realized with a cost advantage.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the existing technical solution, a high-concentration substrate (for example, the resistivity thereof is 0.001-0.003 &#x3a9;&#xb7;cm, or even lower for reducing Rdson) is generally adopted, the resistivity of which is lower than the resistivity of the N-type epitaxial layer deposited thereon, i.e., 0.5-5 &#x3a9;&#xb7;cm, by 2 orders of magnitude. Therefore, during the process, the uniformity of the device performance is affected due to substrate impurity outdiffusion. In order to reduce the outdiffusion, the backside of the high-concentration substrate needs to be protected by an oxide film and a polysilicon film, thereby increasing the cost. In addition, since the edge portion of the wafer of the high-concentration substrate (assuming that the backside is protected) may be exposed during the process, special management is required during processes such as cleaning. For example, the high-concentration substrate is only adopted before change of a cleaning solution, which reduces the production efficiency; or after the high-concentration substrate is cleaned, the solution is changed immediately for other processes, which increases the cost.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The technical problem to be solved by the present application is to provide a super junction device, so as to eliminate the adverse effect of impurity outdiffusion of a high-concentration substrate on the super junction structure, so that the super junction structure can realize an ultra-low specific on-resistance structure and good ohmic contact can be formed on the backside.
