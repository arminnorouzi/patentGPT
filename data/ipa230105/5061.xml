More specifically, the present invention is directed to tools for chart-based order entry in an electronic trading environment.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Electronic trading is generally based on a host exchange, one or more computer networks, and client devices. Subscribing traders are connected to an exchange's electronic trading platform by way of communication links and through an application program interface to facilitate real-time electronic messaging between themselves and the exchanges. The electronic trading platform includes at least one electronic market, which is at the center of the trading system and handles the matching of bids and offers placed by the traders for that market. The electronic messaging includes market information that is distributed from the electronic market to the traders via an electronic data feed. Once the traders receive the market information, it may be displayed to them on their trading screens. Upon viewing the information, traders can take certain actions including the actions of sending buy or sell orders to the electronic market, adjusting existing orders, deleting orders, or otherwise managing orders. Traders may also use software tools on their client devices to automate these and additional actions.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Although the types of market information published by an electronic exchange may differ from market to market, there are generally some standard pieces of information. Market information may include data that represents just the inside market. The inside market is the lowest available ask price (best ask) and the highest available bid price (best bid) in the market for a particular tradeable object at a particular point in time. Market information may also include market depth. Market depth refers to quantities available at the inside market and may also refer to quantities available at other prices away from the inside market. The quantity available at a given price level is usually provided by the exchange in aggregate sums. In other words, an exchange usually provides the total buy quantity and the total sell quantity available in the market at a particular price level in its data feed. In addition to providing order book information, such as price and quantity information, electronic exchanges can offer other types of market information such as the open price, settlement price, net change, volume, last traded price, the last traded quantity, and order fill information.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The extent of market depth available for a trader usually depends on the exchange. For instance, some exchanges provide market depth for all (or most) price levels, and others may provide no market depth at all. Electronic exchanges may also limit the market depth offered as market information can become intensive for network and client devices to process. For instance, an electronic market might offer only five levels of market depth, which includes the quantities available at the current top five buy prices and the quantities available at the current top five sell prices.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">To profit in electronic markets, market participants must be able to assimilate large amounts of data to recognize market trends and to view current market conditions. Traders often use charts to analyze and predict market movements. Many traders enter trade orders to buy or sell a tradeable object via a chart. There are existing order entry systems that allow a trader to select a desired price level for a trade order on the chart. However, the existing chart order entry methods suffer from accuracy problems as one pixel on the chart may represent a single or multiple price levels, accurately selecting a desired price level may be impossible due to the human error and limitations of currently available user input devices. Thus, it is desirable to provide a fast and more accurate order entry on a chart.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Example embodiments are described herein with reference to the following drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example electronic trading system in which a client terminal and a gateway are located on a local area network;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an example electronic trading system in which a client terminal is located remote from a gateway;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating a client terminal with a number of layers defining different stages that may be used to implement embodiments of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating one example embodiment of an order entry interface for use in relation to a chart;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating another configuration of an order entry interface for use in relation to a chart;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating an example order entry interface incorporating a quantity selection interface;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating an example order entry interface incorporating a view of market data corresponding to a tradeable object; and</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating yet another example order entry interface that displays current market conditions according to another arrangement.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">An example system and methods for chart based order entry are provided. According to one example method, historical market data corresponding to a tradeable object is displayed via a chart, with the historical market data being updated as new market data corresponding to the tradeable object is received from an electronic exchange so that the chart displays the historical market data as well as the current market data. An order entry interface is also displayed in relation to the chart. The order entry interface includes a plurality of price objects corresponding to a plurality of price levels. According to the example embodiment, the plurality of price levels that correspond to price objects are set based on a location of the order entry interface in relation to the chart. As a user moves the order entry interface in relation to the chart, the price levels also change to correspond to a new set of prices. For example, upon activating the order entry interface, a cursor corresponding to a user input device may be displayed at the center of the order entry interface, and the location of the cursor may determine the price levels associated with the price objects. According to one example embodiment, the order entry interface is divided into a bid side and an ask side having price objects corresponding to the same set of prices. When a user wishes to send a trade order for the tradeable object, the user may select a desired price either on the buy side or the ask side to effectively send a buy trade order or a sell trade order to a matching engine at an electronic exchange.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Other features of the present invention will become more apparent to persons having ordinary skill in the art to which the present invention pertains from the following description and claims.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><heading id="h-0007" level="1">I.

Also, the gateway <b>106</b> executes application programs resident at the gateway <b>106</b> under the control of the operating system of the gateway <b>106</b>. In other embodiments and as understood by a person skilled in the art, the function of the application programs at the trading stations <b>102</b>A-B may be performed by the gateway <b>106</b>, and likewise, the function of the application programs at the gateway <b>106</b> may be performed by the trading stations <b>102</b>A-B.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The actual electronic trading system configurations are numerous, and a person skilled in the art of electronic trading systems would be able to construct a suitable network configuration. For the purposes of illustration, some example configurations are provided to illustrate where the elements may be physically located and how they might be connected to form an electronic trading system. These illustrations are meant to be helpful to the reader, and they are not meant to be limiting. According to one example illustration, the gateway device may be located at the client site along with the trading station, which is usually remote from the matching process at the electronic exchange. Alternatively, no gateway is used at all.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to the illustrated embodiment, the trading stations <b>102</b>A-B, the gateway <b>106</b>, and any routers communicate over the LAN <b>104</b>, and the gateway <b>106</b> may communicate with the matching process at the electronic exchange <b>108</b> over a T1, T3, ISDN, or some other high speed connection. In another example illustration, the client site may be located on the actual grounds of the electronic exchange (for example, in the building of the exchange). According to this instance, the trading station and the gateway may still communicate over a LAN, but if any routers are used, they may communicate with the matching process at the electronic exchange through another connection means besides a T1, T3, or ISDN. In yet another example illustration, the gateway may be housed at, or near, its corresponding electronic exchange. According to this instance, the trading station may communicate with the gateway over a wide area network or through the use of a T1, T3, ISDN, or some other high speed connection.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">While a single exchange is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, it should be understood that a trader may obtain access and trade at multiple electronic exchanges. In such an embodiment, a client terminal could access multiple exchanges through multiple gateways, with each gateway designated for a specific exchange. Alternatively, a single gateway may be programmed to handle more than one electronic exchange.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">It could be very valuable to provide a trader with the opportunity to trade tradeable objects listed at different electronic exchanges. For example, a trader could view market information from each tradeable object through one common visual display. As such, price and quantity information from the two separate exchanges may be presented together so that the trader can view both markets simultaneously in the same window. In another example, a trader can spread-trade different tradeable objects listed at the different electronic exchanges.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">II. A Second Example Trading System</heading><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The second method that is often used to connect network segments in an electronic trading environment is a remote connection. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an example electronic trading system <b>200</b> in which a trading station is located remote from a gateway. The example system <b>200</b> comprises a remote trading station <b>202</b>, a remote host <b>204</b>, a gateway <b>206</b>, and an exchange <b>208</b>. A trader connecting in a remote mode connects to the remote host <b>204</b> located at a site that hosts the gateway <b>206</b> via the Internet or through a direct connection. Example connections between the remote trading station <b>202</b> and the remote host include an ISDN, cable, DSL, or a least line connection. The remote host <b>204</b> and the gateway <b>206</b> may communicate via a LAN.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the remote mode of operation, the remote trading station initiates a connection to the remote host <b>204</b> by establishing a Transmission Control Protocol (&#x201c;TCP&#x201d;) session. It should be understood that different protocols could be used as well. When data arrives at the remote host <b>204</b> from the gateway <b>206</b>, the remote host <b>204</b> sends it to the client terminal <b>202</b> via the established TCP connection.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">While two example trading systems have been described above, it should be understood that different network connection are possible as well, and the example embodiments are not limited to the described systems. For example, another example trading system could be configured to use Wide Area Networks (WAN) and WAN routers. One skilled in the art of electronic trading systems will understand that the present embodiments are not limited to the particular configurations illustrated and described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>2</b></figref>, and will be able to design a particular system based on the specific requirements (for example, by adding additional exchanges, gateways, trading stations, routers, or other computers serving various functions like message handling and security). Additionally, several networks, like either of the networks shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>2</b></figref>, may be linked together to access one or more electronic exchanges.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">III. Example System Functions</heading><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating a client terminal <b>300</b> with a number of layers defining different stages that may be used to implement embodiments of the present invention. The layers include a charting application <b>302</b>, a chart-based order entry application <b>304</b>, an operating system <b>306</b>, and an application programming interface (&#x201c;API&#x201d;) <b>308</b>. The client terminal <b>300</b> also preferably includes, among other things, at least a processor and memory (both of which are not shown in figure, but are well known computer components). Preferably, the processor has enough processing power to handle and process various types of market information. Therefore, the more market information is received and processed, the more processing power is preferred. However, any present day processor has enough processing power to handle and process various types of market information. Also, it should be understood that memory may include any computer readable medium. The term computer readable medium, as used herein, refers to any medium that participates in providing instructions to a processor unit for execution.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Preferably, the charting application <b>302</b> has access to market data from one or more host electronic exchanges through an interface such as the API <b>308</b>. When the charting application <b>302</b> receives market data from the host exchange <b>310</b>, it arranges and displays the received data on a chart that a trader may view on a visual output display device <b>312</b>. Example display devices include CRT-based video displays, LCD-based displays, gas plasma-panel displays, displays that show three-dimensional images, different display types, or the combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The chart-based order entry application <b>304</b> allows for order entry via a chart, as will be explained in greater detail below. In short, the chart-based order entry application <b>304</b> generates an order entry interface to be displayed in relation to a chart. According to one example embodiment, the order entry interface takes a format similar to a pie chart interface with a plurality of objects or slices of the pie chart interface dynamically displaying a set of market price levels determined based on the position of the pie chart interface in relation to the chart. As will be described in greater detail below, a user may select one of the prices displayed in relation to the pie chart interface to effectively set a price for a trade order to buy or sell a tradeable object and to send the trade order to an electronic exchange.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The chart-based order entry application <b>304</b> interacts with a trading application, such as X_TRADER&#xae; referenced above, so that when an order is entered using the chart-based order entry methods, the order may be sent to an electronic exchange by the trading application. It should be understood that, according to one example embodiment, the chart-based order entry application <b>304</b> could be an internal module of any trading application. Alternatively, the chart-based order entry interface <b>304</b> may be programmed so that there is no need to interact with any trading applications.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The charting application <b>302</b> and the chart-based order entry application <b>304</b> receive input signals from a trader via input devices <b>314</b>. Example input devices include a mouse, a keyboard, a game pad, or a stylus in the systems using touch-screen display devices. However, different input devices or a combination of input devices could also be used. For example, input signals received from a user may include an input in relation to a chart to enter a trade order to an electronic exchange, the methods of which will be described below.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The operating system <b>306</b> is used to manage hardware and software resources of the client terminal <b>300</b>. General functions of the operating system <b>306</b> include, among others, processor management, memory management, device management, storage management, as well as application interfaces and user interface management. Any type of operating system may be used to implement the present embodiments, and examples of common operating systems include the Microsoft WINDOWS family operating systems, the UNIX family operating systems, or the MACINTOSH operating systems. However, those ordinarily skilled in the art will recognize that the added complexity of an operating system may not be necessary to perform the functions described herein.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">IV. Chart-Based Order Entry Examples</heading><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a block diagram <b>400</b> illustrating one example embodiment of an order entry interface for use in relation to a chart. The block diagram <b>400</b> includes a chart <b>402</b> displayed in relation to a price-based axis and a time-based axis. According to one example embodiment, the chart <b>402</b> displays market data corresponding to a tradeable object being traded at an electronic exchange, and units that are used in relation to the price-based axis are based on prices that are used at an electronic exchange to trade the tradeable object. It should be understood that the chart is dynamically updated as new market data is received for the tradeable object from the electronic exchange so that the chart displays historical market data as well as current market data. It should be understood that many different market related parameters could be displayed via the chart <b>402</b>, including the last traded price, the best bid price, the best ask price, or others.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The diagram <b>400</b> also illustrates an order entry interface <b>404</b> displayed in relation to the chart <b>402</b>. The order entry interface <b>404</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> takes a format of a wedge or pie-chart like interface having a plurality of selectable price-based objects that are divided into a first set <b>406</b> corresponding to a first half of the interface <b>404</b> and a second set <b>408</b> corresponding to a second half of the interface <b>404</b>. According to the illustrated example embodiment, the interface objects shown at <b>406</b> and <b>408</b> display an expanded view of price levels that are determined based on a location of the order entry interface <b>404</b> in relation to the chart <b>402</b>. More specifically, the first and second portions <b>406</b> and <b>408</b> display an identical set of a plurality of price levels, with the left half <b>408</b> of the interface <b>404</b> representing bid prices and the right half <b>406</b> representing ask prices. It should be understood that a reverse configuration could be used as well, and the displayed price levels could be color-coded based on the user's preferences. For example, blue could be used to color-code bid prices, and red could be used to color-code ask prices. However, different colors and configurations could be used as well. Additionally, while a ring-like or pie-like structure is illustrated in relation to the interface <b>404</b>, it should be understood that many different shapes could be used as well such as any arc-shaped interfaces or an interface having the price objects positioned in relation to vertical or horizontal columns. Many different interfaces using different curvature angles are possible as well.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Price levels displayed at <b>406</b> and <b>408</b> dynamically change based on a location of the interface <b>404</b> in relation to the chart <b>402</b>. According to one example embodiment, a cursor may be displayed at a center point of the order entry interface, such as shown at <b>406</b>, and as the cursor is moved along the chart, the position of the cursor at some point directly on the chart <b>402</b> or off the chart <b>402</b> determines a set of prices that are displayed via the interface <b>404</b>. In the example embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the interface <b>404</b> displays eight price levels in each half of the interface <b>404</b>. In such an embodiment, one of the objects close to the center of each half of the interface <b>402</b> may be used as a reference price object that corresponds to a price level that maps to a position of a cursor at <b>410</b> in relation to the chart <b>402</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">According to the example embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the price object that displays a price level of <b>510</b> is a reference price object, and the three upper objects display three higher price levels, and the four lower objects display four lower price levels. It should be understood that any price object could be configured to be a reference price object and represent a price levels that corresponds to a location of the cursor in relation to the chart. Additionally, price levels displayed in relation to the reference price object could be displayed in the reverse order, with the prices lower than a price at the reference price object being displayed in relation to the top price objects, and prices higher than the price of the reference price object being displayed in the lower price objects, such as illustrated in relation to an order entry interface <b>500</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. Also, while the prices displayed in relation to the reference price object use a single increment price value, different configurations using different increment values are possible as well.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">It should be understood that different configurations of the interface <b>404</b> are possible as well, with any other price object than the center object of the interface <b>404</b> corresponding to the price that matches the position of the cursor <b>410</b>. Additionally, any other configuration could be used in relation to the prices surrounding the selected price, such as, for example, displaying only lower price levels, higher price levels, or yet displaying a combination of higher and lower price levels at some other locations than the locations shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. Also, it should be understood that while each half <b>406</b> and <b>408</b> of the interface <b>404</b> displays eight price levels, fewer or more price levels could be displayed as well based on user's preferences or based on a hard-coded configuration. According to yet another example embodiment, a second ring with additional price levels could be displayed as well.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">As explained earlier, the order entry interface <b>404</b> tracks the movement of a user input device. When a user moves a cursor thus moving the interface <b>404</b> in relation to the chart <b>402</b>, the prices displayed via the interface <b>404</b> dynamically change based on the location of the cursor in relation to the chart <b>402</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a change in the displayed price levels as the interface <b>404</b> has been moved to a new location, as shown at <b>410</b>A, with the interface now shown at <b>404</b>A. As shown in relation to the interface <b>404</b>A, the new location of the cursor corresponds to the price level of <b>608</b>, with lower and higher price levels displayed below and above the reference object of each half of the interface <b>404</b>A, respectively. Also, as shown in relation to the interface <b>404</b>A, the location of the cursor does not correspond to any point on the chart <b>402</b>. Regardless, the location of the cursor is mapped to a price level on the price axis.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">According to one example embodiment, a user can freeze the prices displayed in relation to the order entry interface <b>404</b> to enter trade orders to buy or sell a tradeable object for which data is displayed via the chart <b>402</b>. It should be understood that any predefined user input could freeze the prices. According to one example embodiment using a mouse as a user input device, a user freezes the prices displayed via the interface <b>404</b> by selecting and holding down one of the buttons of the mouse. Then, to enter an order, the user moves the cursor, with the mouse button depressed down, to an interface object corresponding to a desired price. According to the example embodiment described earlier where the left half <b>408</b> of the interface <b>404</b> is a bid side, and the right half <b>406</b> is an ask side, a user may move the cursor to a price level on the bid side <b>408</b> to place a buy order, and to a price level on the ask side <b>406</b> to place a sell order. In the embodiment where the button down action freezes the price levels displayed via the interface <b>404</b>, a user could position the cursor at a desired price and release the pressed down button over an interface object corresponding to the desired price to place a trade order to buy or sell at the desired price. In such an embodiment, a user may cancel an order entry process by simply releasing the mouse button outside any interface object displayed via the interface <b>404</b>. According to another example embodiment, a click-release mouse action could be first used in relation to a desired price level to freeze the interface <b>404</b>, and then another click-release action could be used in relation to the desired price object to place an order.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Additionally, as new data is received for display in relation to the chart <b>402</b>, the chart will be scrolling to the left to allow for display of new data points in relation to the chart <b>402</b>. In one example embodiment, the interface <b>404</b> may scroll with the chart <b>402</b>. To prevent any price changes displayed via the interface <b>404</b> at the time when a user initiates an order, a user input action initiated an order entry could freeze the price levels displayed via the interface <b>404</b> and may also prevent any automated chart rescaling for a time period until an initiated order action is completed or an order action is cancelled. Different embodiments where the auto-scrolling feature is disabled are possible as well.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">It should be understood that different embodiments could also be used for order entry. For example, any predefined user action, such a selection of a specific key on a keyboard or a combination of keys may freeze price levels displayed via the interface <b>404</b>. Then, once the prices displayed via the interface <b>404</b> freeze, a selection of a desired price level via one of the interface objects results in placing an order to buy or sell order.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Additionally, a user may preset a default order quantity to be used in relation to any order that is entered via the interface <b>404</b>. Alternatively, a quantity interface could be displayed either in relation to the interface <b>404</b> so that a user could selectively choose a desired quantity, or the interface <b>404</b> could be designed to allow a user select a desired quantity, as shown in the next figure.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating an example order entry interface <b>600</b> incorporating a quantity selection interface. The interface <b>600</b> illustrates a number of interface objects corresponding to price levels as was shown and described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. Additionally, the interface <b>600</b> includes a number of quantity selection objects positioned in the outer ring of the price objects corresponding to the bid and ask side of the interface <b>600</b>. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the quantity objects displayed on the bid side, here the left side, may be used to set quantity values for buy orders. Then, the quantity objects displayed on the ask side, here the right side, may be used to set a quantity for sell orders.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">According to one example embodiment, a user can select a default quantity by simply clicking on a quantity object corresponding to the desired quantity before initiating an order entry process. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the highlighted quantity objects correspond to default quantities set for buy and sell orders, with a quantity of 10 set for buys and a quantity of 5 set for sells. According to one example embodiment, the quantity ring may rotate to align a default quantity with a current position of a cursor in relation to one of the price levels displayed via the interface. For example, if a cursor hovers over the price level of &#x201c;<b>408</b>,&#x201d; the quantity ring rotates such that the quantity of &#x201c;5&#x201d; is aligned with the price level of &#x201c;<b>408</b>.&#x201d; If the cursor is then moved to a price level of &#x201c;<b>406</b>,&#x201d; the outer quantity ring may rotate again such that the quantity of &#x201c;5&#x201d; is aligned with the price level of &#x201c;<b>406</b>.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">It should be understood that while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates five examples of buy and sell quantities, different quantities could also be used based on the user's preferences. For example, a user may select a quantity object to activate an interface that enables the user to change a quantity value for the selected quantity object or other quantity objects. Also, while the interface <b>600</b> displays a separate set of quantities for buy and sell orders, it should be understood that a common set of quantity objects may be used as well to set quantities for both buy or sell orders. Also, according to yet another example embodiment, only a single default quantity is displayed, or each price is assigned to its own quantity value that is displayed in relation to each price. Those skilled in the art will understand that many different embodiments are possible as well.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating yet another example order entry interface <b>600</b> that displays current market conditions at prices displayed via the interface <b>700</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">According to one example embodiment, in addition to enabling a user to enter orders at desired price levels selected based on a position of a cursor in relation to a chart, the example order entry interface <b>700</b> also allows for viewing current market conditions in relation to the displayed prices. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, market depth data is graphically displayed in relation to some or all prices displayed via the interface <b>700</b> depending on the current market activity corresponding to the tradeable object in relation to one or more displayed price levels. According to one example embodiment, if one of the displayed price levels corresponds to the inside market, an indicator is used to alert a user of the current location of the inside market. For example, the price levels corresponding to the inside market could be highlighted; however, different indicators could also be used.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, current market depth data are displayed in relation to each price using bars, where each bar represents a quantity pending at the price. It should be understood that the length of each bar may be scaled based on a predefined scale so that a user can easily view the relative quantity values pending at each price level. In addition to having the bars scaled, quantity values at market depth prices and inside market prices could be displayed in relation to each bar. It should be understood that depending on the position of the interface <b>700</b> in relation to a chart, if no quantities are available at a displayed price level, no bar would be displayed in relation to such price level. Also, quantity bars corresponding to bid prices are displayed in relation to prices on the bid side portion of the interface, here the left side, and quantity bars corresponding to ask prices are displayed in relation to prices on the ask side of the interface, here the right side. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, based on the position of the bars, a user can quickly determine that the current inside market is at price levels <b>411</b> and <b>412</b>, with the best bid price at <b>411</b> and the best ask price at <b>412</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">It should be understood that the bars illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> may not necessarily be radial with respect to each price object of the interface. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating yet another example order entry interface <b>800</b> that displays current market conditions according to another arrangement. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the market bars are aligned horizontally with the price objects displayed via the interface.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates an embodiment related to displaying market data in relation the interface, it should be understood that different market related data, such as total traded volume at each price level could be displayed as well. Additionally, the example embodiments could also incorporate trader-related data. For example, when the interface <b>700</b> displays a price level at which a user has a pending working order, a working order indicator is displayed in relation to the price level. It should be understood that many different formats of working order indicators could be used including displaying an indicator directly next to a price in an interface object or having a separate ring with working order objects that display more detailed working order data. For example, according to the example embodiment where bid and ask prices are divided, any buy working order indicators could be displayed in relation to bid price objects, and ask working order indicators could be displayed directly next to ask price objects. Different embodiments are possible as well.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">It will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that the methods described above may be embodied in a computer program product that includes one or more computer readable media.
