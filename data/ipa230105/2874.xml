China has a vast ocean area, and the development of marine resources is crucial to the sustainable development of China's economy and people's livelihood and the stability of China's international status. The important direction of China's marine development is the deep sea and polar regions. The marine environment in the deep sea and polar regions is complex, and the equipment service conditions are harsh: the deep sea and polar regions have low temperatures, which can cause metal brittleness. Seawater can corrode metals. Marine microorganisms can attach to metal surfaces, accelerate corrosion, and increase movement resistance. The coating surface technology can improve corrosion resistance and anti-fouling property, but requires constant replenishment and cannot meet the long-life and reliable operation of critical components. Therefore, to realize the smooth development of China's marine industry, it is urgent to develop marine engineering metal materials with high plasticity, strong corrosion-resistance, and excellent anti-fouling property.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In metal materials, the Cu element and the Ag element have excellent anti-fouling properties. The Cu element is the first choice for marine anti-fouling metals in terms of cost. The property improvement of metals with high Cu content is a feasible method to realize the development of multi-functional marine engineering metals. To improve the property of metals with high Cu content, two problems need to be overcome: 1, the Cu element is chemically inert and is prone to grain boundary segregation in corrosion-resistant alloys. Grain boundary segregation can not only increase the enthalpy of the grain boundary and deteriorate the plasticity of the material but also cause the potential difference between the grain and the grain boundary to accelerate seawater corrosion. 2, The anti-fouling effect of the Cu element is directly related to the existing form of the Cu element. Compared with the Cu element in a solid solution state, the Cu element in precipitation or segregation state can promote the emission of Cu ions and realize the prevention and killing of microorganisms. It is easy to see that the above two difficulties are contradictory. Therefore, the research and development of multi-functional marine engineering metals have always been a bottleneck technical problem in the world.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Focusing on this problem, the present disclosure couples a variety of metallographic theories and technical methods to carry out innovative designs. The main innovation is that instead of traditional stainless steel and titanium alloys, the face-centered cubic (FCC) phase high-entropy alloy is used as the matrix. The FCC phase high-entropy alloy used has the following advantages: it contains a variety of corrosion-resistant elements and a simple solid solution structure to achieve corrosion resistance. Compared with the body-centered cubic (BCC) phase alloy, it has excellent plasticity. Compared with the traditional corrosion-resistant plastic alloy, it has high mixing entropy and structural metastable property. Entropy and free energy are important physical parameters to change the mutual solubility of alloy and Cu, which provides a theoretical possibility for regulating the morphology of the Cu element.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, the FCC phase high-entropy alloys containing Cu prepared by techniques such as as-cast, directional solidification, laser cladding, and spraying, as well as post-processed high-entropy alloys, have grain boundary segregation of Cu (as shown in FIGS. 13A-13F, see A. Verma, et al., Scripta Materialia, 2019, 161:28-31). The traditional preparation method cannot solve the phase formation problem caused by chemical inertness, and cannot realize the adjustment of mutual solubility by entropy and free energy.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">To solve this problem, another major innovation of the embodiments described herein is that using high-temperature powder metallurgy and suitable temperature heat treatment, temperature control is used to fully exert the effect of mixing entropy and the influence of entropy and free energy on mutual solubility between elements, to realize controllable distribution of the Cu element in high-plasticity and corrosion-resistant multi-principal alloy. The influence of entropy in a long temperature range is used to overcome the influence of chemical inertness. Based on the role of disorder degree and free energy on the solid solubility and phase stability between elements, the uniform and dispersed nano-precipitation of the Cu element in the alloy is realized.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The specific innovative mechanism is that the mutual solubility of the alloy is improved by using high temperature and high entropy in the powder metallurgy process with sufficiently high temperature. In the subsequent heat treatment process, based on the increase of free energy and sufficient diffusion, the nano-precipitation of the Cu element is realized. The technical problem worth noting is: the alloy can maintain the ideal high mixing entropy structure in the solid-state, that is, it must be sintered below the melting point. b, When the mixing entropy of the alloy system is relatively low, the combined effect of mixing entropy and temperature is low, and it is difficult to achieve effective mutual solubility in the powder metallurgy process. c, When the mixing entropy of the alloy is too high, although the alloy can achieve effective mutual solubility in the powder metallurgy process, the relatively high heat treatment temperature could increase the driving force for precipitation, resulting in precipitates with too large scales If the heat treatment temperature is too low, diffusion becomes slower, which inhibits the formation of precipitates. Therefore, the mixing entropy, sintering temperature, and post-treatment temperature of the alloy must be carefully set and fully coordinated to achieve the ideal nano-Cu precipitation structure.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In conclusion, the disclosed embodiments innovatively couple the new alloy structure, temperature, and entropy, controls the mutual solubility between elements and the free energy of the system, realizes the controllable distribution of nano-precipitation of the anti-fouling element Cu in corrosion-resistant and high-plasticity alloys, and solves the long-term technical problems in the development of multi-functional marine engineering alloys. The obtained multi-principal component alloy with high content of nano-precipitated Cu has high plasticity, strong corrosion-resistance, and excellent anti-fouling property, which plays an important role in the development of China's marine equipment engineering.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Embodiments of the present disclosure provide a preparation method for a multi-functional marine engineering alloy, which realizes the nano-precipitation distribution of the high-content anti-fouling element Cu in the corrosion-resistant and high-plasticity alloy.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present disclosure is implemented in the following steps:</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">1) Mixed Ball Milling</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">weighing Co&#x2014;Cr&#x2014;Fe&#x2014;Ni FCC-based high-entropy alloy powder and Cu powder separately, loading the weighed metal powder into a ball milling tank for mixed ball milling and conducting drying treatment after the ball milling to obtain uniform pre-sintered powder;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">2) High-Temperature Sintering to Promote Mutual Solubility</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">loading the obtained mixed powder into a graphite die, placing the graphite die in a spark plasma sintering (SPS) furnace, conducting pressure sintering in a vacuum environment or under the protection of inert gas at 1,000-1,500&#xb0; C., and cooling a sintered material to a room temperature with the furnace after the sintering;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">3) Heat Treatment to Induce Nano-Precipitation</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">placing the prepared high-temperature sintered material in a heat treatment furnace, conducting heat preservation heat treatment at 650-950&#xb0; C., and water cooling or cooling with the furnace after the heat treatment to obtain the multi-functional marine engineering alloy.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">As a further preferable implementation solution, components of a Co&#x2014;Cr&#x2014;Fe&#x2014;Ni FCC-based high-entropy alloy may be in equimolar or nearly molar ratios and may have molar percentages of Co(a)Cr(b)Fe(c)Ni(d), a+b+c+d=100, 30&#x2265;a&#x2265;20, 30&#x2265;b&#x2265;20, 30&#x2265;c&#x2265;20, 30&#x2265;d&#x2265;20.

After equilibrating in seawater, the samples were transferred into a sterile water cup containing 5 mL of seaweed suspension and placed at a constant temperature of 25&#xb0; C. for 24 h, and the surface of the samples after the determination was rinsed with artificial sterile seawater for 3 times. The algae adhered to the surface of the samples and were characterized using automated fluorescence image analysis (Olympus, BX-51, Japan).</p><p id="p-0095" num="0093">The test results are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>D</figref>. The 304 stainless steel of the control group was in seawater, and a large number of algae adhered to the surface, and the average algae deposition was about 2,027/mm<sup>2</sup>. The algae adhered to the surface of the multi-functional marine engineering alloy as the test group was significantly less than that of 304 stainless steel. With the increase of the content of the Cu element, the number of algae adhered to the surface further decreased. The average algae deposition of 95 wt. % [Co(20)Cr(30)Fe(30)Ni(20)]+5 wt. % Cu obtained in Example 2 was about 247/mm<sup>2</sup>. The average algae deposition of 85 wt. % [Co(25)Cr(25)Fe(25)Ni(25)]+15 wt. % Cu obtained in Example 1 was about 129/mm<sup>2</sup>. The average algae deposition of 80 wt. % [Co(30)Cr(20)Fe(20)Ni(30)]+20 wt. % Cu obtained in Example 3 was about 97/mm<sup>2</sup>.
