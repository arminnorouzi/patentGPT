id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to Japanese Patent Application No. 2021-109074, filed on Jun. 30, 2021, the content of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a printer, a control method, and a non-transitory computer readable medium storing a control program.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A printer is known that performs gloss printing using photocurable ink. The gloss printing is a printing method that creates a glossy printed object, by smoothing a layer of the photocurable ink formed on an object to be printed. For example, in the known printer, a color ink head, a clear ink head, a plurality of color LEDs, and a plurality of white/clear LEDs are provided on a carriage. The color ink head and the clear ink head are aligned with each other in a sub-scanning direction, and respectively eject photocurable color ink and photocurable clear ink onto the object to be printed. The plurality of color LEDs are arranged in the plurality thereof on both sides of the color ink head in a main scanning direction, and irradiate light onto the object to be printed. The plurality of white/clear LEDs are arranged in the plurality thereof on both sides of the clear ink head in the main scanning direction, and irradiate light onto the object to be printed.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">At the time of the gloss printing, the printer ejects the color ink from the color ink head onto the object to be printed and causes the plurality of color LEDs to be illuminated, while moving the carriage in the main scanning direction. The printer ejects the clear ink from the clear ink head onto the object to be printed and causes the plurality of clear LEDs to be illuminated. The printer conveys the object to be printed in a direction from the color ink head toward the clear ink head in the sub-scanning direction. By repeating these operations, the printer forms a layer of color ink on the object to be printed, and forms a layer of clear ink on the layer of color ink.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">At the time of the gloss printing, in order to secure a time from when the clear ink layer is formed on the object to be printed to when the smoothing is performed, the above-described printer causes only the white/clear LEDs furthermost upstream in a progress direction of the carriage in the main scanning direction to be illuminated, of the plurality of white/clear LEDs. It is thus necessary for the printer to arrange the white/clear LEDs to be at positions separated from the white/clear ink head in the main scanning direction.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Note that, in the above-described printer, when the clear ink layer is not formed on the color ink layer, for example, it is conceivable to perform the gloss printing by smoothing the color ink layer. In this case also, in a similar manner to the white/clear LEDs, in order to secure a time from when the color ink layer is formed on the object to be printed to when the smoothing is performed, it is conceivable that the printer causes only the color LEDs furthermost upstream in the progress direction of the carriage in the main scanning direction to be illuminated, of the plurality of color LEDs. It is thus necessary for the printer to arrange the color LEDs to be at positions separated from the color ink head in the main scanning direction.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">When the respective LEDs are arranged at the positions separated from the respective heads in the main scanning direction, there is a possibility a support member for each of the LEDs becomes larger in the printer. As a result, there is a possibility that the printer may become larger as a whole device.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">An object of the present disclosure is to provide a printer, a control method, and a recording medium storing a non-transitory computer readable medium storing control program capable of smoothing a layer of ink formed on an object to be printed, in a gloss print mode, while suppressing an increase in size of a device as a whole.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to a first aspect of the present disclosure, a printer includes a platen, a first head, a second head, a first lamp, a second lamp, a processor, and a memory. The platen is configured to have an object to be printed placed thereon. The first head is configured to eject a first ink onto the object to be printed. The first ink is a photocurable ink. The second head is aligned with the first head in a sub-scanning direction, and is configured to eject a photocurable second ink onto the object to be printed. The first lamp is aligned with the first head in a main scanning direction, and is configured to irradiate light onto the object to be printed. The main scanning direction is orthogonal to the sub-scanning direction. The second lamp is aligned with the second head in the main scanning direction, and is configured to irradiate light onto the object to be printed. The memory stores computer-readable instructions that, when executed by the processor, instruct the processor to perform following processes. The processor performs a first movement and a second movement repeatedly. The first movement moves the first head, the second head, the first lamp, and the second lamp relatively with respect to the platen in the main scanning direction. The second movement moves the platen in a direction, of the sub-scanning direction, from the second head toward the first head, relatively with respect to the first head, the second head, the first lamp, and the second lamp. The processor causes the second head to eject the second ink onto the object to be printed during the performing of the first movement, in a gloss print mode. After the performing of the second movement and the ejecting of the second ink, the processor causes to irradiate the light from the first lamp onto the second ink ejected onto the object to be printed, during the performing of the first movement, in the gloss print mode.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to a second aspect of the present disclosure, a printer includes a platen, a first head, a second head, a first lamp, a second lamp, a processor, and a memory. The platen is configured to have an object to be printed placed thereon. The first head is configured to eject a first ink onto the object to be printed. The first ink is a photocurable ink. The second head is aligned with the first head in a sub-scanning direction, and is configured to eject a photocurable second ink onto the object to be printed. The first lamp is aligned with the first head in a main scanning direction, and is configured to irradiate light onto the object to be printed. The main scanning direction is orthogonal to the sub-scanning direction. The second lamp is aligned with the second head in the main scanning direction, and is configured to irradiate light onto the object to be printed. The first lamp is disposed, in a height direction, at a position further separated from the platen than a position of the second lamp with respect to the platen. The height direction is orthogonal to the main scanning direction and the sub-scanning direction. The memory stores computer-readable instructions that, when executed by the processor, instruct the processor to perform following processes. The processor causes the first head, the second head, the first lamp, and the second lamp to move relatively with respect to the platen in the main scanning direction. In a gloss print mode, the processor causes the first head to eject the first ink onto the object to be printed during the moving of the first head, the second head, the first lamp, and the second lamp. In the gloss print mode, the processor causes the first lamp to irradiate the light onto the first ink ejected onto the object to be printed, during the moving of the first head, the second head, the first lamp, and the second lamp.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to a third aspect of the present disclosure, a printer includes a platen, a first head, a second head, a first lamp, a second lamp, a processor, and a memory. The platen is configured to have an object to be printed placed thereon. The first head is configured to eject a first ink onto the object to be printed. The first ink is a photocurable ink. The second head is aligned with the first head in a sub-scanning direction, and is configured to eject a photocurable second ink onto the object to be printed. The first lamp is aligned with the first head in a main scanning direction, and is configured to irradiate light onto the object to be printed. The main scanning direction is orthogonal to the sub-scanning direction. The first lamp includes a first light source and a first housing. The first housing is a housing that accommodates the first light source and includes a first facing surface. The first facing surface faces the platen in a height direction orthogonal to the main scanning direction and the sub-scanning direction. The second lamp is aligned with the second head in the main scanning direction, and is configured to irradiate light onto the object to be printed. The second lamp includes a second light source and a second housing. The second housing is a housing that accommodates the second light source and includes a second facing surface. The second facing surface faces the platen in the height direction. The first light source and the second light source are disposed at the same position as each other in the height direction. The first facing surface is disposed at a position further separated from the platen than a position of the second facing surface with respect to the platen in the height direction. The memory stores computer-readable instructions that, when executed by the processor, instruct the processor to perform following process.
