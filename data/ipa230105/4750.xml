Thus, those of ordinary skilled in the art shall understand that, variations and modifications can be made on the embodiments described herein, without departing from the scope and spirit of the present disclosure. Likewise, for clarity and conciseness, descriptions of well-known functions and structures are omitted in the following description.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In order to describe a clustering method for spatial points provided by an embodiment of the present disclosure more clearly, a possible application scenario of the method for spatial points provided by the present disclosure will be exemplarily described below. It is to be understood that, an example below is the possible application scenario of the method for spatial points provided by an embodiment of the present disclosure. In other optional embodiments, the method for spatial points provided by an embodiment of the present disclosure may also be applicable to other possible application scenarios. The example below does not impose any limitations herein.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In order to characterize roads in an area, multiple spatial points may be selected from at least one road of the area. The selected spatial points are clustered to obtain clustering results, and the at least one road in the area is characterized by utilizing the clustering results. For ease of description, assuming that 100 spatial points are selected from the at least one road of the area, the 100 spatial points are respectively recorded as spatial points 1 to 100.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Each spatial point in the spatial points 1 to 100 may be taken as a clustering group. The following steps are repeatedly performed, until a preset termination condition is reached. Clustering groups reaching the preset termination condition are taken as clustering results of the spatial points 1 to 100.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Step A: For every two clustering groups, a Euclidean distance between one spatial point belonging to one clustering group and another spatial point belonging to the other clustering group is calculated. An average of all calculated Euclidean distances is taken as a between-class distance between the two clustering groups.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Step B: two clustering groups with the smallest between-class distance are merged.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">For example, for ease of description, assuming that a clustering group including a spatial point 1 is a clustering group 1, a clustering group including a spatial point 2 is a clustering group 2, and so on, an Euclidean distance between the spatial point 1 and the spatial point 2 may be calculated. Since each clustering group includes one spatial point, the Euclidean distance between the spatial point 1 and the spatial point 2 may be taken as the between-class distance between the clustering group 1 and the clustering group 2.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Assuming that the between-class distance between the clustering group 1 and the clustering group 2 is the smallest, the clustering group 1 and the clustering group 2 may be merged. The merged clustering group is recorded as a clustering group 101. In this case, the clustering groups include clustering groups 3 to 101.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Then, for every two clustering groups in the clustering groups <b>3</b> to <b>101</b>, the Euclidean distance between every two spatial points respectively belonging to the two clustering groups is calculated. The average of all calculated Euclidean distances is taken as the between-class distance between the two clustering groups. The calculation of the between-class distance between the clustering group 3 and the clustering group 101 is taken as an example. Since the clustering group 3 includes the spatial point 3 and the clustering group 101 includes the spatial points 1 and 2, an Euclidean distance (recorded as a first Euclidean distance) between the spatial point 3 and the spatial point 1 and an Euclidean distance (recorded as a second Euclidean distance) between the spatial point 3 and the spatial point 2 may be respectively calculated. The average of the first Euclidean distance and the second Euclidean distance is calculated as the between-class distance between the clustering group 3 and the clustering group 101. Assuming that the between-class distance between the clustering group 3 and a clustering group 4 is the smallest, the clustering group 3 and the clustering group 4 may be merged. The merged clustering group is recorded as a clustering group 102. In this case, the clustering groups include clustering groups 5 to 102.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">By analogy, termination is achieved until the smallest between-class distance is greater than a preset threshold value. Assuming that the clustering groups at a time point of termination include clustering groups 103 and 104, the clustering groups 103 and 104 may be taken as clustering results of the spatial points 1 to 100.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">However, on the one hand, in this solution, when the clustering groups are merged each time, the Euclidean distances between a large quantity of spatial points are required to be calculated. The between-class distances are calculated according to the Euclidean distances. Clustering and merging are performed according to the between-class distances. In this way, a large calculated quantity is required during the merging of the clustering groups, resulting in low clustering efficiency.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">On the other hand, when the between-class distance between the two clustering groups is calculated, the calculated between-class distance is influenced by space distribution of the spatial points included in the two clustering groups. Exemplarily, assuming that the spatial points 1 to 10 are sampled from an entrance A of a complex intersection and the spatial points 11 to 20 are sampled from an entrance B of the complex intersection, further assuming that the spatial points 1 to 10 belong to a clustering group 105 and the spatial points 11 to 20 belong to a clustering group 106, since the spatial points 1 to 20 belong to the same complex intersection, the clustering group 105 and the clustering group 106 should be theoretically merged into the same clustering group. That is to say, the between-class distance between the clustering group 105 and the clustering group 106 should be relatively small.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">However, when most of the points in the spatial points 1 to 10 are sampled from a side of the entrance A that is away from the entrance B, and most of the points in the spatial points 11 to 20 are sampled from a side of the entrance B that is away from the entrance A, the foregoing manner of calculating the between-class distance may cause the between-class distance between the clustering group 105 and the clustering group 106 to be excessive large, so that the clustering group 105 and the clustering group 106 are not merged into the same clustering group. That is to say, this solution may be influenced by the space distribution of the spatial points, resulting in low accuracy.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Based on the above, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic flowchart of a clustering method for spatial points according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. The clustering method may include the following steps.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">At step S<b>101</b>, multiple spatial points to-be-processed are clustered according to distances between the multiple spatial points to-be-processed to obtain multiple first clustering groups.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">At S<b>102</b>, for each first clustering group, a first external graph enclosing all the spatial points to-be-processed in this first clustering group is determined.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">At S<b>103</b>, the multiple first clustering groups are merged according to distances between the first external graphs of the multiple first clustering groups to obtain at least one second clustering group.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">On the one hand, through this embodiment, positions of the spatial points to-be-processed in the multiple first clustering groups may be generally characterized through the first external graphs, so that distances between the spatial points included in each first clustering group are generally characterized according to the distance between the first external graphs, and the first clustering groups are merged according to the distance between the first external graphs. In addition, since the distance between the first external graphs is taken as the basis of merging the first clustering groups, the calculation of Euclidean distances between the spatial points in the first clustering groups is not required for merging the first clustering groups. In this way, a calculated quantity required by clustering may be effectively reduced, thereby enhancing clustering efficiency.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">On the other hand, since the distance between the first external graphs is taken as the basis of merging the first clustering groups, the merging of the first clustering groups may not be influenced by the space distribution of the spatial points to-be-processed in the first external graphs. Therefore, inaccuracy caused by the space distribution of the spatial points may be avoided, that is, the accuracy of clustering may be effectively enhanced.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the step S<b>101</b>, the spatial points to-be-processed may be positions at which any objects are located. For example, the spatial points to-be-processed may refer to the positions at which entrances of roads are located, may also be the position at which a residential building is located, or may also be the positions at which bus stations are located, which are not limited by the present disclosure. In addition, different spatial points to-be-processed may refer to the positions at which objects of a same type are located, or may also be the positions at which objects of different types are located. For example, a spatial point to-be-processed 1 may refer to the position at which a shopping mall is located, and a spatial point to-be-processed 2 may refer to the position at which a parking lot is located.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">By means of at least one clustering manner, the multiple spatial points to-be-processed may be clustered into multiple first clustering groups. Exemplarily, the spatial points to-be-processed may be clustered by using the clustering manner in application scenarios of the foregoing example. The clustering groups included at the end of any cycle are taken as the multiple first clustering groups. Exemplarily, the clustering groups 3-101 in the foregoing example may be taken as the multiple first clustering groups.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The quantity of the spatial points to-be-processed included in each first clustering group may vary according to different application scenarios. It is to be understood that, since the multiple first clustering groups are obtained by clustering the multiple spatial points to-be-processed, at least one first clustering group should include the multiple spatial points. For easy of description hereafter, a case that the first clustering group includes one spatial point to-be-processed or two spatial points to-be-processed will be described. For the case that the first clustering group includes more than two spatial points, a principle is same as that of the case that first clustering group includes two spatial points, so that details are not described again.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In step S<b>102</b>, the first external graph of the first clustering group may refer to a smallest rectangle enclosing all the spatial points to-be-processed in the first clustering group. Exemplarily, assuming that one first clustering group includes two spatial points to-be-processed, and space coordinates of the two spatial points to-be-processed respectively are (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), the first external graph of the first clustering group may refer to the rectangle with (x1, y1), (x1, y2), (x2, y1), and (x2, y2) as vertices. For the clustering group includes one spatial point, the first external graph of the first clustering group may refer to a shape with a preset size and enclosing this one spatial point. Exemplarily, it may be the rectangle with a side length of w and centered on this one spatial point. w may be any real number set according to user experience or actual requirements. In addition, the first external graph may be either a rectangle or a shape other than the rectangle, including but not limited to a circle, a triangle, a trapezoid, a pentagon, a hexagon and the like, which is not limited by the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">It is to be understood that, since the first external graph is a shape that encloses all the spatial points to-be-processed in the first clustering group, the first external graph can reflect an area at which the spatial points to-be-processed in the first clustering group are located. The area at which the spatial points to-be-processed are located may generally characterize the positions of the spatial points to-be-processed in the first clustering group. Thus, the first external graph can generally characterize the positions of the spatial points to-be-processed in the first clustering group.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In step S<b>103</b>, the calculation of the distance between the two first external graphs will be described in detail below with examples, so that details are not described again herein. It is to be understood that, as analyzed above, since the first external graph may generally characterize the positions of the spatial points to-be-processed in the first clustering group, the distance between the first external graphs of the two first clustering groups may generally characterize the distance between spatial points to-be-processed of the two first clustering groups. For example, when the first external graphs of the two first clustering groups are far from each other, it may be considered that the two spatial points to-be-processed respectively belonged to the two first clustering groups are generally far from each other. When the first external graphs of the two first clustering groups are close to each other, it may be considered that the two spatial points to-be-processed respectively belonged to the two first clustering groups are generally close to each other.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The manner of merging the first clustering groups according to the distance between the first external graphs may vary according to different application scenarios. Exemplarily, in an optional embodiment, for every two first clustering groups, the distance between the first external graphs of the two first clustering groups is calculated as the between-class distance between the two first clustering groups. The multiple the first clustering groups are merged according to the between-class distance between the two first clustering groups, so that at least one second clustering group is obtained.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Through this embodiment, the distance between the first external graphs is directly used as the between-class distance. Thus, the calculated quantity required by the merging of the first clustering groups can be effectively reduced, thereby further enhancing the clustering efficiency.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In another optional embodiment, the between-class distance between the first clustering groups may be obtained through further processing performed on the distance between the first external graphs. According to the between-class distance between the first clustering groups, the multiple first clustering groups are merged to obtain at least on second clustering groups. Any processing method may be selected according to user experience and/or actual requirements, including but not limited to normalization, correction, rounding and so on.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The method of merging the multiple first clustering groups according to the between-class distance may be the same as the method used for merging the clustering groups in any agglomerative hierarchical clustering. For example, the two first clustering groups between which the between-class distance is the smallest may be merged into one second clustering group. For another example, every two first clustering groups between which between-class distance is less than a preset distance threshold value may also be merged into one second clustering group. Merging may also be performed by using other methods. The present disclosure does not impose any limitations thereto. However, when the first clustering groups are merged, the first clustering groups between which between-class distance is small should be merged into the same second clustering group as much as possible.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">After step S<b>103</b> is performed, the second clustering groups may be taken as clustering results of the spatial points to-be-processed. The second clustering groups may also be continuously merged to obtain third clustering groups. The third clustering groups may be taken as the clustering results of the spatial points to-be-processed. Alternatively, the third clustering groups may be continuously merged to obtain fourth clustering groups, and so on.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Methods for merging the second clustering groups and the third clustering groups may be the same as or different from the method for merging the first clustering groups. For example, the second clustering groups and the third clustering groups may be merged according to the merging method in the application scenarios of the foregoing example.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In order to describe the clustering method for spatial points provided by the present disclosure more clearly, the calculation of the distance between the first external graphs will be exemplarily described below. In an optional embodiment, one point may be randomly selected from each of the two first external graphs. A distance between the selected two points is calculated as the distance between the two first external graphs.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The selected points may vary according to the different application scenarios. Exemplarily, a geometric center of each first external graph may be selected, and alternatively, an intersection point of perpendicular bisectors of any two sides of the first external graph may also be selected. The present disclosure does not impose any limitations thereto. For example, the selected points are geometric centers. Assuming the geometric center of the first external graph A is the geometric center 1 and the geometric center of the first external graph B is the geometric center 2, a distance between the geometric center 1 and the geometric center 2 may be taken as a distance between one first external graph and the other first external graph.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In another optional embodiment, it may also be shown as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic flowchart of a method for calculating distances between the first external graphs according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. The method may include the following steps.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">At step S<b>201</b>, a second external graph enclosing the first external graphs of the two first clustering groups is determined.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">For ease of description, the first external graphs of the two first clustering groups are respectively recorded as C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b>. The determined second external graph is recorded as C. It is assumed that C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b> and C are smallest external rectangles.

The same applies to the case that sizes are expressed in other forms, which is not described again herein. The horizontal span represents a difference value between the maximum horizontal coordinate and the minimum horizontal coordinate of the points in the external graphs. The longitudinal span represents a difference value between the maximum longitudinal coordinate and the minimum longitudinal coordinate of the points in the external graphs.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Exemplarily, assuming that one external graph is a rectangle with (x1, y1), (x1, y2), (x2, y1), and (x2, y2) as vertices, with x1&#x3c;x2, and y 1&#x3c;y2, the maximum horizontal coordinate of the points in the external graph is x2, the minimum horizontal coordinate is x1, the maximum longitudinal coordinate is y2, and the minimum longitudinal coordinate is y1.

In addition, when the distance between the first external graphs of the two first clustering groups remains unchanged, the larger the size of the respective first external graph of the two first clustering groups, the larger the size of the second external graph. It may be learned from that, on the one hand, the size of the second external graph depends on the size of the respective first external graph of the two first clustering groups. On the other hand, the size of the second external graph depends on the distance between the first external graphs of the two first clustering groups. Therefore, according to the size of the second external graph and the sizes of the first external graphs of the two first clustering groups, the distance between the first external graphs of the two first clustering groups may be determined.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Through this embodiment, the distance between the two first clustering groups may be accurately calculated according to the size of the second external graph and the sizes of the first external graphs of the two first clustering groups, so as to further enhance the accuracy of clustering.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The method of calculating the distance between the two first external graphs according to the size of the second external graph and the sizes of the first external graphs of the two first clustering groups may vary according to different application scenarios.

Therefore, in an optional embodiment, the distance between the first external graphs of the two first clustering groups may be obtained by subtracting the sizes of the first external graph of the two first clustering groups from the size of the second external graph.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In another optional embodiment, a difference value between the size of the second external graph and the size of the large-size first external graph is calculated as the distance between the first external graphs of the two first clustering groups.

Exemplarily, the preset maximum value may be positive infinity, and may also be a relatively large value set according to user experience and/or actual requirements. For example, when a user thinks that the distance between the first external graphs of the two first clustering groups exceeds 1000, the two first clustering groups cannot be merged into the same second clustering group. Then, the preset maximum value may be set to 1000.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">It is to be understood that, when the size of the second external graph is too large, it may be considered that the distance between the first external graphs of the two first clustering groups is too large. Even if the distance between the first external graphs of the two first clustering groups is calculated, the two first clustering groups cannot be merged into the same second clustering group. Thus, the distance between the first external graphs of the two first clustering groups may be set to a relatively large value to avoid the two first clustering groups from being merged into the same second clustering group, without further calculating the distance between the first external graphs of the two first clustering groups.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">At step S<b>404</b>, the distance between the first external graphs of the two first clustering groups is calculated according to sizes of the first external graphs of the two first clustering groups and a size of the second external graph.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">This step is the same as the foregoing S<b>202</b>, which may refer to relevant description in the foregoing S<b>202</b>, and is not described again herein.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Through this embodiment, when the size of the second external graph is too large, the distance between the first external graphs of the first clustering groups may be directly set to the preset maximum value.

In addition, since the distance between the first external graphs is taken as the basis of merging the first clustering groups, the calculation of Euclidean distances between the spatial points in the first clustering groups is not required for merging the first clustering groups.
