At the same time, hydrogen energy is actively developed as an efficient energy system to replace the existing energy systems powered by fossil fuel that has a negative impact on the environment. Accordingly, hydrogen fuel cells are positioned as an eco-friendly system that is highly efficient and produces water (H<sub>2</sub>O) as a byproduct.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Hydrogen has a very high energy density relative to weight (33.3 kWh&#xb7;kg<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) and has a low energy density relative to volume (2.97 Wh&#xb7;L<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, H<sub>2 </sub>gas, 0&#xb0; C., 1 atm). Thus, it is necessary to store hydrogen in an appropriate way so that the energy density relative to volume is increased. Therefore, to efficiently store hydrogen, physical hydrogen storage methods such as compressed hydrogen storage and liquefied hydrogen storage have been intensively studied in industry; however, these methods have problems in safety and energy loss. For this reason, a growing interest is focusing on chemical hydrogen storage methods capable of potentially storing a large amount of hydrogen in a reliable manner. Possible candidates for the chemical hydrogen storage methods may comprise methanol (CH<sub>3</sub>OH), sodium borohydride (NaBH<sub>4</sub>), ammonia borane (NH<sub>3</sub>BH<sub>3</sub>), formic acid (HCO<sub>2</sub>H), and the like.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Meanwhile, since the chemical hydrogen storage methods involve chemical reactions, high heat transfer efficiency is required to increase catalytic reactivity. Thus, a reactor is preferably made of a material such as metal that has a high thermal conductivity. However, the metal is oxidized, and thus has a problem of poor durability. To avoid this problem, an anti-oxidation film such as ceramic is formed on the surface of the metal; however, this causes a problem of decreased thermal conductivity. Therefore, there is a need to improve a reactor used in the chemical hydrogen storage methods so that the reactor can perform heat transfer in a more efficient manner.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An object of the present invention is to provide a hydrogen production reactor having excellent heat transfer efficiency.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In addition, an object of the present invention is to provide a hydrogen production reactor having excellent durability using a material that is stable and less reactive at a high temperature.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In addition, an object of the present invention is to provide a hydrogen production reactor having high durability due to an excellent antioxidant property.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In addition, an object of the present invention is to provide a hydrogen production reactor that has a reduced volume and requires a less amount of catalyst as compared with conventional ones.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The object of the present invention is not limited to the objects as mentioned above.
