Additionally or alternatively, users that are outside of the active area but are traveling toward the active area may be added to the proximity-based messaging group. In some cases, other context information about a user or a user device may be used to add a user to a proximity-based messaging group. For example, if a location associated with a calendar appointment or social media post of a user is within an active area for a proximity-based messaging group, the user may be added to the proximity-based messaging group.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">These and other embodiments are discussed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>7</b></figref>. However, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the detailed description given herein with respect to these figures is for explanatory purposes only and should not be construed as limiting.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a high-level block diagram of an example proximity-based messaging system <b>100</b>. The system <b>100</b> includes user devices <b>102</b> and a communication server <b>110</b>. The system <b>100</b> also includes a network <b>120</b> that enables communication between the user devices <b>102</b> and the communication server <b>110</b>. The user devices <b>102</b> may include one or more smartphones. Additionally or alternatively, the user devices <b>102</b> may include any other type of computing device, such as a desktop or laptop computer, a tablet, a cable box, a television, a video game console, and the like.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">A user of the user device <b>102</b> interacts with the communication server <b>110</b> via an application, such as a web browser or a native application, to perform operations such as writing and sending messages to other users of the messaging system <b>100</b>, or retrieving and reading messages sent by other users of the messaging system <b>100</b>, and the like. For example, the application may be a messaging application executing on the user device <b>102</b>. As another example, the application may be a web browser that loads a webpage provided by the communication server <b>110</b>. Through functionality provided by the messaging application, the user reads and writes messages. The user device <b>102</b> may transmit messages to and receive messages from other users via the communication server <b>110</b>, and the messages may be communicated through any of a variety of messaging protocols supported by the communication server <b>110</b>. The messages may contain text, pictures, videos, attachments, and the like.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The user device <b>102</b> may also track and communicate various types of context information to the communication server <b>110</b>. Examples of context information include non-messaging information, for example, a location of the user device <b>102</b>, a direction and/or speed of travel of the user device <b>102</b>, calendar appointments accessible on the user device <b>102</b>, contacts accessible on the user device <b>102</b>, and information from applications executing on the user device <b>102</b>. The communication server <b>110</b> may also receive context information from other sources, including social media information received from social media services and the like.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The communication server <b>110</b> includes a messaging engine <b>112</b> and a user database <b>114</b>. The messaging engine <b>112</b> provides functionality for receiving messages from and delivering messages to users of the messaging system <b>100</b>. As noted above, the messaging engine <b>112</b> may provide functionality for receiving and delivering messages using any of a variety of messaging protocols, including web-chat (e.g., a chat application of a web-page hosted by the communication server <b>110</b>), e-mail, extensible messaging and presence protocol (XMPP), short message service (SMS) texting, multimedia messaging service (MMS), mobile chat (e.g., via an application installed on a user device <b>102</b>, chat services provided by gaming consoles, and application program interfaces (APIs) that third party application can use to send messages, among others).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some cases, users may be presented with a list of other users with which they may communicate via the communication server <b>110</b>. The list may be populated by contacts that the user has added or that have been automatically added based on information sent to the communication server <b>110</b>. Additionally or alternatively, the list may include one or more users that are members of a proximity-based messaging group that includes the user. Users that are members of a proximity-based messaging group may communicate with one another, whether the users are strangers (e.g., have no prior connections to one another) or have some previous connection to one another. A message sent within a proximity-based messaging group may be group-wide, meaning all members can see it, or targeted, meaning it is sent only to one or more members of the group. For example, members of a proximity-based messaging group may be presented with a list of other members of the group, and may be able to send messages to one, some, or all of the other members. Users may be members of multiple proximity-based messaging groups.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Proximity-based messaging groups may be established by users or automatically based on a number of user devices <b>102</b> that are proximate to one another. Proximity-based messaging groups may have an associated active area, and user devices <b>102</b> within the active area may be members of the proximity-based messaging group. Proximity-based messaging groups may be associated with events, such as music festivals, concerts, sporting events, and other gatherings and events. The active area of a proximity-based messaging group may correspond to a location of an event, an area surrounding an event, an area within an event location, and the like.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The messaging engine <b>112</b> may automatically determine users that are members of a proximity-based messaging group. In some cases, the users that make up a proximity-based messaging group may be determined based on information received from user devices <b>102</b>, including device locations, device movement information (e.g., speed and/or direction of movement), calendar appointments, and information from applications executing on the user devices.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The messaging engine <b>112</b> may analyze location information received from user devices <b>102</b> to automatically determine the members of a proximity-based messaging group based on their proximity to one another and/or their proximity to a reference location. The messaging engine <b>112</b> may determine an active area for a proximity-based messaging group, and may add one or more users whose user device <b>102</b> is within the active area to the proximity-based messaging group.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The messaging engine <b>112</b> may analyze movement information received from user devices <b>102</b> to automatically determine the members of a proximity-based messaging group. Movement information may include a direction of motion of the user device <b>102</b>, a speed of motion of the user device <b>102</b>, a route or destination from a navigation application, ride-share application, or other application executing on the user device <b>102</b>, and the like. As one example, if a user device <b>102</b> is not within an active area for a proximity-based messaging group but is moving towards an active area, the user of the user device <b>102</b> may be added to the proximity-based messaging group. In some cases, the user may be added to the proximity-based messaging group only if the user device <b>102</b> is also within a predetermined distance of the active area.
