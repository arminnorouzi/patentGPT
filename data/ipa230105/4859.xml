Generally, such prediction system may generate predictions about behaviors and engagement (e.g., email open rate, link click through rate, engagement frequency) of users of a single entity (e.g., customers of a retailer). For example, data about users' behaviors and engagement patterns may be analyzed to extract features to be used as inputs for the prediction system. However, a single entity may have limited data and the prediction may suffer from an under-fitting problem because the prediction model may not have sufficient data from which to learn.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In order to overcome under-fitting, data from a plurality of entities may be utilized in a global model. The global model may be trained by pooling data from multiple entities together. However, such approach makes a false assumption that customers behave the same across different entities. As such, the resulting model may lack personalization for an individual entity.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The accompanying drawings, which are included to provide a further understanding of the disclosed subject matter, are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification.

For example, mean squared error may be used for regression and cross entropy may be used for classification. Generally, a formula of this optimization may be rewritten as:</p><p id="p-0016" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mrow>   <mi>min</mi>   <mo>&#x2062;</mo>   <mrow>    <mi>L</mi>    <mo>&#x2061;</mo>    <mo>(</mo>    <mrow>     <mi>y</mi>     <mo>,</mo>     <mover accent="true">      <mi>y</mi>      <mi>&#x2c6;</mi>     </mover>    </mrow>    <mo>)</mo>   </mrow>  </mrow>  <mo>=</mo>  <mrow>   <mfrac>    <mn>1</mn>    <mi>N</mi>   </mfrac>   <mo>&#x2062;</mo>   <mrow>    <msub>     <mo>&#x2211;</mo>     <mi>i</mi>    </msub>    <mrow>     <msub>      <mi>w</mi>      <mi>i</mi>     </msub>     <mo>&#xd7;</mo>     <mrow>      <mi>L</mi>      <mo>&#x2061;</mo>      <mo>(</mo>      <mrow>       <msub>        <mi>y</mi>        <mi>i</mi>       </msub>       <mo>,</mo>       <msub>        <mover accent="true">         <mi>y</mi>         <mi>&#x2c6;</mi>        </mover>        <mi>i</mi>       </msub>      </mrow>      <mo>)</mo>     </mrow>    </mrow>   </mrow>  </mrow> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0017" num="0015">where y<sub>i </sub>is the i<sup>th </sup>target, &#x177;<sub>i </sub>is the i<sup>th </sup>prediction, and L(y<sub>i</sub>,&#x177;<sub>i</sub>) is a loss function measuring dissimilarity scores between targets and predictions. w<sub>i </sub>is a sample weight which determines how important the i<sup>th </sup>data sample is in the model. Be default, w is set to be 1 for all samples in a global model. Such sample weight also controls the contribution to the model. If the weight w<sub>i </sub>is zero, the i<sup>th </sup>data sample is not used at all in the model. If the sample weight is doubled to two, it is equivalent to adding a duplicate i<sup>th </sup>data sample to the model.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0016">When working with data samples of multiple entities or tenants, model boosting may be performed by optimizing weight values. Given tenant A (from among multiple tenants), higher weights may be intuitively given to samples more relevant to tenant A while reducing weights assigned to other, non-tenant A, samples. However, it may be difficult to determine how relevant between tenant A and non-tenant A samples without well-defined metrics. In addition, it may require per sample level computation which may not be feasible in some cases.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0017">To address this problem, in some implementations weights may be assigned at a tenant level (e.g., tenant A and non-tenant A) and allow samples from the same tenant to share the same sample weight (e.g., a first weight for tenant A samples and a second weight for non-tenant A samples). This may alleviate the problem significantly when the number of tenants (e.g., individual entities) is small. However, it may become severe when the number of tenants grows. Another approach to solve this problem may be segmentation. Segmentation may be achieved by dividing tenants into a small number of groups and treating each group as a big virtual tenant. In this way, a strong assumption may be made that tenants in the same group have the same characteristics. In this situation, the accuracy of a prediction system may rely on not only core prediction models, but also the quality of upstream clustering algorithms. This approach (i.e., segmentation) may become more challenging to debug and tune the system because of the additional complexity. Thus, a simplified but effective solution that provides weight adjustment between tenant A and non-tenant A data samples is needed.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0018">Implementations of the disclosed subject matter provide methods, computer readable media, and devices for determining a hyperparameter for influencing non-local samples in machine learning.

In various implementations, system <b>100</b> may include, for example, machine learning model <b>110</b> that functions or otherwise serves as a prediction system to generate prediction <b>116</b>. Prediction <b>116</b> may represent, for example, a prediction about future user behavior, such as behavior of users of a single entity. For example, an entity, such as a retailer, may want to predict how users associated with the entity, such as customers, may respond or otherwise engage with the entity, such as in response to a mailer, flyer, email, web ad, or the like. Although prediction <b>116</b> is shown as a singular prediction, this is only for simplicity and the prediction may represent a collection of predictions.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0028">In various implementations, system <b>100</b> may include, for example, a set of local samples <b>102</b> and a set of non-local samples <b>104</b>. The set of local samples <b>102</b> may include, for example, data samples associated with a single entity. The set of non-local samples <b>104</b> may include, for example, data samples associated with a plurality of entities other than the single entity. The data samples, either local or non-local, may represent actions and/or behaviors of various users. For example, local data samples may represent behavior of users associated with the single entity (e.g., customers of a retailer) and non-local data samples may represent behavior of users associated with the plurality of other entities.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0029">In various implementations, local weight <b>106</b> may be assigned to one or more data samples of the set of local data samples <b>102</b>. In addition, a range of non-local weights <b>108</b><i>a . . . n </i>may be defined in association with the set of non-local samples <b>104</b>. In various implementations, a range of hyperparameters <b>112</b><i>a . . . n </i>may be determined based on the range of non-local weights <b>108</b><i>a . . . n</i>. As used herein, a &#x201c;hyperparameter&#x201d; has its normal meaning in machine learning and refers to a parameter of a machine learning system that is used to control one or more aspects of the learning process of the system, as opposed to other parameters that may be derived based on training.<sub>[A1]</sub>An optimized hyperparameter <b>114</b> may be selected from the range of hyperparameters <b>112</b><i>a . . . n</i>. As used herein, a hyperparameter is &#x201c;optimized&#x201d; if it is more optimal, i.e., more computationally efficient, than one or more other hyperparameters. Thus, an &#x201c;optimized&#x201d; hyperparameter need not be the &#x201c;most optimized&#x201d; hyperparameter for a given situation. More generally, unless indicated to the contrary, a metric or variable is &#x201c;optimized&#x201d; if it is more efficient or otherwise more optimal than one or more other values of the same metric or variable. For example, machine learning model <b>110</b> may be repeatedly utilized with one or more hyperparameters <b>112</b><i>a . . . n</i>.

However, since the set of non-local samples <b>104</b> includes data samples from other entities, the user behavior represented by those data samples may not be consistent with user behavior represented by the set of local samples <b>102</b>. For example, the set of non-local samples <b>104</b> may include data samples from different types of entities and/or various types of users. The single entity may be, for example, a brick-and-mortar retailer while the other entities may include, for example, online retailers, news sites, banks, brick-and-mortar retailers, informational websites, streaming services, and the like. By assigning an optimized non-local weight based on the optimized hyperparameter <b>114</b> to the set of non-local samples <b>104</b>, machine learning model <b>110</b> may have a sufficient number of data samples from which to learn while limiting any impact of dissimilarity of the other entities.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0031">In various implementations, a given entity or tenant may correspond to the i<sup>th </sup>entity and a local weight W<sub>i</sub><sup>in </sup>may be assigned to data samples associated with the given entity (i.e., set of local data samples).

In some implementations, the prediction may be a prediction of an action to be taken by one or more individuals associated with the first entity.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0052">As disclosed herein, determining an optimized hyperparameter for influencing non-local samples in machine learning may enable improved performance of a machine learning model by ensuring a sufficient amount of training data without losing personalization of a target entity. In a traditional approach, data from a single organization may be utilized to train a machine learning prediction model. However, such data may be limited (i.e., too small of a data sample) to sufficiently train the model. To offset the limited data of a single organization, data from a number of organizations may be used. The problem with using data from multiple organizations is that the various organizations may not be identical or sufficiently similar to accurately model for the target organization. By identifying an appropriate sample weight to be applied to data from other organizations, an amount of dissimilarity with the target organization may be minimized and the accuracy of the model may be improved. As such, the disclosed subject matter enables a machine learning prediction model to train using a larger set of data and, in turn, provide a more accurate prediction.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0053">One or more parts of the above implementations may include software. Software is a general term whose meaning can range from part of the code and/or metadata of a single computer program to the entirety of multiple programs. A computer program (also referred to as a program) comprises code and optionally data. Code (sometimes referred to as computer program code or program code) comprises software instructions (also referred to as instructions). Instructions may be executed by hardware to perform operations. Executing software includes executing code, which includes executing instructions. The execution of a program to perform a task involves executing some or all of the instructions in that program.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0054">An electronic device (also referred to as a device, computing device, computer, etc.) includes hardware and software. For example, an electronic device may include a set of one or more processors coupled to one or more machine-readable storage media (e.g., non-volatile memory such as magnetic disks, optical disks, read only memory (ROM), Flash memory, phase change memory, solid state drives (SSDs)) to store code and optionally data. For instance, an electronic device may include non-volatile memory (with slower read/write times) and volatile memory (e.g., dynamic random-access memory (DRAM), static random-access memory (SRAM)). Non-volatile memory persists code/data even when the electronic device is turned off or when power is otherwise removed, and the electronic device copies that part of the code that is to be executed by the set of processors of that electronic device from the non-volatile memory into the volatile memory of that electronic device during operation because volatile memory typically has faster read/write times. As another example, an electronic device may include a non-volatile memory (e.g., phase change memory) that persists code/data when the electronic device has power removed, and that has sufficiently fast read/write times such that, rather than copying the part of the code to be executed into volatile memory, the code/data may be provided directly to the set of processors (e.g., loaded into a cache of the set of processors). In other words, this non-volatile memory operates as both long term storage and main memory, and thus the electronic device may have no or only a small amount of volatile memory for main memory.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0055">In addition to storing code and/or data on machine-readable storage media, typical electronic devices can transmit and/or receive code and/or data over one or more machine-readable transmission media (also called a carrier) (e.g., electrical, optical, radio, acoustical or other forms of propagated signals&#x2014;such as carrier waves, and/or infrared signals). For instance, typical electronic devices also include a set of one or more physical network interface(s) to establish network connections (to transmit and/or receive code and/or data using propagated signals) with other electronic devices. Thus, an electronic device may store and transmit (internally and/or with other electronic devices over a network) code and/or data with one or more machine-readable media (also referred to as computer-readable media).</p><p id="p-0065" num="0056">Software instructions (also referred to as instructions) are capable of causing (also referred to as operable to cause and configurable to cause) a set of processors to perform operations when the instructions are executed by the set of processors. The phrase &#x201c;capable of causing&#x201d; (and synonyms mentioned above) includes various scenarios (or combinations thereof), such as instructions that are always executed versus instructions that may be executed. For example, instructions may be executed: 1) only in certain situations when the larger program is executed (e.g., a condition is fulfilled in the larger program; an event occurs such as a software or hardware interrupt, user input (e.g., a keystroke, a mouse-click, a voice command); a message is published, etc.); or 2) when the instructions are called by another program or part thereof (whether or not executed in the same or a different process, thread, lightweight thread, etc.). These scenarios may or may not require that a larger program, of which the instructions are a part, be currently configured to use those instructions (e.g., may or may not require that a user enables a feature, the feature or instructions be unlocked or enabled, the larger program is configured using data and the program's inherent functionality, etc.). As shown by these exemplary scenarios, &#x201c;capable of causing&#x201d; (and synonyms mentioned above) does not require &#x201c;causing&#x201d; but the mere capability to cause. While the term &#x201c;instructions&#x201d; may be used to refer to the instructions that when executed cause the performance of the operations described herein, the term may or may not also refer to other instructions that a program may include. Thus, instructions, code, program, and software are capable of causing operations when executed, whether the operations are always performed or sometimes performed (e.g., in the scenarios described previously). The phrase &#x201c;the instructions when executed&#x201d; refers to at least the instructions that when executed cause the performance of the operations described herein but may or may not refer to the execution of the other instructions.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0057">Electronic devices are designed for and/or used for a variety of purposes, and different terms may reflect those purposes (e.g., user devices, network devices). Some user devices are designed to mainly be operated as servers (sometimes referred to as server devices), while others are designed to mainly be operated as clients (sometimes referred to as client devices, client computing devices, client computers, or end user devices; examples of which include desktops, workstations, laptops, personal digital assistants, smartphones, wearables, augmented reality (AR) devices, virtual reality (VR) devices, mixed reality (MR) devices, etc.). The software executed to operate a user device (typically a server device) as a server may be referred to as server software or server code), while the software executed to operate a user device (typically a client device) as a client may be referred to as client software or client code. A server provides one or more services (also referred to as serves) to one or more clients.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0058">The term &#x201c;user&#x201d; refers to an entity (e.g., an individual person) that uses an electronic device. Software and/or services may use credentials to distinguish different accounts associated with the same and/or different users. Users can have one or more roles, such as administrator, programmer/developer, and end user roles. As an administrator, a user typically uses electronic devices to administer them for other users, and thus an administrator often works directly and/or indirectly with server devices and client devices.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an electronic device <b>300</b> according to some example implementations. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> includes hardware <b>320</b> comprising a set of one or more processor(s) <b>322</b>, a set of one or more network interfaces <b>324</b> (wireless and/or wired), and machine-readable media <b>326</b> having stored therein software <b>328</b> (which includes instructions executable by the set of one or more processor(s) <b>322</b>).

Again, in electronic devices where compute virtualization is used, during operation, an instance of the software <b>328</b> is executed within the software container <b>304</b>A on the virtualization layer <b>308</b>.

A system <b>340</b> includes hardware (e.g., a set of one or more server devices) and software to provide service(s) <b>342</b>, including a consolidated order manager. In some implementations the system <b>340</b> is in one or more datacenter(s). These datacenter(s) may be: 1) first party datacenter(s), which are datacenter(s) owned and/or operated by the same entity that provides and/or operates some or all of the software that provides the service(s) <b>342</b>; and/or 2) third-party datacenter(s), which are datacenter(s) owned and/or operated by one or more different entities than the entity that provides the service(s) <b>342</b> (e.g., the different entities may host some or all of the software provided and/or operated by the entity that provides the service(s) <b>342</b>). For example, third-party datacenters may be owned and/or operated by entities providing public cloud services.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0063">The system <b>340</b> is coupled to user devices <b>380</b>A-<b>380</b>S over a network <b>382</b>. The service(s) <b>342</b> may be on-demand services that are made available to one or more of the users <b>384</b>A-<b>384</b>S working for one or more entities other than the entity which owns and/or operates the on-demand services (those users sometimes referred to as outside users) so that those entities need not be concerned with building and/or maintaining a system, but instead may make use of the service(s) <b>342</b> when needed (e.g., when needed by the users <b>384</b>A-<b>384</b>S). The service(s) <b>342</b> may communicate with each other and/or with one or more of the user devices <b>380</b>A-<b>380</b>S via one or more APIs (e.g., a REST API). In some implementations, the user devices <b>380</b>A-<b>380</b>S are operated by users <b>384</b>A-<b>384</b>S, and each may be operated as a client device and/or a server device. In some implementations, one or more of the user devices <b>380</b>A-<b>380</b>S are separate ones of the electronic device <b>300</b> or include one or more features of the electronic device <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0064">In some implementations, the system <b>340</b> is a multi-tenant system (also known as a multi-tenant architecture). The term multi-tenant system refers to a system in which various elements of hardware and/or software of the system may be shared by one or more tenants. A multi-tenant system may be operated by a first entity (sometimes referred to a multi-tenant system provider, operator, or vendor; or simply a provider, operator, or vendor) that provides one or more services to the tenants (in which case the tenants are customers of the operator and sometimes referred to as operator customers). A tenant includes a group of users who share a common access with specific privileges. The tenants may be different entities (e.g., different companies, different departments/divisions of a company, and/or other types of entities), and some or all of these entities may be vendors that sell or otherwise provide products and/or services to their customers (sometimes referred to as tenant customers). A multi-tenant system may allow each tenant to input tenant specific data for user management, tenant-specific functionality, configuration, customizations, non-functional properties, associated applications, etc. A tenant may have one or more roles relative to a system and/or service. For example, in the context of a customer relationship management (CRM) system or service, a tenant may be a vendor using the CRM system or service to manage information the tenant has regarding one or more customers of the vendor. As another example, in the context of Data as a Service (DAAS), one set of tenants may be vendors providing data and another set of tenants may be customers of different ones or all of the vendors' data. As another example, in the context of Platform as a Service (PAAS), one set of tenants may be third-party application developers providing applications/services and another set of tenants may be customers of different ones or all of the third-party application developers.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0065">Multi-tenancy can be implemented in different ways. In some implementations, a multi-tenant architecture may include a single software instance (e.g., a single database instance) which is shared by multiple tenants; other implementations may include a single software instance (e.g., database instance) per tenant; yet other implementations may include a mixed model; e.g., a single software instance (e.g., an application instance) per tenant and another software instance (e.g., database instance) shared by multiple tenants.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0066">In one implementation, the system <b>340</b> is a multi-tenant cloud computing architecture supporting multiple services, such as one or more of the following types of services: Customer relationship management (CRM); Configure, price, quote (CPQ); Business process modeling (BPM); Customer support; Marketing; Productivity; Database-as-a-Service; Data-as-a-Service (DAAS or DaaS); Platform-as-a-service (PAAS or PaaS); Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IAAS or IaaS) (e.g., virtual machines, servers, and/or storage); Analytics; Community; Internet-of-Things (IoT); Industry-specific; Artificial intelligence (AI); Application marketplace (&#x201c;app store&#x201d;); Data modeling; Security; and Identity and access management (IAM). For example, system <b>340</b> may include an application platform <b>344</b> that enables PAAS for creating, managing, and executing one or more applications developed by the provider of the application platform <b>344</b>, users accessing the system <b>340</b> via one or more of user devices <b>380</b>A-<b>380</b>S, or third-party application developers accessing the system <b>340</b> via one or more of user devices <b>380</b>A-<b>380</b>S.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0067">In some implementations, one or more of the service(s) <b>342</b> may use one or more multi-tenant databases <b>346</b>, as well as system data storage <b>350</b> for system data <b>352</b> accessible to system <b>340</b>. In certain implementations, the system <b>340</b> includes a set of one or more servers that are running on server electronic devices and that are configured to handle requests for any authorized user associated with any tenant (there is no server affinity for a user and/or tenant to a specific server). The user devices <b>380</b>A-<b>380</b>S communicate with the server(s) of system <b>340</b> to request and update tenant-level data and system-level data hosted by system <b>340</b>, and in response the system <b>340</b> (e.g., one or more servers in system <b>340</b>) automatically may generate one or more Structured Query Language (SQL) statements (e.g., one or more SQL queries) that are designed to access the desired information from the multi-tenant database(s) <b>346</b> and/or system data storage <b>350</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0068">In some implementations, the service(s) <b>342</b> are implemented using virtual applications dynamically created at run time responsive to queries from the user devices <b>380</b>A-<b>380</b>S and in accordance with metadata, including: 1) metadata that describes constructs (e.g., forms, reports, workflows, user access privileges, business logic) that are common to multiple tenants; and/or 2) metadata that is tenant specific and describes tenant specific constructs (e.g., tables, reports, dashboards, interfaces, etc.) and is stored in a multi-tenant database. To that end, the program code <b>360</b> may be a runtime engine that materializes application data from the metadata; that is, there is a clear separation of the compiled runtime engine (also known as the system kernel), tenant data, and the metadata, which makes it possible to independently update the system kernel and tenant-specific applications and schemas, with virtually no risk of one affecting the others. Further, in one implementation, the application platform <b>344</b> includes an application setup mechanism that supports application developers' creation and management of applications, which may be saved as metadata by save routines. Invocations to such applications, including the framework for modeling heterogeneous feature sets, may be coded using Procedural Language/Structured Object Query Language (PL/SOQL) that provides a programming language style interface. Invocations to applications may be detected by one or more system processes, which manages retrieving application metadata for the tenant making the invocation and executing the metadata as an application in a software container (e.g., a virtual machine).</p><p id="p-0078" num="0069">Network <b>382</b> may be any one or any combination of a LAN (local area network), WAN (wide area network), telephone network, wireless network, point-to-point network, star network, token ring network, hub network, or other appropriate configuration. The network may comply with one or more network protocols, including an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) protocol, a 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) protocol, a 4<sup>th </sup>generation wireless protocol (4G) (e.g., the Long Term Evolution (LTE) standard, LTE Advanced, LTE Advanced Pro), a fifth generation wireless protocol (5G), and/or similar wired and/or wireless protocols, and may include one or more intermediary devices for routing data between the system <b>340</b> and the user devices <b>380</b>A-<b>380</b>S.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0070">Each user device <b>380</b>A-<b>380</b>S (such as a desktop personal computer, workstation, laptop, Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), smartphone, smartwatch, wearable device, augmented reality (AR) device, virtual reality (VR) device, etc.) typically includes one or more user interface devices, such as a keyboard, a mouse, a trackball, a touch pad, a touch screen, a pen or the like, video or touch free user interfaces, for interacting with a graphical user interface (GUI) provided on a display (e.g., a monitor screen, a liquid crystal display (LCD), a head-up display, a head-mounted display, etc.) in conjunction with pages, forms, applications and other information provided by system <b>340</b>. For example, the user interface device can be used to access data and applications hosted by system <b>340</b>, and to perform searches on stored data, and otherwise allow one or more of users <b>384</b>A-<b>384</b>S to interact with various GUI pages that may be presented to the one or more of users <b>384</b>A-<b>384</b>S.
