The rearward wall <b>26</b> of the cabin structure <b>14</b> and the forward wall <b>30</b> of the cargo area structure <b>16</b> face one another but are spaced apart from one another by a gap G, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>11</b></figref>. The gap G does not have a fixed value but can be larger in some areas between the rearward wall <b>26</b> and the forward wall <b>30</b> smaller in other areas between the rearward wall <b>26</b> and the forward wall <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>6</b></figref>, the forward wall <b>30</b> of the cargo area structure <b>16</b> includes at least a main panel <b>40</b> and a header panel <b>42</b> that is attached to and extends along an upper area of the main panel <b>40</b> of the forward wall <b>30</b>.

The elastic bumper elements <b>46</b> are installed to corresponding ones of the openings <b>44</b> of the header panel <b>42</b> of the forward wall <b>30</b> such that in response to flexing of the vehicle frame structure <b>12</b>, the elastic bumper elements <b>46</b> can contact the rearward wall <b>26</b> of the cabin structure <b>14</b> thereby restricting or preventing direct contact between the rearward wall <b>26</b> and the forward wall <b>30</b>. The openings <b>44</b> are located at opposing ends of the header panel <b>42</b> and hence, the elastic bumper elements <b>46</b> are spaced apart from one another and are installed proximate opposite upper ends <b>42</b><i>a </i>and <b>42</b><i>b </i>of the header panel <b>42</b> and hence of the forward wall <b>30</b> of the cargo area structure <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The elastic bumper elements <b>46</b> are cylindrically shaped, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>-<b>14</b></figref>.

Fasteners F<sub>1 </sub>extend through openings in the utility track <b>58</b> and through a nut <b>60</b> welded in position to the main wall <b>40</b> within the hollow area <b>50</b>. The elastic bumper elements <b>46</b> are installed to the header panel <b>42</b> at locations adjacent to corresponding ones of the fasteners F<sub>1 </sub>and the nut <b>60</b>. The combination of the main panel <b>40</b> of the forward wall <b>30</b>, the header panel <b>42</b> and the utility track <b>58</b> provides the forward wall <b>30</b> with rigidity and strength.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The utility track <b>58</b> is a well-known conventional component of cargo areas.

When such flexing occurs, it is possible for areas of the forward wall <b>30</b> to move into close proximity to the rearward wall <b>26</b>. In instances of large amounts of flexing of the frame structure <b>12</b>, it may be possible for the forward wall <b>30</b> to make contact with the rearward wall <b>26</b>. In such extreme circumstance, the bumper elements <b>46</b> contact the rearward wall <b>26</b> of the cabin structure <b>14</b>. The presence of the bumper elements <b>46</b> minimizes and in most cases, eliminates paint scratching and minimizes or prevents any damage to the rearward wall <b>26</b> due to flexing of the frame structure <b>12</b>.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b> and <b>16</b></figref>, a bumper element <b>146</b> in accordance with a second embodiment will now be explained.
