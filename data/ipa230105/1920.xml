end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Self-driving material-transport vehicles navigate and travel within their environments by planning a path to a destination relative to their location within the environment and/or a map of the environment. As the vehicle travels its planned path, it uses sensors to detect objects the vehicle encounters while travelling in the environment. A vehicle may respond to a detected object in a variety of ways.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">For example, when an object is detected within a particular region (relative to the vehicle), the vehicle may evoke a &#x201c;safety stop&#x201d;, meaning that the vehicle stops (e.g. cuts power to the motors) in order to avoid a collision with the object. Such a region (relative to the vehicle) may be deemed a &#x201c;safety field&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In another example, when object is detected within a particular region (relative to the vehicle), the vehicle may attempt to avoid the object by steering around the object. Such a region may be deemed a &#x201c;vehicle footprint&#x201d; of the vehicle. Generally, a vehicle footprint is larger than a safety field, and, in some cases, when an object is detected within the vehicle footprint, the vehicle steers in order to prevent the object from entering the safety field with the intention of avoiding a safety stop.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">According to some embodiments, the vehicle navigates (e.g. plans a path through its environment) in consideration of one or both of the safety field and the footprint. Thus, while a larger safety field will generally result in an increase in safety, and a larger footprint will generally result in fewer safety stops, larger safety fields and footprints also result in the vehicle being less able to navigate throughout the environment. In effect, the minimum navigable space of the vehicle will increase.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, there is shown a block diagram of an example self-driving vehicle <b>110</b>. The self-driving vehicle <b>110</b> includes a sensor system <b>120</b>, a control system <b>140</b> and a drive system <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The sensor system <b>120</b> can include one or more sensors for collecting data from the environment of the self-driving vehicle <b>110</b>. For example, the sensor system <b>120</b> can include a LiDAR device (or other optical, sonar, or radar-based range-finding devices operating on known principles such as time-of-flight). The sensor system <b>120</b> can include optical sensors, such as video cameras and systems (e.g., stereo vision, structured light).</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The control system <b>140</b> can include a processor <b>142</b>, a memory (or storage unit) <b>144</b>, and a communication interface <b>146</b>. The control system <b>140</b> facilitates the operation of the self-driving vehicle <b>110</b>. The control system <b>140</b> can store an electronic map that represents the environment of the self-driving vehicle <b>110</b>, such as a facility, in the memory <b>144</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The processor <b>142</b> can include any suitable processors, controllers or digital signal processors that can provide sufficient processing power depending on the configuration, purposes and requirements of the self-driving vehicle <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, the processor <b>142</b> can include more than one processor with each processor being configured to perform different dedicated tasks.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The memory <b>144</b> can store data to be used during the operation of the self-driving vehicle <b>110</b> and/or to facilitate the operation of the self-driving vehicle <b>110</b>. Example data can include operating data in respect of its operation, the electronic map representing its environment, data in respect of one or more other self-driving vehicles <b>110</b>, data in respect of its mission, etc.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In some embodiments, the memory <b>144</b> can store software applications executable by the processor <b>142</b>. For example, the software application includes drive system control and sensor system control applications.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The memory <b>144</b> can store data that may be used by the application executed by the processor <b>142</b>. For example, the memory <b>144</b> can store vehicle dynamics attributes, navigational constraints, and capability reduction parameters, as will be further described. According to some embodiments, such data may be determined (e.g. generated or manipulated) by the processor <b>142</b> and stored in the memory <b>144</b>. According to some embodiments, such data may be received from a fleet-management system or other computer system that is in communication with the vehicle (e.g. via the communication interface <b>146</b>) and then stored in the memory.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The communication interface <b>146</b> can include any component for facilitating communication with the components of a communication system via a communication network. For example, the communication interface <b>146</b> can include a wireless transceiver for communicating within a wireless communications network.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The self-driving vehicle <b>110</b> can receive a mission from a fleet management system or other external system. The mission received from the fleet management system can include one or more waypoints or destination locations. Based on the received mission, the control system <b>140</b> can determine a path for the self-driving vehicle <b>110</b> to navigate to the waypoint or destination location with minimal, if any, instructions from another system or human operator. The control system <b>140</b> and the sensor system <b>120</b> can navigate the self-driving vehicle <b>110</b> without any additional navigational aids (e.g., navigational targets, magnetic strips, or paint/tape traces) installed in the environment.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">For example, the control system <b>140</b> can generate a path for the self-driving vehicle <b>110</b> to a destination location based on the location of the self-driving vehicle <b>110</b>. The control system <b>140</b> can then operate the drive system <b>130</b> to direct the self-driving vehicle <b>110</b> along the planned path. As the self-driving vehicle <b>110</b> travels along the planned path, the sensor system <b>120</b> can collect data from the environment, which includes detecting obstacles with which the vehicle might be on a collision course by staying on the planned path. The collected data can assist the control system <b>140</b> to track the progress of the self-driving vehicle <b>110</b> along the planned path, to update a location of the self-driving vehicle <b>110</b> within the environment, and to help the vehicle avoid collisions with obstacles. The control system <b>140</b> can determine when an unexpected obstacle is in the planned path using the data collected by the sensor system <b>120</b>, and modify the planned path to navigate around the obstacle.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In some embodiments, the self-driving vehicle <b>110</b> can be equipped with one or more end effectors for facilitating interaction with objects within the environment. Example end effectors can include a gripper, a clamp, a shovel, a broom, a vacuum, a rotating spindle, or any other tools. The operation of the end effectors can be controlled by the control system <b>140</b> and, in some embodiments, with consideration of the data collected by the sensor system <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The self-driving vehicle <b>110</b> can operate in environments with varied terrains and/or regulated zones that require environmental qualifications. Example regulated zones can include sterile environments, and temperature-controlled environments (e.g., high or low temperature environments). The self-driving vehicle <b>110</b> can be configured to comply with the requirements of the various terrains and/or zones within its environment. For example, a self-driving vehicle <b>110</b> can be sterilized to operate in a sterile environment and subsequently only operate within the boundaries of the sterile environment in order to maintain its qualification. Self-driving vehicles <b>110</b> may undergo environmental testing or include higher rated components to meet other environmental qualifications.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">According to some embodiments, the self-driving vehicle <b>110</b> may be a self-driving car or a self-driving truck that can operate on public roadways.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">According to some embodiments, a self-driving vehicle safety system may include any or all of the components of the sensor system <b>120</b>, the drive system <b>130</b>, and the control system <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, there is shown a block diagram of another example self-driving vehicle <b>210</b>. The self-driving vehicle <b>210</b> can act as a self-driving material-transport vehicle <b>210</b> for transporting objects between different locations. The self-driving material-transport vehicle <b>210</b> can include a cargo component for carrying loads.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">For example, the cargo component can be a flatbed or a bucket having sidewalls to prevent loads from falling out as the self-driving transport vehicle <b>210</b> moves. The self-driving transport vehicle <b>210</b> can include cargo securing mechanisms to secure the load and prevent the load from falling off the self-driving transport vehicle <b>210</b>. Although the self-driving vehicle <b>210</b> can act as a self-driving transport vehicle, the self-driving vehicle <b>210</b> is not limited to transporting objects.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Similar to the self-driving vehicle <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the self-driving vehicle <b>210</b> includes a drive system <b>230</b>, a sensor system <b>220</b> and a control system <b>240</b>. According to some embodiments, a self-driving vehicle safety system may include any or all of the components of the sensor system <b>220</b>, the drive system <b>230</b>, and the control system <b>240</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The drive system <b>230</b> includes a motor and/or brakes connected to drive wheels <b>232</b><i>a </i>and <b>232</b><i>b </i>for driving the self-driving transport vehicle <b>210</b>. The motor can be, but is not limited to, an electric motor, a combustion engine, or a combination/hybrid thereof. Depending on the application of the self-driving vehicle <b>210</b>, the drive system <b>230</b> may also include control interfaces that can be used for controlling the drive system <b>230</b>. For example, the drive system <b>230</b> may be controlled to drive the drive wheel <b>232</b><i>a </i>at a different speed than the drive wheel <b>232</b><i>b </i>in order to turn the self-driving transport vehicle <b>210</b>. Different embodiments may use different numbers of drive wheels, such as two, three, four, etc.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">A number of wheels <b>234</b> may be included. The self-driving vehicle <b>210</b> includes wheels <b>234</b><i>a</i>, <b>234</b><i>b</i>, <b>234</b><i>c</i>, and <b>234</b><i>d</i>. The wheels <b>234</b> may be wheels that are capable of allowing the self-driving transport vehicle <b>210</b> to turn, such as castors, omni-directional wheels, and mecanum wheels. In some embodiments, the self-driving transport vehicle <b>210</b> can be equipped with special tires for rugged surfaces or particular floor surfaces unique to its environment.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The sensor system <b>220</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> includes example sensors <b>220</b><i>a</i>, <b>220</b><i>b</i>, <b>220</b><i>c</i>, and <b>220</b><i>d</i>. The sensors <b>220</b><i>a</i>, <b>220</b><i>b</i>, <b>220</b><i>c</i>, and <b>220</b><i>d </i>can be optical sensors arranged to provide three-dimensional (e.g. binocular or RGB-D) imaging.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The positions of the components <b>234</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>240</b>, <b>230</b>, <b>232</b> of the self-driving transport vehicle <b>210</b> are shown for illustrative purposes and are not limited to the illustrated positions. Other configurations of the components <b>234</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>240</b>, <b>230</b>, <b>232</b> can be used depending on the application of the self-driving transport vehicle <b>210</b> and/or the environment in which the self-driving transport vehicle <b>210</b> will be used.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, there is shown a self-driving vehicle <b>300</b> with associated safety fields. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, the self-driving vehicle <b>300</b> has a navigational sensor <b>310</b> located at the front of the vehicle <b>300</b> and the centerline of the vehicle <b>300</b>. Three safety fields are shown, each of which extends radially from the sensor <b>310</b>. Each safety field is shown as a semi-circle, which is a consequence of the placement of the sensor <b>310</b> on the vehicle <b>300</b>. In other words, the safety fields do not extend behind the front edge of the vehicle <b>300</b> since, in the example provided, the sensor <b>310</b> is obscured by the body of the vehicle <b>300</b> itself; in other words, creating blind spots. Accordingly, different placements of the sensor on the vehicle will result in different blinds spots.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The safety fields generally describe a region of the environment in which the vehicle <b>300</b> is operating. In particular, when an obstacle is detected by the sensor <b>310</b> within a safety field, a safety routine may be evoked for the vehicle <b>300</b> in order to avoid or minimize the impact of a collision between the vehicle <b>300</b> and the obstacle. One example of a safety routine is a safety stop, in which the vehicle is immediately stopped. According to some embodiments, a safety stop can include cutting power to the drive motors (e.g. drive system) of the vehicle <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Typical obstacles can include a human pedestrian, another vehicle, or any other object that is unexpectedly found within the safety field.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Each of the safety fields can be considered to correspond to a particular speed or speed threshold of the vehicle <b>300</b>. For example, the safety field <b>312</b> may be associated with a first speed or speed threshold. The safety field <b>314</b> may be associated with a second speed or speed threshold that is greater than the first speed. The safety field <b>316</b> may be associated with a third speed or speed threshold that is greater than the second speed.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">A particular safety field may be used by the vehicle <b>300</b> depending on a safe stopping distance of the vehicle <b>300</b>. For example, it may be desired to ensure that collisions are avoided by having the vehicle <b>300</b> stop before colliding with an object within the safety field. Alternatively, or additionally, it may be desired to ensure that, in the worst case, any collisions that are experienced are below a maximum impact force. (As such, the case of stopping the vehicle <b>300</b> prior to a collision may be considered the same as a collision with zero impact force).</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">With this in mind, the safe stopping distance can be determined in a variety of ways, having regard to the mass of the vehicle <b>300</b> and the deceleration of the vehicle <b>300</b> as it is coming to a stop.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">According to some embodiments, a data table may be derived that associates the safe stopping distance of the vehicle <b>300</b> at particular speeds. For example, such a table may be based on the assumption that the vehicle <b>300</b> is carrying its maximum payload (i.e. that total mass of the system is the mass of the vehicle plus the mass of the maximum payload that the vehicle <b>300</b> can carry). Considering this total mass, safe stopping distances can be determined for particular speed thresholds. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> could be used to illustrate that, below a first speed threshold, the vehicle <b>300</b> will use the first safety field <b>312</b>. If the speed of the vehicle is greater than the first speed threshold but below a second speed threshold, then the vehicle <b>300</b> will use the second safety field <b>314</b>. Similarly, if the speed of the vehicle is greater than the second speed threshold but below a third speed threshold, then the vehicle will use the third safety field <b>316</b>. According to some embodiments, the highest speed threshold (e.g. the third speed threshold, corresponding to the safety field <b>316</b>) may be the maximum operating speed of the vehicle <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">According to some embodiments, the safety field may be dynamically and/or automatically adjusted as the speed of the vehicle is changed. For example, as the speed of the vehicle is changed, a corresponding new safety stopping distance may be calculated, and the new safe stopping distance may be used to determine a corresponding new safety field.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Generally, the safety fields may be described in terms of a range (or depth) and an angular sweep (or width). Referring to the examples in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, the range of the safety field corresponds to the radius of the respective field from the sensor <b>310</b>, and the angular sweep is approximately 180&#xb0; (e.g. corresponding to the natural blind spots caused by the placement of the sensor <b>310</b> relative to the body of the vehicle <b>300</b>). In other words: generally, as the speed of the vehicle <b>300</b> increases, the range of the safety field increases. For example, if the sensor <b>310</b> is a LiDAR device (i.e. with a rotating laser scan), then the safety field can be established by controlling the range of the LiDAR and the scan angle. Similarly, if the sensor <b>310</b> is a vision system (e.g. one or more video cameras), then the safety field can be established by controlling the depth and field of view of the vision system. According to some embodiments, the safety field may be established by applying a filter to the data from the LiDAR device or vision system.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">According to some embodiments, the determination of the safe stopping distance (or other parameters for establishing the safety field) may be based not only on the speed of the vehicle, but on vehicle dynamics attributes of the vehicle, such as the mass of the vehicle, the mass of a payload (and/or other equipment installed) on the vehicle, the braking force of the vehicle, and the condition of the vehicles components (e.g. the brakes and/or motor which may degrade over time and thus affect the safe stopping distance).</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">According to some embodiments, the speed or speed threshold pertaining to a particular safety field may be described as a velocity or velocity threshold. For example, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, the safety fields may be considered to be based on the assumption that the vehicle <b>3</b>A is driving in a straight line, moving forwards.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, there is shown the self-driving vehicle <b>300</b> with associated footprints corresponding to the safety fields previously described in view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>. Generally, footprints differ from safety fields in that footprints are larger; and footprints are used in order to prevent obstacles from entering the safety fields. Since an obstacle detected within a safety field triggers a safety routine (e.g. a safety stop), it may be desirable to avoid having obstacles enter the safety fields, in order to avoid safety routines that can be costly in terms of time or surprising to onlookers.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In other words: when an obstacle is detected within the footprint of the vehicle <b>300</b>, the vehicle attempts to steer (e.g. change its course) in order to avoid having the obstacle enter the safety field, which is generally a smaller area than the footprint.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The footprints correspond to a safety field. As such, the footprint <b>322</b> corresponds to the safety field <b>312</b>; the footprint <b>324</b> corresponds to the safety field <b>314</b>;</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">and the footprint <b>326</b> corresponds to the safety field <b>316</b>. According to some embodiments, the geometry of each footprint may be based on the geometry of the corresponding safety field. In the examples shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, each of the safety fields and footprints is a half disc (defined by a semi-circle), and the radius (i.e. range) of each footprint is greater than the radius of the corresponding safety field.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Generally, the footprints may be defined using sensors in the same way as previously described for the safety fields.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">For the sake of simplifying explanation, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> depict, and are described in terms of safety fields. However, analogous depictions and descriptions are implied with respect to corresponding footprints as well. For each safety field described hereafter, there may be a corresponding footprint as generally described in terms of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>, there is shown the self-driving vehicle <b>300</b> with a forward-facing sensor <b>310</b> and a rearward-facing sensor <b>330</b>. Rearward-facing safety fields <b>332</b>, <b>334</b>, and <b>336</b> may be used in respect of the rearward-facing sensor <b>330</b>, in the same way as the forward-facing safety fields <b>312</b>, <b>314</b>, and <b>316</b> have been described in respect of the forward-facing sensor <b>310</b>.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Rearward-facing safety fields may be useful for reducing injury or damage from accidents with objects (e.g. human pedestrians) who are approaching the vehicle <b>300</b> unexpectedly from behind. Furthermore, rearward-facing safety fields may be useful for avoiding collision when the vehicle <b>300</b> is performing a turn-in-place (i.e. rotational) operation. For example, if the vehicle <b>300</b> is equipped with differential drive motors, and/or multi-directional wheels, the vehicle may be able to rotate without necessarily moving in a linear direction, in which case the parts of the safety fields extending beyond the sides of the vehicle <b>300</b> may help avoid collision with obstacles at the side of the vehicle <b>300</b>. Furthermore, rearward-facing safety fields may be useful for bi-directional vehicles, such that the vehicle may not have a persistent front and back direction, but may instead drive in the opposite direction at any given time.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">According to some embodiments, and unlike the example depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>, the forward-facing and rearward-facing safety fields need not be symmetrically disposed about the vehicle. For example, it may not be necessary or desirable for the rearward-facing safety field to be as large as the forward-facing safety field, since the vehicle is travelling in the forward direction. As will be further described below, when the vehicle is turning (i.e. driving in an arc), the forward-facing safety field may be adjusted to account for the arced path of the vehicle, but a similar adjustment may not be necessary for the rearward-facing safety field.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref>, there is shown a self-driving vehicle <b>350</b> with a forward-facing sensor <b>360</b> and a rearward-facing sensor <b>380</b>. In the example shown, the sensor <b>360</b> is located on a front-right corner of the self-driving vehicle <b>350</b>, and the sensor <b>380</b> is located on a rear-left corner of the self-driving vehicle <b>350</b>.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">According to some embodiments, orientation of the sensors <b>360</b> and <b>380</b> on the vehicle <b>350</b> can be described as front-corner and opposing rear-corner. In such a configuration, one sensor (e.g. the sensor <b>360</b>) can provide a safety field to the front and on one side of the vehicle <b>350</b>, while the other sensor (e.g. the sensor <b>380</b>) can provide a safety field to the rear and on the other side of the vehicle <b>350</b>. Various configurations of such a front-corner and opposing rear-corner are possible.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">The self-driving vehicle <b>350</b> is exemplary of how the placement of sensors can be made in order to provide different safety field coverages for a self-driving vehicle. It is also exemplary of the fact that the coverage of a safety field can be made somewhat independently of the placement of the sensors. (The coverage is somewhat independent of the placement of the sensors since there will always be some dependence due to natural blind spots that may occur if the sensor is obscured by the body of the vehicle in certain placements).</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">For example, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref>, the safety fields <b>362</b>, <b>364</b>, <b>382</b>, and <b>384</b> are generally elliptical or ovular in shape. Generally, the range of the field set may vary as a function of the angular sweep from the sensor. For example, if the sensor <b>360</b> is a LiDAR sensor that sweeps through 360&#xb0;, then the range of the sensor (e.g. the radius of the ellipse-like region) may be varied as the sensor sweeps through 360&#xb0;. In this way, the safety field can take on any geometric shape; and, notwithstanding any blind spots, any geometric shape can be obtained from a sensor placed anywhere on the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, there is shown a self-driving vehicle <b>400</b> having three safety fields <b>412</b>, <b>414</b>, and <b>416</b>. The safety fields may be determined and generated as previously described. As compared to the safety fields <b>312</b>, <b>314</b>, and <b>316</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, the safety fields <b>412</b>, <b>414</b>, and <b>416</b> can be described in terms of exclusion regions <b>442</b> and <b>444</b>. In other words, the safety fields <b>412</b>, <b>414</b>, and <b>416</b> can be determined by first determining the safety fields <b>312</b>, <b>314</b>, and <b>316</b> respectively, then determining the exclusion regions <b>442</b> and <b>444</b>, and then omitting the exclusion regions from the safety fields <b>312</b>, <b>314</b>, and <b>316</b>. According to some embodiments, once the safety fields <b>412</b>, <b>414</b>, and <b>416</b> have been determined, the sensor <b>410</b> can be instructed to generate the safety fields as previously described.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, there is shown a self-driving vehicle <b>500</b> having three safety fields <b>512</b>, <b>514</b>, and <b>516</b>. The safety fields may be described (and/or determined) with respect to the exclusion regions <b>542</b> and <b>544</b> as generally described in respect of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. Specifically, the safety fields and exclusion regions in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> differ from those in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> in that the exclusion regions <b>542</b> and <b>544</b> are generally circular. While any particular geometry may be used for a safety field (and/or an exclusion region), the safety fields <b>512</b>, <b>514</b>, and <b>516</b>, and exclusion regions <b>542</b> and <b>544</b> are associated with a minimum turning radius (indicated by the radial arrows <b>543</b>) for the self-driving vehicle.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">According to some embodiments, the self-driving vehicle <b>500</b> may be turned in one or both of a turn-in-place operation, or by driving in an arc. The minimum turning radius is generally applicable to the case of driving in an arc.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">According to some embodiments, the self-driving vehicle <b>500</b> may include a drive system having differential drive motors. In such a case, the differential drive motors can perform a turn-in-place operation by driving the differential drive motors in opposite directions, or by driving one drive motor and not another. Such a vehicle may also be driven in an arc by driving both differential drive motors in the same direction but at different speeds.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">According to some embodiments, the self-driving vehicle <b>500</b> may be equipped with a steering system such as an Ackerman type steering system. In such a case, the vehicle may be driven in an arc using the steering system.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is exemplary of a scenario in which a minimum turning radius <b>543</b> is known to apply to the self-driving vehicle <b>500</b>. Since the self-driving vehicle <b>500</b> is associated with a minimum turning radius <b>543</b>, then, according to some embodiments, it may not be necessary to include the exclusion regions <b>542</b> and <b>544</b> within the safety fields <b>512</b>, <b>514</b>, and <b>516</b>, since the vehicle <b>500</b> cannot turn (i.e. drive in an arc) into the exclusion regions <b>542</b> and <b>544</b>. Since the vehicle <b>500</b> cannot be driven into the exclusion regions <b>542</b> and <b>544</b>, the risks of colliding with an obstacle with the exclusion regions may be acceptably low. As such, the exclusion regions <b>542</b> and <b>544</b> may be omitted from the safety fields <b>512</b>, <b>514</b>, and <b>516</b>.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, there is shown a self-driving vehicle <b>600</b> with three safety fields <b>612</b>, <b>614</b>, and <b>616</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is exemplary of a scenario in which the safety fields are defined in terms of a polygon. In the simple example shown, each of the safety fields is represented by a pentagon. (For clarity, and with analogy to the safety fields and footprints described elsewhere: each of the safety fields <b>612</b>, <b>614</b>, and <b>616</b> include the boundary line <b>646</b>. In other words, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the safety fields are overlapping such that the area of the safety field <b>616</b> includes the area of the safety field <b>614</b>, and the area of the safety field <b>614</b> includes the area of the safety field <b>612</b>). Generally, the safety fields may have a polygonal geometry pertaining to any polygon. According to some embodiments, polygons may represent a convenient form for calculation and determination of the safety fields.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, there is shown a self-driving vehicle <b>700</b> with three polygonal safety fields <b>712</b>, <b>714</b>, and <b>716</b>. The safety fields <b>712</b>, <b>714</b>, and <b>716</b> differ from the safety fields <b>612</b>, <b>614</b>, and <b>616</b> previously described, in that each of the safety fields <b>712</b>, <b>714</b>, and <b>716</b> is determined based on a navigational constraint. Navigational constraints may represent, for example, a minimum navigable width, a minimum turning radius, a maximum speed, a maximum turning speed, etc.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">The width indicated by the arrow <b>702</b> represents a minimum navigable width navigational constraint. According to some embodiments, the minimum navigable width may be determined by the width of a roadway, path, aisle, etc. through which the vehicle <b>700</b> is going to traverse. For example, in a manufacturing or warehouse facility, the maximum width of an aisle may be eight feet. Based on this, a minimum navigable width of eight feet may be determined.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">Each of the safety fields <b>712</b>, <b>714</b>, and <b>716</b> may be determined based on the navigational constraint represented by the width <b>702</b>. As such, the maximum width of each safety field is the same. The result is that, as the safety fields become larger (i.e. the greater the range), they become proportionally narrower. In other words, the angle from the side of the safety field <b>716</b> to the front of the vehicle <b>700</b> is less than the angle from the side of the safety field <b>714</b> (and the safety field <b>712</b>) to the front of the vehicle <b>700</b>. According to some embodiments, the angle from the side of the safety field to the front of the vehicle may be associated with the turning radius of the vehicle below which the vehicle could steer in an arc and collide with an obstacle that was not previously within the safety field.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">Since each safety field corresponds to a different speed (i.e. the speed for the safety field <b>716</b> is the highest and the speed for the safety field <b>712</b> is the lowest), the slower the vehicle is moving, the lower the turning radius (i.e. the more it can steer in an arc) while still maintaining possible obstacles within the safety field. As the vehicle speed increases, the vehicle must drive in a relatively straighter line in a forward direction in order to avoid steering beyond the safety field and colliding with obstacles that are not in the safety field. This can be mathematically framed as a maximum rotational speed which has an absolute value inversely related to the vehicle translational speed.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, there is shown a self-driving vehicle <b>800</b> with three polygonal safety fields <b>812</b>, <b>814</b>, and <b>816</b>. As indicated by the arrow <b>802</b>, the vehicle <b>800</b> is in the process of turning to the right. In other words, in the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the vehicle <b>802</b> has an angular velocity.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">Two different types of turns have previously been described: a turn-in-place operation; and driving in an arc. These two types of turns can be described in terms of velocity. Generally, it can be said that when the vehicle <b>800</b> is turning, it has an angular velocity with an absolute value greater than zero. Specifically, when the vehicle <b>800</b> is performing a turn-in-place operation, it has an angular velocity with absolute value greater than zero, and no linear velocity (i.e. a linear velocity equal to or very near to zero). When the vehicle <b>800</b> is driving in an arc, it has an angular velocity and a linear velocity (each with absolute magnitudes greater than zero).</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">It is also possible to describe these velocities in terms of speeds. Generally, the magnitude of the velocity may be analogous to a speed (e.g. angular/rotational speed; linear speed). The direction of the velocities can also be described along with the speed (e.g. forward versus backward for linear speed; clockwise/right versus counter-clockwise/left for angular speed).</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">According to some embodiments, either or both of the size (e.g. range) and the geometry (e.g. angular sweep and range as a function of angular sweep) of a safety field can be determined entirely, or in part, based on one or both of the linear velocity (or speed) and the angular velocity (or angular speed) of the vehicle <b>800</b>.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">As shown in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, since the vehicle <b>800</b> is turning to the right, the geometry of the safety fields is determined accordingly. In other words, the safety fields extend further to the right ahead of the vehicle <b>800</b> and less to the left ahead of the vehicle <b>800</b> (e.g. as compared to the safety fields in the previously-described <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, there is shown a method <b>900</b> for self-driving vehicle collision avoidance, according to at least one embodiment. The method <b>900</b> may generally be executed by a self-driving vehicle. The method <b>900</b> may be executed along with, or may include one or both of the methods <b>1000</b> and <b>1100</b>. According to some embodiments, any or all of the methods <b>900</b>, <b>1000</b>, and <b>1100</b> may be represented in computer-instructional code stored on non-volatile, computer-readable media, which, when executed by a processor (e.g. a processor of a self-driving vehicle), cause the processor to be configured to execute some or all of the steps of the methods.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">According to some embodiments, the method <b>900</b> may begin at step <b>910</b>, when the self-driving vehicle obtains navigational constraints. Navigational constraints may represent, for example, a minimum navigable width, a minimum turning radius, a maximum speed, a minimum speed.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">According to some embodiments, navigational constraints may be static, meaning that they may be obtained once, for example, when the vehicle is configured for use in a particular facility. In other words, based on the characteristics of the facility in which the vehicle is to be used (e.g. a warehouse with particular aisle widths), navigational constraints may be set (and then remain unchanged) when the vehicle is initially configured for that facility.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">According to some embodiments, navigational constraints may be dynamic and/or automatically generated as the vehicle move through the facility. As the vehicle moves through its environment (e.g. a warehouse facility), it may use the vehicle's sensors to determine a navigational constraint. For example, as the vehicle is travelling through the facility, it may recognize an aisle and measure the aisle width. The vehicle may then determine navigational constraints based on the aisle width that it has measured.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">According to some embodiments, navigational constraints may be associated with a specific location within the vehicle's environment. For example, navigational constraints may be embedded in or associated with an electronic map that the vehicle uses in order to navigate its environment. Navigational constraints may be provided, for example by a fleet-management system, based on the vehicle's location relative to the map.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">At, or prior to step <b>910</b>, the vehicle may be in the process of executing a mission, and/or travelling to a particular destination. According to some embodiments, the vehicle may be executing a planned path.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">At step <b>9100</b>, the method determines the safety field(s) and/or footprint(s) for the vehicle.

As will be apparent and further described, and as indicated by the double-ended arrow, according to some embodiments, the execution of step <b>9110</b> may be a step precedent to, and informing step <b>9100</b>. According to some embodiments, the execution of step <b>9100</b> may be a step precedent to, and informing step <b>9110</b>. In other words, the generation of the capability reduction parameters may inform the determination of the safety fields; and vice-versa.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">According to some embodiments, step <b>9110</b> may be performed according to any or all of the steps of the method <b>1100</b> as provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>.

According to some embodiments, the self-driving vehicle may autonomously plan the path. According to some embodiments, the self-driving vehicle may have previously been executing a path; but the determination (or re-determination) of the capability reduction parameters during step <b>9110</b> and/or the safety fields during the stop <b>9100</b> may necessitate the re-planning of a new path, since the safety fields affect the vehicle's navigable space restrictions.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">At step <b>918</b>, the vehicle controls its sensors according to the safety field(s) and/or footprint(s) that were generated during step <b>9100</b>.

In the case that capability reduction parameters were generated during step <b>9110</b>, step <b>922</b> includes controlling the drive system according to the capability reduction parameters.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">According to some embodiments, the self-driving vehicle may comprise two (or more) differential drive motors.

For example, sensors on the vehicle may detect the attributes of a payload (and/or additional) equipment being carried by the vehicle, the condition of the vehicle components, and the vehicle's steering, braking, and acceleration capabilities.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">According to some embodiments, the method <b>1000</b> may include step <b>1012</b>. At step <b>1012</b>, any or all of the vehicle's speed, path, steering, and safe stopping distance may be received or determined. According to some embodiments, any or all of the vehicle's speed, path, steering, and safe stopping distance may be received or determined by a processor of the vehicle (e.g. a processor of the control system), for example, being received from non-transitory computer-readable media of the vehicle (e.g. a memory of the control system).</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">According to some embodiments, any or all of the vehicle's speed, path, steering, and safe stopping distance may be received from a fleet-management system (or other computer system) in communication with the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">According to some embodiments, any or all of the vehicle's speed, path, steering, and safe stopping distance may be provided to the memory by a vehicle sensor. The safe stopping distance may be determined, for example by a processor of the vehicle, based on any or all of the speed, path, and steering of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">For example, sensor on the vehicle (e.g. odometers, rotary encoders, the LiDAR or other time-of-flight sensor, GPS) may be used to measure the speed of the vehicle. The linear and angular velocities of the vehicle may be determined. Based on this, and, in some embodiments, in further consideration of the mass of the vehicle (which may include the mass of a payload and other equipment), a safe stopping distance may be determined.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">It may be desired to ensure that collisions with obstacles are avoided by having the vehicle stop before colliding with an object. Alternatively, or additionally, it may be desired to ensure that, in the worst case, any collisions that are experienced are below a maximum impact force.

According to some embodiments, the range of the safety field may be based on the safe stopping distance and/or the speed. According to some embodiments, a static mass attribute may be associated with the vehicle (e.g. based on the assumption that the mass doesn't change), and, therefore, the safe stopping distance may be easily determined or approximated directly by the vehicle's speed.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">According to some embodiments, velocity may be used rather than speed. In such a case, an angular velocity can be used, which is associated with either a turn-in-place operation or driving in an arc. In such a case, the safety field may be asymmetrically disposed about the centerline of the vehicle (e.g. as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>) by varying the range as previously described.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">At step <b>1018</b>, safety field exclusion regions may be determined.

According to some embodiments, the safety field exclusion regions may be based on the velocity of the vehicle (i.e. linear velocity and/or angular velocity). As such, the magnitude and/or direction of the velocity may be used to determine regions through which the vehicle is unlikely to travel, and these regions can be considered as exclusion regions (or parts thereof).</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">At step <b>1020</b>, a safety field is determined based on the safety field range and the exclusion regions.

According to some embodiments, a footprint may have the same geometry as the associated safety field; and may have a range greater than the range of the safety field. According to some embodiments, the range and/or geometry of the footprint may be based on the associated safety field and/or the speed or velocity of the vehicle. For example, as the vehicle speed increases, a footprint size may also increase. According to some embodiments, the proportional size of the footprint relative to the safety field may increase as the vehicle's speed increases.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, there is shown a method <b>1100</b> for determining capability reduction parameters, according to at least one embodiment.

The differential drive system may enable both linear speed and acceleration (by driving the drive wheels at the same speeds) as well as turn-in-place or driving an arc by driving the drive wheels at different speeds and/or in different directions. Similarly, the drive system may include a single drive motor (or, generally, one or more drive wheels that are driven at the same speed) and a steering system such as an Ackerman type steering system.
