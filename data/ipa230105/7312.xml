Hyper-ubiquitous and deeply entrenched in the lifestyles of people around the world, many of these devices transcend cultural and economic barriers.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Computationally, these computing devices offer speed and storage capabilities comparable to engineering workstation or workgroup computers from less than ten years ago, and typically include powerful media processors, rendering them suitable for real-time sound synthesis and other musical applications. Partly as a result, some portable handheld devices, such as iPhone&#x2122;, iPad&#x2122;, iPod Touch&#x2122; and other iOS&#xae; or Android devices, as well as media application platforms and set-top box (STB) type devices such as AppleTV&#x2122; devices, support audio and video processing quite capably, while at the same time providing platforms suitable for advanced user interfaces. Indeed, applications such as the Smule Ocarina&#x2122;, Leaf Trombone&#x2122;, I Am T-Pain&#x2122;, AutoRap&#xae;, Smule (fka Sing!Karaoke&#x2122;), Guitar! By Smule&#x2122;, and Magic Piano apps available from Smule, Inc. have shown that advanced digital acoustic techniques may be delivered using such devices in ways that provide compelling musical experiences.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Smule (fka Sing! Karaoke&#x2122;) implementations have previously demonstrated accretion of vocal performances captured on a non-real-time basis with respect to each other using geographically-distributed, handheld devices, as well as implementations where more tightly-coupled coordination between portable handheld devices and a local media application platform (e.g., in-room) is supported, typically with short-range, negligible-latency communications on a same local- or personal-area network segment. Improved techniques and functional capabilities are desired to extend an intimate sense of &#x201c;now&#x201d; or &#x201c;liveness&#x201d; to collaborative vocal performances, where the performers are separated by more significant geographic distances and notwithstanding non-negligible communication latencies between devices.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">As researchers seek to transition their innovations to commercial applications deployable to modern handheld devices and media application platforms within the real-world constraints imposed by processor, memory and other limited computational resources thereof and/or within communications bandwidth and transmission latency constraints typical of wireless and wide-area networks, significant practical challenges present. For example, while applications such as Smule (fka Sing! Karaoke&#x2122;) have demonstrated the promise of post-performance audiovisual mixes to simulate vocal duets or collaborative vocal performances of larger numbers of performers, creating a sense of now and live collaboration has proved elusive without physical co-location.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Improved techniques and functional capabilities are desired, particularly relative to management of communication latencies and captured audiovisual content in such a way that a combined audiovisual performance nonetheless can be disseminated (e.g., broadcast) in a manner that presents to recipients, listeners and/or viewers as a live interactive collaboration of geographically-distributed performers. Audience involvement and participation constructs that provide an intimate sense of &#x201c;now&#x201d; or &#x201c;liveness&#x201d; are also desired.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It has been discovered that, despite practical limitations imposed by mobile device platforms and other media application execution environments, audiovisual performances, including vocal music, may be captured and coordinated with those of other users in ways that create compelling user and listener experiences. In some cases, the vocal performances of collaborating contributors are captured (together with performance synchronized video) in the context of a karaoke-style presentation of lyrics and in correspondence with audible renderings of a backing track. In some cases, vocals (and typically synchronized video) are captured as part of a live or unscripted performance with vocal interactions (e.g., a duet or dialog) between collaborating contributors. In either case, it is envisioned that non-negligible network communication latencies will exist between at least some of the collaborating contributors, particularly where those contributors are geographically separated. As a result, a technical challenge exists to manage latencies and the captured audiovisual content in such a way that a combined audiovisual performance nonetheless can be disseminated (e.g., broadcast) in a manner that presents to recipients, listeners and/or viewers as a live interactive collaboration.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one technique for accomplishing this facsimile of live interactive performance collaboration, actual and non-negligible network communication latency is (in effect) masked in one direction between a guest and host performer and tolerated in the other direction. For example, a captured audiovisual performance of a guest performer on a &#x201c;live show&#x201d; internet broadcast of a host performer could include a guest+host duet sung in apparent real-time synchrony. In some cases, the guest could be a performer who has popularized a particular musical performance. In some cases, the guest could be an amateur vocalist given the opportunity to sing &#x201c;live&#x201d; (though remote) with the popular artist or group virtually &#x201c;in studio&#x201d; as (or with) the show's host. Notwithstanding a non-negligible network communication latency from guest-to-host involved in the conveyance of the guest's audiovisual contribution stream (perhaps 200-500 ms or more), the host performs in apparent synchrony with (though temporally lagged from, in an absolute sense) the guest and the apparently synchronously performed vocals are captured and mixed with the guest's contribution for broadcast or dissemination.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The result is an apparently live interactive performance (at least from the perspective of the host and the recipients, listeners and/or viewers of the disseminated or broadcast performance). Although the non-negligible network communication latency from guest-to-host is masked, it will be understood that latency exists and is tolerated in the host-to-guest direction. However, host-to-guest latency, while discernible (and perhaps quite noticeable) to the guest, need not be apparent in the apparently live broadcast or other dissemination. It has been discovered that lagged audible rendering of host vocals (or more generally, of the host's captured audiovisual performance) need not psychoacoustically interfere with the guest's performance.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Performance synchronized video may be captured and included in a combined audiovisual performance that constitutes the apparently live broadcast, wherein visuals may be based, at least in part, on time-varying, computationally-defined audio features extracted from (or computed over) captured vocal audio. In some cases or embodiments, these computationally-defined audio features are selective, over the course of a coordinated audiovisual mix, for particular synchronized video of one or more of the contributing vocalists (or prominence thereof).</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Optionally, and in some cases or embodiments, vocal audio can be pitch-corrected in real-time at the guest performer's device (or more generally, at a portable computing device such as a mobile phone, personal digital assistant, laptop computer, notebook computer, pad-type computer or netbook, or on a content or media application server) in accord with pitch correction settings. In some cases, pitch correction settings code a particular key or scale for the vocal performance or for portions thereof. In some cases, pitch correction settings include a score-coded melody and/or harmony sequence supplied with, or for association with, the lyrics and backing tracks. Harmony notes or chords may be coded as explicit targets or relative to the score coded melody or even actual pitches sounded by a vocalist, if desired.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Using uploaded vocals captured at guest performer devices such as the aforementioned portable computing devices, a content server or service for the host can further mediate coordinated performances by manipulating and mixing the uploaded audiovisual content of multiple contributing vocalists for further broadcast or other dissemination. Depending on the goals and implementation of a particular system, in addition to video content, uploads may include pitch-corrected vocal performances (with or without harmonies), dry (i.e., uncorrected) vocals, and/or control tracks of user key and/or pitch correction selections, etc.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Synthesized harmonies and/or additional vocals (e.g., vocals captured from another vocalist at still other locations and optionally pitch-shifted to harmonize with other vocals) may also be included in the mix. Geocoding of captured vocal performances (or individual contributions to a combined performance) and/or listener feedback may facilitate animations or display artifacts in ways that are suggestive of a performance or endorsement emanating from a particular geographic locale on a user-manipulable globe. In this way, implementations of the described functionality can transform otherwise mundane mobile devices and living room or entertainment systems into social instruments that foster a unique sense of global connectivity, collaboration and community.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="2">Audiovisual Livestream</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some embodiments in accordance with the present invention(s), a collaboration method for a livestream broadcast of a coordinated audiovisual work of first and second performers captured at respective geographically-distributed, first and second devices includes: (1) receiving at the second device, a media encoding of an audiovisual performance mixed with a backing audio track and including (i) vocal audio captured at the first device from a first one of the performers and (ii) video that is performance synchronized with the captured first performer vocals; (2) at the second device, audibly rendering the received mixed audio performance and capturing thereagainst vocal audio from a second one of the performers; (3) mixing the captured second performer vocal audio with the received mixed audio performance to provide a broadcast audiovisual mix that includes the captured vocal audio of the first and second performers and the backing audio track without apparent temporal lag therebetween; and (4) supplying the audiovisual broadcast mix to a service platform configured to livestream the broadcast audiovisual mix to plural recipient devices constituting an audience.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some cases or embodiments, the performance synchronized video included in the received media encoding is captured in connection with the vocal capture at the first device, the method further includes capturing, at the second device, video that is performance synchronized with the captured second performer vocals, and the audiovisual broadcast mix is an audiovisual mix of captured audio and video of at least the first and second performers.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some embodiments, the method further includes capturing, at the second device, second performer video that is performance synchronized with the captured second performer vocals; and compositing the second performer video with video for the first performer in the supplied audiovisual broadcast mix. In some cases or embodiments, the first and second performer video compositing includes, for at least some portions of the supplied audiovisual broadcast mix, a computational blurring of image frames of first and second performer video at a visual boundary therebetween.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some embodiments, the method further includes dynamically varying in a course of the audiovisual broadcast mix relative visual prominence of one or the other of the first and second performers. In some cases or embodiments, the dynamic varying is, at least partially, in correspondence with time varying vocal part codings in an audio score corresponding to and temporally synchronized with the backing audio track. In some cases or embodiments, the dynamic varying is, at least partially, based on evaluation of a computationally defined audio feature of either or both of the first and second performer vocals.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some cases or embodiments, the first device is associated with the second device as a current livestream guest, and the second device operates as a current livestream host, the current livestream host controlling association and dissociation of particular devices from the audience as the current livestream guest. In some cases or embodiments, the current livestream host selects from a queue of requests from the audience to associate as the current livestream guest. In some cases or embodiments, the first device operates in a livestream guest role and the second device operates in a livestream host role, the method further comprising either or both of: the second device releasing the livestream host role for assumption by another device; and the second device passing the livestream host role to a particular device selected from a set comprising the first device and the audience.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some embodiments, the method further includes accessing a machine readable encoding of musical structure that includes at least musical section boundaries coded for temporal alignment with the vocal audio captured at the first and second devices; and applying a first visual effect schedule to at least a portion of audiovisual broadcast mix, wherein the applied visual effect schedule encodes differing visual effects for differing musical structure elements of the first audiovisual performance encoding and provides visual effect transitions in temporal alignment with at least some of the coded musical section boundaries.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some cases or embodiments, the differing visual effects encoded by the applied visual effect schedule include for a given element thereof, one or more of: a particle-based effect or lens flare; transitions between distinct source videos; animations or motion of a frame within a source video; vector graphics or images of patterns or textures; and color, saturation or contrast. In some cases or embodiments, the associated musical structure encodes musical sections of differing types; and the applied visual effect schedule defines differing visual effects for different ones of the encoded musical sections. In some cases or embodiments, the associated musical structure encodes events or transitions; and the applied visual effect schedule defines differing visual effects for different ones of the encoded events or transitions.

Audiovisual performances including vocal music are captured and coordinated with performances of other users in ways that can create compelling user and listener experiences. For example, in some cases or embodiments, duets with a host performer may be supported in a sing-with-the-artist style audiovisual livestream in which aspiring vocalists request or queue particular songs for a live radio show entertainment format. The developed techniques provide a communications latency-tolerant mechanism for synchronizing vocal performances captured at geographically-separated devices (e.g., at globally-distributed, but network-connected mobile phones or tablets or at audiovisual capture devices geographically separated from a live studio).</p><p id="p-0054" num="0052">While audio-only embodiments are certainly contemplated, it is envisioned that livestream content will typically include performance-synchronized video captured in connection with vocals. In addition, while network-connected mobile phones are illustrated as audiovisual capture devices, it will be appreciated based on the description herein that audiovisual capture and viewing devices may include suitably-configured computers, smart TVs and/or living room style set-top box configurations, and even intelligent virtual assistance devices with audio and/or audiovisual capture devices or capabilities. Finally, while applications to vocal music are described in detail, it will be appreciated based on the description herein that audio or audiovisual capture applications need not be limited to vocal duets, but may be adapted to other forms of group performance in which one or more successive performances are accreted to a prior performance to produce a livestream.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0053">In some cases, the vocal performances of collaborating contributors are captured (together with performance synchronized video) in the context of a karaoke-style presentation of lyrics and in correspondence with audible renderings of a backing track. In some cases, vocals (and typically synchronized video) are captured as part of a live or unscripted performance with vocal interactions (e.g., a duet or dialog) between collaborating contributors. In each case, it is envisioned that non-negligible network communication latencies will exist between at least some of the collaborating contributors, particularly where those contributors are geographically separated. As a result, a technical challenge exists to manage latencies and the captured audiovisual content in such a way that a combined audio visual performance nonetheless can be disseminated (e.g., broadcast) in a manner that presents to recipients, listeners and/or viewers as a live interactive collaboration.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0054">In one technique for accomplishing this facsimile of live interactive performance collaboration, actual and non-negligible network communication latency is (in effect) masked in one direction between a guest and host performer and tolerated in the other direction. For example, a captured audiovisual performance of a guest performer on a &#x201c;live show&#x201d; internet broadcast of a host performer could include a guest+host duet sung in apparent real-time synchrony. In some cases, the host could be a performer who has popularized a particular musical performance. In some cases, the guest could be an amateur vocalist given the opportunity to sing &#x201c;live&#x201d; (though remote) with the popular artist or group &#x201c;in studio&#x201d; as (or with) the show's host. Notwithstanding a non-negligible network communication delay from guest-to-host (perhaps 200-500 ms or more) to convey the guest's audiovisual contribution, the host performs in apparent synchrony with (though temporally lagged from, in an absolute sense) the guest and the apparently synchronously performed vocals are captured and mixed with the guest's contribution for broadcast or dissemination.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0055">The result is an apparently live interactive performance (at least from the perspective of the host and the recipients, listeners and/or viewers of the disseminated or broadcast performance). Although the non-negligible network communication latency from guest-to-host is masked, it will be understood that latency exists and is tolerated in the host-to-guest direction. However, host-to-guest latency, while discernible (and perhaps quite noticeable) to the guest, need not be apparent in the apparently live broadcast or other dissemination. It has been discovered that lagged audible rendering of host vocals (or more generally, of the host's captured audiovisual performance) need not psychoacoustically interfere with the guest's performance.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0056">Although much of the description herein presumes, for purposes of illustration, a fixed host performer on a particular host device, it will be appreciated based on the description herein that some embodiments in accordance with the present invention(s) may provide host/guest control logic that allows a host to &#x201c;pass the mic&#x201d; such that a new user (in some cases a user selected by the current host and other cases, a user who &#x201c;picks up the mic&#x201d; after the current host &#x201c;drops the mic&#x201d;) may take over as host. Likewise, it will be appreciated based on the description herein that some embodiments in accordance with the present invention(s) may provide host/guest control logic that queues guests (and/or aspiring hosts) and automatically assigns queued users to appropriate roles.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0057">In some cases or embodiments, vocal audio of individual host- and guest-role performers is captured together with performance synchronized video in a karaoke-style user interface framework and coordinated with audiovisual contributions of the other users to form duet-style or glee club-style group audiovisual performances. For example, the vocal performances of individual users may be captured (together with performance synchronized video) on mobile devices, television-type display and/or set-top box equipment in the context of karaoke-style presentations of lyrics in correspondence with audible renderings of a backing track. In some cases or embodiments, score-coded continuous pitch correction may be provided as well as user selectable audio and/or video effects. Consistent with the foregoing, but without limitation as to any particular embodiment claimed, karaoke-style vocal performance capture using portable handheld devices provides illustrative context.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">Karaoke-Style Vocal Performance Capture</heading><p id="p-0060" num="0058">Although embodiments of the present invention are not limited thereto, pitch-corrected, karaoke-style, vocal capture using mobile phone-type and/or television-type audiovisual equipment provides a useful descriptive context. For example, in some embodiments such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, iPhone&#x2122; handhelds available from Apple Inc. (or more generally, handhelds <b>101</b>A, <b>101</b>B operating as guest and host devices, respectively) execute software that operates in coordination with a content server <b>110</b> to provide vocal capture. The configuration optionally provides continuous real-time, score-coded pitch correction and harmonization of the captured vocals. Performance synchronized video may also be captured using a camera provided by, or in connection with, a computer, a television or other audiovisual equipment (not specifically shown) or connected set-top box equipment such as an Apple TV&#x2122; device. In some embodiments, performance synchronized video may be captured using an on-board camera provided by handheld paired with connected set-top box equipment. Suitable techniques are detailed in commonly-owned, co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 15/337,866, filed Oct. 28, 2016, naming Hersh, Shimmin, Yang, and Cook as inventors, entitled &#x201c;Audiovisual Media Application Platform with Wireless Handheld Audiovisual Input,&#x201d; the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0059">In the illustration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a current host user of current host device <b>101</b>B at least partially controls the content of a live stream <b>122</b> that is buffered for, and streamed to, an audience on devices <b>120</b>A, <b>120</b>B . . . <b>120</b>N. In the illustrated configuration, a current guest user of current guest device <b>101</b>A contributes to the group audiovisual performance mix <b>111</b> that is supplied (eventually via content server <b>110</b>) by current host device <b>101</b>B as live stream <b>122</b>. Although devices <b>120</b>A, <b>120</b>B . . . <b>120</b>N and, indeed, current guest and host devices <b>101</b>A, <b>101</b>B are, for simplicity, illustrated as handheld devices such as mobile phones, persons of skill in the art having benefit of the present disclosure will appreciate that any given member of the audience may receive livestream <b>122</b> on any suitable computer, smart television, tablet, via a set-top box or other streaming media capable client.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0060">Content that is mixed to form group audiovisual performance mix <b>111</b> is captured, in the illustrated configuration, in the context of karaoke-style performance capture wherein lyrics <b>102</b>, optional pitch cues <b>105</b> and, typically, a backing track <b>107</b> are supplied from content server <b>110</b> to either or both of current guest device <b>101</b>A and current host device <b>101</b>B. A current host (on current host device <b>101</b>B) typically exercises ultimate control over the live stream, e.g., by selecting a particular user (or users) from the audience to act as the current guest(s), by selecting a particular song from a request queue (and/or vocal parts thereof for particular users), and/or by starting, stopping or pausing the group AV performance. Once the current host selects or approves a guest and/or song, the guest user may (in some embodiments) start/stop/pause the roll of backing track <b>107</b>A for local audible rendering and otherwise control the content of guest mix <b>106</b> (backing track roll mixed with captured guest audiovisual content) supplied to current host device <b>101</b>B. Roll of lyrics <b>102</b>A and optional pitch cues <b>105</b>A at current guest device <b>101</b>A is in temporal correspondence with the backing track <b>107</b>A, and is likewise subject start/stop/pause control by the current guest. In some cases or situations, backing audio and/or video may be rendered from a media store such as an iTunes&#x2122; library resident or accessible from a handheld, set-top box, etc.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0061">Typically, song requests <b>132</b> are audience-sourced and conveyed by signaling paths to content selection and guest queue control logic <b>112</b> of content server <b>110</b>. Host controls <b>131</b> and guest controls <b>133</b> are illustrated as bi-directional signaling paths. Other queuing and control logic configurations consistent with the operations described, including host or guest controlled queueing and/or song selection, will be appreciated based on the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0062">In the illustrated configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, and notwithstanding a non-negligible temporal lag (typically 100-250 ms, but possibly more), current host device <b>101</b>B receives and audibly renders guest mix <b>106</b> as a backing track against which the current host's audiovisual performance are captured at current host device <b>101</b>B. Roll of lyrics <b>102</b>B and optional pitch cues <b>105</b>B at current host device <b>101</b>B is in temporal correspondence with the backing track, here guest mix <b>106</b>. To facilitate synchronization to the guest mix <b>106</b> in view of temporal lag in the peer-to-peer communications channel between current guest device <b>101</b>A and current host device <b>101</b>B as well as for guest-side start/stop/pause control, marker beacons may be encoded in the guest mix to provide the appropriate phase control of lyrics <b>102</b>B and optional pitch cues <b>105</b>B on screen. Alternatively, phase analysis of any backing track <b>107</b>A included in guest mix <b>106</b> (or any bleed through, if the backing track is separately encoded or conveyed) may be used to provide the appropriate phase control of lyrics <b>102</b>B and optional pitch cues <b>105</b>B on screen at current host device <b>101</b>B.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0063">It will be understood that temporal lag in the peer-to-peer communications channel between current guest device <b>101</b>A and current host device <b>101</b>B affects both guest mix <b>106</b> and communications in the opposing direction (e.g., host mic <b>103</b>C signal encodings). Any of a variety of communications channels may be used to convey audiovisual signals and controls between current guest device <b>101</b>A and current host device <b>101</b>B, as well as between the guest and host devices <b>101</b>A, <b>101</b>B and content server <b>110</b> and between audience devices <b>120</b>A, <b>120</b>B . . . <b>120</b>N and content server <b>110</b>. For example, respective telecommunications carrier wireless facilities and/or wireless local area networks and respective wide-area network gateways (not specifically shown) may provide communications to and from devices <b>101</b>A, <b>101</b>B, <b>120</b>A, <b>120</b>B . . . <b>120</b>N. Based on the description herein, persons of skill in the art will recognize that any of a variety of data communications facilities, including 802.11 Wi-Fi, Bluetooth&#x2122;, 4G-LTE, 5G, or other communications, wireless, wired data networks, wired or wireless audiovisual interconnects such as in accord with HDMI, AVI, Wi-Di standards or facilities may employed, individually or in combination to facilitate communications and/or audiovisual rendering described herein.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0064">User vocals <b>103</b>A and <b>103</b>B are captured at respective handhelds <b>101</b>A, <b>101</b>B, and may be optionally pitch-corrected continuously and in real-time and audibly rendered mixed with the locally-appropriate backing track (e.g., backing track <b>107</b>A at current guest device <b>101</b>A and guest mix <b>106</b> at current host device <b>101</b>B) to provide the user with an improved tonal quality rendition of his/her own vocal performance. Pitch correction is typically based on score-coded note sets or cues (e.g., the pitch and harmony cues <b>105</b>A, <b>105</b>B visually displayed at current guest device <b>101</b>A and at current host device <b>101</b>B, respectively), which provide continuous pitch-correction algorithms executing on the respective device with performance-synchronized sequences of target notes in a current key or scale. In addition to performance-synchronized melody targets, score-coded harmony note sequences (or sets) provide pitch-shifting algorithms with additional targets (typically coded as offsets relative to a lead melody note track and typically scored only for selected portions thereof) for pitch-shifting to harmony versions of the user's own captured vocals. In some cases, pitch correction settings may be characteristic of a particular artist such as the artist that performed vocals associated with the particular backing track.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0065">In general, lyrics, melody and harmony track note sets and related timing and control information may be encapsulated in an appropriate container or object (e.g., in a Musical Instrument Digital Interface, MIDI, or Java Script Object Notation, json, type format) for supply together with the backing track(s).</p><p id="p-0068" num="0066">Using such information, devices <b>101</b>A and <b>101</b>B (as well as associated audiovisual displays and/or set-top box equipment, not specifically shown) may display lyrics and even visual cues related to target notes, harmonies and currently detected vocal pitch in correspondence with an audible performance of the backing track(s) so as to facilitate a karaoke-style vocal performance by a user. Thus, if an aspiring vocalist selects &#x201c;When I Was Your Man&#x201d; as popularized by Bruno Mars, your_man.json and your_man.m4a may be downloaded from the content server (if not already available or cached based on prior download) and, in turn, used to provide background music, synchronized lyrics and, in some situations or embodiments, score-coded note tracks for continuous, real-time pitch-correction while the user sings. Optionally, at least for certain embodiments or genres, harmony note tracks may be score coded for harmony shifts to captured vocals. Typically, a captured pitch-corrected (possibly harmonized) vocal performance together with performance synchronized video is saved locally, on the handheld device or set-top box, as one or more audiovisual files and is subsequently compressed and encoded for communication (e.g., as guest mix <b>106</b> or group audiovisual performance mix <b>111</b> or constituent encodings thereof) to content server <b>110</b> as an MPEG-4 container file. MPEG-4 is one suitable standard for the coded representation and transmission of digital multimedia content for the Internet, mobile networks and advanced broadcast applications. Other suitable codecs, compression techniques, coding formats and/or containers may be employed if desired.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0067">As will be appreciated by persons of skill in the art having benefit of the present disclosure, performances of multiple vocalists (including performance synchronized video) may be accreted and combined, such as to form a duet-style performance, glee club, or vocal jam session. In some embodiments of the present invention, social network constructs may at least partially supplant or inform host control of the pairings of geographically-distributed vocalists and/or formation of geographically-distributed virtual glee clubs. For example, relative to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, individual vocalists may perform as current host and guest users in a manner captured (with vocal audio and performance synchronized video) and eventually streamed as a live stream <b>122</b> to an audience.

While the guest will perceive the host's accreted vocals delayed (in the mix supplied at guest speaker or headset <b>240</b>A) by a full audio round-trip-travel (RTT) delay, the audio stream (including the remote guest mic mixed with the backing track) supplied to the host device <b>101</b>B and mixed as the livestreamed (<b>122</b>) multi-vocal performance exhibit zero (or negligible) latency to the host vocalist or to the audience.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0072">A key to masking actual latencies is to include track <b>107</b>A in the audio mix suppled from guest device <b>101</b>A and to the broadcaster's device, host device <b>101</b>B. This audio flow ensures that the guest's voice and backing track is always synced from the broadcasters point of view (based on audible rendering at host speaker or headset <b>240</b>B. The guest may still perceive that the broadcaster is singing slightly out of sync if the network delay is significant. However, as long as the guest focuses on singing in time with the backing track instead of the host's slightly delayed voice, the multi-vocal mix of host vocals with guest vocals and the backing track is in sync when livestreamed to an audience.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a flow graph depicting the flow of audio signals captured and processed at respective guest and host devices coupled in an alternative &#x201c;shared latency&#x201d; peer-to-peer configuration for generation of a group audiovisual performance livestream in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention(s).

The guest device <b>101</b>A sends periodic timing messages to the host containing the current position in the song, and the host device <b>101</b>B adjusts the playback position of the song accordingly.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0075">We have experimented with two different approaches to keeping the backing tracks in sync on the two devices (guest and host devices <b>101</b>A and <b>101</b>B):<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0076">Method 1: We adjust playback position we receive on the host-side by the one-way network delay, which is approximated as the network RTT/2.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0077">Method 2: We synchronize the clocks of the two devices using network time protocol (NTP).

Just as audio signals are captured, conveyed and mixed, video captured at respective devices is composited in correspondence with the audio with which it is performance synchronized as a temporal alignment and distributed performer synchronization baseline.
