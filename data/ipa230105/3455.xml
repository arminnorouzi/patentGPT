Freon, CO<sub>2</sub>, ammonia, or some other refrigerant circulates in a circulation channel that connects these. In such a heat-exchange cycle, it has been proposed (refer to Patent Document 1) to improve heat-exchanging performance by disposing a double pipe in the circulation channel and effecting heat exchange by causing a high-temperature refrigerant, which is discharged from the condenser, and a low-temperature refrigerant, which is discharged from the evaporator, to circulate in opposition to each other in two streams of space configured by the double pipe.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">On the other hand, to address environmental problems, refrigerants having a lower global warming potential are being studied for use as refrigerants to be used in the heat-exchange cycle. There is a concern that the heat-exchanging performance of a refrigerant that takes such environmental problems into consideration will be lower than that of current refrigerants. Consequently, to curtail performance deterioration of the heat-exchange cycle overall, it is effective to proactively utilize a configuration that further improves heat-exchanging performance by incorporating the above-mentioned double pipe.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a system that uses a compressor to compress a gas refrigerant discharged from the evaporator, a malfunction can occur, in which the heat exchange cannot be performed sufficiently, in a situation in which the refrigerant has flowed into the compressor in the state in which the refrigerant has not been sufficiently evaporated, i.e., in the state in which liquid is mixed with the gas. However, this malfunction can be resolved by incorporating the double pipe. This is because, in the double pipe, the refrigerant can be heated before it is caused to flow into the compressor, and thereby the refrigerant can be sufficiently evaporated.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Here, with regard to the double pipe described in Patent Document 1, an inner pipe having a plurality of helical groove portions is used as an inner pipe, and this is combined with a smooth, circular-tube-shaped outer pipe. Furthermore, in a straight-pipe part of the double pipe, the inner diameter of the outer pipe is larger than the outer diameter of the inner pipe, and a ridge portion between the groove portions of the inner pipe does not make contact with the outer pipe. Thereby, in the straight-pipe part of the double pipe, the groove portions communicate with one another in a circumferential direction, and an outer-side channel, which is formed between the outer pipe and the inner pipe, is formed over the entire circumference.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">PRIOR ART LITERATURE</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Documents</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Patent Document 1</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication 2006-162241</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">With regard to the double pipe described in Patent Document 1, in the straight-pipe part the inner diameter of the outer pipe is larger than the outer diameter of the inner pipe, as described above, the outer-side channel is one of the channels extending in the circumferential direction, and the channel cross-sectional area is larger than that of a bent portion. Consequently, the flow velocity of the refrigerant in the outer-side channel tends to drop in the straight-pipe part, and therefore there is a possibility that sufficient heat-exchanging performance of the straight-pipe part will not be obtained.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">With regard to the double pipe for exchanging heat, even though it has a bent portion in one part, because the majority thereof is constituted by the straight-pipe part it is conceivable that the heat-exchanging performance of the double pipe overall can be improved by improving the heat-exchanging performance of the straight-pipe part. On the other hand, even though it is considered that other optimizations, such as flow velocity, channel surface area and pressure drop in the inner-side channel, which is the channel inside the inner pipe, etc., and in the outer-side channel, as well as optimization of the channel cross-sectional shape, etc., will have an effect on the heat-exchanging performance of the double pipe, it cannot be said that the optimal conditions have been clarified yet. In particular, an effective channel cross-sectional shape of the outer-side channel has not been sufficiently elucidated.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention was conceived considering this background, and an object of the present invention is to provide a double pipe for a heat exchanger in which the heat-exchanging performance can be improved beyond that in the past by optimizing the channel cross-sectional shape of outer-side channels in the straight-pipe part.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Means for Solving the Problems</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">One aspect of the present invention is a double pipe for a heat exchanger having a double-pipe structure, in which an inner pipe is disposed in an interior of an outer pipe, that is for effecting heat exchange between a fluid that flows in the interior of the inner pipe and a fluid that flows between the inner pipe and the outer pipe, wherein:</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">in a straight-pipe part of the double pipe for a heat exchanger, the inner pipe comprises a plurality of protruding parts extending in a longitudinal direction and curved to protrude toward an outer-circumference side;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">the protruding parts are helically offset in the longitudinal direction;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">in a cross section of the straight-pipe part orthogonal to the longitudinal direction, an inner-circumferential surface of the outer pipe exhibits a circular shape;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">in the straight-pipe part, the inner-circumferential surface of the outer pipe and the protruding parts of the inner pipe are in contact, and outer-side channels, which are partitioned at a plurality of locations in the circumferential direction, are formed between the outer pipe and the inner pipe; and</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">in the cross section of the straight-pipe part orthogonal to the longitudinal direction, when D [mm] is defined as the maximum depth of each of the outer-side channels and L [mm] is defined as the arc length of each of the outer-side channels in the circumferential direction, the average value of the D/L values of all the outer-side channels is greater than 0.09 and less than 0.20.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Effects of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the straight-pipe part of the double pipe for a heat exchanger, the inner-circumferential surface of the outer pipe and the protruding parts of the inner pipe are in contact, and the outer-side channels, which are partitioned at a plurality of locations in the circumferential direction, are formed between the outer pipe and the inner pipe. In this manner, in the straight-pipe part, by forming the outer-side channels such that they are divided up in the circumferential direction, the flow velocity of the fluid flowing through the outer-side channels in the straight-pipe part can be ensured, and thereby the heat-exchanging performance of the straight-pipe part can be improved.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In addition, in a cross section of the straight-pipe part orthogonal to the longitudinal direction, when D [mm] is defined as the maximum depth of each of the outer-side channels and L [mm] is defined as the arc length of each of the outer-side channels in the circumferential direction, the average value of the D/L values of all the outer-side channels is greater than 0.09 and less than 0.20. That is, in the straight-pipe part, each of the outer-side channels is formed such that its depth becomes small to a certain extent and its arc length in the circumferential direction becomes long. For that reason, in the straight-pipe part, the contact surface area between the fluid that flows in the outer-side channels and the outer pipe and the contact surface area between the fluid that flows in the outer-side channels and the inner pipe can be increased. Thereby, the heat-exchanging performance of the straight-pipe part can be improved.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In addition, in a cross section of the straight-pipe part, by virtue of setting the average value of the D/L values of all the outer-side channels to a value that is greater than 0.09, an increase in the pressure drop of the fluid that flows in each of the outer-side channels in the straight-pipe part can be curtailed. Furthermore, in a cross section of the straight-pipe part, by setting the above-mentioned average value to a value of less than 0.20, an increase in the pressure drop of the fluid that flows in the inner pipe in the straight-pipe part can be curtailed.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to the present aspect as described above, a double pipe for a heat exchanger can be provided in which the channel cross-sectional shape of outer-side channels in a straight-pipe part are optimized, and thereby the heat-exchanging performance can be improved beyond that in the past.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0009" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a partial, cross-sectional oblique view of a double pipe for a heat exchanger according to Working Example 1.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a partial, cross-sectional side view of the double pipe for a heat exchanger according to Working Example 1.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a cross-sectional auxiliary view taken along line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an enlarged view of a portion, which is surrounded by a chain line, of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of an inner pipe for explaining a maximum depth D of outer-side channels and an arc length L in a circumferential direction according to Working Example 1.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is an explanatory diagram that shows an aspect, viewed from a longitudinal direction of a pipe stock of the inner pipe, of the arrangement of pressing disks according to Working Example 1.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the inner pipe for explaining maximum depth D of the outer-side channels and arc length L in the circumferential direction according to Working Example 2.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the double pipe of sample 1, in which the D/L average value is 0.08, according to Test Examples 1-3.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the double pipe of sample 5, in which the D/L average value is 0.15, according to Test Examples 1-3.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the double pipe of sample 7, in which the D/L average value is 0.20, according to Test Examples 1-3.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the double pipe of sample 8, as a comparative sample, according to Test Examples 1-3.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is an overall oblique view of the double pipe of sample 5 according to Test Examples 1-3.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a graph that shows the relationship between the D/L average value and the amount of heat absorption of a refrigerant in an inner-side channel according to Test Example 1.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is a graph that shows the relationship between the D/L average value and the pressure drop of the refrigerant in the outer-side channels according to Test Example 2.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is a graph that shows the relationship between the D/L average value and the pressure drop of the refrigerant in the inner-side channel according to Test Example 3.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0010" level="1">MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The above-mentioned double pipe for a heat exchanger may be configured such that it can be incorporated in, for example, an air-conditioning system for an automobile or the like. The air-conditioning system may comprise a condenser, an evaporator, a compressor, an expansion valve, and a circulation channel, which couples these, and may be configured such that the double pipe for a heat exchanger is disposed in the circulation channel. In this situation, the double pipe for a heat exchanger should be incorporated in the circulation channel such that a low-temperature/low-pressure gas refrigerant, which is discharged from the evaporator, is guided to a channel within an inner pipe, a high-temperature/high-pressure liquid refrigerant, which is discharged from the condenser, is guided to outer-side channels, and the liquid refrigerant that flows in the outer-side channels and the gas refrigerant that flows in the inner pipe flow in directions that are in opposition to each other. By virtue of the circulation channel being configured in this manner, heat exchange in the double pipe for a heat exchanger between the high-temperature/high-pressure liquid refrigerant and the low-temperature/low-pressure gas refrigerant is performed efficiently, and thereby the heat-exchanging performance of the heat-exchange cycle overall can be improved.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The double pipe for a heat exchanger is configured such that the average value of the D/L values of all the outer-side channels in a cross section of a straight-pipe part orthogonal to a longitudinal direction is greater than 0.09 and less than 0.20. By setting the average value of the D/L values of the outer-side channels to the above-mentioned specific range, as described above, an increase in the pressure drop of the fluid that flows in each of the outer-side channels of the straight-pipe part can be curtailed, and an increase in the pressure drop of the fluid that flows in the inner pipe can be curtailed. From the viewpoint of more reliably exhibiting such functions and effects, in a cross section of the straight-pipe part orthogonal to the longitudinal direction, the average value of the D/L values of all the outer-side channels preferably is set to greater than 0.10 and less than 0.20, more preferably is set to greater than 0.11 and less than 0.20, yet more preferably is set to greater than 0.12 and less than 0.20, yet more preferably is set to greater than 0.13 and less than 0.19, and in particular preferably is set to greater than 0.13 and less than 0.18.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">If the double pipe for a heat exchanger comprises the straight-pipe part extending in a straight line, then a portion (one location or a plurality of locations) may be bent by bending work or the like. In this situation, at least in a cross section of the straight-pipe part of the double pipe orthogonal to the longitudinal direction, the average value of the D/L values of all the outer-side channels may be set to a value of greater than 0.09 and less than 0.20. Thereby, the heat-exchanging performance of the straight-pipe part, which occupies the majority of the double pipe for a heat exchanger, can be improved, and a reduction in the pressure drop can be achieved.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">An outer pipe and protruding parts of the double pipe for a heat exchanger may be brought into contact with each other by swaging the outer pipe toward the inner pipe. In this situation, the outer pipe and the protruding parts can easily be brought directly into contact with each other, and thereby the manufacturability of the double pipe for a heat exchanger, which comprises the outer-side channels partitioned at a plurality of locations in the circumferential direction, can be improved.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the cross section of the straight-pipe part orthogonal to the longitudinal direction, a total of arc lengths L of all the outer-side channels preferably is 60% or more of a circumferential length C of a virtual circumscribed circle of the inner pipe. Thus, by forming the outer-side channels in the straight-pipe part over a large region in the circumferential direction, the heat-exchanging performance of the straight-pipe part can be improved, and a reduction in the pressure drop can be achieved. In addition, in a cross section of the straight-pipe part orthogonal to the longitudinal direction, the total of arc lengths L of all the outer-side channels is preferably set to 90% or less of circumferential length C of a circumscribed circle of the inner pipe. In this situation, the contact width of contact parts between the inner pipe and the outer pipe can be easily assured, and thereby the outer-circumferential channel can be divided reliably.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the straight-pipe part, the number of the protruding parts provided on the inner pipe is preferably four locations or more and six locations or fewer. By virtue of setting the number of the protruding parts to four locations or more, the flow velocity of the outer-side channels of the straight-pipe part can be easily increased, and thereby heat-exchanging performance can be greatly improved. In addition, by setting the number of the protruding parts to six locations or fewer, it is possible to curtail an excessive increase in the pressure drop caused by the outer-side channels of the straight-pipe part having been divided up at numerous locations in the circumferential direction.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In a cross section of the straight-pipe part of the double pipe for a heat exchanger orthogonal to the longitudinal direction, the plurality of protruding parts is preferably formed equispaced. Thereby, the refrigerant flow volumes of the outer-side channels become amounts that are substantially equal in the circumferential direction. Consequently, it becomes easy to curtail non uniformity in heat exchange between the refrigerant that flows through the outer-side channels and the refrigerant that flows through the channel inside the inner pipe.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The spiral angle of each of the protruding parts of the straight-pipe part is preferably 20&#xb0; or more and 60&#xb0; or less. The spiral angle is the angle formed by the forming direction of the protruding parts and a straight line parallel to the longitudinal direction of the double pipe for a heat exchanger. By setting the spiral angle to 20&#xb0; or more, it becomes easy to increase the contact portions between each of the outer-side channels and the inner pipe, and thereby it becomes easy to improve heat-exchanging performance. By setting the spiral angle to 60&#xb0; or less, it is possible to curtail the pressure drop of the refrigerant that flows in the outer-side channels from becoming excessively large.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The boundary part between each of the protruding parts on the outer-circumferential surface of the inner pipe and each of the helical recessed parts can be formed in an angular shape. Here, &#x201c;angular shape&#x201d; refers to the state in which the radius of curvature of each of the protruding parts and the radius of curvature of each of the helical recessed parts changes in a step shape, with the boundary part as the boundary. In the situation in which each of the boundary parts has an angular shape, the protruding part tends to manifest such that it protrudes sufficiently toward the outer-circumference side relative to the helical recessed part, and the radius of curvature tends to become small. Consequently, in the situation in which the boundary parts are formed having an angular shape, the protruding parts and the outer pipe can be easily brought into tight contact reliably, and thereby the outer-side channels can be divided up reliably in the circumferential direction.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">WORKING EXAMPLES</heading><heading id="h-0012" level="1">Working Example 1</heading><p id="p-0046" num="0045">A working example of the double pipe for a heat exchanger will now be explained, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a double pipe <b>1</b> for a heat exchanger (hereinbelow, may also be simply called double pipe <b>1</b>) of the present example has a double-pipe structure in which an inner pipe <b>3</b> is disposed in the interior of an outer pipe <b>2</b>.

Thereby, an improvement in the heat-exchanging performance of the straight-pipe part <b>11</b> and a reduction in the pressure drop of the refrigerant that flows through the outer-side channels <b>4</b> can be achieved.

For example, a fluorocarbon-based refrigerant, such as R-134a, R-1234yf, or the like, or a CO<sub>2 </sub>refrigerant can be used as the refrigerant.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Next, the functions and effects of the present example will be explained.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In the straight-pipe part <b>11</b> of the double pipe <b>1</b> of the present example, the inner-circumferential surface of the outer pipe <b>2</b> and the protruding parts <b>31</b> of the inner pipe <b>3</b> are in contact, and the outer-side channels <b>4</b>, which are partitioned at a plurality of locations in the circumferential direction, are formed between the outer pipe <b>2</b> and the inner pipe <b>3</b>. In this manner, in the straight-pipe part <b>11</b>, by forming the outer-side channels <b>4</b> such that they are divided up in the circumferential direction, the flow velocity of the refrigerant flowing through the outer-side channels <b>4</b> in the straight-pipe part <b>11</b> can be ensured, and thereby the heat-exchanging performance of the straight-pipe part <b>11</b> can be improved.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In addition, in a cross section of the straight-pipe part <b>11</b> orthogonal to the X direction, when D [mm] is defined as the maximum depth of each of the outer-side channels <b>4</b> and L [mm] is defined as the arc length of each of the outer-side channels <b>4</b> in the circumferential direction, the average value of the D/L values of all the outer-side channels <b>4</b> is greater than 0.09 and less than 0.20. That is, in the straight-pipe part <b>11</b>, each of the outer-side channels <b>4</b> is formed such that its depth becomes small to a certain extent and its arc length in the circumferential direction becomes long. For that reason, in the straight-pipe part <b>11</b>, the contact surface area between the refrigerant that flows in the outer-side channels <b>4</b> and the outer pipe <b>2</b> and the contact surface area between the refrigerant that flows in the outer-side channels <b>4</b> and the inner pipe <b>3</b> can be increased. Thereby, the heat-exchanging performance of the straight-pipe part <b>11</b> can be improved.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In addition, in a cross section of the straight-pipe part <b>11</b>, by virtue of setting the average value of the D/L values of all the outer-side channels <b>4</b> to a value that is greater than 0.09, an increase in the pressure drop of the refrigerant that flows in each of the outer-side channels <b>4</b> in the straight-pipe part <b>11</b> can be curtailed. Furthermore, in a cross section of the straight-pipe part <b>11</b>, by setting the above-mentioned average value to a value of less than 0.20, an increase in the pressure drop of the refrigerant that flows in the inner-side channel <b>6</b> in the straight-pipe part <b>11</b> can be curtailed.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In addition, by swaging the outer pipe <b>2</b> toward the inner pipe <b>3</b>, the outer pipe <b>2</b> and the protruding parts <b>31</b> make contact. Thereby, the outer pipe <b>2</b> and the protruding parts <b>31</b> can easily be brought directly (mechanically) into contact, and thereby the manufacturability of the double pipe <b>1</b>, which comprises the outer-side channels <b>4</b> partitioned at the plurality of locations in the circumferential direction, can be improved.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In addition, in the straight-pipe part <b>11</b>, the inner pipe <b>3</b> comprises the protruding parts <b>31</b> at four locations in the circumferential direction.

In addition, by configuring four of the protruding parts <b>31</b> in the straight-pipe part <b>11</b>, the pressure drop of the refrigerant that flows through the interior of the outer-side channels <b>4</b> becoming excessively large can be curtailed.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In addition, with regard to the cross-sectional shape of the inner pipe <b>3</b>, the plurality of the protruding parts <b>31</b> is formed equispaced. For that reason, the refrigerant flow volumes of the outer-side channels <b>4</b> become equal in the circumferential direction. Consequently, it becomes easy to curtail heat-exchanging nonuniformity between the refrigerant that flows through the outer-side channels <b>4</b> and the refrigerant that flows through the channel inside the inner pipe <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In addition, in the straight-pipe part <b>11</b>, the spiral angle of each of the protruding parts <b>31</b> is 20&#xb0; or more and 60&#xb0; or less. By setting the spiral angle to 20&#xb0; or more, it is easy to increase the contact portions between the outer-side channels <b>4</b> and the inner pipe <b>3</b>, and thereby it becomes easy to improve the heat-exchanging performance.
