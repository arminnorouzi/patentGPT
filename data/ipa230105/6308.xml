relates to a module connector for electrically conductively connecting at least two battery modules, wherein the module connector comprises a connecting conductor, which has a contact region that is arrangeable on a contact element of a battery module.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Such module connectors are used in an electrical battery storage that comprises a plurality of battery modules to connect the battery modules of the battery storage to one another in an electrically conductive manner.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">When assembling the module connectors on the battery modules to be connected to one another, it must be ensured that there is no risk of an electric shock during and/or after the assembly.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">To prevent this, it is known, for example, to use a fastening screw, which has a screw head provided with an electrically insulating coating, as a fastening element for assembling the module connector on the contact element of the battery module.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The production of such an electrically insulating coating is complex, however, and such an electrically insulating coating can be easily damaged before or during the assembly, the contact protection provided by the electrically insulating coating then being lost.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, a module connector of the kind stated at the outset is created in which a sufficient contact protection for a fastening element is ensured in a simple and reliable manner.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, a module connector with the features of the preamble of claim <b>1</b> is created in which the module connector comprises a contact protection element, which at least partially covers the contact region of the connecting conductor, and a fastening element for fixing the contact region of the connecting conductor to the contact element, wherein the fastening element in a rest position is held on the contact protection element and is transferable from the rest position into an assembly position in which a contact protection is provided for at least a protected part of the fastening element by the contact protection element.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the case of the module connector in accordance with the invention, the fastening element is already connected to the contact protection element before the assembly of the module connector on a battery module, such that no additional connecting elements have to be used in the assembly of the module connector on the battery module. The assembly of the module connector on the battery module is hereby simplified and the assembly time shortened.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, provision is made that the fastening element has a head and a shank and the protected part of the fastening element comprises the head of the fastening element.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Provision is preferably made that the fastening element in the rest position and/or in the assembly position is captively held on the contact protection element. This enables a simple handleability of the module connector upon assembly on a battery module or upon disassembly of the module connector from the battery module in the case of a repair or maintenance.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The contact protection element may comprise a blocking element, which blocks a transfer of the fastening element from the rest position into the assembly position. Provision may hereby be made that the blockade of the fastening element can be overcome by the fastening element being acted upon with an activating force that is sufficiently high in order to destroy the blocking element or to deform same such that the fastening element can be moved past the blocking element.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Furthermore, provision may be made that the contact protection element comprises a retaining element, which prevents a removal of the fastening element from the contact protection element in the rest position of the fastening element. The contact protection element and the fastening element can thus be handled as a unit in a simple manner.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, provision is made that the fastening element comprises a holding region, which in the rest position of the fastening element is held between the blocking element and the retaining element, particularly preferably substantially without play.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Here, the holding region may, in particular, comprise part of the head of the fastening element.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Furthermore, provision may be made that the fastening element has an engagement region with which an assembly tool, for example a screwdriver or a key, can be brought into engagement in order to move the fastening element out of the rest position by acting upon it with an activating force.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Such an engagement region may, in particular, have an engagement recess that has, for example, a polygonal cross section.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In particular, provision may be made that the engagement region is formed complementary to an Allen key or complementary to a Torx key.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The blocking element may comprise, in particular, at least one rib.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Such a rib may run substantially perpendicularly to a longitudinal axis of the fastening element.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Alternatively, provision may also be made that such a rib runs substantially in parallel to a longitudinal axis of the fastening element.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The contact protection element may comprise an inlet channel for accommodating a portion of the connecting conductor.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The contact protection element may be captively held on the connecting conductor, preferably by interference fit.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The connecting conductor may comprise an insulating sleeve, and the inlet channel may have a constriction, wherein provision is preferably made that the insulating sleeve of the connecting conductor ends in the region of the constriction of the inlet channel.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">A longitudinal axis of the inlet channel may run obliquely to a longitudinal axis of the fastening element when the fastening element is arranged in its rest position on the contact protection element.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The angle that the longitudinal axis of the inlet channel encloses with the longitudinal axis of the fastening element may preferably be at least 10&#xb0;, in particular at least 20&#xb0;, particularly preferably at least 30&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Furthermore, the angle that the longitudinal axis of the inlet channel encloses with the longitudinal axis of the fastening element may preferably be at most 80&#xb0;, in particular at most 70&#xb0;, particularly preferably at most 60&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, provision is made that the contact protection element has a through-recess through which a part of an assembly tool can extend from an outside space of the contact protection element into an inside space of the contact protection element.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Such an assembly tool may serve, in particular, to rotate the fastening element about its longitudinal axis in order to, for example, bring the fastening element into engagement with a thread that is arranged on the contact element of the battery module.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The contact protection element may comprise an electrically insulating plastic material and, in particular, be made substantially entirely of such an electrically insulating plastic material.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The contact protection element may be configured as an injection molded part. The contact protection element is preferably formed in one piece. The connecting conductor may comprise a flat conductor.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In particular, provision may be made that the contact region of the connecting conductor is configured as a flat conductor.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The contact region of the connecting conductor preferably has a through-opening through which the fastening element of the module connector extends in the assembly position.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The connecting conductor may comprise an electrically conductive conductor body, which is configured as a flat conductor, preferably as a flat wire.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The conductor body may be provided, at least in sections, with an electrically insulating sleeve, for example made of a plastic material.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Furthermore, the connecting conductor may be made, for example, of a round wire provided with an insulating sleeve, at least one end region of the connecting conductor being reshaped to form a contact region that can be fixed to a contact element of the battery module.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">To reduce the mechanical forces occurring in the connecting conductor, in particular the mechanical forces due to position tolerances of the battery modules to be connected to one another by the connecting conductor, provision may be made that the connecting conductor has at least one bend, preferably at least two bends. Such position tolerances can occur upon assembly of the battery modules due to a swelling of the cells of the battery modules as a result of an aging process or during the operation of the battery modules due to different thermal expansions.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The at least one bend of the connecting conductor preferably has a bend angle of at least 90&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The sum of the bend angles of the bends of the connecting conductor is preferably at least 180&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The electrically conducting conductor body of the connecting conductor is preferably made of an electrically conductive metallic material.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">For example, provision may be made that the conductor body of the connecting conductor is made of a CCA (copper clad aluminum) or of a different material containing primarily aluminum.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The use of aluminum offers the advantage that aluminum has a lower density than copper, such that a conductor body that is made primarily of aluminum is lighter than a conductor body made of copper ever when taking into account the lower electrical conductivity of aluminum with the same current-carrying capacity.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The use of copper offers the advantage that a conductor body made primarily of copper has a lower contact resistance to a contact element of the battery module made of copper.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The connecting conductor configured, at least in sections, as round wire is preferably brought by means of a wire bending machine into the form required for the connection of the battery modules to be connected to one another.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The end regions of the connecting conductor on which the connecting conductor is to be connected to a respective contact element of a battery module are free from the insulating sleeve (stripped).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, provision is made that the contact region of the connecting conductor is formed from the starting material of the connecting conductor by means of a reshaping operation, for example by means of a drop forging operation.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">During the reshaping operation, in particular, a through-opening for the fastening element of the module connector can be formed from the starting material of the connecting conductor.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In principle, the portion of the connecting conductor configured as insulated round wire may also be made of cable strands.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In this case, however, the cable strands would have to be materially bonded, for example by welding or soldering, to the contact region of the connecting conductor in an electrically conductive manner.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In contrast, a contact region of the connecting conductor that is produced in one piece from the conductor body of the connecting conductor offers the advantage that the production of a joint between the conductor body of the connecting conductor on the one hand and the contact region of the connecting conductor on the other hand can be forgone, which simplifies the production of the module connector and increases the reliability of the electrical connection by the module connector.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">If the connecting conductor is provided with an electrically insulating sleeve, this thus advantageously enables the use of the module connector in environments in which an electrical insulation strength and/or a contact protection is required.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The connecting conductor is preferably provided on at least two different regions of the connecting conductor, in particular on at least two end regions of the connecting conductor, with a respective contact region for electrically conductively connecting to a contact element of a battery module.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The contact region of the connecting conductor can be latched to the contact protection element.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The present invention further relates to a method for electrically conductively connecting a module connector to a contact element of a battery module.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, such a method is provided by means of which a sufficient contact protection for a fastening element of the module connector in the assembly position on the contact element of the battery module is provided in a simple and reliable manner.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, provision is made that the module connector comprises a connecting conductor, a contact protection element, and a fastening element and that the method comprises the following:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0058">positioning a contact region of the connecting conductor on which the contact protection element is arranged on the contact element of the battery module;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0059">transferring the fastening element held in a rest position on the contact protection element from the rest position into an assembly position in which the fastening element
