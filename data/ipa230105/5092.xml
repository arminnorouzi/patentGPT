It should be understood that particular features and aspects of any embodiment disclosed herein may be used and/or combined with particular features and aspects of any other embodiment disclosed herein. It should also be understood that such embodiments are by way of example and are merely illustrative of a small number of embodiments within the scope of the present invention. Various changes and modifications obvious to one skilled in the art to which the present invention pertains are deemed to be within the spirit, scope and contemplation of the present invention as further defined in the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The approaches disclosed herein may improve the safety and security of a ridesharing service. More specifically, for example, the approaches disclosed herein enable and/or improve driver and passenger safety in a ridesharing service, for example, by determining whether a trip order is suspicious and/or has a high risk. Incidents can make a trip unsafe. Incidents can include physical incidents (e.g., property losses and physical harms to drivers and passengers). For a trip order that is suspicious and/or has a high risk, the ridesharing service can ask the passenger to provide verification information via an application (e.g., mobile application) of the ridesharing service. As used herein, the application may be referred to as an &#x201c;App.&#x201d; The verification information can include a credit card number and an associated expiration month. The verification information can include a national identification number and a date of birth of the person assigned the national identification number. The verification information can include login information of an online system, such as a social media system.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The App of the ridesharing service can determine the validity of the verification information using a verification service or a third party service. The verification service can in turn verify the validity of the verification information using a third party service. For example, the App of the ridesharing service can determine the credit card number and the associated expiration month match each other using a validation service, which in turn uses a third party service (e.g., a payment or credit card processing service), to verify the credit card number and the associated expiration month match each other. As another example, the App of the ridesharing service can determine the login information of an online system provided by the passenger is valid using an application program interface (API) and/or software development kit (SDK) of the online system. The App of the ridesharing service can save the verification information (e.g., a credit card number and an associated expiration month) to a passenger information database. Alternatively or additionally, the App of the ridesharing service can save an indication that the verification information (e.g., login information of an online system) provided by the passenger is valid to the passenger information database.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">After the validity of the verification information is verified, the App of the ridesharing service can send an updated trip order or resend the trip order to the ridesharing service. The ridesharing service can determine a decision for the updated trip order or the resent trip order based on the verification information provided for the passenger of the account.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">Passenger, Driver, and Ridesharing Platform System Interactions</heading><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example environment for a ridesharing platform system. In the environment <b>100</b> illustrates in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a passenger <b>104</b> uses a passenger device <b>104</b><i>d </i>(e.g., a smartphone, a tablet, or a computer) to make a trip request, via a communication network <b>108</b> (e.g., the Internet) to a ridesharing platform system <b>112</b> (such as the computing system <b>202</b> described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). The ridesharing platform system <b>112</b> can in turn assign a driver <b>116</b> and the driver's vehicle <b>116</b><i>v </i>(e.g., a car, a SUV, and a truck) to fulfil the trip request. The driver <b>116</b> can receive and accept or decline the trip request using a driver device <b>116</b><i>d </i>(e.g., a smartphone, a tablet, or a computer). The driver device <b>116</b><i>d </i>can be a standalone device or part of the driver's vehicle <b>116</b>v.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">During an onboarding process, the passenger <b>104</b> and the driver <b>116</b> can provide personal information to the ridesharing platform system <b>112</b>. Stringent background checks can increase driver safety and passenger safety. The passenger <b>104</b> can provide the ridesharing platform system <b>112</b> with a pickup or starting location and a drop off or destination location of a trip and receive pricing information (e.g., the estimated cost of the trip) and timing information (e.g. the estimated duration of the trip). If the pricing information and timing information are acceptable to the passenger <b>104</b>, the passenger <b>104</b> can make a trip request or place an order (e.g., by clicking an order button) to the ridesharing platform system <b>112</b>. After receiving the trip request from the passenger <b>104</b>, the ridesharing platform system <b>112</b> can decide whether to accept the trip request and assign or match the driver <b>116</b> to the passenger for the particular trip request. Declining or rejecting a trip request of a passenger determined to be likely an offender in an incident can increase driver safety. The driver <b>116</b> can proceed to and arrive at the pickup location, where the passenger <b>104</b> can enter the driver's vehicle <b>116</b>v and be transported, by the driver <b>116</b> using the vehicle <b>116</b>v, to the drop off location of the trip request or order.

Suspicious conditions can include the trip order is a first trip order of the account, the pickup time of the trip order is night time (e.g., about 20:00, about 22:00, about 0:00, or about 2:00), and the trip order is being paid with cash.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">With respect to the method <b>500</b>, at block <b>512</b>, the computer system can request verification information unavailable in a passenger information database being provided for a passenger of the account. The passenger information database can be operationally coupled to the computing system. For example, the passenger information database can be part of the computing system. As another example, the passenger information database can be part of a passenger information database system accessible by the computing system. The computing system can transmit, to the mobile application, a request for the mobile application to be provided with the verification information unavailable in the passenger information database. For example, the computing system can transmit a message to the mobile application that the passenger associated with the account using the mobile application to provide verification information.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The mobile application can receive the request for the mobile application to be provided with the verification unavailable in the passenger information database, from the computing system. The mobile application can request the passenger provide verification information. The mobile application can receive verification information from the passenger. The verification information of the passenger can comprise two or more types of verification information. The two or more types of verification information can comprise a credit card number and associated information, an identification number and associated information, and login information of an online system (e.g., a social media system, such as Facebook&#xae;, Twitter&#xae;, Instagram&#xae;, YouTube&#xae;, and LinkedIn&#xae;. The credit card number and associated information can comprise a credit card number, an expiration date an address, a security number, or a combination thereof. The identification number and associated information can comprise a state identification number, a national identification number, a passport number, an issuance date or month, an expiration date or month, an issuance authority, a date of birth of the person having the identification number or passport number, or a combination thereof. The login information can include a username, a password, an answer to a security question, or a combination thereof. The passenger can be asked to provide two or more elements of a type of verification information. For example, the passenger can be asked to provide a national identification number and an issuance date. As another example, the passenger can be asked to provide a national identification number and a date of birth.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">With respect to the method <b>500</b>, at block <b>516</b>, the computer system can receive an indication that valid verification information has been provided for the passenger of the account from the passenger information database. The computing system can receive an updated trip order (or the trip order again) for the account. The updated trip order for the account received can be indicative of the valid verification information having been provided for the passenger of the account. The computing system can receive an updated trip order for the account from the mobile application. The mobile application can receive a request to transmit the updated trip order to the computing system from the passenger. The mobile application can transmit the updated trip order for the account to the computing system responsive to receiving the request to transmit the updated trip order to the computing system from the passenger.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">For verification using a credit card number and associated information (e.g., an expiration date and a security number), or an identification number or associated information (e.g., a date of issuance, or a date of expiration), the mobile application can transmit the verification information received from the passenger to a verification system. The verification system can be operationally coupled to the computing system. The verification system can be part of the system. Alternatively, the verification system can be a separate system accessible by the system. The mobile application can receive an indication that the verification information received from the passenger is valid from the verification system. The mobile application can transmit an updated trip order or resend the trip order for the account to the ridesharing system.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The verification system can determine the verification information received from the mobile application is valid using a third party service, such as a payment or credit card processing system, service, or database. For example, the verification information can include a credit card number and an associated expiration month. The verification system can determine the credit card number and the associated expiration month match each other using a third party service (e.g., a payment or credit card processing service), to verify the credit card number and the associated expiration month match each other.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Alternatively or additionally, the verification system can determine the verification information received from the mobile application is valid using an identification number verification system, service, or database. A registration process of the payment processing system can require more or more stringent requirements than a registration process of the ridesharing system. For example, to obtain a credit card, a user needs to provide a bank with his name, date of birth, home address, a driver license number, and/or a social security number. A process of obtaining an identification number verifiable using the identification number verification system can require more or more stringent requirements than the registration process of the ridesharing system. For example, to obtain a government identification number, a person has to provide a government entity with a name, a date of birth, an address, and/or a birth certification. The verification system can cause the verification information received from the mobile application, or a portion thereof, to be saved to the passenger information database system. For example, the verification system can save the verification information received to the passenger information database.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">For verification using login information of an online account (e.g., a social media account), the mobile application can transmit the verification information (e.g., a username and password) received from the passenger to an online system (e.g., a social media system, such as Facebook&#xae;). The mobile application can receive an indication that the verification information received from the passenger is valid from the online system. For example, the verification information can include login information of the online system. The mobile application can determine the login information of an online system provided by the passenger is valid using an application program interface (API) and/or software development kit (SDK) of the online system.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The mobile application can cause the indication that the verification information received from the passenger is valid to be saved to the passenger information database system. For example, the mobile application can save the indication that the verification information received from the passenger is valid to the passenger information database system without saving the actual verification information to the passenger information database system. An account creation process of the online system can require more or more stringent requirements than a registration process of the ridesharing system. For example, to create an account of the online system, a user may need to provide a user name, a password, a phone number, or a combination thereof. The online system can send a verification code to the phone number and ask the user to provide the verification code during the account creation process. As another example, the online system may not allow a phone number to be used for too many accounts, such as 5, 10, or more.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">With respect to the method <b>500</b>, at block <b>520</b>, the computer system can determine the decision for the trip order based on the valid verification information provided for the passenger of the account. The computing system can determine whether the verification information being provided by the passenger of the account is associated with another account. If so, the computing system can decline the trip order, disable the account and/or the other account, and/or suspend the account and/or the second account. For example, the computing system can decline a trip order if multiple accounts are associated (e.g., linked) with one credit card number as payment methods. If not, the computing system can assign a driver for the trip order. For example, the computing system can decline a trip order if multiple accounts are associated (e.g., linked) with one national identification number.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Alternatively or additionally, the computing system can determine whether the verification information being provided by the passenger is consistent with passenger information in a passenger profile associated with the account stored in the passenger information database system. For example, the computing system can determine whether the age information in the passenger profile associated with the account is consistent (e.g., within a threshold number of years) with the age information associated with the identification number provided by the passenger. If so, the computing system can assign a driver for the trip order. If not, the computing system can decline the trip order, disable the account, and/or suspend the account.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In some embodiments, the computer system can determine the decision for the trip order based on the risk for the driver for the trip order. The risk for the driver can be determined based on the gender of the passenger. The risk for the driver can be determined based on the passenger's prior behavior, such as the number of recent trip orders, the number of recent canceled trip orders, and driver identities and car models of the recent trip orders and canceled trip orders. The risk for the driver can be determined based on the pickup location, the drop off location, the pickup time, the estimated drop off time, the estimated trip duration of the trip order, and the estimated route for the trip order. The risk for the driver can be determined based on the review of the passenger by drivers who have provided transportation services for the passenger. The decision for the trip order can be an acceptance of the trip order and a decline of the trip order. The decision for the trip order can be a particular driver to assign to the trip order.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">Computer System</heading><p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a block diagram that illustrates a computer system <b>600</b> upon which any of the embodiments described herein may be implemented.
