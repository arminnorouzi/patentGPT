Also, the size of each component does not completely reflect the actual size. In the drawings, like reference numerals denote like or corresponding elements.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Advantages and features of the disclosure and methods of accomplishing the same may be understood more readily by reference to the following detailed description of the embodiments of the disclosure and the accompanying drawings. In this regard, the embodiments of the disclosure may have different forms and should not be construed as being limited to the descriptions set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments of the disclosure are provided so that the disclosure will be thorough and complete and will fully convey the concept of the disclosure to one of ordinary skill in the art, and the disclosure will only be defined by the appended claims. Throughout the specification, like reference numerals denote like elements. While describing the disclosure, detailed description of related well-known functions or configurations may be omitted when it is deemed that they may unnecessarily obscure the essence of the disclosure. Also, terms used below are defined in consideration of functions in the disclosure, and may have different meanings according to an intention of a user or operator, customs, or the like. Thus, the terms should be defined based on the description throughout the specification.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Throughout the disclosure, the expression &#x201c;at least one of a, b or c&#x201d; indicates only a, only b, only c, both a and b, both a and c, both b and c, all of a, b, and c, or variations thereof.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Throughout the specification, a layer may also be referred to as an entity.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Hereinafter, a base station is an entity that allocates resources of a terminal, and may be at least one of a next generation node B (gNB), an evolved node B (eNB), a node B (NB), a base station (BS), a wireless access unit, a base station controller, or a node on a network. Also, the base station may be a network entity including at least one of an integrated access and backhaul (IAB)-donor that is a gNB providing a network access to a terminal(s) through a network of a backhaul and access links in a new radio (NR) system, or an IAB-node that is a radio access network (RAN) node supporting an NR access link(s) to a terminal(s) and supporting NR backhaul links to the IAB-donor or another IAB-node. A terminal may be wirelessly accessed through an IAB-node, and transmit or receive data to or from an IAB-donor connected to at least one IAB-node through a backhaul link. Examples of a terminal may include user equipment (UE), a mobile station (MS), a cellular phone, a smartphone, a computer, and a multimedia system capable of performing a communication function. In the disclosure, a downlink (DL) is a wireless transmission path of a signal transmitted from a base station to a terminal, and an uplink (UL) is a wireless transmission path of a signal transmitted from a terminal to a base station. Also, hereinbelow, a long-term evolution (LTE) or long-term evolution advanced (LTE-A) system may be described as an example, but an embodiment of the disclosure may also be applied to other communication systems having a similar technical background or channel form. An example of the other communication may include a 5<sup>th </sup>generation wireless communication technology (5G or new radio (NR)) developed after LTE-A, and hereinafter, 5G may have a concept including existing LTE, LTE-A, and another similar service. Also, it will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the disclosure may be applied to other communication systems through some modifications without departing from the scope of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Here, it will be understood that combinations of blocks in flowcharts or process flow diagrams may be performed by computer program instructions. Because these computer program instructions may be loaded into a processor of a general-purpose computer, a special purpose computer, or another programmable data processing apparatus, the instructions, which are performed by a processor of a computer or another programmable data processing apparatus, create units for performing functions described in the flowchart block(s). The computer program instructions may be stored in a computer-executable or computer-readable memory capable of directing a computer or another programmable data processing apparatus to implement a function in a particular manner, and thus the instructions stored in the computer-executable or computer-readable memory may also be capable of producing manufacturing items containing instruction units for performing the functions described in the flowchart block(s). The computer program instructions may also be loaded into a computer or another programmable data processing apparatus, and thus, instructions for operating the computer or the other programmable data processing apparatus by generating a computer-executed process when a series of operations are performed in the computer or the other programmable data processing apparatus may provide operations for performing the functions described in the flowchart block(s).</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In addition, each block may represent a portion of a module, segment, or code that includes one or more executable instructions for executing specified logical function(s). It should also be noted that in some alternative implementations, functions mentioned in blocks may occur out of order. For example, two blocks illustrated successively may actually be executed substantially concurrently, or the blocks may sometimes be performed in a reverse order according to the corresponding function.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Here, the term &#x201c;unit&#x201d; in the embodiments of the disclosure means a software component or hardware component such as a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) or an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), and performs a specific function. However, the term &#x201c;unit&#x201d; is not limited to software or hardware. The &#x201c;unit&#x201d; may be formed so as to be in an addressable storage medium, or may be formed so as to operate one or more processors. Thus, for example, the term &#x201c;unit&#x201d; may refer to components such as software components, object-oriented software components, class components, and task components, and may include processes, functions, attributes, procedures, subroutines, segments of program code, drivers, firmware, micro codes, circuits, data, a database, data structures, tables, arrays, or variables. A function provided by the components and &#x201c;units&#x201d; may be associated with the smaller number of components and &#x201c;units,&#x201d; or may be divided into additional components and &#x201c;units.&#x201d; Furthermore, the components and &#x201c;units&#x201d; may be embodied to reproduce one or more central processing units (CPUs) in a device or security multimedia card. Also, in the embodiments of the disclosure, the &#x201c;unit&#x201d; may include at least one processor.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Wireless communication systems have been developed from wireless communication systems providing voice centered services in the early stage toward broadband wireless communication systems providing high-speed, high-quality packet data services, like communication standards of high speed packet access (HSPA), long term evolution (LTE or evolved universal terrestrial radio access (E-UTRA)), LTE-advanced (LTE-A), and LTE-Pro of the 3GPP, high rate packet data (HRPD) and ultra mobile broadband (UMB) of 3GPP2, IEEE 802.16e or the like.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">As a representative example of the broadband wireless communication system, the LTE system has adopted an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) scheme in a downlink (DL) and has adopted a single carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) scheme in an uplink (UL). The UL refers to a radio link through which a terminal (a UE or an MS) transmits data or a control signal to a base station (BS) (e.g., eNode B), and the DL refers to a radio link through which a BS transmits data or a control signal to a terminal. In such a multiple access scheme, data or control information of each user is classified by generally allocating and managing the data or control information such that time-frequency resources for transmitting data or control information for each user do not overlap each other, that is, such that orthogonality is established.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">As a future communication system after the LTE system, that is, a 5G communication system, has to be able to freely reflect various requirements of a user and a service provider, and thus, services satisfying various requirements at the same time need to be supported. The services considered for the 5G communication system include enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), massive machine type communication (mMTC), ultra reliability low latency communication (hereinafter, URLLC), etc.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The eMBB aims to provide a higher data transfer rate than a data transfer rate supported by the LTE, LTE-A, or LTE-Pro system. For example, in the 5G communication system, the eMBB may be able to provide a peak data rate of 20 Gbps in a downlink and a peak data rate of 10 Gbps in an uplink from the viewpoint of one base station. In addition, the 5G communication system needs to provide the increased user perceived data rate of the terminal simultaneously with providing the peak data rate. In order to satisfy such requirements, improvement of various transmitting/receiving technologies including a further improved multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) transmission technology may be demanded. In addition, signals are transmitted using a transmission bandwidth of up to 20 MHz in a 2 GHz band used by the current LTE system, but the 5G communication system uses a bandwidth wider than 20 MHz in a frequency band of 3 to 6 GHz or more than 6 GHz, thereby satisfying a data rate required in the 5G communication system.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">At the same time, the mMTC is being considered to support application services such as Internet of things (IoT) in the 5G communication system. The mMTC is required for an access support of a large-scale terminal in a cell, coverage enhancement of a terminal, improved battery time, and cost reduction of a terminal in order to efficiently provide the IoT. The IoT needs to be able to support a large number of terminals (e.g., 1,000,000 terminals/km&#x2032;) in a cell because the IoT is attached to various sensors and various devices to provide communication functions. In addition, the terminals supporting the mMTC are more likely to be positioned in shaded areas not covered by a cell, such as the underground of a building due to nature of services, and thus, the terminal may require a wider coverage than other services provided by the 5G communication system. The terminals that support the mMTC may be configured as inexpensive terminals and require very long battery lifetime, such as 10 to 15 years, because it is difficult to frequently replace batteries of the terminals.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Lastly, the URLLC is a cellular-based wireless communication system used for a specific purpose (mission-critical). For example, a service used in remote control for a robot or machinery, industrial automation, unmanned aerial vehicle, remote health care, or emergency alert may be considered. Accordingly, communication provided by the URLLC may provide very low latency and very high reliability. For example, a service supporting the URLLC may satisfy air interface latency smaller than 0.5 milliseconds and at the same time, has a packet error rate of 10<sup>&#x2212;5 </sup>or less. Accordingly, for URLLC-supportive services, the 5G communication system may be required to provide a transmit time interval (TTI) shorter than those for other services while securing reliable communication links by allocating a broad resource in a frequency band.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The three services, that is, eMBB, URLLC, and mMTC, of the 5G system may be multiplexed in one system and may be transmitted. In this case, the services may use different transmission and reception methods and transmission and reception parameters in order to meet their different requirements. Obviously, the 5G system are not limited by the above three services.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Hereinafter, for convenience of description, some of terms and names defined by the 3GPP standard (standard of a 5G, NR, LTE, or similar system) may be used. However, the disclosure is not limited by such terms and names, and may be equally applied to systems conforming to other standards. Also, terms for identifying access nodes, terms denoting network entities, terms denoting messages, terms denoting interfaces between network entities, terms denoting various types of identification information, etc. used herein are exemplified for convenience of description. Thus, the terms used in the disclosure are not limited and other terms denoting targets having the same technical meanings may be used.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">[NR Time-Frequency Resource]</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Hereinafter, a frame structure of a 5G system will be described in detail with reference to accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a diagram showing a base structure of a time-frequency domain that is a radio resource region where data or a control channel is transmitted in a 5G system.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a horizontal axis represents a time domain and a vertical axis represents a frequency domain.

The information may be transmitted by the base station to the UE through higher layer signaling, for example, radio resource control (RRC) signaling. At least one BWP from among the configured one or plurality of BWPs may be activated. Whether to activate the configured BWP may be transmitted from the base station to the UE semi-statically through RRC signaling or dynamically through downlink control information (DCI).</p><p id="p-0085" num="0082">According to some embodiments of the disclosure, an initial BWP for an initial access may be configured for the UE before an RRC connection by the base station through a master information block (MIB). More specifically, the UE may receive configuration information related to a control resource set (CORESET) and a search space, in which a physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) may be transmitted, the PDCCH being designed to receive system information (may correspond to remaining system information (RMSI) or system information block 1 (SIB1)) required for the initial access, through an MIB in an initial access stage. The CORESET and search space that are configured through the MIB may be assumed to be identities (IDs) 0, respectively. The CORESET and search space that are configured through the MIB may be respectively referred to as a common CORESET and a common search space. The base station may notify the UE of configuration information, such as frequency allocation information, time allocation information, or numerology, for a CORESET #0, through the MIB. Also, the base station may notify the UE of configuration information for a monitoring cycle and occasion for the CORESET #0, i.e., configuration information for a search space #0, through the MIB. The UE may consider a frequency domain configured by the CORESET #0 obtained from the MIB, as an initial BWP for the initial access. Here, an ID of the initial BWP may be considered to be 0. The CORESET may be referred to as a control region, a control resource region, or the like.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0083">A configuration for the BWP supported in 5G may be used for various purposes.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0084">According to some embodiments of the disclosure, when a bandwidth supported by the UE is smaller than a system bandwidth, the UE may be supported through the configuration of the BWP. For example, the base station may configure the UE with a frequency location of the BWP such that the UE may transmit or receive data at a specific frequency location within the system bandwidth.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0085">Also, according to some embodiments of the disclosure, the base station may configure the UE with a plurality of BWPs for a purpose of supporting different numerologies. For example, to support data transmission/reception using both a subcarrier spacing of 15 kHz and a subcarrier spacing of 30 kHz for the UE, two BWPs respectively having the subcarrier spacings of 15 kHz and 30 kHz may be configured. Frequency division multiplexing may be performed on the different BWPs, and when data is to be transmitted/received in a specific subcarrier spacing, a BWP configured to have the corresponding subcarrier spacing may be activated.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0086">According to some embodiments of the disclosure, the base station may configure the UE with BWPs, which have different sizes of bandwidths, for a purpose of reducing power consumption of the UE. For example, when the UE supports a very wide bandwidth, for example, a bandwidth of 100 MHz, and always transmits/receives data through the corresponding bandwidth, very large power consumption may occur. In particular, it may be very inefficient in terms of power consumption to monitor an unnecessary downlink control channel in a large bandwidth of 100 MHz in a situation where there is no traffic. Accordingly, the base station may configure the UE with BWP of a relatively small bandwidth, for example, a BWP of 20 MHz, for a purpose of reducing the power consumption of the UE. In a situation where there is no traffic, the UE may perform a monitoring operation in a BWP of 20 MHz, and when data is generated, the UE may transmit/receive the data through a BWP of 100 MHz according to an instruction of the base station.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0087">In relation to a method of configuring the BWP, the UEs before RRC-connected may receive configuration information regarding the initial BWP through the MIB in the initial access stage. In detail, the UE may be configured with, from an MIB of a physical broadcast channel (PBCH), a CORESET for a downlink control channel through which DCI for scheduling a system information block (SIB) may be transmitted. A bandwidth of the CORESET configured by the MIB may be considered as the initial BWP, and the UE may receive a physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) through which the SIB is transmitted, through the configured initial BWP. The initial BWP may be used for other system information (OSI), paging, and random access, in addition to the reception of the SIB.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0088">[BWP Switch]</p><p id="p-0092" num="0089">When the UE is configured with one or more BWPs, the base station may indicate the UE to change (or switch or transit) the BWP by using a BWP indicator field in the DCI. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, when a currently activated BWP of the UE is the BWP #1 <b>301</b>, the base station may indicate the BWP #2 <b>302</b> as a BWP indicator in the DCI to the UE, and the UE may perform a BWP switch to the BWP #2 <b>302</b> indicated by the BWP indicator in the received DCI.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0090">As described above, because the DCI-based BWP switch may be indicated by the DCI scheduling a PDSCH or physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH), when a BWP switch request is received, the UE needs to perform reception or transmission in the PDSCH or PUSCH scheduled by the DCI, at the switched BWP without any difficulty.

When the base station is to schedule the data channel in the new BWP, the base station may determine time domain resource allocation for the data channel, considering the delay time T<sub>BWP </sub>for the BWP switch of the UE. In other words, regarding a method of determining the time domain resource allocation for the data channel when scheduling the data channel in the new BWP, the base station may schedule the data channel after the delay time T<sub>BWP </sub>for the BWP switch. Accordingly, the UE may not expect the DCI indicating the BWP switch to indicate a value of a slot offset K0 ( ) or K2 smaller than the delay time T<sub>BWP </sub>for the BWP switch.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0093">When the UE has received the DCI (for example, a DCI format 1_1 or 0_1) indicating the BWP switch, the UE may not perform any transmission or reception during a time period from a third symbol of a slot that received the PDCCH including the DCI to a starting point of a slot indicated by the value of the slot offset K0 or K2 indicated by a time domain resource allocation indicator field in the DCI. For example, when the UE has received the DCI indicating the BWP switch in the slot n, and a value of the slot offset indicated by the DCI is K, the UE may not perform any transmission or reception from a third symbol of the slot n to a symbol before a slot n+K (i.e., a last symbol of a slot n+K&#x2212;1).</p><p id="p-0098" num="0094">[Synchronization Signal (SS)/PBCH Block]</p><p id="p-0099" num="0095">Next, an SS/PBCH block in 5G will be described.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0096">The SS/PBCH block may denote a physical layer channel block including a primary SS (PSS), a secondary SS (SSS), and a PBCH.

num="0115"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates a diagram showing an example of a base unit of time and frequency resources configuring a downlink control channel, which may be used in 5G. According to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the base unit of the time and frequency resources configuring the downlink control channel may be called an REG <b>503</b>, and the REG <b>503</b> may be defined by one OFDM symbol <b>501</b> on a time axis and one physical resource block (PRB) <b>502</b> on a frequency axis, that is, may be defined by, <b>12</b> subcarriers. A base station connects and attaches REGs <b>503</b> to each other to configure a downlink control channel allocation unit.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0116">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, when a base unit for allocation for the downlink control channel in 5G is a control channel element (CCE) <b>504</b>, one CCE <b>504</b> may be configured by a plurality of the REGs <b>503</b>. For example, the REG <b>503</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> may be configured by 12 REs, and when one CCE <b>504</b> is configured by six REGs <b>503</b>, the one CCE <b>504</b> may be configured by 72 REs. When a downlink CORESET is configured, the downlink CORESET may be configured by the plurality of CCEs <b>504</b>, and a specific downlink control channel may be transmitted after being mapped to one or the plurality of CCEs <b>504</b>, according to an aggregation level (AL) in the CORESET. The CCEs <b>504</b> in the CORESET are distinguished by numbers, and here, the numbers of CCEs <b>504</b> may be assigned according to a logical mapping scheme.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0117">The base unit of the downlink control channel shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, i.e., the REG <b>503</b>, may include REs to which DCI is mapped and a region to which a DMRS <b>505</b> that is a reference signal for decoding the REs is mapped. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, three DMRSs <b>505</b> may be transmitted in one REG <b>503</b>. The number of CCEs required to transmit a PDCCH may be 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 depending on an AL, and the different numbers of CCEs may be used to implement link adaptation of a downlink control channel. For example, when AL=L, one downlink control channel may be transmitted via L CCEs. A UE needs to detect a signal while information about a downlink control channel is unknown, and a search space indicating a group of CCEs is defined for blind decoding. The search space is a group of downlink control channel candidates including CCEs that are attempted to be decoded by the UE on a given AL, and the UE may have a plurality of search spaces because there are several ALs forming one group by using 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 CCEs. A search space set may be defined as a group of search spaces in all configured ALs.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0118">The search spaces may be classified into a common search space and a UE-specific search space. UEs of a certain group or all UEs may inquire into a common search space of a PDCCH to receive cell-common control information, such as a paging message or dynamic scheduling for system information. For example, PDSCH scheduling allocation information for transmission of an SIB including cell operator information or the like may be received by inquiring into the common search space of the PDCCH. The common search space may be defined as a group of pre-promised CCEs because the certain group of UEs or all UEs need to receive the PDCCH. Scheduling allocation information for a UE-specific PDSCH or PUSCH may be received by inquiring into a UE-specific search space of the PDCCH. The UE-specific search space may be UE-specifically defined by a function of an identity of a UE and various system parameters.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0119">In 5G, a parameter for a search space of the PDCCH may be configured to the UE by a base station through higher layer signaling (for example, SIB, MIB, or RRC signaling). For example, the base station may configure the UE with the number of PDCCH candidates in each of the L ALs, a monitoring cycle for the search space, a monitoring occasion of a symbol unit within a slot for the search space, a search space type (common search space or UE-specific search space), a combination of a DCI format and RNTI to be monitored in the search space, and a CORESET index for monitoring the search space. For example, the parameter for the search space of the PDCCH may include following pieces of information.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00009" num="00009"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="2"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="161pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="105pt" align="left"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="2" rowsep="1">TABLE 9</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>SearchSpace ::=</entry><entry>&#x2003;SEQUENCE {</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="266pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>&#x2003;-- Identity of the search space.

Accordingly, NR supports four types of QCL relationships shown in Table 17 below.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00021" num="00021"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="2"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="98pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="119pt" align="left"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="2" rowsep="1">TABLE 17</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>QCL type</entry><entry>Large-scale characteristics</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>A</entry><entry>Doppler shift, Doppler spread,</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>average delay, delay spread</entry></row><row><entry>B</entry><entry>Doppler shift, Doppler spread</entry></row><row><entry>C</entry><entry>Doppler shift, average delay</entry></row><row><entry>D</entry><entry>Spatial Rx parameter</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0171" num="0181">A spatial RX parameter may be a generic term for some or all of various parameters including an angle of arrival (AoA), a power angular spectrum (PAS) of AoA, an angle of departure (AoD), a PAS of AoD, a transmit/receive channel correlation, transmit/receive beamforming, and a spatial channel correlation.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0182">The QCL relationship may be configured to a UE through an RRC parameter TCI-State and QCL-Info as shown in Table 18 below.

In other words, when the plurality of CORESETs overlap in time, the UE may receive only one QCL-TypeD characteristic. Here, a criterion for determining a QCL priority may be as follows:<ul id="ul0017" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0017-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0018" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0018-0001" num="0208">Criterion 1.

First, when CORESET 1 contains CSI-RS 1 as a reference signal having a relationship of QCL-TypeD, the reference signal having the relationship of QCL-TypeD with CSI-RS 1 is SSB 1, and a reference signal having the relationship of QCL-TypeD with another CORESET 2 is SSB 1, the UE may consider that the CORESET 1 and CORESET 2 have different QCL-TypeD characteristics. Second, when CORESET 1 contains CSI-RS 1 configured in a cell 1, as a reference signal having a relationship of QCL-TypeD, the reference signal having the relationship of QCL-TypeD with CSI-RS 1 is SSB 1, CORESET 2 contains CSI-RS 2 configured in a cell 2, as a reference signal having a relationship of QCL-TypeD, and the reference signal having the relationship of QCL-TypeD with CSI-RS 2 is also SSB 1, the UE may consider that the CORESET 1 and CORESET 2 have same QCL-TypeD characteristics.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0212"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> illustrates a diagram for describing a method of selecting a receivable CORESET, considering a priority when a UE receives a downlink control channel, in a wireless communication system according to an embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0213">For example, a UE may be configured with reception for a plurality of CORESETs overlapping in time in a specific PDCCH monitoring occasion <b>1110</b>, and the plurality of CORESETs may be connected to a common search space or UE-specific search space for a plurality of cells.

A base station may configure the UE with at least one SRS configuration for each uplink BWP and at least one SRS resource set for each SRS configuration, so as to transmit configuration information for the SRS transmission.

For example, the individual configuration information regarding the SRS resource may include time-frequency axis mapping information in a slot of the SRS resource, and the time-frequency axis mapping information may include information about frequency hopping within a slot or between slots of the SRS resource. Also, the individual configuration information regarding the SRS resource may include a time axis transmission configuration of the SRS resource, and may be configured to be one of periodic, semi-persistent, and aperiodic. The individual configuration information may be limited to have a same time axis transmission configuration as the SRS resource set including the SRS resource.

The UE may transmit the SRS resource in an uplink BWP activated regarding the semi-persistent SRS resource activated through the higher layer signaling.</p><p id="p-0235" num="0240">For example, the base station may trigger aperiodic SRS transmission in the UE through DCI. The base station may indicate one of aperiodic SRS resource triggers (aperiodicSRS-ResourceTrigger) through an SRS request field of the DCI. The UE may interpret that an SRS resource set including an aperiodic SRS resource trigger indicated by the DCI has been triggered from an aperiodic SRS resource trigger list from among configuration information of the SRS resource set. The UE may transmit an SRS resource referred to by the triggered SRS resource set. A time-frequency axis resource mapping in a slot of the transmitted SRS resource may follow resource mapping information configured in the SRS resource.</p><p id="p-0236" num="0241">Also, slot mapping of the transmitted SRS resource may be determined through a slot offset between the SRS resource and a PDCCH including the DCI, and the slot offset may refer to a value (or values) included in a slot offset group configured in the SRS resource set. In detail, the slot offset between the SRS resource and the PDCCH including the DCI may be applied with a value indicated by a time domain resource assignment field of the DCI among an offset value (or offset values) included in the slot offset group configured in the SRS resource set. Also, a spatial domain transmission filter applied to the transmitted SRS resource may refer to spatial relation information configured in the SRS resource or to associated CSI-RS information configured in the SRS resource set including the SRS resource.

A time interval for SRS transmission of the UE may be defined by the number of symbols between a last symbol of the PDCCH including the DCI triggering the aperiodic SRS transmission and a first symbol to which an SRS resource transmitted the earliest from among transmitted SRS resource(s) is mapped. The minimum time interval may be determined by referring to a PUSCH preparation procedure time required for the UE to prepare for PUSCH transmission.</p><p id="p-0238" num="0243">Also, the minimum time interval may have different values according to whether an SRS resource set including the transmitted SRS resource is used. For example, the minimum time interval may refer to the PUSCH preparation procedure time of the UE and may be determined to be N2 symbols defined in consideration of UE processing capability according to capability of the UE. Also, when the SRS resource set is configured to be used for codebook or antennaSwitching, considering where the SRS resource set including the transmitted SRS resource is used, the minimum time interval may be determined to be N2 symbols, and when the SRS resource set is configured to be used for nonCodebook or beamManagement, the minimum time interval may be determined to be N2+14 symbols. When the time interval for aperiodic SRS transmission is equal to or greater than the minimum time interval, the UE may transmit aperiodic SRS, and when the time interval for aperiodic SRS transmission is smaller than the minimum time interval, the UE may ignore the DCI triggering the aperiodic SRS.</p><p id="p-0239" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00034" num="00034"><table frame="none"

The codebook-based PUSCH transmission may be dynamically scheduled through the DCI format 0_0 or 0_1, or may quasi-statically operate by the configured grant. When the codebook-based PUSCH transmission is dynamically scheduled by the DCI format 0_1 or quasi-statically configured by the configured grant, the UE determines a precoder for the PUSCH transmission, based on an SRS resource indicator (SRI), a transmission precoding matrix indicator (TPMI), and a transmission rank (the number of PUSCH transmission layers).</p><p id="p-0251" num="0252">Here, the SRI may be provided through a field SRS resource indicator in the DCI or via srs-ResourceIndicator that is higher layer signaling. The UE is configured with at least one SRS resource, and may be configured up to two SRS resources, during the codebook-based PUSCH transmission. When the UE is provided with the SRI through the DCI, an SRS resource indicated by the SRI denotes an SRS resource corresponding to the SRI, from among SRS resources transmitted before a PDCCH including the SRI. Also, the TPMI and transmission rank may be provided through field precoding information and number of layers in the DCI or may be configured via precodingAndNumberOfLayers that is higher layer signaling. The TPMI is used to indicate a precoder applied to the PUSCH transmission. When the UE is configured with one SRS resource, the TPMI is used to indicate the precoder to be applied to the one configured SRS resource. When the UE is configured with a plurality of SRS resources, the TPMI is used to indicate the precoder to be applied to the SRS resource indicated through the SRI.</p><p id="p-0252" num="0253">The precoder to be used for the PUSCH transmission is selected from an uplink codebook having the number of antenna ports equal to a value of nrofSRS-Ports in SRS-Config that is higher layer signaling. In the codebook-based PUSCH transmission, the UE determines a codebook subset, based on the TPMI and the codebookSubset in the pusch-Config that is higher layer signaling. The codebookSubset in the pusch-Config that is higher layer signaling may be configured to be one of fullyAndPartialAndNonCoherent, partialAndNonCoherent, and nonCoherent, based on UE capability reported by the UE to the base station. When the UE reported partialAndNonCoherent as the UE capability, the UE does not expect a value of codebookSub set that is higher layer signaling to be configured to fullyAndPartialAndNonCoherent. Also, when the UE reported nonCoherent as the UE capability, the UE does not expect the value of codebookSubset that is higher layer signaling to be configured to fullyAndPartialAndNonCoherent or partialAndNonCoherent. When nrofSRS-Ports in SRS-ResourceSet that is higher layer signaling indicates two SRS antenna ports, the UE does not expect the value of codebookSubset that is higher layer signaling to be configured to partialAndNonCoherent.</p><p id="p-0253" num="0254">The UE may be configured with one SRS resource set in which a value of usage in SRS-ResourceSet that is higher layer signaling is configured to codebook, and one SRS resource in the SRS resource set may be indicated through SRI. When several SRS resources are configured in the SRS resource set in which the value of usage in SRS-ResourceSet that is higher layer signaling is configured to codebook, the UE expects a value of nrofSRS-Ports in SRS-Resource that is higher layer signaling to be the same for all SRS resources.</p><p id="p-0254" num="0255">The UE transmits, to the base station, one or a plurality of SRS resources included in the SRS resource set in which the value of usage is configured to codebook according to higher layer signaling, and the base station selects one of the SRS resources transmitted by the UE and instructs the UE to perform the PUSCH transmission, by using transmission beam information of the selected SRS resource. Here, in the codebook-based PUSCH transmission, SRI is used as information for selecting an index of one SRS resource, and is included in the DCI. In addition, the base station includes, to the DCI, information indicating the TPMI and rank to be used by the UE for the PUSCH transmission. The UE performs the PUSCH transmission by applying the precoder indicated by the rank and TPMI indicated based on a transmission beam of the SRS resource, by using the SRS resource indicated by the SRI.</p><p id="p-0255" num="0256">Next, non-codebook-based PUSCH transmission will be described. The non-codebook-based PUSCH transmission may be dynamically scheduled through the DCI format 0_0 or 0_1, or may quasi-statically operate by the configured grant. When at least one SRS resource is configured in the SRS resource set in which a value of usage in SRS-ResourceSet that is higher layer signaling is configured to nonCodebook, the UE may receive scheduling of the non-codebook-based PUSCH transmission through the DCI format 0_1.</p><p id="p-0256" num="0257">Regarding the SRS resource set in which the value of usage in SRS-ResourceSet that is higher layer signaling is configured to nonCodebook, the UE may receive configuration of one connected non-zero power (NZP) CSI-RS resource. The UE may perform calculation regarding a precoder for SRS transmission through measurement on the NZP CSI-RS resource connected to the SRS resource set. When a difference between a last reception symbol of an aperiodic NZP CSI-RS resource connected to the SRS resource set and a first symbol of aperiodic SRS transmission is less than 42 symbols, the UE does not expect information regarding the precoder for SRS transmission to be updated.</p><p id="p-0257" num="0258">When a value of resourceType in SRS-ResourceSet that is higher layer signaling is configured to be aperiodic, the connected NZP CSI-RS is indicated by an SRS request that is a field in the DCI format 0_1 or 1_1. Here, when the connected NZP CSI-RS resource is an aperiodic NZP CSI-RS resource, it is indicated that the connected NZP CSI-RS is present regarding a case where a value of SRS request that is the field in the DCI format 0_1 or 1_1 is not 00. In this case, corresponding DCI does not indicate cross carrier or cross BWP scheduling. Also, when the value of SRS request indicates the presence of NZP CSI-RS, the NZP CSI-RS is located at a slot on which PDCCH including an SRS request field is transmitted. Here, TCI states configured in a scheduled subcarrier are not configured to be QCL-TypeD.</p><p id="p-0258" num="0259">When a periodic or semi-persistent SRS resource set is configured, the connected NZP CSI-RS may be indicated through associatedCSI-RS in the SRS-ResourceSet that is higher layer signaling. Regarding the non-codebook-based transmission, the UE does not expect spatialRelationInfo that is higher layer signaling for the SRS resource and associatedCSI-RS in SRS-ResourceSet that is higher layer signaling to be configured together.</p><p id="p-0259" num="0260">When a plurality of SRS resources are configured, the UE may determine the precoder and a transmission rank to be applied to the PUSCH transmission, based on SRI indicated by the base station. Here, the SRI may be indicated through a field SRS resource indicator in the DCI or configured through srs-ResourceIndicator that is higher layer signaling. Like the codebook-based PUSCH transmission, when the UE receives the SRI through the DCI, the SRS resource indicated by the SRI denotes an SRS resource corresponding to the SRI from among SRS resources transmitted prior to the PDCCH including the SRI. The UE may use one or a plurality of SRS resources for SRS transmission, and the maximum number of SRS resources capable of being simultaneously transmitted from a same symbol in one SRS resource set is determined by UE capability reported by the UE to the base station. Here, the SRS resources simultaneously transmitted by the UE occupy a same RB. The UE configures one SRS port for each SRS resource. Only one SRS resource set, in which the value of usage in SRS-ResourceSet that is higher layer signaling is configured to be nonCodebook, may be configured, and up to 4 SRS resources for the non-codebook-based PUSCH transmission may be configured.</p><p id="p-0260" num="0261">The base station transmits, to the UE, one NZP-CSI-RS connected to an SRS resource set, and the UE calculates a precoder to be used to transmit one or a plurality of SRS resources in the SRS resource set, based on a result measured when receiving the NZP-CSI-RS. The UE applies the calculated precoder when transmitting, to the base station, one or plurality of SRS resources in the SRS resource set, in which the usage is configured to be nonCodebook, and the base station selects one or plurality of SRS resources from among the received one or plurality of SRS resources. Here, in the non-codebook-based PUSCH transmission, the SRI denotes an index capable of representing one SRS resource or a combination of a plurality of SRS resources, and the SRI is included in the DCI. At this time, the number of SRS resources indicated by the SRI transmitted by the base station may be the number of transmission layers of the PUSCH, and the UE transmits the PUSCH by applying, to each layer, the precoder applied for the SRS resource transmission.</p><p id="p-0261" num="0262">[PUSCH: Preparation Procedure Time]</p><p id="p-0262" num="0263">Next, a PUSCH preparation procedure time will be described. When a base station schedules a UE to transmit a PUSCH by using a DCI format 0_0, 0_1, or 0_2, the UE may require the PUSCH preparation procedure time for transmitting the PUSCH by applying a transmission method (a transmission precoding method of an SRS resource, the number of transmission layers, and a spatial domain transmission filter) indicated through DCI.

A starting symbol at a second reception location of the PDSCH may be a location to which a symbol offset is applied by higher layer signaling StartingSymbolOffsetK from a last symbol of the first transmission location, and the transmission location may be determined by a symbol length indicated therefrom.

When repetitionNumber is 2, the UE may receive PDSCH repetitive transmissions of first and second slots by applying first and second TCI states, respectively.

When tciMapping is configured to sequenticalMapping, the first TCI state is applied to first and second PDSCH transmission locations and the second TCI state is applied to third and fourth PDSCH transmission locations, and such a TCI state application method is identically applied to remaining PDSCH transmission locations.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0409" num="0467">Referring to the descriptions about the PDCCH transmission and reception configuration and transmission beam configuration, the current Rel-15/16 NR does not support PDCCH repetitive transmission, and thus it may be difficult to achieve required reliability in a scenario that requires high reliability, such as URLLC. Meanwhile, in Rel-17 FeMIMO, a method of improving reception reliability of PDCCH through repetitive transmission of PDCCH is being standardized. Representative PDCCH repetitive transmission methods include a non-single frequency network (non-SFN) method of separating time or frequency resources and repeatedly transmitting CORESETs respectively connected to a plurality of search spaces explicitly connected through a higher layer signaling, through different TRPs, and an SFN method of repeatedly transmitting one CORESET by configuring a plurality of TCI states. Regarding the non-SFN method, different CORESETs may be respectively connected to the plurality of search spaces explicitly connected through higher layer signaling, or a same CORESET may be connected to all search spaces.</p><p id="p-0410" num="0468">As described above with reference to the operation related to power headroom, a type (actual PHR or virtual PHR) of calculating power headroom information is determined by a UE according to a PDCCH monitoring occasion where a first DCI format scheduling a PUSCH for PHR is detected. However, when repetitive transmission is performed to improve reception reliability of a PDCCH, there may be a plurality of PDCCH monitoring occasions. It may be vague whether the first DCI format is based on simply a PDCCH received by the UE a first time, based on an operation of receiving all PDCCH repetitive transmissions, or based on an operation of successfully decoding a PDCCH. Also, for activated supporting cells, DCI for uplink signal transmission of each supporting cell may also be repeatedly transmitted. Here, a method of determining a power headroom calculation type of the UE may be required depending on whether all PDCCH repetitive transmissions are received or some of PDCCH repetitive transmissions are received before a timeline for determining the power headroom calculation type.

Here, the same value may be generally interpreted in one meaning, but according to a special configuration, may be interpreted in a plurality of meanings when the same value includes or corresponds to a plurality of values (for example, 2) Details thereof will be described below.</p><p id="p-0426" num="0497">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>, for example, when the base station repeatedly transmits the PDCCH two times (for example, m=2), the base station may respectively map the PDCCHs to a TRP A and a TRP B, and repeatedly transmit the PDCCHs based on same or different beams in a spatial domain. Here, the base station may perform PDCCH repetitive transmission based on CORESETs respectively connected to two search spaces explicitly connected to each other through higher layer signaling, perform PDCCH repetitive transmission based on a single TRP when IDs of CORESETs connected to a search space are the same or TCI states of the CORESET are the same, or perform PDCCH repetitive transmission based on multi-TRP when the IDs of CORESETs connected to the search space are all different or the TCI states of the CORESETs are all different. When the base station repeatedly transmits the PDCCH four times, the base station may map the PDCCHs to the TRP A and TRP B two each, and at this time, the two PDCCHs of each TRP may be distinguishably transmitted in a time domain. The PDCCH repetitive transmissions distinguished in the time domain may be repeated in slot-based, subslot-based, or mini-slot-based time units.</p><p id="p-0427" num="0498">However, the above method is only an example and is not limited thereto.

For example, when the PDCCH is repeatedly transmitted in terms of the time domain, the base station may pre-configure the UE with information about which one of the slot-based, subslot-based, or mini-slot-based time units is used for repetition. When the PDCCH is repeatedly transmitted in terms of the frequency domain, the base station may pre-configure the UE with information about which one of CORESET, BWP, or component carrier (CC) is used for repetition. When the PDCCH is repeatedly transmitted in terms of the spatial domain, the base station may pre-configure the UE with information related to a beam for PDCCH repetitive transmission through a configuration for each QCL type. Alternatively, the base station may transmit, to the UE, the information listed above through the RRC message. Accordingly, the base station may repeatedly transmit the PDCCH according to the information pre-configured through the RRC message, and the UE may repeatedly receive the PDCCH according to the information pre-configured through the RRC message.</p><p id="p-0430" num="0505">[Method 1-2] Repetitive Transmission of Plurality of Pieces of Control Information that May have Different Formats and/or Payloads</p><p id="p-0431" num="0506">Method 1-2 is a method of repeatedly transmitting a plurality of pieces of control information that may have different formats and/or payloads. The control information schedules repeatedly transmitted PDSCHs, and the number of PDSCH repetitive transmissions indicated by each piece of control information may vary. For example, PDCCH #1 may indicate information of scheduling {PDSCH #1, PDSCH #2, PDSCH #Y}, whereas PDCCH #2 may indicate information of scheduling {PDSCH #2, PDSCH #Y}, and PDCCH #X may indicate information of scheduling {PDSCH Y}. Such a method of repeatedly transmitting the control information may have a small total delay time required for control information and PDSCH repetitive transmission compared to Method 1-1. However, payloads of the pieces of control information that are repeatedly transmitted may be different from each other, and thus reliability may be low compared to Method 1-1 because soft combining of the pieces of control information that are repeatedly transmitted is impossible.</p><p id="p-0432" num="0507">In Method 1-2, a UE may not need to be pre-aware of a resource location of the control information to be repeatedly transmitted and the number of repetitive transmissions, and may independently decode and process the pieces of control information that are repeatedly transmitted. When the UE decodes a plurality of pieces of repeatedly transmitted control information scheduling a same PDSCH, the UE may process only first repeatedly transmitted control information and ignore remaining repeatedly transmitted control information.

The control information repetitive transmission may be explicitly indicated by the base station to a UE through higher layer signaling. Alternatively, the control information repetitive transmission may be indicated in combination with another configuration information. For example, a higher layer configuration indicating PDSCH repetitive transmission may be combined with an indication of the control information repetitive transmission. When a PDSCH is indicated to be repeatedly transmitted in an FDM manner, it may be interpreted that the control information is repeatedly transmitted only by using Method 1-1. This is because there is no delay time reduction effect according to Method 1-2 when the PDSCH is repeatedly transmitted in the FDM manner. For a similar reason, when the PDSCH is indicated to be repeatedly transmitted in an intra-slot TDM manner, it may be interpreted that the control information is repeatedly transmitted by using Method 1-1.

When the PDSCH is indicated to be repeatedly transmitted in the FDM manner, it may be interpreted that the control information is repeatedly transmitted in the FDM or SDM manner because when the control information is repeatedly transmitted in the inter-slot TDM manner, there is no delay time reduction effect according to the PDSCH repetitive transmission in the FDM manner.</p><p id="p-0438" num="0513">For a similar reason, when the PDSCH is indicated to be repeatedly transmitted in the intra-slot TDM manner, it may be interpreted that the control information is repeatedly transmitted in the intra-slot TDM, FDM, or SDM manner.

Specific methods will now be described.</p><p id="p-0444" num="0519">[UE Capability Reporting Method 1] A UE may report, to a base station, information about whether soft combining is possible during PDCCH repetitive transmission. For example, the UE may report UE capability in a form of possibility or impossibility only regarding whether the soft combining is possible.</p><p id="p-0445" num="0520">For example, when the UE reported, to the base station, information that the soft combining is possible during the PDCCH repetitive transmission as the UE capability, the base station may determine the possibility of soft combining of the UE to be most flexible (for example, the soft combining is possible for the UE in a log-likelihood ratio (LLR) level, and notify, to the UE, a PDCCH repetitive transmission-related configuration as flexible as possible during a PDCCH transmission-related configuration.

Here, as an example related to the PDCCH repetitive configuration, the base station may notify a corresponding configuration to the UE under an assumption soft combining between a plurality of CORESETs having a same configuration is possible, or soft combining between PDCCH candidates in a same AL is possible.</p><p id="p-0447" num="0522">[UE capability reporting Method 2] To express soft combining possible for a UE as UE capability in further detail compared to UE Capability Reporting Method 1, the UE may report, to a base station, the UE capability by dividing, into levels, degrees of possibility of the soft combining during PDCCH repetitive transmission. In other words, a signal level to which the UE may apply the soft combining for the PDCCH repetitive transmission may be identified from among signal levels generated during reception operations of the UE, and the UE may report, to the base station, such information as UE capability. For example, the UE may notify that the soft combining is possible in at least one of an OFDM symbol level, a modulation symbol level, or an LLR level, as the signal level to which the soft combining may be applied. According to each signal level reported by the UE, the base station may notify a suitable configuration such that the UE may perform the soft combining according to the reported UE capability.</p><p id="p-0448" num="0523">[UE capability reporting Method 3] A UE may transmit, to a base station, restrictions required to enable soft combining in the UE during PDCCH repetitive transmission, as UE capability.

As another example, the UE may report, to the base station, that an intra-slot TDM manner or an inter-slot TDM or FDM manner is supported from Method 1-1 (a plurality of PDCCH repetitive transmissions having a same payload). In particular, regarding TDM, the UE may report, to the base station, a maximum value of a time interval between two repeated PDCCHs. For example, when the UE reported 4 OFDM symbols as the maximum value of the time interval between two repeated PDCCHs, the base station may need to adjust the time interval between the two repeated PDCCHs to be equal to or less than 4 OFDM symbols, when the base station performs TDM-based PDCCH repetitive transmission based on such information.

For example, regarding Trigger Events 1 through 6 described above, whether to report power headroom is determined based on when PUSCH transmission is scheduled. For example, regarding Trigger Event 1, a UE performs PHR when a variation of a pathloss value used to calculate uplink transmit power of the scheduled PUSCH compared to a pathloss reference value used for PHR performed previously is greater than a higher layer parameter phr-Tx-PowerFactorChange that corresponds to a threshold value. As such, PHR is triggered according to a variation of a pathloss value according to Trigger Event 1 or according to a variation of a power backoff value required according to Trigger Event 6, based on a time point when a PUSCH is scheduled.</p><p id="p-0489" num="0573">When a PDCCH scheduling the PUSCH is repeatedly transmitted, it is required to determine a time point when a trigger event is applied.
