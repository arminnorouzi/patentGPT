The ability to visualize or differentially identify microscopic structures is frequently enhanced through the use of histological stains. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&#x26;E) stain is the most commonly used stain in light microscopy for histological samples. Hematoxylin is used to stain nuclei blue, and eosin stains cytoplasm and the extracellular connective tissue matrix pink. In addition to H&#x26;E stains, other stains or dyes have been applied to provide more specific staining and provide a more detailed view of tissue morphology. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) stains have great specificity, as they use a peroxidase substrate or alkaline phosphotase (AP) substrate for IHC stainings, providing a uniform staining pattern that appears to the viewer as a homogeneous color with intracellular resolution of cellular structures, e.g. membrane, cytoplasm, and nucleus.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) tissue samples, metaphase spreads or histological smears are typically analyzed by staining on a glass slide, where a particular biomarker, such as a protein or nucleic acid of interest, can be stained with H&#x26;E and/or with a colored dye, hereafter &#x201c;chromogen&#x201d; or &#x201c;chromogenic moiety&#x201d;. IC staining is a common tool in evaluation of tissue samples for the presence of specific biomarkers. IHC stains are precise in the recognition of specific targets in throughout the sample and allow quantification of these targets.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">IHC staining employs chromogenic and/or fluorescent reporters that mark targets in histological samples. This is carried out by linking the biomarker directly or indirectly with an enzyme, typically either Horse Radish Peroxidase (HRP) or Alkaline Phosphatase (AP), that subsequently catalyzes the formation of an insoluble colored precipitate, at the location of the biomarker from a soluble suitable enzyme substrate, which exhibits a color.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In blotting/capture assays, the biomarker is extracted into solution from its original location and then re-immobilized on a membrane, gel, or chip array, but the biomarker is also stained with a visible color, a chromogen, typically by action of the same HRP or AP enzymes.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Compared to other detection techniques, such as radioactivity, chemo-luminescence or fluorescence, chromogens generally suffer from much lower sensitivity, but have the advantage of a permanent, plainly visible color which can be visually observed, such as with bright field microscopy. Other limitations of enzyme-based chromogenic detection of targets in solid biological samples or targets that are immobilized onto or into a solid support include that there is a very limited number of chromogenic HRP and AP substrates that can be used for target staining, which limits use of these target visualization systems for detection of multiple targets in samples. Also, some chromogens, like the HRP substrate 3,3&#x2032;-diaminobenzidine (DAB), are not characterized by well-defined spectral features, but rather insoluble light adsorbing brown precipitates. Moreover, where visualization of multiple targets is concerned, it often requires one to use a combination of multiple enzyme-based visualization systems, such as HRP and AP. These limitations make sample staining procedures complex, less robust and expensive and also complicates automated detection of targets and image analyses of stained samples.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Rhodamines, rhodols and fluoresceins are intensely colored and fluorescent. They come in virtually any color, dependent on halogenation and/or substitution pattern. They have been known for more than a century, and several are used as special stains which stain tissue samples without any enzyme activity. For example, Rhodamine 110 is used as a mitochondrial stain, TetraBrornoFluorescein, also referred to as Eosin, is used extensively in Haematoxilin/Eosine (H and E) double stains, where Haematoxilin stains nuclei blue and Eosin stains essentially any protein pink or red. So while derivatives of these compounds would seem attractive as potential chromogens due to their distinct and bright color, unspecific tissue staining, even in the absence of any enzyme activity, is an impediment to their use as chromogens. Another impediment is to provide derivatives with suitable solubility in aqueous environments.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Rhodamine and fluorescein compounds are also stable and require forcing conditions to undergo further reaction. A solution has been to introduce extra reactive groups, such as an IsoThioCyanate as in FluoresceinisoThioCyanate (&#x201c;FITC&#x201d;) and Tetramethyl Rhodamine IsoThioCyanate (&#x201c;TRITC&#x201d;) or CarboxyFluorescein and SulphoRhodamine. However, the addition of these reactive groups is not done easily and results in a mixture of two almost inseparable isomers. FITC has become widely associated with reactive fluorescein, the proven way to prepare fluorescein derivatives of antibodies and nucleic acid probes. However such derivatives are expensive, some prohibitively expensive.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the last decade, there has been progress made within the field of rhodamine and fluorescein 2&#x2032;-ester derivatives. See, for example Beija, Mariana et al., &#x201c;Synthesis and applications of Rhodamine derivatives as fluorescent probes.&#x201d; Chem. Soc. Rev., 2009, 38, 2410-2433; Afonso, A. M. Carlos, et al., &#x201c;An Expedient Synthesis of Cationic Rhodamine Fluorescent Probes Suitable for Conjugation to Amino Acids and Peptides.&#x201d; Synthesis, 2003, 17, 2647-2654; Xi Chen et al., &#x201c;An efficient and versatile approach for the preparation of a rhodamine B ester bioprobe library.&#x201d; Dyes and Pigments 2012, 94, 296-303.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Both rhodamines and fluoresceins possess a 2&#x2032; carboxylic acid that can be derivatized as esters or amides under certain conditions. However, 2&#x2032; primary amides of rhodamines or fluoresceins collapse into colorless spirolactam or spirolactone tautomers, making such derivatives unsuitable as chromogens. Esters and amides of secondary amines do not undergo this tautomerization as they lack the labile N&#x2014;H proton.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">A method of preparing amides of the secondary amine piperazine of Rhodamines and Fluorescein have been reported. See Nguyen T. et al., &#x201c;Practical synthetic route to rhodamine dyes&#x201d;, Org. Lett. 2003, 18, 3245-48; Huang, Chusem, et al.; &#x201c;Versatile Probes for the Selective Detection of Vicinal-Dithiol-Containing proteins: Design, Syntheses, and Applications in Living Cells&#x201d;. (hem. Eur. J. 2013, 19, 7739-7747.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) is a derivative of fluorescein used in many applications employing fluorescence, such as flow cytometry. FITC comprises a fluorescein molecule functionalized at its 4&#x2032; position with a isothiocyanate reactive group (&#x2014;N&#x2550;C&#x2550;S) on the monocyclic phenyl of the structure. This derivative is reactive towards nucleophiles including amine and sulfhydryl groups on proteins.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Use of fluorecein as the detectable part of HRP substrates in histochemical detection of targets has recently been described. WO2007/015168 to Lohse relates to monomeric or polymeric linker molecules useful in biological and chemical applications, their synthesis, and the synthesis and use of derivatives of the linkers conjugated to a variety of detectable labels and other substances. The linkers may be used, for example, in conjunction with fluorescent labels, nucleic acid or nucleic acid analog probes, and solid phase systems, and to enhance the solubility of the conjugated molecules. WO2009/036760, WO2010/094283, WO2010/094284, WO2011/047680 and WO2012/143010 relate to HRP substrates that are conjugated via linker of WO2007/015168 to fluorescein at its 4&#x2032; position. The latter conjugates are colorless but fluorescent and can be used either for direct fluorescent or indirect histochemical detection of targets: the conjugates are deposited in target sites labeled with HRP activity via the enzymatic reaction, and then the deposited conjugates may be detected optically as fluorescent stain or immunochemically as haptens. Deposition of the conjugates by HRP demands presence of certain amounts of DAB, ferulic acid or alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (ACHCA) in the deposition medium.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present disclosure provides chromogenic conjugate molecules capable of serving as substrates of an enzyme with peroxidase activity, and describes their utility for detecting molecular targets in samples.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present teachings are best understood from the following detailed description when read with the accompanying drawing figures.

Descriptions or details of known systems, compounds, materials, methods of use and methods of manufacture may be omitted so as to avoid obscuring the description of the example embodiments. Nonetheless, systems, moieties and methods that are within the purview of one of ordinary skill in the art may be used in accordance with the representative embodiments.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0035">The present disclosure provides chromogenic peroxidase substrate conjugates (interchangeably termed herein as &#x201c;chromogenic conjugates&#x201d;, &#x201c;conjugate molecules&#x201d; or &#x201c;reporter molecules&#x201d;). The present conjugate molecules combine one or more of the virtues of DAB, without one or more of the disadvantages.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0036">Embodiments of the present chromogenic conjugates include molecules comprising a peroxidase substrate moiety linked to a chromogenic moiety, that are (a) non-toxic, (b) precipitated from solutions via HRP-mediated reaction as bright and spectrally narrow and intense stains; (c) are stable in aqueous solutions for more than 24 hours once mixed; and/or (d) are insoluble in organic solvents when precipitated.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0037">In some embodiments, the chromogenic conjugates of the present disclosure adsorb and/or emit light in the range from about 450 nm to about 600 nm. In some embodiments, the chromogenic conjugate absorbs light at 536 nm and the color of stain may be defined as magenta. In some embodiments, the chromogenic conjugate is yellow and absorbs light at 450 nm. In some embodiments, the chromogenic conjugate is purple and absorbs light close to 600 nm. The embodiments of the present chromogenic conjugates can serve as substrates of a peroxidase enzyme, e.g. HRP, and they are spectrally narrow, non-dichromatic, and do not change their spectral characteristics upon precipitation; the stains produced via enzymatic precipitation of the chromogenic conjugates are poorly soluble, if at all, in water or organic solutions and do not bleach when exposed to light sources used for imaging of stained samples. These features make the present chromogenic conjugates particularly suitable for automated image analyses and multiplexing. Further, the molecules of the chromogenic conjugates have well-defined chemical structures and can easily be produced by the processes described herein.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Chromogenic

have been made. This allows staining of a tissue sample with one or more distinct color. For example a method of analyzing a sample may comprise labeling a first target with Compound 14, so that the first target is detected, or identified at places of the sample, with magenta stain, and labeling a second target with Compound 5, so that the second target is detected or identified as purple stain.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0045">Surprisingly a systematic trend was observed in the peak absorbances of the chromogenic conjugates having piperazine amides and ethers. The piperazine amides absorb approximately 15 nm higher than corresponding rhodamine and fluorescein and ester-comprising conjugates absorb approximately 10 nm above the corresponding rhodamine and fluorescein. This enables fine tuning of the hue of the chromogenic conjugates.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">Chromogenic Moiety</heading><p id="p-0054" num="0046">The chromogenic conjugates may include a chromogenic moiety capable of providing visible color.

One example of a known dichroic chromogen is pumpkin seed oil. Pumpkin seed oil absorbs predominantly blue light, has an absorbance minimum for green light and a minor second absorbance peak in the far red wave lengths. With a short light path through the oil, the oil appears greenish. As the light path is increased, the color changes from brown to red. This change can be valuable if one is to measure the concentration of pumpkin seed oil by spectrophotometry. In low concentrations, precise measurements can be based on the blue absorbance. Furthermore, as the absorbance increases with concentration, rendering blue absorbance inaccurate (since blue light is substantially absorbed), one can switch to red absorbance (which is substantially inaccurate at low concentrations since no red light is substantially absorbed). Therefore, the technical effect of dichroic chromogens is that dichroic chromogens have an expanded dynamic range of human and instrument perception.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0070">Dichroic effects can be obtained by mixing two or more chromogens of present disclosure.

For example the medium can include hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) e.g., at a concentration of 0.0002% to 0.04%, or from around 0.5 mM to around 1.5 mM. In some embodiments, when the chromogenic composition comprises a peroxide compound, stability of the composition may be reduced, such as to 1-2 week's storage without changing the features discussed above.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0107">In some embodiments, the present compositions are substantially free of peroxidase substrates other than the peroxidase substrate moieties of the chromogenic conjugates of the present disclosure and peroxide compound.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0108">As mentioned above, in some embodiments, the present compositions may comprise a detergent. In some preferred embodiments, the detergent is a nonionic, non-denaturing detergent. In some embodiments, the composition comprises from 0.001% to 10% detergent, alternatively 0.01% to 1%, alternatively 0.05% to 0.5%.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0109">In some embodiments, a two-component formulation is provided as a kit or used in a method. A first component comprises a chromogenic conjugate as described herein in a buffer with a lower pH (such as pH of 4 to 5, e.g., pH 4.8) to avoid hydrolysis over time. The second component is a buffered solution of hydrogen peroxide with a higher pH (such as a pH of 7-8, e.g., pH 7.4). The two components when mixed form a working solution having an intermediate pH (such as a pH of 6-7, e.g., pH 6.8). Such a two component formulation can be mixed by instrument or manually and can have a shelf life of +2 years at cold room temperature. The formulation has 3 week stability when mixed together at room temperature.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0110">In some embodiments, the chromogenic composition comprises an organic cosolvent, e.g. 2-10% v/v organic co-solvent, which has been found to yield a staining intensity which is significantly enhanced. Suitable organic co-solvents are 2-pyrrolidone and NMP.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="2">Methods of Use</heading><p id="p-0140" num="0111">As another aspect, methods are provided for using the chromogenic conjugates described herein and compositions comprising those conjugates in various analyses, techniques and steps where a sample, tissue, or portions thereof are stained or dyed. For example, the present chromogenic conjugates are useful for detection of molecular targets, such biological or chemical molecules, molecular structures, etc, in samples using a host of experimental schemes for detecting and visualizing such targets, for example. immunohistochemistry (IHC), in situ hybridization (ISH), ELISA, Southern, Northern, and Western blotting. Generally, the present chromogenic conjugates may be used in any analysis in which DAB has been used as stain for visualization of targets. Compared to conjugates described in WO2009/036760, WO2010/094283, WO2010/094284, WO2011/047680 and WO2012/143010, the present chromogenic conjugates do not demand the presence of a cross-linker such as DAB, ACHC or ferulic acid to mediate precipitation of the conjugates from chromogenic described above in the presence of peroxidase. The chromogenic conjugates can be used for detection of molecular targets in solid or semi-solid samples or targets that are immobilized onto or into solid supports, such as a microscopic slide, nitrocellulose membrane, microarray chip, gel, and other supports.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0112">For example, the present chromogenic conjugates can be used to stain or dye Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) tissue samples, metaphase spreads or histological smears. The present chromogenic conjugates can be used in immunohistochemical analytical methods, where a protein of interest is detected or identified by color. The present chromogenic conjugates can be used in chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH), where a nucleic acid of interest is detected or identified by color.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0113">The present methods are carried out by linking a target with a molecule or moiety peroxidase activity, typically Horse Radish Peroxidase (HRP) or fragments having the enzymatic activity, then subsequently catalyzing the formation of an insoluble colored precipitate at the location of the target from any of the soluble chromogenic conjugates described herein.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0114">The present conjugates are superior to chromogens such as DAB for use with cells, tissues and other types of samples which have brown coloring. For example, melanomas are already brown by nature, as are many lung cancer specimens due to smoking or urban air pollution. For these samples, DAB is especially ill suited for staining specimens from patients afflicted with these two major types of cancers. Accordingly, as another aspect, methods are provided for staining specimens having a natural brown color by applying the present conjugates, particularly a red, yellow or blue chromogenic conjugate. In some embodiments, one, two, or more of the present chromogenic conjugates are contacted with a sample comprising a brown tissue, for example, a sample comprising lung cancer cells, melanoma cells, melanocytes, mole tissue, tonsil tissue, or liver tissue. Preferably the conjugate is Compound 2. The present conjugates can also advantageously be used for detection of multiple targets in a sample.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0115">In the present methods, one or more binding agents may be applied to a sample before the present conjugates are applied to the sample. The term &#x201c;binding agent&#x201d; designates a molecule that is capable of direct or indirect binding to a target, wherein the term &#x201c;directly&#x201d; means that the binding agent has affinity to the target and is capable of recognizing the target and specifically binding to it, wherein the term &#x201c;indirectly&#x201d; means that the binding agent does not have specific affinity to the target but has affinity to a substance which is associated with the target and is capable of specifically binding to this substance. The binding agent which is capable of direct binding to a target is sometimes referred to as a &#x201c;primary binding agent&#x201d;. A binding agent which is capable of indirect binding to a target is sometimes referred to as a &#x201c;secondary binding agent&#x201d;. The primary binding agent is typically used to contact the sample. It may be comprised of any molecule which will specifically bind to the target supposedly present in the sample. The secondary binding agent may be any molecule that binds the primary binding agent. Detection systems employing the present conjugates for visualization of targets may comprise other binding agents, such as a tertiary or quaternary binding agents; the detection may include several primary binding agents directed to detect various targets in the sample, for example, two or more different molecules (such as two or more proteins, or a protein and a nucleic acid) or include several primary binding agent directed to detect the same target in the sample, e.g. multiple molecular probes detecting a gene of interest. The detection systems may also include several secondary binding agents, which may be molecules of same species, e.g. antibodies, or different species, e.g. antibody and nucleic acids.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0116">In cases where the target does not inherently comprise peroxidase activity, at least one of the binding agents used to detect a target in the sample in the present visualization systems comprises a peroxidase activity in order to label the location of target in the sample with the peroxidase activity.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0117">Use of the present conjugate molecules may be particularly advantageous in multiplexed methods where more than one target is to be stained or dyed. As described above, the present conjugate molecules have advantageous optical features that allow clear distinction between targets stained in different colors, both by observing the microscopic field of a stained sample, such as a histological sample, and analyzing a captured image of the stained sample. Another advantage is that the conjugates are substrates of the same enzyme, namely a peroxidase enzyme, such as HRP or SP. This significantly simplifies procedures for staining of multiple targets in samples, increases robustness of staining procedures, as one and the same protocol and the same reagents may be used for detection of the targets by employing different conjugates. It also makes the overall detection procedure less expensive and particularly suited for automated staining, imaging of stained samples and analyses of staining results.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0118">The present methods and kits can comprise any binding agents capable of detecting a target in a solid sample or a target immobilized onto or into a solid support. For example, the binding agent can be an immune-specific binding pair such as an antibody and antigen, or a non-immune specific binding pair such as a nucleic acid probe and a complementary sequence, or another type such as biotin and avidin. Binding agents of various types are common general knowledge in the field, and descriptions of binding agents can be found in Q. Ashton Acton ed., &#x201c;Antigens&#x2014;Advances in Research and Application: 2013 Edition&#x201d;, Scholarly Editions. or Ralph Raply, ed, &#x201c;The Nucleic Acid-Protocols Handbook&#x201d;, Humana Press.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0119">Typically, in the present target detection methods, a sample comprising a target is sequentially incubated in one or more incubation media. The term &#x201c;incubation medium&#x201d; means in the present context an aqueous medium comprising particular compounds where a sample is maintained during a certain period of time (termed herein &#x201c;incubation time&#x201d;) in order to allow a desirable reaction between the particular compounds of the solution and the sample taking place. The incubation media may be the media in which the target is naturally found by a binding agent (&#x201c;binding agent media&#x201d;), or it may be one of the present chromogenic compositions (such as those described in the above sections).</p><p id="p-0149" num="0120">Time for maintaining and/or incubating the sample in an incubation medium, i.e. incubating time, may vary from approximately 3 seconds to overnight, for example, around 10 seconds, 20 seconds, 30 seconds, 1 minute, 2 minutes, etc., for example, 3-10 minutes, 10-20 minutes, 20-40 minutes, 40-60 minutes, 1-2 hours or longer, for example, overnight. In one embodiment, the incubating time at all steps of the detection procedure may have the same duration, i.e. every incubating may last 1 min, 2 min, 3 minutes, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, etc. The time may be selected based on the embodiment used. In another embodiment, the incubating time may vary from one step to another, for example, incubating the sample in a media comprising a binding agent may last from 1 minute to overnight, incubating the sample in a media comprising the chromogenic conjugate and a peroxide compound may last from 1 min to 15 minutes or longer.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0121">Incubating may be performed in various temperature conditions, depending on the type of target, binding agent, conjugate, etc. The detection procedures are mainly temperature independent, however, if desired, the temperature may be used for regulating the duration of the incubating time, for example, lower temperatures may be used to prolong the incubating time, and, vice versa, higher temperatures may be used to shorten the time for incubating.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0122">Basically, the binding agent media is a buffered aqueous solution of one or more binding agents that has pH in the range from 4 to 9. In some embodiments the first incubation media may comprise an organic or inorganic salt. The inorganic salt may be selected from for example, sodium chloride, magnesium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium chloride, sodium phosphate, or ammonium sulfate.

In some embodiments, the media may comprise salt in the amount from approximately 10 mM to 500 mM. In other embodiments the medium may be free of salt.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0124">As mentioned, typically, the pH value of binding agent media may vary from about 4 to about 9, such as between pH 3.5 and pH 9.5, for example, between pH 5 and pH 7, between pH 5.5 and pH 6.5 or between pH 6.5 and 7.5, or between pH 7 and pH 8, or between pH 7.5 and pH 8.5, or pH 8 and pH 9. Any buffer with a suitable buffer capacity may be used, for example, phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and imidazole buffer. Other suitable buffers may be found in Good, N E., et al (1966) Hydrogen ion buffers for biological research. Biochem. 5(2), 467-477. The pH value of the media may be essential for binding of binding agent to the target; it may be optimized depending on the nature of the binding agent and the target.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0125">In some embodiments the binding agent media may comprise an organic modifier (by the term &#x201c;organic modifier&#x201d; is meant any non water solvent), for example, N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP), dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO), mono- and diethylene glycol, sulpholane, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), polyethylene glycol (PEG), propylene glycol, etc. The amount of the organic modifier may vary from around 1% to around 20% (v/v or w/v), or, in some embodiments, be higher than 20%.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0126">In some embodiments the binding agent media may comprise a detergent, for example, polyethyleneglycol-p-isooctyphenyl ether (NP-40) or a surfactant for example, selected from the surfactants based on polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate (Tween), or a surfactant based on block copolymers (pluronic etc.), etc. The amount of the detergent may vary from about 0.001% to about 5% v/v or w/v). In some embodiments the binding agent media may comprise a stabilizing agent for the binding agent, for example, bovine serum albumin or dextran. The amount of the stabilizing agent may vary from 0.01% to 20% (w/v).</p><p id="p-0156" num="0127">In some embodiments the binding agent media may comprise an ion chelator (for example, ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA) or ethylene diamine hydroxyl phenylacetic acid type chelator (EDHPA), etc.).

Typically, a washing medium will be a medium of the same or similar composition as one that has been used for incubating or otherwise treating the sample in the step preceding the washing step, wherein the washing media lacks the active ingredient, i.e. a particular agent of the incubation step, for example, a binding agent, a conjugate molecule, etc.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0131">The present methods may comprise one or more steps of incubating of the sample in a medium that would quench any undesirable peroxidase activity, e.g. endogeneous peroxidase activity in the sample or residual peroxidase activity associated with the target site. Typically, incubating of the sample in a peroxidase activity quenching medium will precede a step of incubating of the sample with a binding agent, or, in case of detection of several targets in a sample, it will take place after the first target is visualized with a first conjugate and before incubation of the sample with a second binding agent directed to a second target. A peroxidase activity quenching medium would typically comprise an amount of a peroxide compound, such as hydrogen peroxide. The amount of a peroxide compound in the medium may vary from 1% to 10% (v/v or w/v).</p><p id="p-0161" num="0132">The present methods and uses include assays of various formats in which the present chromogenic conjugates are employed. In general, the assays where the conjugates may be used are any of those where DAB can be used.

Among targets contained in chemical and environmental samples may be different pollutants, toxins, warfare substances, members of molecular libraries, industrial noxious waste compounds, etc.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0136">In some embodiments, the biological sample may be a suspension of cells or a tissue section. Target molecules or structures of cells in suspension may be detected using ELISA, IHC or CISH.

The target nucleic acid in the sample is typically denatured to expose binding sites. In the present assays, the binding agent has or is linked to a peroxidase enzyme, and one or more of the present chromogenic conjugates are thereafter contacted with the sample. The existence or amount of the target nucleic acid is detected by visual recognition of the chromogen manually or automatedly.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0139">In IHC, a sample is taken and exposed to a binding agent such as an antibody or fragment thereof which specifically binds a target molecule such as a cell surface protein.

The existence or amount of the target molecule is detected by visual recognition of the chromogen manually or automatedly.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0140">In the present assays, a light microscope, often referred to as optical microscope, uses visible light and a system of lenses to magnify images of small samples containing the chromogenic conjugate. Bright-field microscopy is a simple optical microscopy illumination technique. The sample is illuminated by white light, and contrast in the sample is caused by absorbance of some of the transmitted light in dense areas of the sample. The typical appearance of a bright-field microscopy image is a chromogenically colored sample on a bright background.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0141">Automated staining and visualization devices may be used in various embodiments of the present methods, for example for the detection of multiple biological markers. Detection of multiple markers frequently requires balancing of the signals derived from the different chromogenic moieties. Automated staining devices are known in the field and the methods may be adapted for these devices.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0142">In automated methods of analysis, computer-controlled automatic test equipment is used to evaluate the stained samples, using computations to derive quantitative measurements from an image. High-performance charge-coupled device (CCD) cameras can be used for visualizing the chromogenically stained samples having one or more colored precipitates. Image acquisition can be coupled with advanced widefield microscopes and various algorithms for image restoration. Color separation can be obtained using three-CCD devices (3CCD) and a dichroic beam splitter prism that splits the image into red, green and blue components. Each of the three CCDs is arranged to respond to a particular color.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0143">The methods of analysis described herein can include some or all of the following steps: (a) collecting a first tissue or cell sample from an individual diagnosed with or suspected of having a cancer, particularly lung cancer cells, melanoma cells, or liver cancer cells; (b) applying a binding agent for a target, wherein the binding agent has peroxidase activity; (c) staining the first tissue or cell samples with one or more of the present chromogenic conjugates; (d) measuring the optical density of the stained tissue or cell samples from step (c), wherein the stained tissue or cell samples are illuminated with light having a wavelength absorbed by the one or more chromogenic conjugates.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0144">In some embodiments, the present methods are for detecting a target in a sample, for example, an object with peroxidase activity, biological marker, etc, wherein said target or sample is immobilized onto a solid support, wherein the methods comprise steps of (a) incubating a sample supposedly comprising target with one or more binding agents comprising peroxidase activity, wherein said one or more binding agents is/are capable of direct or indirect binding to the target and forming a complex comprising the target and one or more binding agents having peroxidase activity; (b) incubating the sample in a solution comprising one or more of the present chromogenic conjugates; (c) detecting the deposited chromogenic conjugate, and thereby detecting the target.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0145">Yet another aspect of the present disclosure, a method for staining a sample by mixing chromogenic conjugates of the present disclosure with other chromogens. For example, Rhodamine 6G-L12-Cou can be mixed with a fluorescein chromogen to produce a yellow/orange color. This combination is favorable because no single chromogen produces a suitable orange color. Additionally, rhodamine derivatives such as rhodamine 101 derivatives are expensive and chemically troublesome. A chromogen producing a yellow color will be considered weak to the human eye since yellow chromogens based on fluorescein have sharp upper absorbance peaks and absorb little green light, even in high concentration/intense stains. In other words, the yellow color does not change; they remain yellow. On the other hand, yellow dyes with broader absorbance extending weakly into the green absorbance range exhibit dichroism, meaning they produce two colors. In low concentration, these dyes appear yellow since they absorb blue light well; in higher concentrations, the color shifts towards red as green light is absorbed. Therefore, by mixing a green absorbing Rhodamine 6G with a yellow dye, the mixture can yield a designer dichromic dye, where hue changes slightly with intensity to yield an extended dynamic range of color contrast.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0146">Compound 2 alone produced stains that changed from bright magenta at low intensities toward more full reds at higher intensities. In a mixture containing 0.6 mM of compound 2 in 15 mM imidazole, pH 6.8, 4% NMP, 0.1% NP40-Nonidet (octylphenoxypolyetheneoxyethanol), 0.01% Benzalkonium chloride, 0.03% hydrogen peroxide, the mixture is characterized by matching DAB in intensity in the low range by equal staining of low expression targets. Conversely, this mixture never overstains even the highest intensity targets. This can be seen when using various primary antibodies and various types of tissue samples.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0147">As shown above, various dichroic stains of the present disclosure can be made by mixing two or more chromogenic conjugates of the present disclosure. The dichroic effect depends on very high absolute absorbance at the dominant wavelength that saturates the eye and instruments used to observe the dichroic effects of stained samples. If the dominant chromogen is magenta, as in compound 2, then at some point of increasing intensity there must be essentially no perception of green light left for humans or even instruments. Unexpectedly, it was found that 4 &#x3bc;m thick sections of tissue samples could be stained with a single dichroic chromogen so intensely that a color change would be observed by the human eye. So it was theorized that a change from Magenta towards purple would be especially agreeable, since the hue change would be perceived as harmonic and gradual and the by using compound 2 and 32, that neither absorb blue, the colors would stay bright. Another assumption, a reflection on the brownish precipitates produced by chromogens that appear orange in solution, was a dichroic bright orange with an absorbance minimum around 505 nm composed of a greenish-yellow chromogen and again a magenta chromogen. Therefore, it should be appreciated that dichroic chromogens provide an expanded dynamic range; as one channel of information dries out, (i.e. all light of one color is already absorbed at medium intensities) then absorbance of light at other wavelengths begins at higher intensities; thus, producing a color change.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0148">Two useful dicroic stains were produced: a dichroic orange stain that turns red at high intensities and a dichroic red stain that turns bluish purple at high intensities. These compounds have expanded dynamic range, having a more distinct cut-off with respect to intensity and color change.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0149">The dichroic orange stain was made in the following manner: in 50 mM imidazole, pH 6.8, 10% NMP, 0.1% NP40-Nonidet (octylphenoxypolyetheneoxyethanol), 0.01% Benzalkonium chloride, 0.03% hydrogen peroxide 1 mM compound 9 and 0.2 mM compound 2 produced a dichroic orange of good intensity with clear colors. The color change was from pale, slightly salmon orange at low intensities over vibrant deep oranges at medium intensities towards extremely bright reds at the highest intensities. This is valuable since no chromogen alone produces a good orange color when staining tissue, and it is an excellent contrast color to hematoxylin. The dichroic effect is a further aid in determining intensity differences. The degree of color change is moderate since the local shallow minimum is only 72 nm wide but the key point is that this minimum is around 505 nm. The dichroic stain absorbs blue light well and green light very well, yet matches the human color receptors with a drop right in the middle of the tipping point. Hence the bright and vibrant colors look much more pleasing and clear to the eye than single orange chromogens. This dichroic chromogen was measured in water at pH 6.8 and has a local shallow minimum between 459 and 531 nm, 72 nm wide and a global minimum with essentially no absorbance above 575 nm.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0150">The dichroic red stain was made in the following manner: in 50 mM imidazole, pH 6.8, 10% NMP, 0.1% NP40-Nonidet, 0.01% Benzalkonium chloride, 0.03% hydrogen peroxide 1 mM compound 2 and 0.2 mM compound 35 produced an intense, and radically changing, color. The color change was from feeble magenta over bright red at low intensities. At medium intensities the color shifted towards distinctly reddish purple ending in deep bluish purple at the highest intensities. This shift was very clear on Her2 control cell lines. Because of the high intensity even some +0 cells were weakly stained and +1 cells appeared bright red. +2 cells were stained distinctly reddish purple and +3 cells dark bluish purple.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0151">Another striking example was produced by staining tonsils with either antiCD21 or antiCD20. CD21 is an archetypical low expression marker whereas CD20 marks one of the most abundant proteins.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0152">In liver tissue stained with cytokeratin, close range dramatic color changes could be observed between very low expression membranes that were feeble, yet distinctly magenta, and very high expression ductal structures with color changing to intense red to deep purple.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0153">Areas with technical tissue defects as folds that produce increased absorbance demonstrated the ultimate color change towards bluish black. When measured in water at pH 6.8, this composition has a local shallow minimum between 532 nm and 642 nm, 110 nm wide and a global minimum with essentially no absorbance below 460 nm.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0154">The dichroic effect demonstrated by these dichroic chromogens and stains provides an expanded dynamic range. Additionally, for those dichroic conjugates where a cut off in intensity is supported by a change of color, those conjugates provides a distinct method of staining targets. In some embodiments, a chromogenic HRP substrate conjugate is provided that has at least one local minimum at least 50 nm wide and a global minimum between 390 and 700 nm measured in water between pH 6 and 8.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0155">Although the present conjugate molecules are described with respect to their chromogenic properties, it is also contemplated that the conjugate molecules can be used as fluorescent molecules in assays and methods that detect fluorescence.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0156">As yet another aspect, conjugates are disclosed which provide fluorescence Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) within the conjugate. These FRET conjugates have two different chromogenic moieties that absorb and emit light at different wavelengths (maxima), and the radius of interaction is smaller than the wavelength of light emitted. An excited (first) chromogenic moiety emits energy that is absorbed by a receiving (second) chromogenic moiety, which then emits light at a different wavelength. For FRET conjugates, the distance and angle between the two chromogenic moieties affects the energy transfer, so it is desirable to fix the distance and angle, at least so any rotation or flipping around bonds is much slower than in photochemical reactions. In the present FRET conjugates, the emission of the first chromogenic moiety and the absorbance of the second chromogenic moiety should overlap, as increased overlap yields better energy transfer and better fluorescence.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0157">A suitable FRET conjugate was prepared by reacting the piperazine amides of Rhodamine 6G with carboxy-fluorescein (shown below as Formula XV):</p><p id="p-0187" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00033" num="00033"><img id="EMI-C00033" he="51.05mm" wi="129.37mm" file="US20230002816A1-20230105-C00033.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0188" num="0158">Another FRET conjugate was prepared by reacting Rhodamine B with carboxy-fluorescein.

It is contemplated there will not be energy transmission between such chromophores if a flexible linker is used between them, since a flexible linker would allow them to come into contact; a piperazine ring provides adequate distance and rigidity, and other 4- to 8-membered cyclic or heterocyclic groups are expected to also provide adequate distance and rigidity. The effect is that the fluorescence of the carboxy-fluorescein moiety is transferred to the rhodamine moiety. While these chromogenic moieties retains two excitation maxima, corresponding to their performance as stand-alone fluorophores, a single emission maxima corresponding to the rhodamine moiety is observed.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0161">The Rhodamine B-carboxyfluorescein conjugate can be excited at 500 nm and emits at 585 nm. The present FRET conjugates are extremely useful since they allow several fluorophores to be excited at the same wavelength, yet be detected at different wavelengths. It is contemplated that the present FRET conjugates can be used in multiplexed flow cytometry and in DNA sequencing. These are structurally similar rigid back-to-back fluorescein-rhodamine conjugates that are further attached to nucleotide triphosphates. Additional description of dye terminators based on FRET can be found in US2005/0255475.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0162">The drawback is that the quantum yield is limited. This is consistent with FRET theory: The distance and angles of the two compounds are identical but the overlap smaller between fluorescein and Rhodamine B than between fluorescein and Rhodamine 6G. But the conjugates are intensely fluorescent.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0163">It is contemplated that the Rhodamine B-carboxy-fluorescein conjugate could potentially be a long-sought fourth color for fluorescence microscopy, namely a blue emitting fluorophore. FITC (fluorescein) has been used to provide a green emission or signal, and Rhodamines or CyDyes have been used to provide a red emission or signal, but in practice it is difficult to obtain a yellow fluorophore without unacceptable spill-over of the yellow signal into the green or red signals. This is has limited the use of yellow fluorescent signals. Typically infra-red emitting fluorophores are used as a fourth color, but they have the disadvantage of not being visible to the human eye. A FRET conjugate based on Rhodamine B and carboxy-fluorescein would also be visible with a set excitation and emission filters for red fluorophores. By using a green excitation filter and a red emission filter, only the FRET fluorophore would be visible. Digital image processing can be used to subtract the FRET image from the red image to show the desired red signal.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0164">A linker to a peroxidase substrate may be attached to the FRET conjugates at an acid attachment point or a phenolic attachment point, as shown in Formula XV above. It is contemplated that it will be preferable to attach a linker to the acid position, provided such attachment can be made (see drawing) without eliminating FRET capability. Additionally, as chromogens, these conjugates have highly desirable properties; for example, the 6G compound is orange while the Rhodamine B analogue is true red. These findings emphasize the potential value of the Rhodamine piperazine amides, as their colors and FRET capabilities are unexpected and beneficial.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="2">Kit-of-Parts</heading><p id="p-0196" num="0165">A kit-of-parts comprising any of the present chromogenic conjugates or compositions comprising thereof is described herein for detecting a target in a sample.

It is possible that reactivity can be enhanced by stabilizing a cationic leaving group. The benzyl ester, 33R3, showed low, but some reactivity. The alkyl-carboxyl-methyl derivatives 33R4, 33R5, and 33R6 reacted more strongly with secondary amines. However, 33R4 and 33R5 were more prone to side reactions (i.e., hydrolysis), and 33R6 reacted slightly more slowly. The 4-nitrobenzylic ester, 33R7, reacted with secondary amines but was also more prone to hydrolysis, whereas the ethyl-carboxy-methyl ester, 33R8, reacted suitably. 33R8 is prepared from rhodamine B and 2-bromoethylacetate. 33R8 remains stable up to around 140&#xb0; C. overnight.

Reaction between rhodamine esters, such as the esters of Compounds 33R1-33R9, and various secondary amines yields secondary amides of rhodamine. The various secondary amines can be one of the following compounds 34A to 34L, alternatively compounds 34G to 34L, alternatively compounds 34J to 34L, alternatively compounds 34G to 34I:</p><p id="p-0219" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00039" num="00039"><img id="EMI-C00039" he="245.87mm" wi="69.93mm" file="US20230002816A1-20230105-C00039.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00040" num="00040"><img id="EMI-C00040" he="64.26mm" wi="69.93mm" file="US20230002816A1-20230105-C00040.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0220" num="0181">The secondary amines can be a piperazine, piperidine, pyrrolidine, imidazolidine, pyrazolidine, azetidine, or other 4- to 8-membered (alternatively 5- to 7-membered) cyclic or heterocyclic group, optionally with an amine, a carboxyl or an ester substituent.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0182">It is surprising and unexpected that piperazine (Compound 34B) reacts with these esters (which are only slightly active), and that N,N&#x2032;-dimethyl ethylenediamine (Compound 34A) react also. Further experiments demonstrated that compounds 34C-L were also surprisingly reactive with these esters. Compounds 34A-L are listed in order of experimental (or expected) reactivity with the esters, from most reactive to least reactive, where compound 34A is the most reactive and compound 34L is expected to be the least reactive. Compound 34A, N,N&#x2032;-dimethyl ethylenediamine, is an alternative to piperazine and absorbs at 531 nm, which is the same absorbance as the esters. Upon reaction with a rhodamine, the secondary amines 34B, 34C, 34D, 34E, and 34F will not undergo a further reaction useful for preparing a conjugate having a peroxidase substrate linked to it. It was observed that reactivity dropped sharply from the 5 ring of 34C to the 7 ring of 34E and that the Rhodamine 6G derivative of 34C had absorbance (533 nm) in between &#x3b2;-carbonyl esters (531 nm) and other secondary amides (535 nm). Therefore, it is contemplated that 34L would react in a similar manner. 34G, 34H and 34I also reflect an effort for a carboxylic acid derivative of a secondary amide of rhodamines, and 34G reacts acceptably. It is contemplated that the positive trend in reactivity would continue with azetidine compounds such as 34J, 34K and 34L. In particular, a compound such as 34K or 34L, which comprise aziridine-3-carboxylate, are contemplated as reacting to form useful synthesis precursors, which in turn can comprise a novel family of desirable rhodamine carboxylic acid derivatives. 34G, 34H and 34I also respond to a need for a carboxylic acid derivative of a secondary amide of rhodamines that reacts sufficiently.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0183">Thus, it has unexpectedly been found that the reactivity between similar secondary amines and &#x3b2;-carbonyl esters of rhodamines can differ by orders of magnitude. In some instances, steric hindrance appears to be affecting reactivity. Furthermore, this can affect the stability of these secondary amides that appear exceptionally unstable towards aqueous base, hence the use of acid labile tert-butyl protection groups on compounds 34G and 34H.

These secondary amides can be prepared on any scale and are purified by crystallization. Less reactive derivatives that do not include further functional groups can be used as chromogens; as they combine color and fluorescence with stable and static chemical structures, these are suitable as dyes, inks, paints, lasers, LEDs and in other compositions and uses.</p><p id="p-0226" num="0185">Yet another aspect is a method to stain a tissue sample for the absence of a target. It has been recognized that if a certain portion of a tissue is stained with a chromogen of the present disclosure or DAB, then the portion of the tissue cannot be stained with a different color, unless the first stain is very weak and the second stain is very intense. It should be appreciated that it is possible to make a double stain of co-localized targets in mixed colors.</p><p id="p-0227" num="0186">However, in such case of co-localized targets, the first chromogen reduces the number of antigens available for recognition by the second antibody and also reduces the number of the first primary antibodies (not recognized by HRP visualization in the first step) that might be visualized in a different color in the second step.</p><p id="p-0228" num="0187">This effect can be performed to stain for the absence of a target such as a marker. This was observed on in using two of the present chromogenic conjugates to stain colon carcinomas. Colon tissue is normally positive for Cytokeratin 18. Colon tissue was stained using a method comprising staining cytokeratin 18 with a chromogenic conjugate of a first color, then staining with a second chromogenic conjugate of a second color to stain all cytokeratins in the colon tissue. For example, the first and second chromogenic conjugate may precipitate at the same binding agent, and they may contact the colon tissue simultaneously or sequentially. Alternatively, this may be accomplished by having two different binding agents, one of which is specific for cytokeratin 18, ant the other is pan-specific for cytokeratin (both normal colon and carcinomas are positive for cytokeratins), wherein a first of the two chromogenic conjugates precipitates at a first binding agent and a second of the two chromogenic conjugates precipitates a second binding agent. After staining colon carcinoma tissue with first and second chromogenic conjugates of distinct colors, it was observed that in many carcinomas, small areas were identified by the second chromogenic conjugate, in that they were stained in the second color. If the carcionomas were stained in the first color only, these areas could easily be overlooked and the sample could incorrectly be deemed negative for Cytokeratin 18, even though the absence of a stain could have been caused by many factors, such as air bubbles during staining, necrotic tissue, bad fixation, or another cause. Thus, the technical effect of the second stain is that it positively confirms the absence of cytokeratin 18, indicating for example that the cells have been mutated and lost their ability to produce cytokeratin 18. It is known that colon carcinomas undergo such mutations. Therefore, this method of staining allows one to use first and second chromogenic conjugates to identify carcinomas that have such mutations.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0188">Yet another aspect of the present disclosure is Compound 22 (Formula XIa) and other compounds of Formula XI:</p><p id="p-0230" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00042" num="00042"><img id="EMI-C00042" he="43.69mm" wi="75.61mm" file="US20230002816A1-20230105-C00042.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0231" num="0000">wherein R<sup>18 </sup>is a halogen; R<sup>19 </sup>is a nitrogen atom protecting group (such as tert-butyloxycarbonyl (BOC) group; p is 0 to 4; and q is 0 to 4.

In other words, the combination of chromogens mixed together in this ratio produced a stain and precipitate that has almost constant absorbance from 430 to 500 nm and experiences a sharp drop off at higher wavelengths.</p><p id="p-0504" num="0427">Example Green: 1 mM compound 9 mixed with 0.3 mM compound 10+0.3 mM compound 35 (cyan) produced a beautiful bright green that at low intensities appeared somewhat faint and very bright. At higher intensities, saturation increased, resulting in a very intense yet vibrant green. The combined yellow chromogens peak at 487 nm and the cyan peaks at 642 nm. At low intensities, some blue and red light is transmitted too, but in a balanced fashion. As intensities increase and saturation of the yellow and cyan is reduced, the perceived saturation of the green is increased as less, but proportionally more green light is transmitted.</p><p id="p-0505" num="0428">Example Blue: 1 mM compound 5 mixed with 1 mM compound 35 (cyan) produced bright yet extremely intense sky blue stains. Again, as with Example Yellow, the effect is that by mixing two closely spaced spectrally narrow chromogens, an almost perfect match with the red and green absorbing cones of the human eye is produced, leaving almost perfectly blue light. It is not the best contrast to blue hematoxylin, but the hematoxylin stained nuclei suddenly looked somewhat reddish in contrast to this blue. This is because hematoxylin has a small element of red transmission, too, which suddenly becomes apparent when contrasted to this pure blue.</p><p id="p-0506" num="0429">Example Cyan: A perfect blue and green could be made with mixtures including Compound 35, the new cyan chromogen showing its great utility. But like greenish yellow alone, cyan alone is perceived as somewhat weak in low intensities and unpleasing to the human eye in high intensities. Even 1-2 mM of Compound 32 alone in chromogen buffer did not produce convincing results. This is understandable since both chromogens absorb at the periphery of our color vision only, allowing free transmission of most light at low intensities.</p><p id="p-0507" num="0430">It is expressly contemplated that any chromogenic conjugates in the present disclosure can be used in any of the methods of use, compositions, and kits-of-parts in the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0508" num="0431">In the present disclosure, numeric ranges are inclusive of the numbers defining the range.
