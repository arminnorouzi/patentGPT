Its return into the combustion process is required by law worldwide and is realized in so-called closed crankcase venting systems. The most important tasks of a crankcase venting system include the oil separation and oil return into the crankcase as well as the control of the crankcase pressure. In this context, the requirements placed on the oil separation have steadily increased in recent years with the exhaust gas regulations becoming more stringent in order to protect emission-relevant engine components such as exhaust gas turbochargers, charge air coolers or sensors from performance loss by oil contamination. The oil separation provides a contribution to the minimization of the oil consumption as well as also an important contribution in regard to observing the exhaust gas regulations over the vehicle service life.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">EP 3100780 A1 discloses an oil separator with an exchangeable filter element.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The invention is based on the object of providing a beneficial separator for a liquid from a gas flow that is suitable as a lifetime component.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A further object is providing an assembly kit for such a separator.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The aforementioned object is solved according to an aspect of the invention by a separator for separation of liquid from a gas flow, in particular for separation of oil from a blow-by gas in a crankcase venting system, comprising at least one nozzle carrier element with at least one nozzle arrangement with at least one nozzle, and comprising an impact element arranged downstream at least partially opposite the nozzle arrangement, wherein a permanent cover device for one or more nozzles of the nozzle arrangement is provided that reduces by at least 50% a through-flow of the gas flow through the one or more nozzles in relation to nozzles that are free from the cover device.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The permanent cover for one or more nozzles of the nozzle arrangement can be changed in the context of the initial assembly of the separator or for recurrent servicing events. In this context, the cover can be completely or partially removed from individual nozzles of the nozzle arrangement. A function as a controlling or regulating member, for example, of a valve, is not provided. The cover device is no valve body that changes its position in operation but is fixedly adjusted and unchanged across all operating states.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The further object is solved by an assembly kit for a separator, at least comprising a nozzle carrier element with at least one nozzle arrangement which comprises at least one nozzle; an impact element for arrangement downstream of the nozzle arrangement; a cover device for one or more nozzles of the nozzle arrangement that reduces by at least 50% a through-flow of the gas flow through the one or more nozzles in comparison to nozzles that are free from the cover device, wherein at least the nozzle carrier element, the impact element or/and a liquid reservoir are provided as carry over parts for different nozzle arrangements or number of nozzles.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Beneficial embodiments and advantages of the invention result from the additional claims, the description, and the drawing.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">A separator for separating liquid from a gas flow is proposed, in particular for separating oil from a blow-by gas in a crankcase venting system, comprising at least one nozzle carrier element with at least one nozzle arrangement with at least one nozzle, and comprising an impact element arranged downstream at least partially opposite the nozzle arrangement. A permanent cover device is provided for one or more nozzles of the nozzle arrangement that reduces by at least 50% a through-flow of the gas flow through the one or more nozzles in comparison to nozzles that are free from the cover device.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Preferably, the through-flow of the gas flow is reduced by at least 80%, particularly preferred by at least 95%. In that during assembly of the separator it can be determined which nozzles can be flowed through freely and which can be flowed through less or not at all, it can be achieved that separators for entirely different through-flows of the gas flow from a minimal to a maximal gas flow can be realized with identical components. In this way, for example, separators for entirely different performance classes of internal combustion engines can be produced with identical components.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Advantageously, the separator can be configured without filter element and the separated liquid can directly drain or the separated liquid can be collected in a reservoir. An exchange of a filter element, and thus an at least partial removal of the separator, is not necessary. Optionally, a filter element can however be arranged downstream of the separator.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to a beneficial embodiment of the separator, a downstream distance, in relation to the nozzles, between nozzles and cover device can be smaller by at least 50% than a downstream distance between the impact element and the nozzles that are free from the cover device. Beneficially, the cover device can rest, for example, on the corresponding nozzles. For example, the impact element can comprise the cover device.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to a beneficial embodiment of the separator, the nozzle carrier element and the impact element can comprise a positioning device with complementary positioning elements with which a relative position, in particular rotatory position, between cover device and nozzle arrangement can be fixed. For example, a positioning element can be formed by a projection, for example, in the form of at least one pin, in particular of a radially extending pin, and the complementary positioning element by one or more receptacles for the projection. The pin can be formed at the nozzle carrier element and a plurality of receptacles can be formed at the impact element, or vice versa.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to a beneficial embodiment of the separator, the cover device can be arranged upstream of the nozzle arrangement. In particular, an upstream distance, in relation to the nozzles, between nozzles and cover device can be smaller by at least 50% than an upstream distance between the impact element and the nozzles that are free from the cover device. For example, a separate element can be arranged, viewed in the flow direction, in front of the nozzle arrangement that comprises an opening through which one or more nozzles are accessible unhindered for the gas flow.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to a beneficial embodiment of the separator, the nozzle carrier element and the cover device can comprise a positioning device with complementary positioning elements with which a rotatory position between cover device and nozzle arrangement can be fixed. This is beneficial when nozzle carrier element and cover device are arranged coaxially to each other.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to a beneficial embodiment of the separator, the nozzle carrier element can comprise a receptacle in which the impact element is arranged. The nozzle carrier element can have a pot-shaped cutout into which the impact element can be placed. Advantageously, nozzle carrier element and impact element can be arranged concentrically.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to a beneficial embodiment of the separator, the nozzle carrier element can be arranged in a receptacle of a liquid reservoir. Advantageously, the liquid reservoir can have a drainage valve through which the liquid reservoir can be emptied from time to time.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to a beneficial embodiment of the separator, the cover device can be integrated in the impact element. This enables a particularly compact configuration.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to a beneficial embodiment of the separator, the cover device can be configured as a flat ring or ring segment. Advantageously, the ring or ring segment can be arranged in front of a ring-shaped or ring segment-shaped nozzle arrangement.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to a beneficial embodiment of the separator, the cover device can be configured as a ring-type body with round or angular cross section. For example, the body can be a cylinder or a cuboid. The cross section of the body can be configured triangular or polygonal, for example, hexagonal. The corners of the cover device can serve as part of the positioning device and enable a positioning of a complementarily designed nozzle carrier element whose corners can also be part of the positioning device.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to a beneficial embodiment of the separator, the cover device can be embodied as a cover. Alternatively or additionally to a coaxial arrangement, a separate cover can be arranged upstream of the nozzle arrangement.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to a beneficial embodiment of the separator, the impact element and the nozzle carrier element can be arranged concentrically or coaxially about an axis. The corresponding arrangement can be selected depending on existing installation space and/or requirements on the separator.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to a beneficial embodiment of the separator, the nozzle arrangement can be arranged as a circular segment or ring segment in the nozzle carrier element. A maximal number of nozzles can be realized on a tight installation space. In particular, the nozzle carrier element and the impact element can be arranged perpendicularly to the axis. For example, nozzle arrangement and impact element can interact with ring-shaped regions.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to a beneficial embodiment of the separator, the nozzle arrangement can be arranged in a wall segment of the nozzle carrier element that is embodied parallel to the axis. Advantageously, a coaxial arrangement of a nozzle carrier element and impact element can be selected. In particular, the nozzle carrier element and the impact element can be arranged parallel to the axis. This is particularly beneficial in order to provide a maximal number of nozzles in a small installation space.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to a further aspect of the invention, an assembly kit for a separator is proposed, comprising at least a nozzle carrier element with at least one nozzle arrangement which comprises at least one nozzle; an impact element for arrangement downstream of the nozzle arrangement; a cover device for one or more nozzles of the nozzle arrangement that reduces by at least 50% a through-flow of the gas flow through the one or more nozzles in comparison to nozzles that are free from the cover device, wherein the nozzle carrier element, the impact element, and a liquid reservoir in a special embodiment are provided as carry over parts for different nozzle arrangements and/or number of nozzles.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Advantageously, with such an assembly kit with carry over parts, numerous separators can be produced which exhibit different gas throughputs in that, upon assembly of the separator, more or fewer nozzles are covered or the distance between one or more nozzles and the cover element is reduced by at least 50% in relation to the downstream distance between the impact element and the nozzles.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The number of nozzles which are free from a cover device can be selected depending on a required differential pressure that is a function of the throughput rate of the blow-by gas. With particular advantage, the nozzle carrier element, the impact element and/or the liquid reservoir can be designed as carry over parts. The nozzle carrier element can comprise a maximal number of nozzles. Due to a positioning device with complementary positioning elements, it can be determined by a suitable arrangement of the complementary positioning elements relative to each other which nozzles can be flowed through substantially freely and which nozzles are covered, or the distance between one or more nozzles and the cover element is reduced by at least 50%. Likewise, the ring-shaped cover element can be designed as carry over part.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">For example, maximally twelve nozzles can be provided in the nozzle carrier element and a through-flow region with minimal through-flow through a nozzle and maximal through-flow through all twelve nozzles can be exploited.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to a beneficial embodiment of the assembly kit, complementary positioning elements can be provided at the nozzle carrier element and the impact element with which a relative position between the cover device and the nozzle arrangement can be fixed. This enables a simple assembly of separators from carry over parts for different performance classes.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">According to a beneficial embodiment of the assembly kit, the cover device can coaxially surround the nozzle carrier element. Depending on positioning of the cover device in relation to the nozzle carrier element, more or fewer nozzles can be covered upon assembly of the separator.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Further advantages result from the following drawing description.
