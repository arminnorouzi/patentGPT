Compared with traditional in-ear and over-ear headphones, the open-ear acoustic output apparatus has characteristics of not blocking or covering an ear canal, which may allow a user to obtain sound information in external environment while listening to music, thereby improving the safety and comfort level. Due to an open structure, a leaked sound of the open-ear acoustic output apparatus is more serious than that of a traditional earphone. Generally, two or more sound sources are used to construct a specific sound field and adjust a sound pressure distribution to reduce the leaked sound, which can reduce the leaked sound to a certain extent, but there are still certain limitations. For example, a volume of the sound sent to the user may be reduced while the leaked sound is suppressed. In addition, because sounds at different frequencies have different wavelengths, the suppression effect of the leaked sound at high-frequency is not good.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, it is desirable to provide an acoustic output apparatus that can simultaneously increase a volume of the sound heard by the user and reduce the leaked sound.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to one aspect of the present disclosure, an acoustic output apparatus is provided.

Besides, one or more other operations may be added to the flowcharts, or one or more operations may be omitted from the flowchart.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The present disclosure describes an acoustic output apparatus including at least one acoustic driver. When a user wears the acoustic output apparatus, the acoustic output apparatus may be at least located on a side of a head of the user, close to but not blocking ears of the user. The acoustic output apparatus may be worn on the head of the user (e.g., non-ear open earphones that have the same or similar wearing style as glasses, headbands, or other structures) or other portions (e.g., a neck/shoulder area of the user) of a body of the user, or placed near the ears of the user by other manners (e.g., handheld by the user). The sound generated by the at least one acoustic driver in the acoustic output apparatus may be transmitted outwards through two sound guiding holes acoustically coupled with the at least one acoustic driver. For example, the two sound guiding holes may respectively transmit sounds with a same (or approximately same) amplitude and opposite (or approximately opposite) phases outwards. In some embodiments, the two sound guiding holes may be distributed on both sides of a user's auricle. In such cases, the user's auricle may be served as a baffle to separate the two sound guiding holes, so that acoustic routes from the two sound guiding holes to the user's ear canal may be different. In some embodiments, a baffle structure may be provided on the acoustic output apparatus, so that the two sound guiding holes may be respectively located on both sides of the baffle, which may increase an acoustic distance difference of sounds transmitted from the two sound guiding holes to a user's ear (that is, a difference in sound distances from the two sound guiding holes to the user's ear canal), thereby weakening the effect of sound cancellation, increasing a volume of sound heard by the user's ear (also referred to as near-field sound or heard sound), and providing the user with a better listening experience. In addition, the baffle may have little effect on sounds transmitted from the sound guiding holes to the environment (also referred to as far-field sound). The far-field sounds generated by the two sound guiding holes may cancel each other, which may suppress the sound leakage of the acoustic output apparatus and prevent the sound generated by the acoustic output apparatus from being heard by others near the user.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating an exemplary structure of an acoustic output apparatus according to some embodiments of the present disclosure. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the acoustic output apparatus <b>100</b> may include a supporting structure <b>110</b>, an acoustic driver <b>120</b>, and a controller (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) disposed in the supporting structure <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, the acoustic output apparatus <b>100</b> may be worn on the user's body (for example, human body's head, neck, or upper torso) through the supporting structure <b>110</b>. At the same time, the supporting structure <b>110</b> and the acoustic driver <b>120</b> may approach but not block the ear canal, so that the user's ears may remain open, thus the user may hear both the sound output from the acoustic output apparatus <b>100</b> and the sound of the external environment. For example, the acoustic output apparatus <b>100</b> may be arranged around or partially around the user's ear, and transmit sounds by means of air conduction or bone conduction.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The supporting structure <b>110</b> may be used to be worn on the user's body and include one or more acoustic drivers <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, the supporting structure <b>110</b> may have an enclosed shell structure with a hollow interior, and the one or more acoustic drivers <b>120</b> may be located inside the supporting structure <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, the acoustic output apparatus <b>100</b> may be combined with a product, such as glasses, headsets, head-mounted display devices, AR/VR helmets, etc. In this case, the supporting structure <b>110</b> may be fixed near the user's ear in a hanging or clamping manner. In some alternative embodiments, a hook may be provided on the supporting structure <b>110</b>, and the shape of the hook may match the shape of the user's auricle, so that the acoustic output apparatus <b>100</b> may be independently worn on the user's ear through the hook. The independently worn acoustic output apparatus <b>100</b> may communicate with a signal source (for example, a computer, a mobile phone, or other mobile devices) in a wired or wireless (for example, Bluetooth) manner. For example, the acoustic output apparatus <b>100</b> at the left and right ears may be directly in communication connection with the signal source in a wireless manner. As another example, the acoustic output apparatus <b>100</b> at the left and right ears may include a first output apparatus and a second output apparatus, the first output apparatus may be in communication connection with the signal source, and the second output apparatus may be connected with the first output apparatus wirelessly. The audio output of the first output apparatus and the second output apparatus may be synchronized through one or more synchronization signals. A wireless connection disclosed herein may include but not be limited to Bluetooth, a local area network, a wide area network, a wireless personal area network, a near field communication, or the like, or any combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In some embodiments, the supporting structure <b>110</b> may be a shell structure with a shape suitable for human ears, for example, a circular ring shape, an oval shape, a polygonal shape (regular or irregular), a U shape, a V shape, and a semi-circle, so that the supporting structure <b>110</b> may be directly hooked at the user's ear. In some embodiments, the supporting structure <b>110</b> may also include one or more fixed structures. The fixed structure(s) may include an ear hook, a head strip, or an elastic band, so that the acoustic output apparatus <b>100</b> may be better fixed on the user, preventing the acoustic output apparatus from falling. Merely by way of example, the elastic band may be a headband to be worn around the head region. As another example, the elastic band may be a neckband to be worn around the neck/shoulder area. In some embodiments, the elastic band may be a continuous band and be elastically stretched to be worn on the user's head. In the meanwhile, the elastic band may also exert pressure on the user's head so that the acoustic output apparatus <b>100</b> may be fixed to a specific position of the user's head. In some embodiments, the elastic band may be a discontinuous band. For example, the elastic band may include a rigid portion and a flexible portion. The rigid portion may be made of a rigid material (for example, plastic or metal), and the rigid portion may be fixed to the supporting structure <b>110</b> of the acoustic output apparatus <b>100</b> by a physical connection (for example, a clamping connection, a threaded connection, etc.). The flexible portion may be made of an elastic material (for example, cloth, composite material, or/and neoprene).</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In some embodiments, when the user wears the acoustic output apparatus <b>100</b>, the supporting structure <b>110</b> may be located above or below the auricle. The supporting structure <b>110</b> may also be provided with a sound guiding hole <b>111</b> and a sound guiding hole <b>112</b> for transmitting sound. In some embodiments, the sound guiding hole <b>111</b> and the sound guiding hole <b>112</b> may be located on both sides of the user's auricle, respectively, and the acoustic driver <b>120</b> may output sounds through the sound guiding hole <b>111</b> and the sound guiding hole <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The acoustic driver <b>120</b> may be a component that can receive an electrical signal, and convert the electrical signals into a sound signal for output. In some embodiments, in terms of frequency, the type of acoustic driver <b>120</b> may include an acoustic driver with a low-frequency (for example, 30 Hz-150 Hz), an acoustic driver with a mid-low-frequency (for example, 150 Hz-500 Hz), an acoustic driver with a mid-high-frequency (for example, 500 Hz-5 kHz), an acoustic driver with a high-frequency (for example, 5 kHz-16 kHz), or an acoustic driver with a full-frequency (for example, 30 Hz-16 kHz), or the like, or any combination thereof. Of course, the low frequency, high frequency, etc. mentioned herein may merely represent an approximate range of the frequency, and different division manners may be used in different application scenarios. For example, a frequency division point may be determined. Low frequency may represent a frequency range below the frequency division point, and high frequency may represent a frequency range above the frequency division point. The frequency division point may be an arbitrary value within the audible range of the human ear, for example, 500 Hz, 600 Hz, 700 Hz, 800 Hz, 1000 Hz, etc. In some embodiments, in terms of a principle, the acoustic driver <b>120</b> may include but is not limited to a moving coil driver, a moving iron driver, a piezoelectric driver, an electrostatic driver, a magnetostrictive driver, or the like.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In some embodiments, the acoustic driver <b>120</b> may include a vibration diaphragm. When the vibration diaphragm vibrates, sound may be transmitted from the front and rear sides of the vibration diaphragm, respectively. In some embodiments, the front side of the vibration diaphragm in the supporting structure <b>110</b> may be provided with a front chamber <b>113</b> for transmitting sound. The front chamber <b>113</b> may be acoustically coupled with the sound guiding hole <b>111</b>, and the sound on the front side of the vibration diaphragm may be outputted from the sound guiding hole <b>111</b> through the front chamber <b>113</b>. The rear side of the vibration diaphragm in the supporting structure <b>110</b> may be provided with a rear chamber <b>114</b> for transmitting sound. The rear chamber <b>114</b> may be acoustically coupled with the sound guiding hole <b>112</b>, and the sound on the rear side of the vibration diaphragm may be outputted from the sound guiding hole <b>112</b> through the rear chamber <b>114</b>. It should be noted that, when the vibration diaphragm is vibrating, the front side and the rear side of the vibration diaphragm may simultaneously generate sounds with opposite phases. After passing through the front chamber <b>113</b> and the rear chamber <b>114</b>, respectively, the sounds may propagate outward from the positions of the sound guiding hole <b>111</b> and the sound guiding hole <b>112</b>, respectively. In some embodiments, by adjusting the structure of the front chamber <b>113</b> and the rear chamber <b>114</b>, the sounds output by the acoustic driver <b>120</b> at the sound guiding hole <b>111</b> and the sound guiding hole <b>112</b> may meet specific conditions. For example, by designing the lengths of the front chamber <b>113</b> and the rear chamber <b>114</b>, the sound guiding hole <b>111</b> and the sound guiding hole <b>112</b> may output sounds with a specific phase relationship (for example, opposite phases). Therefore, the problems including a small volume of the sound heard by the user in the near field of the acoustic output apparatus <b>100</b> and a large sound leakage in the far field of the acoustic output apparatus <b>100</b> may be effectively resolved.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In some alternative embodiments, the acoustic driver <b>120</b> may also include a plurality of vibration diaphragms (for example, two vibration diaphragms). Each of the plurality of vibration diaphragms may vibrate respectively to generate sounds, which may respectively pass through different cavities connected to the vibration diaphragms in the supporting structure, and output from corresponding sound guiding holes. The plurality of vibration diaphragms may be controlled by the same controller or different controllers and generate sounds that meet certain phase and amplitude conditions (for example, sounds with the same amplitude but opposite phases, sounds with different amplitudes and opposite phases, etc.).</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The controller may be used to control a phase and an amplitude of a sound generated by the acoustic driver <b>112</b>. In some embodiments, a count of controllers in the acoustic output apparatus <b>100</b> may be one or more. For example, when the acoustic output apparatus <b>100</b> includes a plurality of acoustic drivers <b>112</b>, the count of controllers may be one. The controller may control, using a control signal, the plurality of acoustic drivers simultaneously <b>112</b> to generate sounds that meet a certain phase and amplitude condition. As another example, the count of controllers in the acoustic output apparatus <b>100</b> may be equal to the count of acoustic drivers. Each controller may control an acoustic driver corresponding to the controller to generate a sound that meets the certain phase and amplitude condition.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In order to further explain the specific structure of the acoustic output apparatus <b>100</b>, the present disclosure takes an acoustic output apparatus including two acoustic drivers as an example. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, an acoustic output apparatus <b>200</b> may include a supporting structure <b>210</b>, a first acoustic driver <b>221</b>, a second acoustic driver <b>222</b>, and a controller (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). The supporting structure <b>110</b> may be provided with a sound guiding hole <b>211</b> and a sound guiding hole <b>212</b> for outputting sound. The first acoustic driver <b>221</b>, the second acoustic driver <b>222</b>, and the controller may be disposed inside the supporting structure <b>210</b>. The controller may control the first acoustic driver <b>221</b> and the second acoustic driver <b>222</b> to generate sounds that meet the certain phase and amplitude condition (for example, sounds with a same amplitude but opposite phases, sounds with different amplitudes and opposite phases, etc.) using a control signal. In some embodiments, the sound guiding hole <b>211</b> and the sound guiding hole <b>212</b> may be located on both sides of the user's auricle. The first acoustic driver <b>221</b> may output sound through the sound guiding hole <b>211</b>, and the second acoustic driver <b>221</b> may output sound through the sound guiding hole <b>212</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In some embodiments, a cavity <b>213</b> for transmitting sound may be provided between the first acoustic driver <b>221</b> and the sound guiding hole <b>211</b> in the supporting structure <b>210</b>. The sound generated by the first acoustic driver <b>211</b> may be transmitted through the cavity <b>213</b> and outputted from the sound guiding hole <b>211</b>. A cavity <b>214</b> for transmitting sound may be provided between the second acoustic driver <b>222</b> and the sound guiding hole <b>212</b> in the supporting structure <b>210</b>. The sound generated by the second acoustic driver <b>222</b> may be transmitted through the cavity <b>214</b> and outputted from the sound guiding hole <b>212</b>. In some embodiments, the controller may control the first acoustic driver <b>221</b> and the second acoustic driver <b>222</b> to simultaneously generate a set of sounds with opposite phases by a control signal. For example, if the first acoustic driver <b>221</b> and the second acoustic driver <b>222</b> have the same frequency response characteristic, the controller may adjust electrical signals input into the first acoustic driver <b>221</b> and the second acoustic driver <b>222</b> by the control signal, so that the electrical signals have opposite phases. Further, driven by the electrical signals with opposite phases, the first acoustic driver <b>221</b> and the second acoustic driver <b>222</b> may generate sounds with opposite phases. After passing through the cavity <b>213</b> and the cavity <b>214</b> respectively, the sounds may propagate outward from the sound guiding hole <b>211</b> and the sound guiding hole <b>212</b>, respectively. In some embodiments, the structures of the cavity <b>213</b> and the cavity <b>214</b> may be specially designed so that the sound output by the first acoustic driver <b>221</b> from the sound guiding hole <b>211</b> and the sound output by the second acoustic driver <b>222</b> from the sound guiding hole <b>212</b> meet a specific condition. For example, the lengths of the cavity <b>213</b> and the cavity <b>214</b> may be designed so that the sounds with opposite phases may be output from the sound guiding hole <b>211</b> and the sound guiding hole <b>212</b>. In some embodiments, the controller may control the first acoustic driver <b>221</b> and the second acoustic driver <b>222</b> to simultaneously generate sounds with a same amplitude by the control signal. For example, if the first acoustic driver <b>221</b> and the second acoustic driver <b>222</b> have the same frequency response characteristic, the controller may adjust the electrical signals input into the first acoustic driver <b>221</b> and the second acoustic driver <b>222</b> by the control signal. The electrical signals may control output powers of the first acoustic driver <b>221</b> and the second acoustic driver <b>222</b>, respectively, so that the two electrical signals have a same amplitude. Further, driven by the electrical signals with the same amplitude, the first acoustic driver <b>221</b> and the second acoustic driver <b>222</b> may generate sounds with a same amplitude. It should be noted that the controller is not limited to controlling the first acoustic driver <b>221</b> and the second acoustic driver <b>222</b> to generate the sounds with the same amplitude and opposite phases by the control signal. For example, in some embodiments, the controller may control the first acoustic driver <b>221</b> and the second acoustic driver <b>222</b> to generate sounds with a same amplitude and a same phase by a control signal different from the above-mentioned control signal. As another example, in some embodiments, the controller may control the first acoustic driver <b>221</b> and the second acoustic driver <b>222</b> to generate sounds with different amplitudes and different phases by a control signal different from the above-mentioned control signal. The controller may also control the amplitude and the phase of sounds generated by acoustic drivers other than the first acoustic driver <b>221</b> and the second acoustic driver <b>222</b>, which may not be limited and can be adjusted according to specific requirements.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The two sound guiding holes of the acoustic output apparatus <b>200</b> may be distributed on both sides of a user's auricle, which may increase a volume of the sound heard by the user's ear (also referred to as near-field sound) and suppress the sound leakage of the acoustic output apparatus <b>200</b> to a certain extent. In some embodiments, the two sound guiding holes of the acoustic output apparatus <b>200</b> may be divided by a baffle, which may achieve effects of increasing the near-field sound and reducing the far-field leakage. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating an exemplary structure of an acoustic output apparatus according to some embodiments of the present disclosure.

the present disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a graph illustrating frequency response curves of two point sources with different distances at a near-field listening position according to some embodiments of the present disclosure. In some embodiments, the listening position may be taken as a target point to further illustrate a relationship between a sound pressure at the target point and the distance d between the two point sources. As used herein, the listening position may be used to indicate a position of the user's ear. The sound at the listening position may be used to represent the near-field sound generated by two point sources. It should be noted that &#x201c;near-field sound&#x201d; may refer to a sound within a certain range from a sound source (for example, the point source equivalent to the sound guiding hole <b>111</b>), for example, a sound within 0.2 m from the sound source. Merely by way of example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, a point source A<sub>1 </sub>and a point source A<sub>2 </sub>may be on a same side of the listening position, the point source A<sub>1 </sub>may be closer to the listening position, and the point source A<sub>1 </sub>and the point source A<sub>2 </sub>may output sounds with the same amplitude but opposite phases, respectively. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, as the distance between the point source A<sub>1 </sub>and the point source A<sub>2 </sub>gradually increases (for example, from d to 10 d), the sound volume at the listening position may gradually increase. That is, as the distance between the point source A<sub>1 </sub>and the point source A<sub>2 </sub>increases, the difference in sound pressure amplitude (i.e., sound pressure difference) between the two sounds reaching the listening position may become larger, making the sound cancellation effect weaker, which may increase the sound volume at the listening position. However, due to the existence of sound cancellation, the sound volume at the listening position may still be less than the sound volume generated by a single point source at a same position in the low and middle frequency band (for example, a frequency of less than 1000 Hz). However, in the high-frequency band (for example, a frequency close to 10000 Hz), due to the decrease in the wavelength of the sound, mutual enhancement of the sound may appear, making the sound generated by the two point sources louder than that of the single point source. In some embodiments, a sound pressure may refer to the pressure generated by the sound through the vibration of the air.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0090">In some embodiments, by increasing the distance between the two point sources (for example, the point source A<sub>1 </sub>and the point source A<sub>2</sub>), the sound volume at the listening position may be increased. But as the distance increases, the sound cancellation of the two point sources may become weaker, which may lead to an increase of the far-field sound leakage. For illustration purposes, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a graph illustrating sound leakage indexes (also referred to as normalization parameters) of two point sources with different distances in a far field according to some embodiments of the present disclosure. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, a far-field sound leakage index of a single point source may be taken as a reference, as the distance between two point sources increases from d to 10d, the far-field sound leakage index may gradually increase, which indicates that the sound leakage becomes larger. More descriptions regarding the sound leakage index may be found in equation (4) and related descriptions.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0091">In some embodiments, adding a baffle structure to the acoustic output apparatus may be beneficial to improve the output effect of the acoustic output apparatus, that is, to increase the sound intensity at the near-field listening position, while reducing the volume of the far-field sound leakage. For illustration, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating an exemplary baffle provided between two point sources according to some embodiments of the present disclosure. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, when a baffle is provided between the point source A<sub>1 </sub>and the point source A<sub>2</sub>, in the near field, the sound wave of the point source A<sub>2 </sub>may need to bypass the baffle to interfere with the sound wave of the point source A<sub>1 </sub>at the listening position, which may be equivalent to increasing the length of the acoustic route from the point source A<sub>2 </sub>to the listening position. Therefore, assuming that the point source A<sub>1 </sub>and the point source A<sub>2 </sub>have a same amplitude, compared to the case without a baffle, the difference in the amplitude of the sound waves of the point source A<sub>1 </sub>and the point source A<sub>2 </sub>at the listening position may increase, so that the degree of cancellation of the two sounds at the listening position may decrease, causing the sound volume at the listening position to increase. In the far field, because the sound waves generated by the point source A<sub>1 </sub>and the point source A<sub>2 </sub>do not need to bypass the baffle in a large space, the sound waves may interfere (similar to the case without a baffle). Compared to the case without a baffle, the sound leakage in the far field may not increase significantly. Therefore, a baffle structure being provided between the point source A<sub>1 </sub>and the point source A<sub>2 </sub>may increase the sound volume at the near-field listening position significantly while the volume of the far-field leakage does not increase significantly.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a graph illustrating frequency response curves of two point sources in a near field when an auricle is located between the two point sources according to some embodiments of the present disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a graph illustrating frequency response curves of two point sources in a far field when an auricle is located between the two point sources according to some embodiments of the present disclosure. In the present disclosure, when the two point sources are located on both sides of the auricle, the auricle may serve as a baffle, so the auricle may also be referred to as a baffle for convenience. As an example, due to the existence of the auricle, the result may be equivalent to that the near-field sound may be generated by two point sources with a distance of D<sub>1 </sub>(also known as mode 1). The far-field sound may be generated by two point sources with a distance of D<sub>2 </sub>(also known as mode 2), D<sub>1</sub>&#x3e;D<sub>2</sub>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, in a low-frequency range (e.g., when the frequency is less than 1000 Hz), when the two point sources are distributed on both sides of the auricle, the volume at the near-field sound (i.e., the sound heard by the user's ear) may basically be the same as that of the near-field sound in mode 1, be greater than the volume of the near-field sound in mode 2 and be close to the volume of the near-field sound of a single point source. As the frequency increases (e.g., when the frequency is between 2000 Hz-7000 Hz), the volume of the near-field sound in mode 1 and the two point sources being distributed on both sides of the auricle may be greater than that of the single point source. It shows that when the user's auricle is located between the two point sources, the volume of the near-field sound transmitted from the sound source to the user's ear may be effectively enhanced. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, as the frequency increases, the volume of the far-field leakage may increase, but when the two point sources are distributed on both sides of the auricle, the volume of the far-field leakage generated by the two point sources may be basically the same as that of the volume of the far-field leakage in mode 2, and both of which may be less than the volume of the far-field leakage in mode 1 and the volume of the far-field leakage of a single point source. It shows that when the user's auricle is located between the two point sources, the sound transmitted from the sound source to the far field may be effectively reduced, that is, the sound leakage from the sound source to the surrounding environment may be effectively reduced.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0093">More descriptions regarding the specific meaning and related content of the sound leakage index may refer to the following description. In the application of the open acoustic output apparatus, it may be necessary to ensure that a sound pressure P<sub>ear </sub>at the listening position is large enough to meet the listening needs. Meanwhile, it may be necessary to ensure that a sound pressure P<sub>far </sub>at the far field is small enough to reduce sound leakage.

The volume of the near-field sound may be significantly increased compared to the case without a baffle. In the far field, since the interference of the sound waves generated by the two point sources is rarely affected by the baffle, the sound leakage may not change significantly with or without the baffle. It may be seen that by setting a baffle between the two sound guiding holes (two point sources), the capability to reduce sound leakage of the acoustic output apparatus may be effectively improved, the volume of the near-field sound of the acoustic output apparatus may be significantly increased. Therefore, the requirements for sound generation components of the acoustic output apparatus may be greatly reduced, which may reduce the electrical loss of the acoustic output apparatus at the same time due to simple circuit structure, so that the working time of the acoustic output apparatus may be greatly prolonged under a certain amount of electricity.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0099"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is a graph illustrating frequency response curves of two point sources in a near field when a distance d between the two point sources is 1 cm according to some embodiments of the present disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is a graph illustrating frequency response curves of two point sources in a near field when a distance d between the two point sources is 2 cm according to some embodiments of the present disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> is a graph illustrating frequency response curves of two point sources in a near field when a distance d between the two point sources is 4 cm according to some embodiments of the present disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> is a graph illustrating sound leakage indexes of two point sources in a far field when a distance d between the two point sources is 1 cm according to some embodiments of the present disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> is a graph illustrating sound leakage indexes of two point sources in a far field when a distance d between the two point sources is 2 cm according to some embodiments of the present disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> is a graph illustrating sound leakage indexes of two point sources in a far field when a distance d between the two point sources is 4 cm according to some embodiments of the present disclosure.

It should be noted that as the distance between two sound guiding holes or two point sources increases, the interference cancellation of sound at the far-field position may be weakened, leading to a gradual increase in the far-field leakage and a weaker ability to reduce sound leakage. Therefore, the distance d between two sound guiding holes or the two point sources may not be too large. In some embodiments, in order to keep the sound output device output sound as loud as possible in the near field and suppress the sound leakage in the far field, the distance d between the two sound guiding holes may be set to no more than 20 cm.

In order to improve the acoustic output effect of the acoustic output apparatus, in some embodiments, the acoustic output apparatus may be provided with at least two sound guiding holes, the at least two sound guiding holes may include two sound guiding holes located on the front and rear sides of the user's auricle, respectively. In some specific embodiments, considering that the sound propagated from the sound guiding hole located on the rear side of the user's auricle needs to bypass over the auricle to reach the user's ear canal, the acoustic route between the sound guiding hole located on the front side of the auricle and the user's ear canal (i.e., the acoustic distance from the sound guiding hole to the of the entrance) may be shorter than the acoustic route between the sound guiding hole located on the rear side of the auricle from the user's ear. In some embodiments, the acoustic output apparatus may include two sound guiding holes. The two sound guiding holes may be respectively located on both sides of the listening position, and the baffle may be located at one side of the listening position. The distance from one sound guiding hole on a same side of the baffle as the listening position of the two sound guiding holes to the listening position may be shorter than the distance from the other sound guiding hole to the listening position.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b> and <b>22</b></figref>, for the listening position 1, since the acoustic route difference between the point source A<sub>1 </sub>and the point source A<sub>2 </sub>to the listening position 1 is small, the difference in amplitude of the sound generated by the two point sources at the listening position 1 may be small, so that interference of the sounds of two point sources at the listening position 1 may cause the volume of the sound heard by the user to be smaller than that of other listening positions. For the listening position 2, compared with the listening position 1, the distance between the listening position 2 and the point source A<sub>1 </sub>may remain unchanged, that is, the acoustic route from the point source A<sub>1 </sub>to the listening position 2 may not change. However, the distance between the listening position 2 and the point source A<sub>2 </sub>may be longer, and the acoustic route between the point source A<sub>2 </sub>and the listening position 2 may increase. The amplitude difference between the sound generated by the point source A<sub>1 </sub>and the point source A<sub>2 </sub>at the listening position 2 may increase, so the volume of the sound transmitted from the two point sources after interference at listening position 2 may be greater than that at the listening position 1. Among all positions on an arc with a radius of r<sub>1</sub>, since the acoustic route difference between the point source A<sub>1 </sub>and the point source A<sub>2 </sub>to the listening position 3 may be the longest, compared with the listening position 1 and the listening position 2, the listening position 3 may have the highest volume of the sound heard by the user. For the listening position 4, the distance between the listening position 4 and the point source A<sub>1 </sub>may be short. The sound amplitude of the point source A<sub>1 </sub>at the listening position 4 may be relatively large, the volume of the sound heard by the user at the listening position 4 may be relatively large. In summary, the volume of the sound heard by the user at the near-field listening position may change with the listening position and the relative position of the two point sources. When the listening position is on the connection line between two point sources and on the same side of the two point sources (for example, listening position 3), the acoustic route difference between the two point sources at the listening position may be the largest (the acoustic route difference may be the distance d between the two point sources). In this case (i.e., when the auricle is not used as a baffle), the volume of the sound heard by the user at this listening position may be greater than that at other positions. According to Equation(4), when the far-field sound leakage is constant, the sound leakage index corresponding to the listening position may be the smallest, and the leakage reduction capability may be the strongest. At the same time, reducing the distance r<sub>1 </sub>between the listening position (for example, listening position 4) and the point source A<sub>1 </sub>may further increase the volume at the listening position, reduce the sound leakage index, and improve the capability to reduce leakage.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0103"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref> is a graph illustrating frequency response curves of two point sources with a baffle (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>) at different listening positions in a near field according to some embodiments of the present disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref> is a graph illustrating=sound leakage indexes at different listening positions obtained based on Equation (4) on the basis of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>22</b> and <b>23</b></figref>, compared to the case without a baffle, the volume of the sound generated by the two point sources at listening position 1 may increase significantly when there is a baffle, the volume of the sound heard by the user at the listening position 1 may exceed that at the listening position 2 and the listening position 3. The reason may be that the acoustic route from the point source A<sub>2 </sub>to the listening position 1 may increase after a baffle is set between the two point sources. As a result, the acoustic route difference from the two point sources to the listening position 1 may increase significantly. The amplitude difference between the sounds generated by the two point sources at the listening position 1 may increase, which reduces the interference and cancellation of sounds, thereby increasing the volume of the sound heard by the user generated at the listening position 1 significantly. At the listening position 4, since the distance between the listening position and the point source A<sub>1 </sub>is further reduced, the sound amplitude of the point source A<sub>1 </sub>at this position may be larger. The volume of the sound heard by the user at the listening position 4 may still be the largest among the four listening positions. For listening position 2 and listening position 3, since the increased effect of the baffle on the acoustic route from the point source A<sub>2 </sub>to the two listening positions is not very obvious, the volume increase effect at the listening position 2 and the listening position 3 may be less than that at the listening position 1 and the listening position 4 which are closer to the baffle.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0104">The volume of the leaked sound in the far field may not change with listening positions, and the volume of the sound heard by the user at the listening position in the near field may change with listening positions. In this case, according to Equation (4), the leakage index of the acoustic output apparatus may vary in different listening positions. A listening position with a large volume of the sound heard by the user (for example, listening position 1 and listening position 4) may have a small sound leakage index, and a strong capability to reduce leakage. A listening position with a low volume of the sound heard by the user (for example, listening position 2 and listening position 3), may have a large sound leakage index, and a weak capability to reduce leakage.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0105">Therefore, according to the actual application scenario of the acoustic output apparatus, the user's auricle may serve as a baffle. In this case, the two sound guiding holes on the acoustic output apparatus may be arranged on the front side and the rear side of the auricle, respectively, and the ear canal may be located between the two sound guiding holes as a listening position. In some embodiments, by designing the positions of the two sound guiding holes on the acoustic output apparatus, the distance between the sound guiding hole on the front side of the auricle and the ear canal may be smaller than the distance between the sound guiding hole on the rear side of the auricle and the ear canal. In this case, the acoustic output apparatus may produce a large sound amplitude at the ear canal since the sound guiding hole on the front side of the auricle is close to the ear canal. The sound amplitude formed by the sound guiding hole on the back of the auricle may be smaller at the ear canal, which may avoid the interference cancellation of the sound at the two sound guiding holes at the ear canal, thereby ensuring that the volume of the sound heard by the user at the ear canal is large. In some embodiments, the acoustic output apparatus may include one or more contact points (e.g., &#x201c;an inflection point&#x201d; on a supporting structure to match the shape of the ear) that can contact with the auricle when it is worn. The contact point(s) may be located on a connection line between the two sound guiding holes or on one side of the connection line between the two sound guiding holes.

In such cases, since the sound guiding hole located on the same side of the baffle as the listening position is close to the listening position, an amplitude of a sound output by the sound guiding hole located on the same side of the baffle as the listening position may be large at the listening position, and an amplitude of a sound output by the sound guiding hole located on the other side of the baffle may be small at the listening position, which reduce the interference and cancellation of the sounds output by two sound guiding holes at the listening position, thereby ensuring that the volume of the sound heard by the user at the listening position is large.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0107">In some embodiments, when the distance from one of the two sound guiding holes to the baffle is much less than the distance from the other of the two sound guiding holes to the baffle, the acoustic output apparatus may have a large volume at the listening position in the near field.

In this case, an acoustic route difference between the point source A<sub>1 </sub>and the point source A<sub>2 </sub>to the listening position may be increased and the interference cancellation of the sound may be reduced. As a result, the volume at the listening position may be increased after the baffle is added. When L is large, the listening position may be far away from the baffle. The baffle may have a small effect on the acoustic route difference between the point source A<sub>1 </sub>and the point source A<sub>2 </sub>to the listening position. As a result, a volume change at the listening position may be small after the baffle is added.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0112">As described above, by designing positions of the sound guiding holes on the acoustic output apparatus, the baffle (or an auricle of a human body) may separate different sound guiding holes when the user wears the acoustic output apparatus, such that a structure of the acoustic output apparatus may be simplified and the output effect of the acoustic output apparatus may be further improved.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0113">In some embodiments, the position of the two sound guiding holes may be designed so that when the user wears the acoustic output apparatus, a ratio of a distance between the sound guiding hole on the front side of the auricle and the auricle (or a contact point on the acoustic output apparatus for contacting with the auricle) to a distance between the two sound guiding holes may be less than or equal to 0.5. Preferably, the ratio of the distance between the sound guiding hole on the front side of the auricle and the auricle (or the contact point on the acoustic output apparatus for contacting with the auricle) to the distance between the two sound guiding holes may be less than or equal to 0.3.

The acoustic route may be changed by adjusting a cavity length between a vibration diaphragm in the acoustic output apparatus and the sound guiding hole. In some embodiments, the acoustic driver may include a vibration diaphragm. The front and rear sides of the vibration diaphragm may be coupled to two sound guiding holes through a front chamber and a rear chamber, respectively. The acoustic routes from the vibration diaphragm to the two sound guiding holes may be different.

Specifically, impedances of acoustic routes connecting the acoustic driver and the two sound guiding holes may be adjusted so as to adjust the sound amplitude at each of the two sound guiding holes. In some embodiments of this specification, the impedance may refer to a resistance that a medium needs to overcome during displacement when acoustic waves are transmitted. The acoustic routes may or may not be filled with a damping material (e.g., a tuning net, a tuning cotton, etc.) so as to adjust the sound amplitude. For example, a resonance cavity, a sound hole, a sound slit, a tuning net, and/or a tuning cotton may be disposed in an acoustic route so as to adjust the acoustic resistance of the acoustic route, thereby changing the impedances of the acoustic route. As another example, in some embodiments, an aperture of each of the two sound guiding holes may be adjusted to change the acoustic resistance of the acoustic routes corresponding to the two sound guiding holes. In some embodiments, a ratio of the acoustic impedance of the acoustic route between the acoustic driver (the vibration diaphragm) and one of the two sound guiding holes to the acoustic impedance of the acoustic route between the acoustic driver and the other sound guiding hole may be 0.5-2.

In some embodiments, the acoustic driver <b>130</b> and the acoustic driver <b>120</b> may output sounds of different frequencies. In some embodiments, the acoustic output apparatus may further include a controller configured to cause the acoustic driver <b>120</b> to output sound in the first frequency range, and cause the acoustic driver <b>130</b> to output sound in the second frequency range. The second frequency range may include frequencies higher than the first frequency range. For example, the first frequency range may be 100 Hz-1000 Hz, and the second frequency range may be 1000 Hz-10000 Hz. In some embodiments, there is an overlapping frequency range between the first frequency range and the second frequency range. The sounds in the overlapping frequency range may be regarded as being output from the first sound guiding hole, the second sound guiding hole, and the pair of third sound guiding holes together.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0133">In some embodiments, the acoustic driver <b>120</b> may be a low-frequency speaker, and the acoustic driver <b>130</b> may be a mid-high-frequency speaker. Due to different frequency response characteristics of the low-frequency speaker and the mid-high-frequency speaker, frequency bands of the output sound may also be different. High-frequency bands and low-frequency bands may be divided by using the low-frequency speakers and the mid-high-frequency speakers, and accordingly, two low-frequency point sources and two mid-high-frequency point sources may be constructed to perform near-field sound output and a far-field leakage reduction. For example, the acoustic driver <b>120</b> may provide two point sources for outputting low-frequency sound through the sound guiding hole <b>111</b> and the sound guiding hole <b>112</b>, which may be mainly used for outputting sound in low-frequency band. The two low-frequency point sources may be distributed on both sides of an auricle to increase a volume near the near-field ear. The acoustic driver <b>130</b> may provide two point sources for outputting mid-high-frequency sound through two second sound guiding holes. A mid-high-frequency sound leakage may be reduced by adjusting a distance between the two second sound guiding holes. The two mid-high-frequency point sources may be distributed on both sides of the auricle or on the same side of the auricle. Alternatively, the acoustic driver <b>120</b> may provide two point sources for outputting full-frequency sound through the sound guiding hole <b>111</b> and the sound guiding hole <b>112</b> so as to further increase the volume of the near-field sound.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0134">Further, the distance d<sub>2 </sub>between the pair of third sound guiding holes may be smaller than the distance d<sub>1 </sub>between the sound guiding hole <b>111</b> and the sound guiding hole <b>112</b>, that is, d<sub>1 </sub>may be greater than d<sub>2</sub>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>41</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating sound leakage indexes under the action of a combination of low-frequency two point sources and high-frequency two point sources according to some embodiments of the present disclosure. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>41</b></figref>, by setting a set of low-frequency two point sources and a set high-frequency two point sources with different distances, a stronger ability to reduce sound leakage may be achieved compared with a single point source. In the low-frequency range, when the distance (d1) between the low-frequency two point sources is adjusted (e.g., increased), the increase in the volume of the near-field sound may be greater than the increase in the volume of the far-field leakage, which may achieve a higher volume of the near-field sound output in the low-frequency band. At the same time, in the low-frequency range, because that the sound leakage of the low frequency two point sources is very small, adjusting (increasing) the distance d1 may slightly increase the sound leakage, but the increased sound leakage is still be kept at a low level (&#x3b1; value is even further reduced). In the high-frequency range, by adjusting (e.g., reducing) the distance (d2) between the high frequency two point sources, the problem that the cutoff frequency of high-frequency sound leakage reduction is too low and the frequency band of the sound leakage reduction is too narrow may be overcome. Therefore, a stronger effect of sound leakage reduction may be achieved in higher frequency bands, which may meet the needs of open acoustic output apparatus.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0135">It should be noted that a curve of a total leaked sound shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>41</b></figref> is an ideal, which is only used to illustrate the principle and effect. Affected by factors such as the filter characteristic of a circuit, the frequency characteristic of a transducer, and the frequency characteristic of an acoustic route, the actual low-frequency and high-frequency sounds output by the acoustic output apparatus may differ from those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>41</b></figref>. In addition, low-frequency and high-frequency sounds may have a certain overlap (aliasing) in the frequency band near the frequency division point, causing the total leaked sound of the acoustic output apparatus does not have a mutation at the frequency division point as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>41</b></figref>. Instead, there may be a gradient and/or a transition in the frequency band near the frequency division point, as shown by a thin solid line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>41</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0136">In some embodiments, the pair of third sound guiding holes may output sounds with a phase difference. Preferably, the third sound guiding holes may output sounds with opposite phases. In some embodiments, the acoustic driver <b>130</b> that output sounds with a phase difference from the third sound guiding holes may be similar to the acoustic driver <b>120</b> that outputting sounds from the sound guiding holes as described elsewhere in this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0137">It should be noted that the descriptions of the present disclosure may not limit an actual use scenario of the acoustic output apparatus. The acoustic output apparatus may be any apparatus outputting the sound or a portion thereof. For example, the acoustic output apparatus may be applied to a phone. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>42</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a phone having sound guiding holes according to some embodiments of the present disclosure. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>42</b></figref>, a plurality of sound guiding holes as described elsewhere in the present disclosure may be arranged on a top <b>4220</b> (that is, an upper end perpendicular to a display of the phone <b>4200</b>) of a phone <b>4200</b>. Merely by way of example, sound guiding holes <b>4201</b> may constitute a set of two point sources (or an array of point sources) for outputting sounds. A first sound guiding hole of the sound guiding holes <b>4201</b> may be close to a left end of the top <b>4220</b>, and a second sound guiding hole of the sound guiding holes <b>4201</b> may be close to a right end of the top <b>4220</b>. The two sound guiding holes may be separated by a certain distance. An acoustic driver <b>4230</b> may be provided inside a housing of the phone <b>4200</b>. The sounds generated by the acoustic driver <b>4230</b> may be transmitted outward through the sound guiding holes <b>4201</b>.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0138">In some embodiments, the two sound guiding holes <b>4201</b> may output a set of sounds with the opposite (or approximately the opposite) phase and the same (or approximately the same) amplitude. When a user places the phone near an ear to receive voice information, the sound guiding holes <b>4201</b> may be located on both sides of a user's ear, according to the descriptions of other embodiments in the present disclosure, which may be equivalent to increasing an acoustic distance of the sound from the sound guiding hole to the user's ear, so that the sound guiding holes <b>4201</b> may output strong near-field sound to the user. Meanwhile, the user's ear may have little effect on sounds output by the sound guiding holes in a far field, so that due to the interference and cancellation of the sounds in the far field, the sound guiding holes <b>4201</b> may reduce sound leakage to the surrounding environment. In addition, by arranging the sound guiding holes on the top portion of the phone instead of an upper portion of the display of the phone, a space on a front of the phone may be saved. Therefore, an area of the display of the phone may be further increased and the appearance of the phone more concise and beautiful.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0139">It should be understood that the above descriptions of the sound guiding holes on the phone are merely for illustration purposes. Those skilled in the art may make various modifications to the above structures without departing this principle. The modified structures may be within the protection scope of the present disclosure. For example, all or a portion of the sound guiding holes <b>4201</b> may also be set at other positions of the phone <b>4200</b>, which may still ensure that the user may hear a relatively loud volume when receiving voice information while avoiding leakage of the voice information to the surrounding environment. For example, the first sound guiding hole may be arranged on the top <b>4220</b> (relatively close to the user's ear), and the second sound guiding hole may be arranged on a back or a side of the phone <b>4200</b> (relatively away from the user's ear). When the user places the first sound guiding hole near the ear to receive the voice information, the housing of the phone <b>4200</b> may be equivalent to a &#x201c;baffle&#x201d; that &#x201c;blocks&#x201d; between the second sound guiding hole and the user's ear, which may add an acoustic distance from the second sound guiding hole to the user's ear. Therefore, a volume heard by the user's ear may be increased. As another example, acoustic drivers that output sounds in different frequency ranges may be disposed inside the housing of the phone <b>4200</b>, and sound guiding holes corresponding to these acoustic drivers may be provided with or without baffles in the manner described above.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0140">It should be noted that the above descriptions are merely for the convenience of description, and not intended to limit the present disclosure. It may be understood that, for those skilled in the art, after understanding the principle of the present disclosure, various modifications and changes in the forms and details of the acoustic output apparatus may be made without departing from this principle. In some embodiments, the sound guiding hole <b>111</b> and the sound guiding hole <b>112</b> corresponding to the acoustic driver <b>120</b> may not be distributed on both sides of the auricle, and/or the two third guide holes corresponding to the acoustic driver <b>130</b> may not be distributed on the front side of the auricle. For example, the pair of third sound guiding holes corresponding to the acoustic driver <b>130</b> may be distributed on the same side of the auricle (for example, a rear side, an upper side, or a lower side of the auricle). As another example, the pair of third sound guiding holes corresponding to the acoustic driver <b>130</b> may be distributed on both sides of the auricle. As still another example, when the sound guiding hole <b>111</b>, the sound guiding hole <b>112</b>, and/or the pair of third sound guiding holes are located on the same side of the auricle, a baffle (e.g., a baffle <b>4240</b>) may be disposed between the sound guiding holes <b>111</b> and the sound guiding hole <b>112</b>, and/or between the pair of third sound guiding holes to further increase the volume of the near-field sound and reduce the volume of the far-field leakage. As still another example, in some embodiments, the two sound guiding holes corresponding to the acoustic driver <b>120</b> may be located on the same side of the auricle (for example, a front side, a rear side, an upper side, and a lower side of the auricle).</p><p id="p-0149" num="0141">Having thus described the basic concepts, it may be rather apparent to those skilled in the art after reading this detailed disclosure that the foregoing detailed disclosure is intended to be presented by way of example only and is not limiting.
