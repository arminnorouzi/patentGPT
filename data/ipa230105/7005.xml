Devices such as cameras, kitchen appliances, medical devices, doors, windows, HVAC systems, drones, . . . , , etc. can all be connected through the IoT. Basically, anything that can be powered can be connected to the internet to control its functionality. The IoT allows objects to be sensed and controlled remotely across existing network infrastructure, creating opportunities for more direct integration of the physical world into computer-based systems, and resulting in improved efficiency, accuracy, and control.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">IoT devices can help a public-safety officer in crime investigation since IoT sensors can monitor a crime scene with devices such as video cameras, motion detectors, sound recorders, environmental monitors, etc. Since a criminal may try to connect to IoT devices to remove evidence or serve false information to any connected public-safety device, it would be beneficial to stop a public-safety officer's device from transferring data to/from IoT devices in situations where the IoT device may provide false evidence.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The accompanying figures where like reference numerals refer to identical or functionally similar elements throughout the separate views, and which together with the detailed description below are incorporated in and form part of the specification, serve to further illustrate various embodiments and to explain various principles and advantages all in accordance with the present invention.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram of an IoT ecosystem.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a block diagram of an apparatus designed to access an IoT device.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a flow chart showing operation of the apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a flow chart showing operation of the apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Skilled artisans will appreciate that elements in the figures are illustrated for simplicity and clarity and have not necessarily been drawn to scale.

Also, common but well-understood elements that are useful or necessary in a commercially feasible embodiment are often not depicted in order to facilitate a less obstructed view of these various embodiments of the present invention. It will further be appreciated that certain actions and/or steps may be described or depicted in a particular order of occurrence while those skilled in the art will understand that such specificity with respect to sequence is not actually required.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In order to address the above-mentioned need, a method and apparatus for preventing access to an IoT device is provided herein. During operation an apparatus will inquire about current and/or past connections to an IoT device. A list of identities of current and/or past apparatuses that were connected to the IoT device will be provided, and a determination on whether or not to allow access to the IoT device will be based on the identities of current and/or past apparatuses that are accessing, or have accessed the IoT device.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Consider the following example: An officer was involved in a foot chase with a suspect. After an unsuccessful chase, the officer wants to provide a nearby IoT camera with data about the suspect to enable recognition of the suspect in the future. The officer connects an apparatus to the IoT camera, however, before transmitting the data to the IoT camera, the IoT camera will provide the apparatus with a list of devices that are currently connected to the IoT camera. If the devices currently connected to the IoT camera are all recognized as known safe devices, then data will be transmitted to the IoT camera. However, if unknown (or known malicious) devices are currently connected to the IoT camera, then the apparatus will prevent itself from transmitting any data to the IoT camera. Preventing the transmission of data will prevent unwanted individuals from being able to access the data.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In an alternate embodiment of the present invention if unknown (or known malicious) devices are currently connected to the IoT camera, then the apparatus will prevent itself from transmitting any unencrypted data to the IoT camera. Preventing the transmission of unencrypted data will prevent unwanted individuals from being able to access the data.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another example, consider the following: An officer is currently chasing a suspect. After a successful chase, the officer wants to access a nearby IoT camera and retrieve a video of the apprehension. The officer connects an apparatus to the IoT camera, however, before retrieving the video of the apprehension, the IoT camera will provide the apparatus with a list of devices that are currently connected to the IoT camera and a list of devices that have connected to the IoT camera within the recent past (e.g., since the apprehension has taken place). If the devices currently connected to the IoT camera and the devices that have connected to the IoT camera within the recent past are all recognized as known safe devices, then data will be retrieved from the IoT camera. However, if unknown (or known malicious) devices are currently connected, or have recently connected to the IoT camera since the apprehension, then the apparatus will prevent itself from receiving any data to the IoT camera. This prevents the apparatus from retrieving potentially corrupt images and video placed there nefariously.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram of IoT ecosystem <b>100</b>. As shown, officer <b>101</b> is provided with apparatus <b>102</b> that accesses IoT device <b>105</b> through network <b>107</b>. Apparatus <b>102</b> may comprise any suitable computing and/or communication devices configured to engage in wireless communication over an air interface as is known to those in the relevant art. For example, apparatus <b>102</b> may comprise a mobile device running an Android&#x2122; or iOS&#x2122; operating system.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Apparatus <b>102</b> may implement a direct-mode, conventional, or trunked land mobile radio (LMR) standard or protocol such as ETSI Digital Mobile Radio (DMR), a Project 25 (P25) standard defined by the Association of Public Safety Communications Officials International (APCO), Terrestrial Trunked Radio (TETRA), or other LMR radio protocols or standards. In other embodiments, the long-range transmitter may implement a Long Term Evolution (LTE) (including LTE-Advanced or LTE-Advanced Pro compliant with, for example, the 3GPP TS 36 specification series) or 5G (including a new radio (NR) air interface compliant with the 3GPP TS 38 specification series) protocol, among other possibilities, over which multimedia broadcast multicast services (MBMS), single site point-to-multipoint (SC-PTM) services, or Mission Critical Push-to-talk (MCPTT) services may be provided, or over which an open mobile alliance (OMA) push to talk (PTT) over cellular (OMA-PoC), a voice over IP (VoIP), an LTE Direct or LTE Device to Device, or a PTT over IP (PolP) application may be implemented. Direct mode LTE standards may additionally or alternatively be implemented as well, including but not limited to the LTE Direct device-to-device standard.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Communication between apparatus <b>102</b> and IoT device <b>105</b> takes place through intervening network <b>107</b> such as, but not limited to a high-speed data network <b>107</b> such as a cellular communication system and/or public-safety core network and radio access network. IoT device <b>105</b> comprises any device, sensor, camera, video cameras, motion detectors, sound recorders, environmental monitors . . . , etc. that can be accessed and/or controlled via apparatus <b>102</b> via communications through intervening network <b>107</b>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, users <b>106</b> of other devices <b>103</b> (only one user and other device labelled in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) may access and/or control IoT device <b>105</b>. This control may be through other intervening networks (not shown) or through network <b>107</b>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Finally, although not necessary, ecosystem <b>100</b> may comprise logger <b>104</b> that serves to log identities of those individuals accessing and/or controlling IoT device <b>105</b>. Although logger <b>104</b> is shown connected to only IoT device <b>105</b>, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that logger <b>104</b> may be connected to many IoT devices, logging information on those who access to IoT devices.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">During operation, apparatus <b>102</b> connects to IoT device <b>105</b>. As part of the connection process, apparatus <b>102</b> is provided with information on the identities of people that are using the IoT device at the particular moment, and/or identities of people that have used the IoT device in the past. (Apparatus <b>102</b> may provide a timeframe to IoT device <b>105</b> when determining past IoT users of device <b>105</b>, for example, a period of time, that the IoT device will use for determining past users).</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In response to the connection of apparatus <b>102</b> to IoT device <b>105</b>, apparatus <b>102</b> is provided with information on current users and/or recent users of IoT device <b>105</b>. In order to provide this information to apparatus <b>102</b>, IoT device <b>105</b> may access logger <b>104</b> to determine this information, and pass this information to apparatus <b>102</b>. The information about current and past users may comprise any information that will help in identifying the current and recent users of IoT device <b>105</b>. For example, in one embodiment, a Media Access Control (MAC) address of current and past users may be provided in order to identify particular devices <b>103</b>. Apparatus <b>102</b> may access an internal or an external database of known MAC addresses to determine whether or not the device is unknown, or known malicious. By comparing the MAC addresses provided by IoT devices <b>105</b> to those stored in a database (internal or external), apparatus <b>102</b> may learn the identities and prevent data transfer to and from IoT device <b>105</b> if known malicious persons have accessed IoT device <b>105</b>, or if unknown persons have accessed IoT device <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Alternatively, in another embodiment, voice recordings or images of those current or past users may also be provided to apparatus <b>102</b>. For example, if IoT device <b>105</b> comprises a microphone, a recording of persons accessing IoT device <b>105</b> may be provided to apparatus <b>102</b>. Similarly, if IoT device <b>105</b> comprises a camera, a video or photograph or video may be provided to apparatus <b>102</b>. Once a voice recording, photo, or video has been obtained by apparatus <b>102</b>, it will be up to apparatus <b>102</b> to identify whether or not the users <b>106</b> of devices <b>103</b> are either unknown, or malicious. Again, this may be accomplished by apparatus <b>102</b> accessing a database of known voice signatures and/or images of individuals. By comparing the voice recording and/or images of the users provided by IoT devices <b>105</b> to those stored in a database (internal or external), apparatus <b>102</b> may learn the identities and prevent data transfer to and from IoT device <b>105</b> if known malicious persons have accessed IoT device <b>105</b>, or if unknown persons have accessed IoT device <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a block diagram of an apparatus designed to access an IoT device. In an embodiment, apparatus <b>102</b> is embodied within a police radio, however in alternate embodiments the device may be embodied within the public-safety core network, dispatch center, or more computing devices in a cloud compute cluster (not shown), or some other communication device not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, and/or may be a distributed communication device across two or more entities.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">As shown, apparatus <b>102</b> comprises network interface <b>203</b>, which may comprise a Wide-Area-Network (WAN) transceiver, database <b>204</b>, logic circuitry <b>201</b>, and graphical-user interface (GUI) <b>202</b>. In other implementations, apparatus <b>102</b> may include more, fewer, or different components. All components are connected via common data busses as known in the art.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Network interface <b>203</b> may comprise well known long-range transceivers that utilize any number of network system protocols. (As one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize, a transceiver comprises both a transmitter and a receiver for transmitting and receiving data). For example, network interface <b>203</b> may be operable to utilize a next-generation cellular communications protocol operated by a cellular service provider, or any public-safety protocol such as an APCO <b>25</b> network or the FirstNet broadband network.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In alternate embodiments of the present invention, network interface <b>203</b> may comprise a wired connection to network <b>107</b>. If this is the case, then network interface <b>203</b> provides processing, modulating, and transceiver elements that are operable in accordance with any one or more standard or proprietary wireless interfaces, wherein some of the functionality of the processing, modulating, and transceiver elements may be performed by means of the logic circuitry <b>201</b> through programmed logic such as software. Examples of network interfaces (wired or wireless) include Ethernet, T1, USB interfaces, IEEE 802.11b, IEEE 802.11g, etc.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Logic circuitry <b>201</b> comprises a digital signal processor (DSP), general purpose microprocessor, a programmable logic device, or application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) and is operable to receive information on identities of devices that have connected to IoT device <b>105</b> within a particular time period, and/or the identities of devices that are currently connected to IoT device <b>105</b>. Logic circuitry <b>201</b> also prevents data transmission to/from IoT device <b>105</b>, or alternatively prevents unencrypted transmissions to IoT device <b>105</b> when unknown or untrusted devices have connected to IoT device <b>105</b> in the recent past, or when unknown or untrusted devices are currently connected to IoT device <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">GUI <b>202</b> provides a man/machine interface for receiving an input from a user and displaying information. For example, GUI <b>202</b> may provide a way of receiving a time period from a user. The time period received by GUI <b>202</b> may be provided to IoT device <b>105</b> so that IoT device may provide a list of user information on those users who have accessed IoT device within the time period. For example, GUI may receive a time period of 1 hour, and this may be provided to IoT device <b>105</b>. IoT device will then return those users who have accessed IoT device <b>105</b> within the last hour. With the above in mind, GUI <b>202</b> may comprise any combination of a touch screen, a computer screen, a keyboard, or any other interface needed to receive a user input and provide information to the user.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Database <b>204</b> is provided. Database <b>102</b> comprises standard memory (such as RAM, ROM, . . . , etc) and serves to store information used to identify known users, whether a user is unknown, and/or whether or not a user is malicious. For example, database <b>204</b> may store a list of known &#x201c;friendly&#x201d; MAC addresses or known &#x201c;high risk&#x201d; MAC addresses. Any MAC address received from IoT device <b>105</b> may be compared to database <b>204</b> to determine if the MAC address is from a &#x201c;friendly&#x201d; device. In a similar manner, database <b>102</b> may comprise voice prints or images of known friendly or high-risk individuals. Any image or voice recording received from IoT device <b>105</b> may be compared to those within database <b>102</b> to determine friendly or high-risk devices are accessing, or have accessed IoT device <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">With the above in mind, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> provides for an apparatus comprising a network interface configured to access an Internet of Things (IoT) device, and a database configured to store information used to identify if an individual accessing the IoT device is friendly, malicious, or unknown.
