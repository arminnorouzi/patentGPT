In particular, though not exclusively, the invention relates to motion generators, and to motion systems including such motion generators, and to methods of using motion generators and motion systems.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">A motion generator is a device capable of applying forces and/or moments, movements and accelerations to a payload in one or more directions of degrees of freedom. The payload can be, for example, a human undergoing a simulated experience in a motion simulator based on a motion generator. Motion generators are used in motion systems, which include a control system.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Motion systems are used in a variety of applications, including motion simulation (for example, flight simulators, and driving simulators), robotics, 3D printing, vibration, and seismic simulation. The most common type of motion system currently used in motion simulation is the Stewart platform (or &#x201c;hexapod&#x201d;). This is a type of parallel robot that has six actuators (typically hydraulic rams), attached in pairs to three configurations on the baseplate of a platform and crossing over to three mounting points on a top plate. Devices or payloads such as a human user placed on the top plate, usually in some form of cockpit, driver area or model vehicle, can be moved in the six degrees of freedom in which it is possible for a freely-suspended body to move, i.e., the three linear movements x, y, z (lateral, longitudinal and vertical), and the three rotations (pitch, roll and yaw).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A motion simulator is a mechanism including a motion system that can create, for an occupant, the effects or feelings of being in a moving vehicle. Motion simulators are used, professionally, for training drivers and pilots in the form of driving simulators and flight simulators respectively. They also are used, industrially, in the creation, design, and testing of the vehicles themselves. Professional motion simulators used for driving and flying simulators typically synchronise a visual display&#x2014;provided, for example, by a projection system and associated screens and audio signals with the movement of a carriage (or chassis) occupied by the driver or pilot in order to provide a better sensation of the effect of moving. Motion simulators are also used in leisure or gaming applications (for example in an arcade video driving game) The advent of virtual reality (VR) head-mounted displays (HMDs) makes the aspect of an immersive simulation less costly with current motion systems and has the ability to deliver virtual reality applications to leisure uses such as in passive amusement park or arcade driving, riding-first-person, or flying rides and in active gaming, where one or more players has some control over the driving, riding, flying or first-person game experience.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The type of hexapods typically used for motion simulation for human participants typically have a relatively low bandwidth of up to about 20 Hz. This means that they can create oscillatory movements and vibrations of a consistent amplitude, with a frequency of up to 20 times per second, beyond which the amplitude of the movements reduces as the frequency increases. This is sufficient for replicating most car suspension movements, but it does not transmit the frequency content associated with vibrations from the car engine, tyre vibrations, road noise, and the sharp-edged kerbs on racetracks. A low bandwidth also means the signals are delayed, meaning that the driver cannot respond as quickly.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Current motion systems, especially those intended for high-end use such as in military and commercial flight instruction and training applications, are typically very large, heavy, complex, and very expensive. Their complexity necessitates extensive programming and maintenance, further extending the cost to users. Dedicated driving simulator motion systems have been developed by the likes of McLaren/MTS Williams/ABD and Ansible, but these tend to be extremely mechanically complex, and therefore also very expensive, featuring precision machined custom components and often expensive linear motors. These dedicated driving simulator motion systems are more responsive than hexapods when moving in some directions but are still limited in others. The use of ball screws in such systems is disadvantageous in that, whilst good at establishing position, they inhibit force transfer and can only achieve a lower bandwidth. This results in a less natural experience for a human user.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The applicant's earlier patent publications WO2020/007506 and EP3591641, form part of the technological background to the present invention.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">An object of the present invention is to provide an improved motion generator, and improved motion systems and simulators incorporating such motion generators. One object of the invention is to provide a motion generator capable of operation to move the end effector in six degrees of freedom, that is less expensive to produce. Another object of the invention is to provide a motion generator that is suitable for leisure or gaming applications.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to one aspect of the invention there is provided a motion generator according to claim <b>1</b>. An advantage of such a motion generator may be that it is less expensive to produce.

One actuation mechanism is shown in detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. In this form of actuation mechanism, and as shown in detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, a rocker R, which is pivotally mounted on axle A, is associated with a motor M which has a toothed capstan C on its shaft (obscured). An elongate toothed belt TB is connected at both ends to the rocker R, around the midpoint of the rocker and engages with the capstan C. It will be appreciated that the toothed belt TB may, alternatively, be continuous and fixed at one point to the rocker R. Other connection points are contemplated. Connection points towards the free end of the rocker may be preferred. An idler pulley P is biased by spring S to keep the belt B in tension. The free end of the rocker R is connected to an elongate tension member TM, which in turn suspends the end effector <b>14</b>. Six such actuation mechanisms are provided in the motion generator.

It is possible that a motion generator in accordance with the invention might include six of the same type of actuation mechanisms, or a mixture of actuation mechanisms for example of the types described above. A motion generation in accordance with the invention, might include more than six such actuation mechanisms, possibly for reasons of redundancy.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Motion System</heading><p id="p-0042" num="0039">A motion system in accordance with the invention, comprises a motion generator in accordance with the invention, and an associated motion generator control system. An example of a control system suitable for use in controlling operation of a motion generator in accordance with the invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>. The control system <b>701</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> may receive inputs from a user. In relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the motion generator of the motion system is referred to as <b>702</b>, but the control system <b>701</b> is applicable to the other motion generators, motion systems, and motion simulators, such as the motion generator <b>10</b> and motion simulators <b>20</b>,<b>30</b> described herein. The control system <b>701</b> comprises a motion controller <b>704</b> which executes a computer program, preferably in a deterministic or real time manner, and which takes motion demand inputs <b>705</b> from a demand generator such as a simulation environment <b>703</b> or a set point generator <b>706</b>. The motion controller computes the positions, accelerations and/or forces <b>707</b> required to be produced at each actuator <b>709</b> in order to generate the demanded motion profile <b>705</b>. The control system <b>701</b> also comprises servo drives <b>708</b> which provide precisely controlled electrical currents <b>710</b> to drive the actuators <b>709</b>. In operation, the motion controller sends to each servo drive <b>708</b> a demanded position or force <b>707</b>. The actuator <b>709</b> has a motion measurement device <b>711</b>, such as an encoder, which provides motion feedback <b>712</b> to the motion controller, optionally via the servo drive. The motion controller compares the demanded motion profile <b>705</b> to the one measured <b>712</b> and updates the actuator demand <b>707</b> accordingly. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> also shows the control system with a simulation environment <b>703</b>, such as a driving simulation in which the physics of a simulated vehicle and its environment, such as a racetrack or city roads, are computed. In this embodiment the control system <b>701</b> receives motion demands from the simulation environment <b>703</b>, which represent the motion of a virtual vehicle. The computer program determines the motion of the vehicle in a virtual world <b>714</b>, then applies a motion cueing algorithm <b>713</b> (MCA, also known as washout filters) to transform the simulated vehicle motions into those that can be represented by the motion generator <b>701</b>. These calculated motions are then provided to the control system as motion demands <b>705</b>. The MCA <b>713</b> could be part of the simulation environment <b>703</b> or the control system <b>701</b> or separate to both. The simulation environment <b>703</b> may receive inputs signals <b>715</b> from control devices <b>716</b> such as steering, throttle or brake inputs, which an operator, i.e., a human user such as a driver, passenger or pilot uses to control the virtual vehicle in the simulation environment. The operator would likely be a passenger on the motion generator <b>702</b>. These inputs <b>715</b> may be passed back to the simulation environment via the control system or directly. The simulation environment is also likely to produce an output on a visual display <b>717</b> for the driver, passenger, or other user or operator. The simulation environment may also require additional data <b>718</b> from the control system, such as relating to the position of the motion generator, or control device input signals.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">Motion Simulator</heading><p id="p-0043" num="0040">Motion simulators <b>20</b> and <b>30</b> in accordance with the invention are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref>.
