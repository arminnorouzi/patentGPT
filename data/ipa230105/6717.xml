In some aspects of the present disclosure, an embedding representing a characterization of a beam may be generated by an encoder trained using an autoencoder training procedure. Once trained, the encoder may generate values for a look-up table indicating embeddings representing various beams. In some aspects, the characterization of the beam may be in the form of an array gain sphere. The array gain sphere data may be converted into a graph data structure, and the autoencoder training procedure may involve using a graphical convolution network to process the graph and train the encoder for generation of the values for the look-up table.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some aspects, the look-up table may be provided to a user equipment (UE) for processing. For instance, a UE may retrieve, from the look-up table, an embedding representing a beam of interest and input the embedding into a machine learning model to generate a communication parameter to be used. As one example, the machine learning model may perform beam rotation, predict signal quality parameters (e.g., reference signal receive power (RSRP)) associated with the beam, calculate inter-beam similarities, performing mobility estimation, or perform codebook characterization, as described further herein.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Using an embedding as described herein results in reduced storage space and computation complexity at the UE by providing a low-dimensional representation of a beam that can be stored at the UE and used for performing computations. Generation of the embedding enables various evaluations (e.g., inter-beam similarity evaluation) from a single metric and provides a richer representation than conventional implementations that have codebook characterizations using descriptive statistics.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Introduction to Wireless Communication Networks</heading><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts an example of a wireless communications system <b>100</b>, in which aspects described herein may be implemented.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Generally, wireless communications system <b>100</b> includes base stations (BSs) <b>102</b>, user equipments (UEs) <b>104</b>, one or more core networks, such as an Evolved Packet Core (EPC) <b>160</b> and 5G Core (5GC) network <b>190</b>, which interoperate to provide wireless communications services.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Base stations <b>102</b> may provide an access point to the EPC <b>160</b> and/or 5GC <b>190</b> for a user equipment <b>104</b>, and may perform one or more of the following functions: transfer of user data, radio channel ciphering and deciphering, integrity protection, header compression, mobility control functions (e.g., handover, dual connectivity), inter-cell interference coordination, connection setup and release, load balancing, distribution for non-access stratum (NAS) messages, NAS node selection, synchronization, radio access network (RAN) sharing, multimedia broadcast multicast service (MBMS), subscriber and equipment trace, RAN information management (RIM), paging, positioning, delivery of warning messages, among other functions.

For example, 3GPP technical standard TS 38.101 currently defines Frequency Range 1 (FR1) as including 600 MHz-6 GHz, though specific uplink and downlink allocations may fall outside of this general range. Thus, FR1 is often referred to (interchangeably) as a &#x201c;Sub-6 GHz&#x201d; band.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Similarly, TS 38.101 currently defines Frequency Range 2 (FR2) as including 26-41 GHz, though again specific uplink and downlink allocations may fall outside of this general range.

Machine learning is generally the process of producing a trained model (e.g., an artificial neural network, a tree, or other structures), which represents a generalized fit to a set of training data that is known a priori. Applying the trained model to new data produces inferences, which may be used to gain insights into the new data. In some cases, applying the model to the new data is described as &#x201c;running an inference&#x201d; on the new data.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Both ML and non-ML mmWave applications use information that describe mmWave beams as an input to produce a target objective (e.g., schedule beams based on UE mobility). A codebook characterization provides a collection of different measures to describe individual beams and inter-beam relations. This set of information is currently obtained by empirical study and simulation. However, codebook characterization is not ideal, or practical, for consumption by downstream mmWave applications. Therefore, the performance of mmWave applications that rely on codebook beam characterization may be limited by the current representation of beams. Certain aspects of the present disclosure are directed to techniques for generating a low-dimension beam characterization (also referred to as &#x201c;codebook embedding&#x201d; or &#x201c;embedding&#x201d; for short), which can be used in arbitrary mmWave applications, codebook characterization, and beam analysis, to name a few examples.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">A beam may be characterized using various techniques. For example, a beam may be represented by a beam ID, which is codebook specific. However, merely using a beam ID to characterize a beam may be insufficient as a general tool usable with arbitrary codebooks.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some cases, beams may be characterized by defining parent-child-neighbor relationships of beams, providing a coarse characterization of the beams. A parent-child relationship between two beams may indicate a similarity in the features of the beams. However, using parent-child-neighbor relationships may be not provide a notion of relative closeness of beams.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Summary statistics of beams may be used for beam characterization. Summary statistics may be extracted from an array gain sphere which may be used to provide complete information regarding the beam. Summary statistics such as peak phi angle (&#x3c6;), theta angle (&#x3b8;), and gain associated with the beam may result in two beams with very different profiles sharing a misleadingly similar representation.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates example array gain spheres for various beams. Array gain spheres may be used to characterize multiple beams, such as beam<sub>1 </sub>to beam<sub>5</sub>, as shown. The array gain sphere indicates the gain associated with a beam at each phi and theta angle. The array gain sphere for beam<sub>1 </sub>may have a peak center of mass at spherical coordinate <b>403</b> and the array gain sphere for beam<sub>5 </sub>may have a peak center of mass at spherical coordinate <b>407</b>. For instance, the peak center of mass for beam<sub>1 </sub>may be at theta angle 30, phi angle 179, and have a gain of &#x2212;95 dB.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">While an array gain sphere provides detailed information of a beam, it may be difficult to use in practice for various applications&#x2014;especially on user equipments and network elements not capable of generating the gain sphere data. Codebook characterization measures that work directly on the sphere, such as spherical cross-correlation, overlap ratio, and envelope, are approximations that do not capture non-0-lag relationships. Non-0-lag relationships are derived using non-0-lag analysis which provided an accurate representation of inter-beam relationships by considering different rotations associated with the array gain spheres by aligning the spheres on different coordinates, and performing a separate analysis for each rotation. Moreover, sphere projections to one-dimension (1D) or two-dimension (2D) representations may cause too many features for efficient processing, distortions, and/or discontinuities.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Some aspects of the present disclosure are directed to generating low-dimension beam characterization (e.g., capturing detailed information provided by a codebook characterization), which may be embodied in vector or other tensor data forms. The low-dimension beam characterization may also be referred to herein as an embedding. The embedding may be generated based on array gain measurements per UE beam on a sphere (e.g., an array gain sphere). In some cases, codebook beam characterization metrics per UE beam may be used as an auxiliary input for the generation of the embedding. The embedding may be used for determining relationships between beams, as an example. The embedding may be generated using a ML model trained using various types of processing units, including a graphical processing unit (GPU), central processing unit (CPU), neural processing unit (NPU), artificial intelligence (AI) accelerator, application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), or other processing units, any of which may be &#x201c;off-target&#x201d; (e.g., at a network entity such as a network server).</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The embedding may then be generated using the trained ML model off-target (e.g., using a CPU at the network). For example, a look-up table may be generated indicating the embedding for each of multiple beam IDs. The look-up table may be sent to the target (e.g., a UE) to be used for performing various target tasks, such as evaluating inter-beam similarities, performing mobility estimation, and performing codebook characterization. The embedding may capture beam properties provided by the codebook characterization, such as width, strength, orientation, and peak gain, as a few examples. Using the embedding results in reduced storage space and computation complexity at the UE by providing a low-dimensional representation of a beam that can be stored at the UE and used for performing computations. In some aspects, the training of the ML model and generation of the look-up table may be performed on-target (e.g., at a UE).</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates example operations for embedding generation and processing. In some aspects, an autoencoder technique may be used to implement an encoder for generation of embeddings.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">An autoencoder is an artificial neural network used to learn efficient data encodings in an unsupervised manner. The aim of an autoencoder is to learn a representation (encoding) for a set of data by training the network to ignore signal &#x201c;noise&#x201d;, in effect generating a lower dimensionality representation of an input. In some aspects, an autoencoder <b>590</b> may be trained end-to-end. The autoencoder <b>590</b> may include an encoder <b>502</b> that receives a representation of a beam (e.g., array gain sphere data) and generates a low-dimensional representation of the beam (e.g., an embedding <b>503</b>). The autoencoder <b>590</b> may further include a decoder <b>504</b> that attempts to reconstruct the representation of the beam.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In other words, the encoder <b>502</b> (also referred to as an embedding generator) may be used to learn efficient encodings to generate the embedding <b>503</b> based on one or more training codebooks. In some aspects, target task optimization (or at least improvement) of the embedding may be performed. For instance, the embedding is provided to the decoder <b>504</b> to reconstruct (e.g., generate) an output <b>505</b> for training by optimizing (or at least improving) an objective function (e.g., by comparing the output from the decoder with the input to the encoder and adjusting weights of the autoencoder accordingly).</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Once the autoencoder has been trained, the encoder <b>502</b> may be used separately for other tasks, such as generating encodings, without using the decoding aspect of the autoencoder model. For example, the encoder <b>502</b> may receive a target codebook to generate data for a look-up table <b>510</b>, including an embedding for each beam ID, as shown. The autoencoder training operations and look-up table generation may be performed off-target (e.g., on a server at a network). The look-up table may be then saved and provided to a target <b>520</b> (e.g., a UE) for performing a target task.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">For instance, the UE may determine embeddings <b>514</b> and <b>515</b> associated with two beams, respectively (e.g., labeled as UE_beam_id_Rx0 and UE_beam_id_Rx1 in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) using the look-up table <b>510</b>. The embeddings <b>514</b> and <b>515</b> may be provided to an ML model <b>516</b> to perform a target task, such as a prediction relevant to a communication connection between the target (e.g., UE) and the network. The target task may be performed based on data input <b>530</b> as described in more detail herein.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Certain aspects of the present disclosure are directed to techniques for converting an array gain sphere (or array gain sphere data) to an embedding using a graphical convolution network (GCN). A GCN is a type of graph neural network designed to perform inference on data structured as graphs. For example, a graph neural network may be applied directly to a graph to perform node-level, edge-level, and graph-level prediction tasks. A graph may generally have multiple nodes (e.g., vertices) and edges (e.g., connections between the vertices) that represent the relationship of one node with another. For example, an edge may be associated with a weight that may indicate importance or cost associated with the edge.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">To implement a GCN, an array gain sphere may be first converted into a graph data format. Various suitable techniques may be used map the array gain sphere to a graph. For example, each node of the graph may be mapped to a coordinate (e.g., a phi and theta angle coordinates) on the array gain sphere. Other techniques may include using an icosahedron sampling of the sphere or a Hierarchical Equal Area isoLatitude Pixelization (HEALPix) technique, as described in more detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>, and <b>8</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>, and <b>8</b></figref> illustrate example sampling techniques for mapping data to a graph data structure.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates an icosahedron sampling technique. As shown, an array gain sphere may be divided into sets of equilateral triangles.

As shown, the array gain sphere may be divided into hierarchies of equal area curvilinear quadrilaterals. Each quadrilateral may be further divided into multiple quadrilaterals in a hierarchical manner. For example, quadrilateral <b>706</b> may be divided into quadrilaterals <b>708</b>, <b>710</b>, <b>712</b>, <b>714</b>, and each of the quadrilaterals <b>708</b>, <b>710</b>, <b>712</b>, <b>714</b> may be further divided in smaller quadrilaterals and so on, as shown.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The original array gain sphere may be interpolated from codebook phi and theta angle points to discretized points. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the points on the sphere may be then transformed into a set of nodes (e.g., vertex (V) such as vertex <b>802</b>) and edges (E) (e.g., edge <b>804</b>), which define a graph G(V,E). For example, when using the HEALPix technique, the sphere may include a total of 196,608 points for an order-7 discretization in accordance with the equation:</p><p id="p-0069" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>|<i>V|=</i>12&#xd7;4<sup>order</sup>,<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0070" num="0068">where |V| is the total number of points. The order of the differential equation used to define |V| may be 7 for an order-7 discretization. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, graph edges are defined between a node and each node of the set of adjacent faces (e.g., quadrilaterals). Nodes are defined as the centroid of each face (e.g., quadrilateral). Edge <b>804</b> may be defined between vertex <b>802</b> and vertex <b>806</b>. Once the array gain sphere is mapped to a graph, the graph may be fed into one or more graphical convolution networks (GCNs) for generation of the embedding, as described in more detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates an example technique for implementing an autoencoder using a graphical convolution network (GCN), in accordance with certain aspects of the present disclosure.

Federated learning is a framework that allows training of a model across multiple nodes that have local data samples without sharing such data across nodes but only the parameters of their local models. Federated learning involves using an iteration loop where an orchestrator (e.g., a BS) or central server chooses a model to be trained (e.g., model associated with autoencoder <b>590</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) and transmits the model to the nodes (e.g. UEs). The nodes train their local copy of the model with the local data. The orchestrator then pools the local models and generates one aggregated model to be transmitted to the nodes. The main benefit of this approach is privacy, as no UE-local data is shared across nodes or with the orchestrator.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0095">In some aspects, a UE may send an embedding of its codebook to the BS for various use cases. For example, the embedding may be used for a model to be trained at the BS, or to be used with a pre-trained model to generate an inference that runs at the BS (e.g., either using uplink (UL) measurements or reported downlink (DL) measurements). Information on the codebook embedding may include information for mapping such input to the specific ML model. This provides an opportunity for the actual codebook design to remain proprietary while only a compressed version of it can be shared. These use cases can be combined with federated learning. A first set of UEs may receive an initial model and parameters. Such UE sets may train a model locally based on their codebook information and each UE may report back to the BS updated parameters with or without the UE codebook embedding associated with it. The BS may combine the parameters of these models with or without the respective UE codebook embeddings. The result will be a new model that the BS can send to a second set of UEs. This second set of UEs can possibly include the first set of UEs, in some scenarios. For instance, a set of UEs with higher capability can train locally a model, and the associated parameters can be reused by different UEs with lower capability. In the context of models that use Frequency Range 2 (FR2) (e.g., 26-41 GHz) beam measurements as their input, the codebook embedding provides an invariance to be able to leverage learning done by a set of UEs across other UEs. In other words, a codebook embedding may be derived such that the resulting encoder is codebook/UE independent. Once trained, an encoder trained based on FR2 beam measurements from one or more UEs can be used across any other UE operating on FR2. For a given ML model, UEs can communicate their capability, or lack thereof, to train the model locally and participate in the federated learning framework.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Example Wireless Communication Devices</heading><p id="p-0098" num="0096"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> depicts an example communications device <b>1800</b> that includes various components operable, configured, or adapted to perform operations for the techniques disclosed herein, such as the operations depicted and described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>.

While subframes 3, 4 are shown with slot formats 34, 28, respectively, any particular subframe may be configured with any of the various available slot formats 0-61. Slot formats 0, 1 are all DL, UL, respectively. Other slot formats 2-61 include a mix of DL, UL, and flexible symbols.

The bus interface may be used to connect a network adapter, among other things, to the processing system via the bus. The network adapter may be used to implement the signal processing functions of the PHY layer. In the case of a user equipment (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), a user interface (e.g., keypad, display, mouse, joystick, touchscreen, biometric sensor, proximity sensor, light emitting element, and others) may also be connected to the bus. The bus may also link various other circuits such as timing sources, peripherals, voltage regulators, power management circuits, and the like, which are well known in the art, and therefore, will not be described any further. The processor may be implemented with one or more general-purpose and/or special-purpose processors. Examples include microprocessors, microcontrollers, DSP processors, and other circuitry that can execute software. Those skilled in the art will recognize how best to implement the described functionality for the processing system depending on the particular application and the overall design constraints imposed on the overall system.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0186">If implemented in software, the functions may be stored or transmitted over as one or more instructions or code on a computer readable medium. Software shall be construed broadly to mean instructions, data, or any combination thereof, whether referred to as software, firmware, middleware, microcode, hardware description language, or otherwise. Computer-readable media include both computer storage media and communication media including any medium that facilitates transfer of a computer program from one place to another. The processor may be responsible for managing the bus and general processing, including the execution of software modules stored on the machine-readable storage media. A computer-readable storage medium may be coupled to a processor such that the processor can read information from, and write information to, the storage medium. In the alternative, the storage medium may be integral to the processor. By way of example, the machine-readable media may include a transmission line, a carrier wave modulated by data, and/or a computer readable storage medium with instructions stored thereon separate from the wireless node, all of which may be accessed by the processor through the bus interface. Alternatively, or in addition, the machine-readable media, or any portion thereof, may be integrated into the processor, such as the case may be with cache and/or general register files. Examples of machine-readable storage media may include, by way of example, RAM (Random Access Memory), flash memory, ROM (Read Only Memory), PROM (Programmable Read-Only Memory), EPROM (Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory), EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory), registers, magnetic disks, optical disks, hard drives, or any other suitable storage medium, or any combination thereof. The machine-readable media may be embodied in a computer-program product.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0187">A software module may comprise a single instruction, or many instructions, and may be distributed over several different code segments, among different programs, and across multiple storage media. The computer-readable media may comprise a number of software modules. The software modules include instructions that, when executed by an apparatus such as a processor, cause the processing system to perform various functions. The software modules may include a transmission module and a receiving module. Each software module may reside in a single storage device or be distributed across multiple storage devices. By way of example, a software module may be loaded into RAM from a hard drive when a triggering event occurs. During execution of the software module, the processor may load some of the instructions into cache to increase access speed. One or more cache lines may then be loaded into a general register file for execution by the processor. When referring to the functionality of a software module below, it will be understood that such functionality is implemented by the processor when executing instructions from that software module.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0188">As used herein, a phrase referring to &#x201c;at least one of&#x201d; a list of items refers to any combination of those items, including single members.
