However, when the short-circuit member <b>50</b> is connected to the second connector <b>42</b> (when the pulse signals are alternating), after both of the pressure switches <b>11</b>, <b>12</b> open and then they both close, each of the determination circuits <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> outputs safety signals only depend on the determination about the pressure switches <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>.
