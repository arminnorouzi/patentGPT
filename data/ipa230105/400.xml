More specifically, aspects of the present invention relate to reducing the error between calculated analyte levels and impractical analyte measurements using practical analyte measurements as reference measurements for calibration. Even more specifically, aspects of the present invention relate to reducing the error between calculated blood analyte levels and venous blood analyte measurements using capillary blood analyte measurements as reference measurements for calibration.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Discussion of the Background</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The prevalence of diabetes mellitus continues to increase in industrialized countries, and projections suggest that this figure will rise to 4.4% of the global population (366 million individuals) by the year 2030. Glycemic control is a key determinant of long-term outcomes in patients with diabetes, and poor glycemic control is associated with retinopathy, nephropathy and an increased risk of myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, and peripheral vascular disease requiring limb amputation. Despite the development of new insulins and other classes of antidiabetic therapy, roughly half of all patients with diabetes do not achieve recommended target hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels&#x3c;7.0%.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is necessary to achieve tight glycemic control in patients with diabetes mellitus, particularly for those requiring insulin therapy. However, current blood (finger-stick) glucose tests are burdensome, and, even in structured clinical studies, patient adherence to the recommended frequency of SMBG decreases substantially over time. Moreover, finger-stick measurements only provide information about a single point in time and do not yield information regarding intraday fluctuations in blood glucose levels that may more closely correlate with some clinical outcomes.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) have been developed in an effort to overcome the limitations of finger-stick SMBG and thereby help improve patient outcomes. These systems enable increased frequency of glucose measurements and a better characterization of dynamic glucose fluctuations, including episodes of unrealized hypoglycemia. Furthermore, integration of CGMs with automated insulin pumps allows for establishment of a closed-loop &#x201c;artificial pancreas&#x201d; system to more closely approximate physiologic insulin delivery and to improve adherence.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Monitoring real-time analyte measurements from a living body via wireless analyte monitoring sensor(s) may provide numerous health and research benefits. There is a need to enhance such analyte monitoring systems via innovations. In particular, improved calibration systems and methods are needed for more accurate analyte monitoring.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">One aspect of the invention may provide a system including an analyte sensor and a transceiver.

The analyte monitoring system <b>50</b> may be a continuous analyte monitoring system (e.g., a continuous glucose monitoring system). In some aspects, the analyte monitoring system <b>50</b> may include one or more of an analyte sensor <b>100</b>, a transceiver <b>101</b>, and a display device <b>105</b>. In some aspects, the sensor <b>100</b> may be small, fully subcutaneously implantable sensor that measures analyte (e.g., glucose) levels in a medium (e.g., interstitial fluid) of a living animal (e.g., a living human). However, this is not required, and, in some alternative aspects, the sensor <b>100</b> may be a partially implantable (e.g., transcutaneous) sensor or a fully external sensor. In some aspects, the transceiver <b>101</b> may be an externally worn transceiver (e.g., attached via an armband, wristband, waistband, or adhesive patch). In some aspects, the transceiver <b>101</b> may remotely power and/or communicate with the sensor to initiate and receive the measurements (e.g., via near field communication (NFC)). However, this is not required, and, in some alternative aspects, the transceiver <b>101</b> may power and/or communicate with the sensor <b>100</b> via one or more wired connections. In some aspects, the transceiver <b>101</b> may be a smartphone (e.g., an NFC-enabled smartphone). In some aspects, the transceiver <b>101</b> may communicate information (e.g., one or more analyte levels) wirelessly (e.g., via a Bluetooth&#x2122; communication standard such as, for example and without limitation Bluetooth Low Energy) to a hand held application running on a display device <b>105</b> (e.g., smartphone). In some aspects, the analyte monitoring system <b>50</b> may include a web interface for plotting and sharing of uploaded data.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In some aspects, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the transceiver <b>101</b> may include an inductor <b>103</b>, such as, for example, a coil.

In some aspects, the sensor <b>100</b> may include a light source <b>108</b> that emits excitation light <b>329</b> over a range of wavelengths that interact with the indicator molecules <b>104</b>. The sensor <b>100</b> may also include one or more photodetectors <b>224</b>, <b>226</b> (e.g., photodiodes, phototransistors, photoresistors, or other photosensitive elements).
