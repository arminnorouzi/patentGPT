The existing detection tool has already been applied on the Fab, with its various performances and yield meeting the process requirements. The newly-installed detection tool to be checked is a device the check for which is required, and their acceptability needs to be determined. As a result, this detection tool has not yet been put into production.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The semiconductor manufacturing processes are oxidation, deposition, photoetching, diffusion, epitaxy, masking, implantation, sputtering and other such semiconductor manufacturing processes.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The parameters of the existing detection tool and the newly-installed detection tool to be checked for detection include a first type (i.e., data obtained from a first test item) and a second type (i.e., data obtained from a second test item). The first type refers to electrical parameter detection when the detection current is alternating current (AC), while the second type refers to electrical parameter detection when the detection current is direct current (DC). Under the first and second types, there are several corresponding test items, with each test item having several specific detection data corresponding thereto. In this embodiment, the existing detection tool and the newly-installed detection tool to be checked are detection tools with the same functions.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">S<b>21</b> is executed: providing a plurality of wafers.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The wafers are those that need to be detected after the corresponding semiconductor manufacturing process is performed on a particular semiconductor process device. The semiconductor process device is a photoetching device (for photolithography), a furnace tube device (for oxidation or annealing process), a deposition device (for deposition process), a sputtering device (for sputtering process), a chemical mechanical polishing device (for chemical mechanical polishing process), an ion implantation device (for implantation process) or other semiconductor process devices.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">According to researches, multiple detection tools of certain types can obtain detection data with a higher precision when detecting the same wafer (for example, two detection tools having the same functions can obtain detection data by detecting the same wafer to be detected), whereas multiple detection tools of some other types obtain detection data with a lower precision when detecting the same wafer (the detection procedure will cause damage to a structure to be detected which is formed on the wafer). To improve the detection precision, multiple detection tools are required to detect different wafers.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Thus, in an embodiment, to realize a better accuracy of the results obtained from the acceptability check method for detection tools according to the present application, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, S<b>20</b>M needs to be executed prior to S<b>21</b>: determining whether the detection tool to be checked and existing detection tool can repeatedly detect a same wafer, if &#x201c;yes&#x201d;, executing S<b>21</b><i>a: </i>providing a plurality of wafers, which are wafers to be repeatedly detectable, and if &#x201c;no&#x201d;, executing S<b>21</b><i>b: </i>providing a plurality of wafers, which are wafers to be unrepeatably detectable. As a consequence, it can be precisely determined whether the newly-installed detection tools to be checked of different types are acceptable, during the subsequent acceptability check procedure for the detection tools to be checked.
