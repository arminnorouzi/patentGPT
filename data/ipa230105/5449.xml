Accordingly, it should be understood that these statements are to be read in this light, and not as admissions of prior art.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Electronic displays may use one or more emissive elements (e.g., LEDs) to provide backlighting to display images on the electronic display. In embodiments where more than a single backlight emissive element is used, the response of the one or more emissive elements may have different strengths of emissivity. In other words, sending a signal to uniformly backlight at least a portion of the display may appear differently due to different strengths of emissivity of different backlight emissive elements of the display. These different strengths of the emissivity of the different emissive elements may be attributable to manufacturing process differences, different emissive element batches, differences in the different lines of transmission between a power supply and the respective emissive elements, and/or other differences in driving circuitry, the emissive elements, and/or the connections therebetween that may cause the different emissive elements to display different brightness levels. These differing brightness levels may cause artifacts to be visible on the display during operation of the display.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Various aspects of this disclosure may be better understood upon reading the following detailed description and upon reference to the drawings in which:</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram of an electronic device with a display having emissive elements, where the electronic device includes backlight reconstruction and compensation (BRC) unit to reconstruct and compensate differences in strengths of emissive elements, in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is one example of the electronic device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is another example of the electronic device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is another example of the electronic device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is another example of the electronic device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a flow diagram of a process for driving a display using backlight reconstruction, in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a block diagram of pixel contrast control (PCC) circuitry including the BRC unit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a graph of overlapping and non-overlapping portions of a display that may be used by the PCC circuitry of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a graph of a backlight array with emissive elements and grid locations interspersed between the emissive elements and used to reconstruct the backlight, in accordance with an embodiment; and</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a block diagram of the BRC unit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in accordance with an embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">One or more specific embodiments of the present disclosure will be described below. These described embodiments are only examples of the presently disclosed techniques. Additionally, in an effort to provide a concise description of these embodiments, all features of an actual implementation may not be described in the specification. It should be appreciated that in the development of any such actual implementation, as in any engineering or design project, numerous implementation-specific decisions must be made to achieve the developers' specific goals, such as compliance with system-related and business-related constraints, which may vary from one implementation to another. Moreover, it should be appreciated that such a development effort might be complex and time consuming, but may nevertheless be a routine undertaking of design, fabrication, and manufacture for those of ordinary skill having the benefit of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">When introducing elements of various embodiments of the present disclosure, the articles &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; are intended to mean that there are one or more of the elements. The terms &#x201c;including&#x201d; and &#x201c;having&#x201d; are intended to be inclusive and mean that there may be additional elements other than the listed elements. Additionally, it should be understood that references to &#x201c;one embodiment,&#x201d; &#x201c;an embodiment,&#x201d; &#x201c;embodiments,&#x201d; and &#x201c;some embodiments&#x201d; of the present disclosure are not intended to be interpreted as excluding the existence of additional embodiments that also incorporate the recited features.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">An electronic display may utilize multiple emissive elements (e.g., LEDs) in an array (e.g., a two-dimensional array) to provide backlighting to the display in localized backlighting zones. Due to properties of the various emissive elements and/or other local backlighting differences between different backlighting zones, the backlight emissive elements may have differing strengths (e.g., point spread functions, referred to herein as PSFs) that may produce display artifacts. A point spread function may be used to model how light spreads and/or is distributed in space from some or from all backlight emissive elements. In some embodiments, the PSF for each backlight emissive element may be uniquely determined/modeled for a specific emissive element. As discussed in detail below, to address such issues, backlight reconstruction may be employed to determine the brightness and/or color at each pixel value based on the PSFs of the emissive elements and estimated brightness levels. Using the backlight reconstruction, the pixel values may be modified to account for the brightness and/or color of the backlight at each pixel position.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">As will be described in more detail below, an electronic device <b>10</b> that uses such backlight reconstruction and compensation, such as the electronic device <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, may be any suitable electronic device, such as a computer, a mobile phone, a portable media device, a wearable device, a tablet, a television, a virtual-reality headset, and the like. Thus, it should be noted that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is merely an example of a particular implementation and is intended to illustrate the types of components that may be present in the electronic device <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the depicted embodiment, the electronic device <b>10</b> includes the electronic display <b>12</b>, one or more input devices <b>14</b>, one or more input/output (I/O) ports <b>16</b>, a processor core complex <b>18</b> having one or more processor(s) or processor cores, local memory <b>20</b>, a main memory storage device <b>22</b>, a network interface <b>24</b>, a power source <b>25</b>, and a backlight reconstruction and compensation (BRC) unit <b>26</b>. The various components described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> may include hardware elements (e.g., circuitry), software elements (e.g., a tangible, non-transitory computer-readable medium storing instructions), or a combination of both hardware and software elements. For example, the BRC unit <b>26</b> may be implemented as dedicated circuitry and/or instructions stored in the main memory storage device <b>22</b> that are executed using the processor core complex <b>18</b>. Moreover, while the BRC unit <b>26</b> is referred to here as a &#x201c;unit,&#x201d; this is meant to describe one example form that backlight reconstruction and compensation may take in an electronic device. Indeed, it may be unitary or modular in some cases, but may represent separate, non-unitary components implemented by separate components of the electronic device <b>10</b> in other cases. To provide one non-limiting example, backlight reconstruction may be independent of compensation (e.g., backlight reconstruction may be performed using software running on the processor core complex <b>18</b> while compensation may be performed by image processing circuitry in display pipeline). It should also be noted that the various depicted components may be combined into fewer components or separated into additional components. For example, the local memory <b>20</b> and the main memory storage device <b>22</b> may be included in a single component.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The processor core complex <b>18</b> may execute instruction stored in local memory <b>20</b> and/or the main memory storage device <b>22</b> to perform operations, such as generating and/or transmitting image data. As such, the processor core complex <b>18</b> may include one or more processors, such as one or more microprocessors, one or more application specific processors (ASICs), one or more field programmable logic arrays (FPGAs), one or more graphics processing units (GPUs), or the like. Furthermore, as previously noted, the processor core complex <b>18</b> may include one or more separate processing logical cores that each process data according to executable instructions.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The local memory <b>20</b> and/or the main memory storage device <b>22</b> may store the executable instructions as well as the data to be processed by the cores of the processor core complex <b>18</b>. Thus, the local memory <b>20</b> and/or the main memory storage device <b>22</b> may include one or more tangible, non-transitory, computer-readable media. For example, the local memory <b>20</b> and/or the main memory storage device <b>22</b> may include random access memory (RAM), read only memory (ROM), rewritable non-volatile memory such as flash memory, hard drives, optical discs, and the like.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The network interface <b>24</b> may facilitate communicating data with other electronic devices via network connections. For example, the network interface <b>24</b> (e.g., a radio frequency system) may enable the electronic device <b>10</b> to communicatively couple to a personal area network (PAN), such as a Bluetooth network, a local area network (LAN), such as an 802.11x Wi-Fi network, and/or a wide area network (WAN), such as a 4G, LTE, or 5G cellular network. The network interface <b>24</b> includes one or more antennas configured to communicate over network(s) connected to the electronic device <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The power source <b>25</b> may include any suitable source of energy, such as a rechargeable lithium polymer (Li-poly) battery and/or an alternating current (AC) power converter.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The I/O ports <b>16</b> may enable the electronic device <b>10</b> to receive input data and/or output data using port connections. For example, a portable storage device may be connected to an I/O port <b>16</b> (e.g., Universal Serial Bus (USB)), thereby enabling the processor core complex <b>18</b> to communicate data with the portable storage device. The I/O ports <b>16</b> may include one or more speakers that output audio from the electronic device <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The input devices <b>14</b> may facilitate user interaction with the electronic device <b>10</b> by receiving user inputs. For example, the input devices <b>14</b> may include one or more buttons, keyboards, mice, trackpads, and/or the like. The input devices <b>14</b> may also include one or more microphones that may be used to capture audio.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The input devices <b>14</b> may include touch-sensing components in the electronic display <b>12</b>. In such embodiments, the touch sensing components may receive user inputs by detecting occurrence and/or position of an object touching the surface of the electronic display <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The electronic display <b>12</b> may include a display panel with one or more display pixels. The electronic display <b>12</b> may control light emission from the display pixels to present visual representations of information, such as a graphical user interface (GUI) of an operating system, an application interface, a still image, or video content, by display image frames based at least in part on corresponding image data. In some embodiments, the electronic display <b>12</b> may be a display using liquid crystal display (LCD), a self-emissive display, such as an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display, or the like.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The BRC unit <b>26</b> may be used to reconstruct a backlight for the electronic display <b>12</b> using PSFs of emissive elements of the electronic display <b>12</b>. The backlight reconstruction is used to determine the brightness and/or color of the backlight at each pixel value based on the PSFs and estimated brightnesses. Using the determined brightnesses and/or colors, the BRC unit <b>26</b> is used to compensate for the different brightnesses and/or colors of the emissive elements backlighting specific pixel locations. For example, the BRC unit <b>26</b> may modify the image values for the respective pixel locations inverse to any color and/or brightness fluctuations of the local backlights at the pixel locations.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As described above, the electronic device <b>10</b> may be any suitable electronic device. To help illustrate, one example of a suitable electronic device <b>10</b>, specifically a handheld device <b>10</b>A, is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. In some embodiments, the handheld device <b>10</b>A may be a portable phone, a media player, a personal data organizer, a handheld game platform, and/or the like. For example, the handheld device <b>10</b>A may be a smart phone, such as any IPHONE&#xae; model available from Apple Inc.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The handheld device <b>10</b>A includes an enclosure <b>28</b> (e.g., housing). The enclosure <b>28</b> may protect interior components from physical damage and/or shield them from electromagnetic interference. In the depicted embodiment, the electronic display <b>12</b> is displaying a graphical user interface (GUI) <b>30</b> having an array of icons <b>32</b>. By way of example, when an icon <b>32</b> is selected either by an input device <b>14</b> or a touch-sensing component of the electronic display <b>12</b>, a corresponding application may launch.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The input devices <b>14</b> may extend through the enclosure <b>28</b>. As previously described, the input devices <b>14</b> may enable a user to interact with the handheld device <b>10</b>A. For example, the input devices <b>14</b> may enable the user to record audio, to activate or deactivate the handheld device <b>10</b>A, to navigate a user interface to a home screen, to navigate a user interface to a user-configurable application screen, to activate a voice-recognition feature, to provide volume control, and/or to toggle between vibrate and ring modes. The I/O ports <b>16</b> may also extend through the enclosure <b>28</b>. In some embodiments, the I/O ports <b>16</b> may include an audio jack to connect to external devices. As previously noted, the I/O ports <b>16</b> may include one or more speakers that output sounds from the handheld device <b>10</b>A.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Another example of a suitable electronic device <b>10</b> is a tablet device <b>10</b>B shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.

The strengths may pertain to an overall brightness of the individual emissive elements and/or may refer to brightnesses at different wavelengths (e.g., different colors) of the emissive elements. The strengths of the pixels may be indicated using a point spread function (PSF) that provides different brightnesses and/or colors for different pixel values for one or more emissive elements of the display. Using the strengths, the BRC unit <b>26</b> reconstructs the backlight for the electronic display <b>12</b> (block <b>104</b>). For instance, the BRC unit <b>26</b> may determine a brightness and/or color for one or more pixels of the electronic display <b>12</b>. For instance, the BRC unit <b>26</b> may determine what the backlight looks like at a point (e.g., a pixel) of the electronic display <b>12</b>. The reconstruction may include defining two or more overlapped zones and/or non-overlapped zones of pixels to determine the brightnesses and/or color. The overlapped zones may be defined as extensions of the non-overlapped zones. Using the determined brightness and/or color, the BRC unit <b>26</b> compensates for the backlight variance based at least in part on the strengths (block <b>106</b>). For instance, the image data values (e.g., in a linear or gamma domain) of respective pixels may be compensated. In addition to or alternative to modifying image data values, the BRC unit <b>26</b> may cause the backlight driving to be compensated to increase uniformity.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a block diagram of pixel contrast control (PCC) circuitry <b>110</b> that includes the BRC unit <b>26</b>. The BRC unit <b>26</b> receives emissive element strengths <b>112</b> and image data <b>113</b>. As illustrated, the BRC unit <b>26</b> includes a backlight reconstruction component <b>114</b> and a backlight compensation component <b>116</b>. The BRC unit <b>26</b> also receives brightness estimations <b>118</b> from brightness estimation circuitry <b>120</b>. Brightness estimation is used to estimate the brightness of individual addressable backlight zones based on pixel values of the content to enhance contrast while preserving detail and reducing (e.g., minimizing) halo and flicker and to generate compensated image data <b>122</b> that compensates for backlight brightnesses and/or colors. Statistics circuitry <b>124</b> generates statistics including local statistics based on overlapped zones of the electronic display <b>12</b>, local statistics based on non-overlapped zones of the electronic display <b>12</b>, and/or global statistics. An emissive element processor <b>126</b> uses the statistics to compute brightnesses for the individually addressable backlight zones based on the pixel values of the content. The local statistics may be particularly useful in displays with local dimming while global statistics may be applicable to displays with global backlight and to displays with local dimming. The statistics calculated in the statistics circuitry <b>124</b> may include brightness maximums, brightness minimums, brightness averages, en-gamma/de-gamma information, uniformity statistics, and/or other information.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a graph of portions <b>130</b> and <b>131</b> of the electronic display <b>12</b>. In the portions <b>130</b> and <b>131</b>, non-overlapped zones <b>132</b> (individually referred to as non-overlapped zones <b>132</b>A, <b>132</b>B, <b>132</b>C, <b>132</b>D, <b>132</b>E, <b>132</b>F, <b>132</b>G, and <b>132</b>H). The portions <b>130</b> and <b>131</b> also includes include overlapped zones <b>134</b> (individually referred to as <b>134</b>A and <b>134</b>B). At edges of an active area of the electronic display <b>12</b>, the overlapped zones <b>134</b> start at an edge of a respective non-overlapping zone <b>132</b> and extends beyond the borders of the non-overlapping zone <b>132</b>. As illustrated, the overlapped zone <b>134</b>A includes a significant portion (e.g., all) of the non-overlapped zone <b>132</b>A and a vertical overlap <b>136</b> that extends into portions of the non-overlapped zones <b>132</b>B and <b>132</b>D.

The brightness estimations <b>118</b> are computed from the gathered statistics from the statistics circuitry <b>124</b> for emissive elements in a two-dimensional array of the emissive elements.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The emissive element processor <b>126</b> also utilizes a two-dimensional convolution filter <b>148</b>. The two-dimensional convolution filter <b>148</b> applies any suitable filter that may provide filtering in two dimensions. In one example, the two-dimensional convolution filter <b>148</b> includes a two-dimensional FIR filter on elements of data sets sent over from the emissive element processor <b>126</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The emissive element processor <b>126</b> may also utilize a two-dimensional bilateral filter <b>150</b>. The two-dimensional bilateral filter <b>150</b> applies a bilateral filter to values of a number (e.g., 7) of emissive elements and takes a weighted average of the number of emissive element values. The weighting in the two-dimensional bilateral filter <b>150</b> may be based on distance of the emissive elements from a reference point and/or intensity of the values of the respective emissive elements. In some embodiments, the weighting average may be based on long division. However, since the range of expected values is limited, an approximation of the results may be made from one or more data sets. If the initial approximation is sufficiently precise, the bilateral filtration process proceeds. If additional precision is to be used, a number (e.g., 1) of Newton-Raphson update steps may be used to converge from the initial approximation to the desired precision.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The emissive element processor <b>126</b> may also utilize a temporal filter <b>152</b> that is used to temporally filter data from the emissive element processor <b>126</b>. For instance, when the temporal filter <b>152</b> is activated, it may function as an infinite impulse response (IIR) filter. The temporal filter <b>152</b> may be configured in a global filtering mode that causes the temporal filter to function as a classic IIR filter with asymmetric gains to allow for different transition speeds for dark-to-bright transitions and bright-to-dark transitions. When configured in a local filtering mode, for each emissive element, a local parameter is computed based on previous local parameters and emissive element differences.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">A copy engine <b>154</b> may be used to write the brightness estimations <b>118</b> to the backlight reconstruction component <b>114</b>. The copy engine <b>154</b> copies the elements of the input data set to multiple output locations with optional processing for each output. For instance, the optional processing may include enabling/disabling scaling using a scale factor, a minimum limit for a brightness threshold, scaling based on system level brightness settings, and/or other processing of the brightness estimations <b>118</b> from the emissive element processor <b>126</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">A power function <b>156</b> may utilize hardware and/or software to adjust the brightness estimations based on power/power settings for the electronic device <b>10</b>. A division function <b>158</b> may utilize hardware and/or software to perform division. For example, the division function <b>158</b> may include a hardware accelerator that utilizes a polynomial approximation of the division where the polynomial used to approximate the division is based on the input range of the value being divided. When an additional precision is to be used for the long division, the polynomial approximation may converge to the point of precision using a Newton-Raphson update step.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Backlight reconstruction may utilize a backlight grid. The backlight grid includes a grid of the emissive elements and specifies a number of intermediate points in between the emissive elements. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates an example grid <b>160</b> that represents at least a portion of backlighting for the electronic display <b>12</b>. As illustrated, the grid <b>160</b> includes twelve emissive elements <b>162</b> in three rows. As illustrated, grid points <b>164</b> are dispersed between the emissive elements <b>162</b>. The distribution, location, and/or number of the grid points <b>164</b> may be set using corresponding input parameters. For instance, an offset and/or spacing parameter may be used to set how far to offset a grid point <b>164</b> from an edge of the active area of the electronic display <b>12</b>, from another grid point <b>164</b>, and/or from an emissive element <b>162</b>. Furthermore, a number of rows or columns of grid points <b>164</b> may be set using respective number parameters.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> illustrates a block diagram of an embodiment of the BRC unit <b>26</b>. As illustrated, the BRC receives emissive element strengths <b>112</b>. The emissive element strengths <b>112</b> may be received in singular value decomposition (SVD) sets <b>190</b>. Accordingly, in such embodiments, the reconstruction of the backlight may be performed by applying the strengths for one or more (e.g., each) emissive element <b>162</b> of the backlight of the electronic display <b>12</b>. The SVD sets <b>190</b> may be fetched from the local memory <b>20</b> using a direct memory access (DMA) channel. In some embodiments, the SVD sets <b>190</b> may be stored in the local memory <b>20</b> in a raster-scan order of the associated emissive elements <b>162</b> associated the emissive element strengths <b>112</b>. The number of SVD sets <b>190</b> may be controlled using a parameter set for the BRC unit <b>26</b> using an SVD number parameter.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The reconstruction of the backlight at each grid point <b>164</b> is achieved by applying the strengths for each emissive element <b>162</b> to the brightness value for the emissive element <b>162</b> using the brightness estimation discussed above. In some embodiments, only a portion of the emissive elements <b>162</b> are used to apply the strengths for backlight reconstruction. For each emissive element <b>162</b> used in the backlight reconstruction, the emissive element strengths <b>112</b> of the emissive element <b>162</b> is included in the SVD sets <b>190</b> (e.g., up to a number of sets selectable using a set parameter). In each SVD set <b>190</b> a grid point coordinate <b>192</b> is used to determine how much effect the respective emissive element has on the backlight at the grid point coordinate <b>192</b>. For instance, a horizontal weight <b>194</b> and a vertical weight <b>196</b> may be applied to the emissive element strengths <b>112</b> using one or more multipliers <b>198</b> to apply the horizontal weight <b>194</b> and the vertical weight <b>196</b>. Weighted strengths <b>204</b> from the SVD sets <b>190</b> are summed together in one or more adders <b>206</b> to form weight sum <b>208</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some embodiments, the emissive element strengths <b>112</b> may indicate a non-uniformity in color. For example, the emissive element strengths <b>112</b> may be related to color shifts in the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) 1931 XYZ color space. Based on the non-uniformity in color, chrominance (e.g., (X, Z)) compensation may be activated in the backlight reconstruction. Chrominance compensation data may be stored in the form of ratios Z/Y <b>210</b> and X/Y <b>212</b>. The weighted sum <b>208</b> is multiplied by the brightness estimations <b>118</b> in multipliers <b>214</b>, <b>216</b>, and <b>218</b>. In the multiplier <b>214</b>, the weighted sum is multiplied by the ratio Z/Y <b>219</b> in addition to the brightness estimations <b>118</b>, and in the multiplier <b>216</b>, the weighted sum <b>208</b> is multiplied by the ratio X/Y <b>212</b> in addition to the brightness estimations <b>118</b>. Summing circuitries <b>220</b>, <b>222</b>, and <b>224</b> may be used to sum the scaled weighted sums <b>208</b> for the respective paths in the backlight reconstruction component <b>114</b>. The outputs of the summing circuitries <b>220</b>, <b>222</b>, and <b>224</b> are each submitted to a XYZ-to-RGB converter <b>226</b> that is used to reconstruct the backlight into RGB when backlight color compensation is enabled. For instance, a 3&#xd7;3 transform may be used to convert the XYZ values computed at each grid point to linear RGB values. When color compensation is not enabled, in some embodiments, luminance may be solely compensated using the Y channel (through the summing circuitry <b>222</b>).</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Furthermore, when backlight color compensation is enabled, a global target color (e.g., an XY color) or a local target color (e.g., an XY color) may be calculated in a target-to-RGB converter <b>228</b>. This conversion to target color is based at least in part on the luminance in the Y channel using the Z/Y ratio <b>210</b> and the X/Y ratio <b>212</b> and with Z equaling 1-X-Y.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">When color compensation is enabled, the RGB values of the target color (global or local) and the reconstructed values are transmitted to an RGB gain calculator <b>230</b> that calculates gains for in RGB values. The RGB gains may be calculated using component-wise division followed by global scaling of the ratios. The component-wise division may be estimated using one of a number (e.g., 16) of polynomials. If additional precision is to be used, the RGB gain calculator <b>230</b> may apply one or more update steps using the Newton-Raphson method. Accordingly, the reconstructed backlight at each of the grid points <b>164</b> may be converted to RGB gain values using an interpolation engine <b>234</b> and pixel coordinates <b>232</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">As may be appreciated, the grid points <b>164</b> may be at a lower resolution than pixels of the electronic display <b>12</b> to reduce processing/storage costs for determining and/or storing information for each individual pixel. Accordingly, to accommodate compensation at the pixels with a different resolution than the emissive elements <b>162</b>, the RGB gain values for each grid point <b>164</b> may be used to interpolate for pixels between the grid points <b>164</b> based on a location of the respective pixels in relation to respective grid points <b>164</b>. For example, the interpolation may include bilinear interpolation for both vertical and horizontal directions from respective closest grid points <b>164</b>. In some embodiments, the grid points <b>164</b> may have a same resolution as the pixels of the electronic display <b>12</b> where backlight information may be determined and/or stored for each individual pixel.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some embodiments, the backlight reconstruction is to be normalized to an all-on profile <b>236</b>. The all-on profile <b>236</b> represents all emissive elements <b>162</b> being set to a same brightness. The all-on profile <b>236</b> may be conceptualized as a map of gains. This all-on profile <b>236</b> or map of gains is static and defined with the resolution of the grid points <b>164</b>. The all-on profile <b>236</b> is fetched and stored prior to a first frame being displayed following a power up of the electronic display <b>12</b>. This all-on profile <b>236</b> is combined with the weighted luminance in the Y channel using a multiplier <b>238</b>. The result of the multiplier is then interpolated in an interpolation engine <b>240</b> similar to how the output of the RGB gain calculator <b>230</b> is interpolated to the pixel resolution.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The interpolated values from the interpolation engines <b>234</b> and <b>240</b> are transmitted to the backlight compensation component <b>116</b> that includes a pixel modifier <b>242</b>. The pixel modifier <b>242</b> modifies the image data <b>113</b> to generate the compensated image data <b>122</b>. In some embodiments, the compensated image data <b>122</b> may undergo additional manipulation. For example, the compensated image data <b>122</b> may be used to cause a liquid crystal (LC) to open more fully when a backlight is lower than an expected value. Additionally or alternatively, the backlight level of one or more locations may be lowered to reduce power when one or more grid locations indicate that the blacklight level is above a target value.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Components/units discussed herein may include software implemented in the processor, LED processor, other processors/coprocessors using instructions stored in the storage device(s) <b>22</b> and/or the memory <b>20</b>.
