Thus, the following description and drawings are illustrative and are not to be construed as limiting. Numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the disclosure. However, in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order to avoid obscuring the description.

As such, end-to-end network slicing is becoming a major characteristic of the 5G system where different slices could be tailored for different applications and domains. Currently, no tool provides a unique identifier that can be used in all of the domains consistently to differentiate slices. Each domain has its domain-specific attributes, for example, Segment Routing-Traffic Engineering (SR-TE) or Virtual Private Network (VPN) for transport domain, radio frequency or radio parameters for radio access network (RAN) domain, and Single-Network Slice Selection Assistance Information (s-NSSAI) or Data Network Name (DNN) for core network domain. Also, in enterprise campus domain, security policies (e.g., Scalable Group Tag (SGT)) or different virtual networks (e.g., Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF)/Virtual Network (VN)) with reserved resources can be used to differentiate slices. Due to a complex mapping mechanism across different domains and a lack of a unique identifier to differentiate slices in various domains, it is challenging to stitch a slice(s) appropriately across various domains and realize end-to-end slicing.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Therefore, there is a need for generating a common identifier for a specific network slice that can be used for mapping domain-specific attributes and thereby stitching the domain-specific attributes based on the common identifier to stitch the specific network slice across the multiple domains. This way, end-to-end network slicing for a particular slice across multiple domains can be realized with the single common identifier.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The present technology includes systems, methods, and computer-readable media for solving these problems and discrepancies. Specifically, systems, methods, and computer-readable media for generating a common BGP attribute for a specific network slice and stitching the network slice across one or more domains based on mapping of the BGP attribute.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Overview</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Methods, systems, and non-transitory computer-readable media are provided for generating a common BGP attribute, for example, BGP-Slice ID for a specific network slice and stitching the network slice across one or more domains based on mapping of the BGP attribute.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The present technology can generate a BGP ID for a specific network slice spanning a plurality of domains, map domain-specific attributes associated with sub-slices of the specific network slice in different domains of the plurality of domains to the BGP ID, and facilitate distribution of the mapping of the domain-specific attributes to the BGP ID across the plurality of domains for stitching the sub-slices together from the domain-specific attributes based on the BGP ID to stitch the specific network slice across the plurality of domains.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The present technology can further transmit corresponding domain-specific subsets of the mapping to each of the plurality of domains and facilitate an exchange of the corresponding domain-specific subsets of the mapping between the plurality of domains in order to facilitate distribution of the mapping of the domain-specific attributes to the BGP ID across the plurality of domains.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The corresponding domain-specific subsets of the mapping can be transmitted to the plurality of domains through corresponding domain-specific templates. The corresponding domain-specific subsets of the mapping can be exchanged between the plurality of domains through BGP updates. Also, a centralized cross-domain orchestrator can transmit the corresponding domain-specific subsets of the mapping to corresponding controllers of the plurality of domains.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Furthermore, the present technology can identify that an error exists in the mapping of the domain-specific attributes and the BGP ID in one of the plurality of domains and transmit feedback informing the existence of the error in the mapping of the domain-specific attributes and the BGP ID from the one of the plurality of domains for performing one or more remedial measures.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The remedial measures can include facilitating redistribution of the mapping of the domain-specific attributes and the BGP ID to the one of the plurality of domains. The remedial measures further comprise performing a slice configuration check in the one of the plurality of domains to detect one or more slice configuration errors in the one of the plurality of domains and conducting one or more slice configuration remedial measures in the one of the plurality of domains in response to detecting the one or more slice configuration errors in the one of the plurality of domains. The slice configuration remedial measures can also include one or a combination of reverting back to a previous slice configuration in the one of the plurality of domains, re-distributing a desired slice configuration to the one of the plurality of domains, and distributing a configuration difference between a current slice configuration and the desired slice configuration to the one of the plurality of domains.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Furthermore, the domain-specific attributes can include a description of characteristics of the sub-slices. The domain-specific attributes can also include one or more parameters to identify a link between the sub-slices across the plurality of domains. The present technology can also determine, at least a portion, of a routing policy for forwarding data across the plurality of domains through one or more network slices including the specific network slice based on the mapping of the domain-specific attributes and the BGP ID.

The operator network domain <b>250</b> is in some embodiments a Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN), and can be thought of as the carrier or business entity that provides cellular service to the end users in UE domain <b>210</b>. Within the operator network domain <b>250</b>, a plurality of network slices <b>252</b> are created, defined, or otherwise provisioned in order to deliver a desired set of defined features and functionalities, e.g. SaaSs, for a certain use case or corresponding to other requirements or specifications. Note that network slicing for the plurality of network slices <b>252</b> is implemented in end-to-end fashion, spanning multiple disparate technical and administrative domains, including management and orchestration planes (not shown). In other words, network slicing is performed from at least the enterprise or subscriber edge at UE domain <b>210</b>, through the RAN <b>120</b>, through the 5G access edge and the 5G core network <b>230</b>, and to the data network <b>240</b>.

Specifically, the operator network domain <b>250</b> can implement any number of network slices for provisioning SaaSs from SaaS providers to one or more enterprises.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">5G mobile and wireless networks will provide enhanced mobile broadband communications and are intended to deliver a wider range of services and applications as compared to all prior generation mobile and wireless networks. Compared to prior generations of mobile and wireless networks, the 5G architecture is service based, meaning that wherever suitable, architecture elements are defined as network functions that offer their services to other network functions via common framework interfaces. In order to support this wide range of services and network functions across an ever-growing base of user equipment (UE), 5G networks incorporate the network slicing concept utilized in previous generation architectures.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Within the scope of the 5G mobile and wireless network architecture, a network slice comprises a set of defined features and functionalities that together form a complete Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) for providing services to UEs. This network slicing permits for the controlled composition of a PLMN with the specific network functions and provided services that are required for a specific usage scenario. In other words, network slicing enables a 5G network operator to deploy multiple, independent PLMNs where each is customized by instantiating only those features, capabilities and services required to satisfy a given subset of the UEs or a related business customer needs.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In particular, network slicing is expected to play a critical role in 5G networks because of the multitude of use cases and new services 5G is capable of supporting. Network service provisioning through network slices is typically initiated when an enterprise requests network slices when registering with AMF/MME for a 5G network. At the time of registration, the enterprise will typically ask the AMF/MME for characteristics of network slices, such as slice bandwidth, slice latency, processing power, and slice resiliency associated with the network slices. These network slice characteristics can be used in ensuring that assigned network slices are capable of actually provisioning specific services, e.g. based on requirements of the services, to the enterprise.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates an example network environment <b>300</b> for generating a common BGP attribute to stitch a network slice across multiple domains according to one or more examples of the present disclosure. The network environment <b>300</b> comprises cross-domain orchestrator <b>302</b>, enterprise domain <b>312</b>, SP transport domain <b>314</b>, and 5G core domain <b>316</b>. While the network environment <b>300</b> is shown as being formed across the enterprise domain <b>312</b>, the SP transport domain <b>314</b>, and the 5G core domain, these are merely examples of types of domains that can form the network environment <b>300</b>, and the network environment <b>300</b> can be formed by other types of network domains.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The cross-domain orchestrator can generate a common attribute for a specific network slice, e.g. enterprise slice as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. In turn, the common attribute can be used, as will be discussed in greater detail later, to stitch together the network slice across different domains. The BGP-Slice ID can be an applicable identifier that uniquely identifies a network slice and is capable of being transmitted according to an applicable exterior gateway protocol, such as BGP. For example, the BGP-Slice ID can be an address, a part of an address such as address family identifier (AFI), or a subsequent address family identifier (SAFI). More specifically, the BGP-Slice ID can be part of a new BGP address family that can be carried via BGP towards all the domains (e.g., enterprise domain <b>312</b>, SP transport domain <b>314</b>, and 5G core domain <b>316</b>). In some embodiments, when cross-domain orchestrator <b>302</b> receives a network slicing template (NEST) <b>304</b> for a specific network slice (e.g., enterprise slice as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>), cross-domain orchestrator <b>302</b> can generate a common attribute, for example, a BGP-Slice ID that can be carried via BGP.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Furthermore, the BGP-Slice ID can be used for mapping domain-specific attributes associated with sub-slices (e.g., enterprise slice <b>306</b>, transport slice <b>308</b>, and core network slice <b>310</b>) in different domains (e.g., enterprise domain <b>312</b>, SP transport domain <b>314</b>, and 5G core domain <b>316</b>). The domain-specific attributes can be a SGT for enterprise domain <b>312</b>, SR-TE for SP transport domain <b>314</b>, and s-NSSAI for 5G core domain <b>316</b>. For example, an enterprise network can implement SGT to reserve resources within the enterprise network. Similarly, a SP transport network can implement SR-TE to reserve resources on the transport network. 5G core network can implement S-NSSAI to reserve resources on the 5G core network. All of the domain-specific attributes (e.g., SGT, SR-TE, and s-NSSAI) in different domains can be mapped to the BGP-Slice ID. For example, the mapping can be written as &#x201c;BGP-SliceID: SGT: SR-TE: s-NSSAI.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In some embodiments, cross-domain orchestrator <b>302</b> can transmit corresponding domain-specific subsets of the mapping to each of the multiple domains.

Also, cross-domain orchestrator <b>302</b> can transmit a portion of the mapping related to attributes of the transport domain (e.g., SR-TE) to transport domain <b>314</b> and a portion of the mapping related to attributes of the 5G core domain (e.g., s-NSSAI) to 5G core domain <b>316</b>. For example, &#x201c;BGP-SliceID: SGT&#x201d; associated with enterprise slice <b>306</b> can be transmitted to enterprise domain <b>312</b>. Similarly, &#x201c;BGP-SliceID: SR-TE&#x201d; associated with transport slice <b>308</b> can be transmitted to SP transport domain <b>314</b> while &#x201c;BGP-SliceID: s-NSSAI&#x201d; associated with core network slice <b>310</b> can be transmitted to 5G core domain <b>316</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Furthermore, the mapping can be distributed across multiple domains (e.g., enterprise domain <b>312</b>, SP transport domain <b>314</b>, and 5G core domain <b>316</b>) so that the sub-slices (e.g., enterprise slice <b>306</b>, transport slice <b>308</b>, and core network slice <b>310</b>) can be stitched together based on the BGP-Slice ID to stitch the specific network slice included in the NEST <b>304</b> across the multiple domains. Stitching a slice across a plurality of domains, as used herein, can include associating or otherwise linking together corresponding sub-slices of the slice that exist in respective domains of the plurality of domains such that the slice can be conceptually formed across the plurality of domains. More specifically, the corresponding sub-slices can be stitched together across the plurality of domains to form the stitched slice across the plurality of domains.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In some embodiments, the mapping can capture an optional description of characteristics of the sub-slices or the mapping such as purpose or usage.

The parameter(s) can advertise a source IP address and/or next-hop IP address to determine the next-hop between adjacent domains. For example, when a network device (e.g., an edge router) in enterprise network has more than one links connected to another network device in SP transport network, a BGP-Slice ID can include a parameter identifying a link for stitching a slice to the adjacent SP transport domain. For example, the mapping can be &#x201c;BGP-Slice ID: SR-TE next-hop via IP-Address x.x.xxx.&#x201d; The parameter can identify a source IP or a local domain. For example, the mapping can be written as &#x201c;BGP-Slice ID: SGT via local interface-X&#x201d; or &#x201c;BGP-Slice ID: SR-TE: s-NSSAI next-hop via IP-Address x.x.xx.&#x201d; Based on the parameters indicating the source IP address and/or next-hop IP address, a network device can discover and form an end-to-end network slicing for a particular slice across various domains. An example of a complete mapping can be written as &#x201c;BGP-Slice ID: description&#x2014;URLLC for Remote-Surgery: SGT: SR-TE: s-NSSAI next-hop via IP-Address x.x.xx.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Furthermore, the mapping of domain-specific attributes to a BGP-Slice ID has an advantage of providing knowledge about the slice being active across different domains or local to the current domain.

Specifically, network devices can identify, based on the mapping, associated interfaces and/or services and direct the traffic with a suitable resource reservation (e.g., BGP-based EVPN/L3VPN in SP transport domain to SGT or VN mapping in enterprise domain). For example, traffic routing policies between the domain can be determined or mapped based on the identification of the mapping points, interfaces, or IP addresses in adjacent domains for the associated end-to-end slice. As such, an end-to-end slicing can be realized across multiple domains where BGP is extended.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In some embodiments, a single BGP-Slice ID can map to multiple domain-specific attributes (e.g., SGT or VN in enterprise domain).
