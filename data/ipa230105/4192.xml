Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Various embodiments disclosed in this document relate to a shielding member and an electronic device including the shielding member.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Electronic devices such as smartphones, tablet PCs, and computers are becoming multifunctional. For example, electronic devices may support various types of pen input devices. Some electronic devices may include a display module having a separate component (e.g., digitizer) for recognizing an input from a pen input device.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Meanwhile, an electromagnetic field may be generated in the pen input device and electronic components constituting the electronic device. An electromagnetic field induced into unintended parts may be a major cause of malfunction of the electronic device. A member for shielding an electromagnetic field may be disposed inside the electronic device.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A digitizer of the electronic device may refer to a device that recognizes a signal of the pen input device applied to the display panel through a resonant frequency transmitted from the pen input device.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The resonant frequency can be changed by capacitance and inductance. When the pen tip of the pen input device is pressed by the display panel, the capacitance increases, and the digitizer may recognize a signal of the pen input device by detecting a resonant frequency change due to the capacitance increase. An increase or decrease of the inductance may change the resonant frequency in the same way as an increase or decrease of the capacitance. Hence, when the inductance of the pen input device increases, the digitizer may detect a change in the resonant frequency due to the change in inductance and recognize that a pen input is present. Owing to this phenomenon, although the pen input device is floating in the air, when the inductance of the pen input device is increased, the digitizer may recognize that a pen input is present. Further, if the inductance is decreased owing to an external magnetic field or an induced current, the digitizer may fail to recognize a pen input.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The shielding member according to various embodiments disclosed in this document may reduce malfunction of the pen input device.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">An electronic device according to various embodiments disclosed in this document may include: a display panel; a recognition member disposed under the display panel and including a conductive pattern to recognize a signal from a pen input device; a first shielding member disposed under the recognition member; and a second shielding member disposed under the first shielding member and made of a material different than the first shielding member, wherein the second shielding member includes a component region corresponding to at least one electronic component disposed under the second shielding member, and wherein at least a portion of the second shielding member is removed from the component region.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">An electromagnetic field shielding member according to various embodiments disclosed in this document may include: a first shielding member disposed under a recognition member that is disposed under a display panel and includes a conductive pattern configured to recognize a signal from a pen input device; and a second shielding member disposed under the first shielding member and made of a material different than the first shielding member, wherein the second shielding member includes a component region corresponding to at least one electronic component disposed under the second shielding member and is electrically connected to a printed circuit board, and wherein at least a portion of the second shielding member is removed from the component region.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to various embodiments disclosed in this document, a structure for reducing a current induced in the electronic device by a magnetic field generated from the pen input device may be presented. As the current induced in the electronic device decreases, a phenomenon of decreasing inductance of the pen input device can be alleviated, and thus malfunction of the pen input device can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Before undertaking the detailed description below, it may be advantageous to set forth definitions of certain words and phrases used throughout this patent document: the terms &#x201c;include&#x201d; and &#x201c;comprise,&#x201d; as well as derivatives thereof, mean inclusion without limitation; the term &#x201c;or,&#x201d; is inclusive, meaning and/or; the phrases &#x201c;associated with&#x201d; and &#x201c;associated therewith,&#x201d; as well as derivatives thereof, may mean to include, be included within, interconnect with, contain, be contained within, connect to or with, couple to or with, be communicable with, cooperate with, interleave, juxtapose, be proximate to, be bound to or with, have, have a property of, or the like; and the term &#x201c;controller&#x201d; means any device, system or part thereof that controls at least one operation, such a device may be implemented in hardware, firmware or software, or some combination of at least two of the same.

The induced current generated in the second shielding member <b>504</b> may reduce the inductance of the coil <b>323</b> embedded in the pen input device <b>201</b>. As the inductance of the coil <b>323</b> decreases, the electronic device <b>200</b> may experience a malfunction such as failing to recognize a pen input. An embodiment disclosed in this document may present a structure in which a portion of the second shielding member <b>504</b> is removed in order to improve the phenomenon where the inductance of the coil <b>323</b> embedded in the pen input device <b>201</b> decreases due to an increase in the induced current of the second shielding member <b>504</b>. This will be described in detail below.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">According to various embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref>, the second shielding member <b>504</b> may be disposed between the first shielding member <b>503</b> and the electronic component <b>506</b> of the electronic device <b>200</b>.

Here, the component region <b>505</b> may mean a region of the second shielding member <b>504</b> facing the electronic component <b>506</b> of the electronic device <b>200</b>. Further, the component region <b>505</b> may correspond to the region of the first shielding member <b>503</b> where the magnetic permeability decreases and may be a region in which generation of an induced current by the pen input device <b>201</b> increases.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">In various embodiments disclosed in this document, a portion of the second shielding member <b>504</b> may be removed from the component region <b>505</b> of the second shielding member <b>504</b>. As described above, the generation of an induced current may increase in a region of the second shielding member <b>504</b> corresponding to the region of the first shielding member <b>503</b> where the magnetic permeability decreases. To remove the region where the generation of an induced current increases, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>, a region corresponding to the region of the first shielding member <b>503</b> where the magnetic permeability is lowered by the magnetic material <b>507</b> of the electronic component <b>506</b>, or a region including the region of the first shielding member <b>503</b> where the magnetic permeability is lowered may be removed from the component region <b>505</b> of the second shielding member <b>504</b>. Hence, generation of an induced current generated in the second shielding member <b>504</b> by the magnetic field formed by the coil <b>323</b> of the pen input device <b>201</b> can be reduced.
