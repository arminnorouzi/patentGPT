201911187714.7 filed on Nov. 28, 2019, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF TECHNOLOGY</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention belongs to the technical field of medicine, relates to a crystal form of quinolinone compound and use thereof, in particular relates to a crystal form of 2-(4-hydroxy-1-methyl-2-oxo-7-phenoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxamido)acetic acid and use thereof, and further relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising the crystal form.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the case of anemia, trauma, tissue necrosis and defect, tissue or cells are often in a state of hypoxia. Hypoxia leads to the expression of a series of transcription-inducing factors involved in angiogenesis, iron, glucose metabolism, and cell growth and proliferation. Among them, hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) is a transcription factor initiated by somatic cells when oxygen is reduced, and is widely distributed in various parts of the body, especially in the intima of blood vessels, heart, brain, kidney, liver, etc. HIF is a heterodimer containing an oxygen-regulated &#x3b1;-subunit (HIF &#x3b1;) and a constitutively expressed &#x3b2;-subunit (HIF (3/ARNT). In oxygenated (normoxic) cells, the HIF &#x3b1; subunit is rapidly degraded by the mechanism of ubiquitination by the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (pVHL) E3 ligase complex. Under hypoxic conditions, HIF &#x3b1; is not degraded, and active HIF &#x3b1;/&#x3b2; complexes accumulate in the nucleus and activate the expression of various genes, including glycolytic enzymes, glucose transporters, erythropoietin (EPO) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Erythropoietin (EPO) is a naturally occurring hormone produced with HIF a, and it stimulates the production of red blood cells (erythrocytes) which carry oxygen throughout the body. EPO is normally secreted by the kidneys, and endogenous EPO increases under conditions of reduced oxygen (hypoxia). All types of anemia are characterized by a reduction in the blood's ability to carry oxygen and thus accompanied by similar signs and symptoms, including pale skin and mucous membranes, weakness, dizziness, easy fatigue, and lethargy, resulting in a reduced quality of life. Anemia is usually associated with a lack of red blood cells or hemoglobin in the blood. The common causes of anemia include the lack of iron, vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, and folic acid, and can also be complicated by chronic diseases, such as inflammatory diseases, including the diseases with secondary myeloinflammatory suppression. Anemia is also associated with kidney dysfunction, and most patients with kidney failure on regular dialysis suffer from chronic anemia.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) is a key factor in the regulation of HIF. Under normoxic conditions, PHD can hydroxylate the two key proline residues Pro402 and Pro564 of HIF a, and increase its affinity with pVHL and accelerate the degradation process. Under hypoxic and other pathological conditions, the HIF reaction catalyzed by PHD is blocked and the degradation rate of protease is slowed down, resulting in the accumulation of HIF a in cells, thereby causing a series of adaptive responses of cells to hypoxia. Inhibiting PHD by PHD inhibitors prolongs the effect of HIF, thereby increasing the expression of genes such as EPO, which can effectively treat and prevent HIF-related and/or EPO-related diseases, such as anemia, ischemia and hypoxia.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">International application WO 2016034108 A1 discloses the compound 2-(4-hydroxy-1-methyl-2-oxo-7-phenoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxamido)acetic acid (compound of formula (I)), which can treat or reduce HIF-related and/or EPO-related diseases, such as anemia.
