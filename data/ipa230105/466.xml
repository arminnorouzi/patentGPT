More specifically, this application relates to contrast enhanced ultrasound for vascular imaging.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In contrast-enhanced imaging, a contrast agent is provided to an area or volume to be imaged in order to provide a higher signal strength from the area or volume, or selectively enhance signals from areas or volumes with high contrast concentration. For example, in contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), microbubbles may be injected into a subject's bloodstream and ultrasound images may be acquired of the subject's vasculature. Without the microbubbles, little to no signal may be provided by the blood vessels. In contrast accumulation imaging (CAI), multiple contrast-enhanced images (e.g., multiple image frames) are acquired and combined and/or normalized to form the final image, which can be used to map contrast agent progression and enhance vessel topology and conspicuity. Temporal accumulation imaging of CEUS has been commercialized and widely used for vascular visualization. However, CEUS has limited spatial resolution due to the large size of the point spread function (PSF) in contrast mode. The PSF is a measure of blurring or spreading of a point source by an imaging system. CEUS may also have strong residual clutter artifacts as well as vulnerability to patient induced motion due to the combining of multiple image frames to form the final image.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Super-resolution imaging (SRI) is a CEUS technique that makes it potentially possible for improved diagnosis of vascular diseases and cancer malignancy by providing morphological microvascular images as well as functional microcirculation maps in depth with detail not previously possible using conventional approaches. In a common SRI technique, each super-resolved image is obtained by two steps: (1) localizing the center of each separable microbubble in an image and then (2) accumulating these centers over thousands of images. The position of each microbubble is obtained by taking the local maxima of each microbubble intensity profile. This means that the center of each microbubble can be seen and represented as a single-pixel dot. The accumulation of the center positions of microbubbles is the probability density mapping of microbubbles, which is the super-resolved image of the microvasculature.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, the timescale of acquisition is challenging when imaging a large region or a pathology where the bubble inflow dynamics are especially important (e.g. visualizing rapid wash-in). SRI typically requires tens or hundreds of thousands of individual contrast imaging frames, corresponding to a combination of very high imaging frame rates (often &#x3e;500 Hz) and very long acquisition times (e.g., several minutes) compared to conventional contrast ultrasound scans.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Systems and methods for a multi-level resolution vascular imaging approach is disclosed.

exemplary examples is merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the disclosure or its applications or uses. In the following detailed description of examples of the present systems and methods, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which are shown by way of illustration specific examples in which the described systems and methods may be practiced. These examples are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the presently disclosed systems and methods, and it is to be understood that other examples may be utilized and that structural and logical changes may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present disclosure. Moreover, for the purpose of clarity, detailed descriptions of certain features will not be discussed when they would be apparent to those with skill in the art so as not to obscure the description of the present disclosure. The following detailed description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present systems and methods is defined only by the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">As one of the major complications of diabetes, chronic kidney disease leads to significant changes of renal microvasculature and perfusion in the early stage. While contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is sensitive to changes in microvascular perfusion, early changes in microstructures and microcirculations are hard to image with conventional ultrasound due to poor spatial resolution. This also applies for early detection of chronic peripheral vascular diseases as well as early diagnosis of malignant tumors.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">CEUS has been employed clinically for imaging organ/tumor vascularity as well as assessing tissue perfusion. However, its inherently low spatial resolution prevents CEUS from adapting its spatial resolution properly for different clinical needs. Owing to the lack of vascular clarity in small vessels and capillaries in conventional CEUS, super-resolution imaging (SRI) has been developed in recent years to improve the spatial resolution of ultrasound imaging by localizing contrast microbubbles flowing in microvasculature. However, as discussed previously, SRI inherently has both little motion tolerance and low temporal resolution due to its two fundamental requirements of precise microbubble localization and long frame accumulation.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Although SRI can image very fine structures and provide functional information down to the capillary level, it may be impractical to construct and display a super-resolution image of a large region (such as a large portion of an entire organ, or a tumor). In addition, it may be ineffective to utilize SRI to image and display large vessels since already existing conventional high temporal resolution imaging modalities are adequate for large vessels. Consequently, a multi-level contrast imaging approach as disclosed herein may provide more effective and/or optimal views of various levels of a particular vasculature. A multimodal ultrasound vascular imaging system according to principles of the present disclosure may be capable of providing high temporal resolution for large vessel (e.g., CEUS) and high spatial resolution for microvascular imaging (e.g., SRI).</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The present disclosure is directed to systems and methods for multi-level vascular imaging for construction and display of vasculature from large to small vessels and micro-vessels using a combination of varying resolution CEUS flow imaging modalities. While one or more resolution flow imaging modes may be employed for imaging large to small vessels of a vascular tree within a large region of interest (ROI), a SRI mode is constructed for delineation of the microvascular morphology and directional microcirculation within one or more small ROIs placed in selected locations within a larger ROI. Examples of flow imaging modes include, but are not limited to CEUS, color Doppler, color power angiography (CPA), microflow imaging (MFI), CEUS-MFI, microvascular imaging (MVI), and high definition MVI (HD-MVI). In general, different vascular levels can be imaged with different modes for large vessels to small vessels to capillaries.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a block diagram of an ultrasound imaging system <b>100</b> constructed in accordance with the principles of the present disclosure. An ultrasound imaging system <b>100</b> according to the present disclosure may include a transducer array <b>114</b>, which may be included in an ultrasound probe <b>112</b>, for example an external probe or an internal probe such as an intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) catheter probe. In other examples, the transducer array <b>114</b> may be in the form of a flexible array configured to be conformally applied to a surface of subject to be imaged (e.g., patient). The transducer array <b>114</b> is configured to transmit ultrasound signals (e.g., beams, waves) and receive echoes (e.g., received ultrasound signals) responsive to the transmitted ultrasound signals. A variety of transducer arrays may be used, e.g., linear arrays, curved arrays, or phased arrays. The transducer array <b>114</b>, for example, can include a two dimensional array (as shown) of transducer elements capable of scanning in both elevation and azimuth dimensions for 2D and/or 3D imaging. As is generally known, the axial direction is the direction normal to the face of the array (in the case of a curved array the axial directions fan out), the azimuthal direction is defined generally by the longitudinal dimension of the array, and the elevation direction is transverse to the azimuthal direction.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some examples, the transducer array <b>114</b> may be coupled to a microbeamformer <b>116</b>, which may be located in the ultrasound probe <b>112</b>, and which may control the transmission and reception of signals by the transducer elements in the array <b>114</b>. In some examples, the microbeamformer <b>116</b> may control the transmission and reception of signals by active elements in the array <b>114</b> (e.g., an active subset of elements of the array that define the active aperture at any given time).</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some examples, the microbeamformer <b>116</b> may be coupled, e.g., by a probe cable or wirelessly, to a transmit/receive (T/R) switch <b>118</b>, which switches between transmission and reception and protects the main beamformer <b>122</b> from high energy transmit signals. In some examples, for example in portable ultrasound systems, the T/R switch <b>118</b> and other elements in the system can be included in the ultrasound probe <b>112</b> rather than in the ultrasound system base, which may house the image processing electronics. An ultrasound system base typically includes software and hardware components including circuitry for signal processing and image data generation as well as executable instructions for providing a user interface.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The transmission of ultrasonic signals from the transducer array <b>114</b> under control of the microbeamformer <b>116</b> is directed by the transmit controller <b>120</b>, which may be coupled to the T/R switch <b>118</b> and a main beamformer <b>122</b>. The transmit controller <b>120</b> may control the direction in which beams are steered. Beams may be steered straight ahead from (orthogonal to) the transducer array <b>114</b>, or at different angles for a wider field of view. The transmit controller <b>120</b> may also be coupled to a user interface <b>124</b> and receive input from the user's operation of a user control. The user interface <b>124</b> may include one or more input devices such as a control panel <b>152</b>, which may include one or more mechanical controls (e.g., buttons, encoders, etc.), touch sensitive controls (e.g., a trackpad, a touchscreen, or the like), and/or other known input devices.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some examples, the partially beamformed signals produced by the microbeamformer <b>116</b> may be coupled to a main beamformer <b>122</b> where partially beamformed signals from individual patches of transducer elements may be combined into a fully beamformed signal. In some examples, microbeamformer <b>116</b> is omitted, and the transducer array <b>114</b> is under the control of the beamformer <b>122</b> and beamformer <b>122</b> performs all beamforming of signals. In examples with and without the microbeamformer <b>116</b>, the beamformed signals of beamformer <b>122</b> are coupled to processing circuitry <b>150</b>, which may include one or more processors (e.g., a signal processor <b>126</b>, a B-mode processor <b>128</b>, a Doppler processor <b>160</b>, and one or more image generation and processing components <b>168</b>) configured to produce an ultrasound image from the beamformed signals (i.e., beamformed RF data).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The signal processor <b>126</b> may be configured to process the received beamformed RF data in various ways, such as bandpass filtering, decimation, I and Q component separation, and harmonic signal separation. The signal processor <b>126</b> may also perform additional signal enhancement such as speckle reduction, signal compounding, and electronic noise elimination. The processed signals (also referred to as I and Q components or IQ signals) may be coupled to additional downstream signal processing circuits for image generation. The IQ signals may be coupled to a plurality of signal paths within the system, each of which may be associated with a specific arrangement of signal processing components suitable for generating different types of image data (e.g., B-mode image data, Doppler image data). For example, the system may include a B-mode signal path <b>158</b> which couples the signals from the signal processor <b>126</b> to a B-mode processor <b>128</b> for producing B-mode image data.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The B-mode processor <b>128</b> can employ amplitude detection for the imaging of structures in the body. The B-mode processor <b>128</b> may generate signals for tissue images and/or contrast images. The signals produced by the B-mode processor <b>128</b> may be coupled to a scan converter <b>130</b> and/or a multiplanar reformatter <b>132</b>. The scan converter <b>130</b> may be configured to arrange the echo signals from the spatial relationship in which they were received to a desired image format. For instance, the scan converter <b>130</b> may arrange the echo signal into a two dimensional (2D) sector-shaped format, or a pyramidal or otherwise shaped three dimensional (3D) format. In another example of the present disclosure, the scan converter <b>130</b> may arrange the echo signals into side-by-side contrast enhanced and tissue images. As explained further below, in some examples, the image processor <b>136</b> performs microbubble identification, localization, and accumulation.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The multiplanar reformatter <b>132</b> can convert echoes which are received from points in a common plane in a volumetric region of the body into an ultrasonic image (e.g., a B-mode image) of that plane, for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,443,896 (Detmer). The scan converter <b>130</b> and multiplanar reformatter <b>132</b> may be implemented as one or more processors in some examples.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">A volume renderer <b>134</b> may generate an image (also referred to as a projection, render, or rendering) of the 3D dataset as viewed from a given reference point, e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,530,885 (Entrekin et al.). The volume renderer <b>134</b> may be implemented as one or more processors in some examples. The volume renderer <b>134</b> may generate a render, such as a positive render or a negative render, by any known or future known technique such as surface rendering and maximum intensity rendering.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some examples, the system may include a Doppler signal path <b>162</b> which couples the output from the signal processor <b>126</b> to a Doppler processor <b>160</b>. The Doppler processor <b>160</b> may be configured to estimate the Doppler shift and generate Doppler image data. The Doppler image data may include color data which is then overlaid with B-mode (i.e. grayscale) image data for display. The Doppler processor <b>160</b> may be configured to filter out unwanted signals (i.e., noise or clutter associated with non-moving tissue), for example using a wall filter. The Doppler processor <b>160</b> may be further configured to estimate velocity and power in accordance with known techniques. For example, the Doppler processor may include a Doppler estimator such as an auto-correlator, in which velocity (Doppler frequency) estimation is based on the argument of the lag-one autocorrelation function and Doppler power estimation is based on the magnitude of the lag-zero autocorrelation function. Motion can also be estimated by known phase-domain (for example, parametric frequency estimators such as MUSIC, ESPRIT, etc.) or time-domain (for example, cross-correlation) signal processing techniques. Other estimators related to the temporal or spatial distributions of velocity such as estimators of acceleration or temporal and/or spatial velocity derivatives can be used instead of or in addition to velocity estimators. In some examples, the velocity and power estimates may undergo further threshold detection to further reduce noise, as well as segmentation and post-processing such as filling and smoothing. The velocity and power estimates may then be mapped to a desired range of display colors in accordance with a color map. The color data, also referred to as Doppler image data, may then be coupled to the scan converter <b>130</b>, where the Doppler image data may be converted to the desired image format and overlaid on the B-mode image of the tissue structure to form a color Doppler or a power Doppler image. For example, Doppler image data may be overlaid on a B-mode image of the tissue structure.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Output (e.g., B-mode images, Doppler images) from the scan converter <b>130</b>, the multiplanar reformatter <b>132</b>, and/or the volume renderer <b>134</b> may be coupled to an image processor <b>136</b> for further enhancement, buffering and temporary storage before being displayed on an image display <b>138</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some examples, the image processor <b>136</b> may process the images using different image processing techniques. For example, the image processor <b>136</b> may collect multiple images (e.g., sequential images acquired at different time points) and combine them to generate contrast accumulation images (e.g., MVI). In some examples, the image processor <b>136</b> may also analyze individual images to locate one or more microbubbles within the image and find the centers of the microbubbles and generate one or more SRI images based on SRI image processing techniques. Other image processing techniques may also be used (e.g., color Doppler, CPA, CEUS-MFI). According to principles of the present disclosure, the image processor <b>136</b> may process different regions of the images received from the scan converter <b>130</b> using different image processing techniques. For example, one or more regions may be processed using contrast accumulation imaging techniques and one or more regions may be processed using SRI techniques.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The different processing techniques may provide images of the regions that have both different temporal and spatial resolutions. For example, a region processed by MVI techniques may have lower spatial resolution and higher spatial resolution than a region processed by SRI techniques. In some examples, higher spatial resolution may be a result, at least in part, of a greater number of image frames being combined to generate a final image of the region. In some examples, higher temporal resolution may be a result, at least in part, of a fewer number of image frames being combined and/or a faster acquisition rate by the ultrasound probe (e.g., number of frames per second).</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some examples, the one or more regions processed using different image processing techniques may at least partially overlap. In some examples, different sets of images may be processed by the image processor <b>136</b> to process the different regions with different processing techniques (e.g., every other image may be used for the first region and the other images may be used for the second region). In some examples, which regions of the images are processed by what techniques by the image processor <b>136</b> may be based, at least in part, by setting a region of interest and/or an imaging mode by a user via the user interface <b>124</b>, as described further below.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">According to principles of the present disclosure, in some examples, an ultrafast imaging mode with a same pulse sequence may be employed during/after the contrast agent injection/infusion. In some examples, the pulse sequence may be based on control signals provided by the transmit controller <b>120</b>. In some examples, imaging frames and/or relevant RF and/or IQ-data may be streamed to a computer-readable medium (e.g., local memory <b>142</b>) continuously during the entire contrast imaging length. The data may be provided from the beamformer <b>122</b>, the signal processor <b>126</b>, B-mode processor <b>128</b>, Doppler processor <b>160</b>, and/or scan converter <b>130</b>. The user interface <b>124</b> may allow control of how an image or ROI of a first imaging mode (e.g., CEUS) is displayed along with one or more additional images or ROIs of different imaging modes (e.g., SRI). In other examples, if not all imaging frames and/or relevant RF/IQ-data can be saved continuously, the interleaving of two pulse sequences can be used with one for the overview mode and another for the super-resolution imaging. In some examples, if system constraints do not allow simultaneous interleave/acquisition of different imaging modes, then when SRI is selected as an imaging mode, the SRI mode may operate with a realization similar to PW Doppler where sparse updates to the reference image guide the clinician with plane selection while a long accumulation/streaming operation occupies the majority of the system process.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">A graphics processor <b>140</b> may generate graphic overlays for display with the images. These graphic overlays can contain, e.g., standard identifying information such as patient name, date and time of the image, imaging parameters, and the like. For these purposes the graphics processor may be configured to receive input from the user interface <b>124</b>, such as a typed patient name or other annotations. The user interface <b>124</b> can also be coupled to the multiplanar reformatter <b>132</b> for selection and control of a display of multiple multiplanar reformatted (MPR) images.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The system <b>100</b> may include local memory <b>142</b>.

In some examples, the user may select one or more ROIs and indicate different imaging modes for each ROI. In some examples, an ROI may be included within and/or overlap with another ROI. In some examples, a maximum size of the ROI may be based, at least in part, on the imaging mode selected by the user. For example, a maximum size of the ROI for accumulation CEUS imaging may be larger than a maximum size of the ROI for SRI. The selected imaging modes may affect the processing of the images by the image processor <b>136</b> and/or the acquisition settings (e.g., pulse sequences indicated by the transmit controller <b>120</b>) in addition to affecting the images displayed on display <b>138</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some examples, various components shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> may be combined.

In some examples, the correlation value between two consecutive frames may be averaged across multiple correlation values calculated for consecutive pairs of frames used to generate the SRI image. The correlation may be normalized to a value between 0 and 1. The normalized correlation value may be used as the confidence score. This confidence score may indicate that a sufficient number of frames have been accumulated for generating the SRI image and/or motion during frame accumulation was sufficiently low.

All contrast images frames may be collected and processed by an image processor (e.g., image processor <b>136</b>) once contract injection is indicated by the user via the user interface. The second level resolution imaging is an accumulation imaging mode with its resolution enhanced with microbubble localization and tracking techniques (e.g., HD-MVI). Once the &#x201c;large&#x201d; ROI window is selected, the HD-MVI image within the window will be updated continuously with images frames acquired before and after the ROI selection. The temporal interval for the imaging accumulation may be controlled by the user via the user interface in some examples. The third level resolution imaging is a super-resolution imaging (SRI) mode.

In some examples, blocks <b>508</b> and <b>510</b> may be performed simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In some examples, the method shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> may further include displaying the images processed by the first and/or second processing techniques, for example, on the display.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Optionally, in some examples, the method shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> may further include calculating a confidence score when the second processing technique is an SRI processing technique. The confidence score may be based, at least in part, on the SRI processing technique. In some examples, the confidence score may be displayed with the ultrasound images. In some examples, the confidence score may be provided qualitatively, for example, as a colored ring as discussed in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In some examples, the method shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> may further include acquiring ultrasound signals for generating the plurality of ultrasound images. The acquiring may be performed by an ultrasound transducer array, such as transducer array <b>114</b> included in ultrasound probe <b>112</b>. In some examples, the acquiring may be under the control of a transmit controller, such as transmit controller <b>120</b>. The control signals may indicate one or more pulse sequences in some examples. In some examples, acquisition of ultrasound signals for generating the first set of the plurality of ultrasound images are interleaved with acquisition of ultrasound signals for generating the second set of the plurality of ultrasound images. For example, the interleaving may be based on control signals provided by the transmit controller to the ultrasound probe. In some examples, the method shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> may further continuously streaming data corresponding to the ultrasound signals to a computer readable medium, for example, local memory <b>142</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Two non-limiting examples of interleaved acquisition are provided herein for illustration of the principles of the present disclosure. In a first example, the frame-to-frame interleaving is performed. In this form of interleaving, one or more frames of a first imaging type are acquired followed by acquisition of one or more frames of a second imaging type. In some applications, this may be followed by acquisition of one or more frames of a third imaging type. This acquisition sequence is then repeated for the duration of the scan, or at least as long as images of the different imaging modes are desired. For example, a B-mode frame, which may be displayed as either a &#x201c;nonlinear&#x201d; contrast image for microbubbles, or a &#x201c;linear&#x201d; anatomic image for tissue, or both, a color imaging frame (e.g., Doppler power or velocity map, or both), and/or a number of SRI frames can be selectively put together in one or more frame-to-frame sequences in any order. In some cases, the SRI image may be an accumulation of many ultra-fast imaging frames.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In a second interleaving example, all of the acquired frames are same (e.g., each frame for B-mode and/or color Doppler, SRI. That is, the acquisition parameters for generating the different images may be the same. For example, an ultra-fast imaging frame may include multiple beams and/or directions and/or a number of pulses that are transmitted and received along each beam or direction. In some examples, the pulses may be different (e.g., different frequency, duration, intensity). The received pulses from multiple frames may then be extracted and/or accumulated to form images for the different imaging modes (e.g., B-mode, color Doppler, and/or SRI images). For example, if transmit pulse waveforms for B-mode, color Doppler, and SRI are different, the pulses for B-mode, color Doppler, and SRI may be transmitted along the same beam or direction in sequence. In another example, if transmit pulse waveforms for B-mode or color Doppler are the same as a part of SRI waveforms, the pulses for SRI alone may be sufficient.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Optionally, in some examples, the method shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> may further include receiving an indication of a second ROI, for example, via the user interface. The method may further include processing in the second ROI a third set of the plurality of ultrasound images with a third processing technique. Again, the processing may be performed by an image processor. In some examples, the third processing technique may have a higher spatial resolution and a lower temporal resolution than the first processing technique and a lower spatial resolution and higher temporal resolution than the second processing technique.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The advantages of the multi-level vascular imaging according to the principles of the present disclosure may include adequate display of spatially detailed micro-vasculature within small ROIs, shortened processing time for SRI reconstruction for prompt display of the microstructure, and allowing for effective correction of localized physiological motion which may be important in SRI.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In various examples where components, systems and/or methods are implemented using a programmable device, such as a computer-based system or programmable logic, it should be appreciated that the above-described systems and methods can be implemented using any of various known or later developed programming languages, such as &#x201c;C&#x201d;, &#x201c;C++&#x201d;, &#x201c;FORTRAN&#x201d;, &#x201c;Pascal&#x201d;, &#x201c;VHDL&#x201d; and the like.
