Such hygiene products generally contain active agents, such as surfactants and/or conditioners, in addition to significant amounts of water and/or viscosity control agents and are most commonly provided in large bottles containing enough product for multiple applications. While such bulk products are suitable for many consumer applications, there remains a need for smaller aliquots of hygiene products, particularly in the travel and hospitality industries.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Hygiene products have been provided in small bottles for use in the hospitality and/or travel industries. These bottles provide a user with enough product for one or a few uses, but generally are not meant for long-term use and are meant to be disposed of in a few short days. Unfortunately, in at least some instances, the small bottles of hygiene product (e.g., shampoo, conditioner, lotion, shaving cream, bodywash, etc.) generally found in the hospitality industry have a high packaging to product ratio, and are typically made of non-reusable and/or non-biodegradable materials, which contributes to higher costs and excessive amounts of waste.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Some single-use packages of hygiene product (e.g., shampoo, conditioner) have been developed to reduce the packaging to product ration and cut down on waste. However, in at least some instances, these packages are packaged in plastic sachets, bags, or blister packs which are generally not recycled or biodegradable and therefore continue to produce undesirable amounts of waste.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It would therefore be desirable to provide single-use devices, systems, and methods which are eco-friendly, reduce waste, and provide measured doses of hygiene product. Not necessarily all such aspects or advantages are achieved by any particular embodiment. Thus, various embodiments may be carried out in a manner that achieves or optimizes one advantage or group of advantages taught herein without necessarily achieving other aspects or advantages as may also be taught or suggested herein.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure generally relates to single-use cleaning and/or personal care products and more particularly relates to single-use water-soluble hygiene product pods.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Aspects of the present disclosure provide a hygiene product pod configured for single-use applications, and a method of using such a pod.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Disclosed herein are hygiene product pods, comprising: a water-soluble envelope; and a hygiene product sealed in the water-soluble envelope, the hygiene product comprising, based on the total weight of the hygiene product: a non-aqueous carrier comprising: one or more polyol solvents in an amount ranging from about 10 wt % to about 30 wt %; and one or more polyglyceryl fatty acid ester (PGE) chassis in an amount ranging from about 10 wt % to about 50 wt %, wherein the hygiene product has a free water content of about 18 wt % or less.

In some embodiments, the hygiene product pods may provide cleansing and/or conditioning agents for hair and/or skin. In particular, the hygiene product may include an active agent(s), such as active ingredients of a shampoo, conditioner, or a combination thereof, within a non-aqueous carrier agent(s) that may comprise one or more polyols, which can include one or more polyglyceryls.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The component weight percentages disclosed herein are based on the total weight of the hygiene product, unless otherwise specified.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">Hygiene Product Pods</heading><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Various embodiments described herein may include a single dose of a hygiene product in the form of a pod. As used herein, the term &#x201c;pod&#x201d; refers to water-soluble material filled with a hygiene product and sealed to form a chamber (also referred to herein as an envelope) in the shape of a capsule, sphere, drop, or the like. For example, a pod may include a water-soluble envelope encapsulating a liquid or gel hygiene product. In some embodiments, a pod may include a water-soluble envelope encapsulating a solid or a paste hygiene product.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">A pod may have any suitable shape and/or size as desired by one of ordinary skill in the art. For example, the water-soluble material may be sealed around the hygiene product to form a shaped chamber holding the hygiene product. In some embodiments, the chamber may be relatively flat (e.g., with a relatively small thickness compared to its width and length) such that the pod appears nearly two-dimensional. In some embodiments, the chamber may be three-dimensional. The chamber (and thus the pod as a whole) may be shaped like a capsule, a sphere, a drop, a cylinder, a cone, an ellipsoid, a tetrahedron, a square pyramid, a hexagonal pyramid, a cube, a cuboid, a triangular prism, an octahedron, a pentagonal prism, a hexagonal prism, a dodecahedron, an icosahedron, or the like, or a nearly two-dimensional version (e.g., rectangular, circular, triangular, square, pentagonal, circular, elliptical, tablet-shaped, or the like) thereof.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some embodiments, a pod may contain a sufficient amount of hygiene product for a single use (also referred to herein as a single dose). For example, a pod may contain an amount of shampoo sufficient to clean one head of hair. In some embodiments, a pod may contain an amount of conditioner sufficient to condition one head of hair. In some embodiments, a pod may contain an amount of bodywash sufficient to wash one body. In some embodiments, a pod may contain an amount of a shaving product sufficient to shave one or more body parts. As used herein, the term &#x201c;shaving product&#x201d; may refer to shaving cream, shaving gel, or a precursor composition configured to form a shaving product. It will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the volume of a single dose of the hygiene product may depend on the nature of the hygiene product itself. For example, a user may require a smaller volume of a more concentrated hygiene product and a larger volume of a more dilute hygiene product in order to achieve the same effect. Alternatively, or in combination, the type of hygiene product may determine the volume of a single dose thereof. For example, a single dose of a shampoo may be about the same as a single dose of a conditioner. A single dose of a bodywash may be larger than a single dose of a shampoo if the bodywash is less viscous than the shampoo and/or if the tissue surface area to be cleansed is sufficiently larger. Pods including a concentrated active agent may be smaller than pods containing undiluted or semi-diluted active agents.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The pod may have a weight within a range of about lg to about 20 g. For example, the pod may have a weight within a range bounded by any two of the following values: lg, 2 g, 3 g, 4 g, 5 g, 6 g, 7 g, 8 g, 9 g, 10 g, 11 g, 12 g, 13 g, 14 g, 15 g, 16 g, 17 g, 18 g, 19 g, or 20 g. In some embodiments, for example when the hygiene product is a shampoo, conditioner, or shampoo and conditioner two-in-one, the pod may range in weight from about 4 g to about 12 g, such as from about 5 g to about 8 g. In some embodiments, for example when the hygiene product is a bodywash, the pod may range in weight from about 5 g to about 15 g, such as from about 8 g to about 10 g.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The pod may have a volume within a range of about 4 ml to about 10 ml. For example, the pod may have a volume within a range bounded by any two of the following values: 4 ml, 5 ml, 6 ml, 7 ml, 8 ml, 9 ml, or 10 ml. In some embodiments, for example when the hygiene product is a shampoo or bodywash, the pod may range in volume from about 4 ml to about 7 ml, such as about 5 ml. In some embodiments, for example when the hygiene product is a conditioner, the pod may range in volume from about 6 ml to about 8 ml, such as about 7 ml.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> shows a photograph of a plurality of hygiene product pods <b>100</b>. The pod <b>100</b> may comprise a hygiene product <b>104</b> sealed in a water-soluble envelope <b>102</b>. The water-soluble envelope <b>102</b> may be sealed around the hygiene product <b>104</b> to form a hygiene product <b>104</b> filled chamber. The chamber (and thus the overall impression of the pod <b>100</b>) may be generally drop-shaped (as shown). However, the chamber/pod is not limited to any particular shape. For example, the chamber/pod may be rectangular, circular, triangular, square, pentagonal, circular, elliptical, tablet-shaped, or the like.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The water-soluble envelope <b>102</b> may be configured to rapidly dissolve in the presence of a solvent such as water. For example, the water-soluble envelope <b>102</b> may include, or be formed of, a water-soluble material such as polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH or PVA), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), or the like. The water-soluble material may be in the form of a film, a woven fiber, or non-woven fiber. For example, the water-soluble material may comprise a PVOH fiber, CMC fiber, or the like. For example, the water-soluble envelope <b>102</b> may be formed of a PVOH film, such as Monosol 9643 or Monosol PC2600, available from Kuraray Inc.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The solubility of the water-soluble envelope <b>102</b> may depend on the material from which it is formed. For example, the degree of hydrolysis of PVOH may affect the water-solubility of the water-soluble envelope <b>102</b>, with less hydrolyzed PVOH being more water-soluble at lower temperatures and more hydrolyzed PVOH being less water-soluble at lower temperatures and requiring higher temperature water for similar solubility rates. Further, the molecular weight of the polymer used may affect the water-solubility. For example, a lower molecular weight polymer may dissolve faster than a higher molecular weight polymer in water. Alternatively, or in combination, the thickness and/or pH of the material may affect the solubility of the water-soluble envelope <b>102</b>. Alternatively, or in combination, the temperature of the water may affect the solubility of the water-soluble envelope <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The water-soluble envelope <b>102</b> may have a thickness ranging from about 0.5 mil to about 200 mil, from about 0.5 mil to about 190 mil, from about 0.5 mil to about 180 mil, from about 0.5 mil to about 170 mil, from about 0.5 mil to about 160 mil, from about 0.5 mil to about 150 mil, from about 0.5 mil to about 140 mil, from about 0.5 mil to about 130 mil, from about 0.5 mil to about 120 mil, from about 0.5 mil to about 110 mil, from about 0.5 mil to about 100 mil, from about 0.5 mil to about 90 mil, from about 0.5 mil to about 80 mil, from about 0.5 mil to about 70 mil, from about 0.5 mil to about 60 mil, from about 0.5 mil to about 50 mil, from about 0.5 mil to about 40 mil, from about 0.5 mil to about 30 mil, from about 0.5 mil to about 20 mil, from about 0.5 mil to about 10 mil, from about 0.5 mil to about 9 mil, from about 0.5 mil to about 8 mil, from about 0.5 mil to about 7 mil, from about 0.5 mil to about 6 mil, from about 0.5 mil to about 5 mil, from about 0.5 mil to about 4 mil, from about 0.5 mil to about 3 mil, from about 0.5 mil to about 2 mil, or from about 0.5 mil to about 1 mil. For example, the water-soluble envelope <b>102</b> may have a thickness within a range bounded by any two of the following values: 0.5 mil, 1 mil, 1.5 mil, 2 mil, 2.5 mil, 3 mil, 3.5 mil, 4 mil, 4.5 mil, 5 mil, 5.5 mil, 6 mil, 6.5 mil, 7 mil, 7.5 mil, 8 mil, 8.5 mil, 9 mil, 9.5 mil, 10 mil, 11 mil, 12 mil, 13 mil, 14 mil, 15 mil, 16 mil, 17 mil, 18 mil, 19 mil, 20 mil, 25 mil, 30 mil, 35 mil, 40 mil, 45 mil, 50 mil, 55 mil, 60 mil, 65 mil, 70 mil, 75 mil, 80 mil, 85 mil, 90 mil, 95 mil, 100 mil, 105 mil, 110 mil, 115 mil, 120 mil, 125 mil, 130 mil, 135 mil, 140 mil, 145 mil, 150 mil, 155 mil, 160 mil, 165 mil, 170 mil, 175 mil, 180 mil, 185 mil, 190 mil, 195 mil, or 200 mil.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The water-soluble envelope <b>102</b> may have a pH ranging from about 4.0 to about 9.0, at a temperature of about 25&#xb0; C. For example, the water-soluble envelope <b>102</b> may have a pH at about 25&#xb0; C. within a range bounded by any two of the following values: 4.0, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.7, 4.8, 4.9, 5.0, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7, 5.8, 5.9, 6.0, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.7, 6.8, 6.9, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, 7.6, 7.7, 7.8, 7.9, 8.0, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 8.8, 8.9, or 9.0</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The water-soluble envelope <b>102</b> may be configured to rapidly dissolve in water at about 25&#xb0; C. within about 0.5 seconds to about 1 minute. For example, the water-soluble envelope <b>102</b> may be configured to dissolve in water at about 25&#xb0; C. in a time period ranging from about 3 seconds to about 15 seconds, such as from about 5 seconds to about 7 seconds. The water-soluble envelope <b>102</b> may be configured to dissolve in 25&#xb0; C. water within about 5 seconds to about 60 seconds, such as about 15 seconds to about 45 seconds or about 20 seconds to about 30 seconds. The water-soluble envelope <b>102</b> may be configured to dissolve in 25&#xb0; C. water within a time range bounded by any two of the following values: 0.5 seconds, 1 second, 2 seconds, 3 seconds, 4 seconds, 5 seconds, 6 seconds, 7 seconds, 8 seconds, 9 seconds, 10 seconds, 11 seconds, 12 seconds, 13 seconds, 14 seconds, 15 seconds, 16 seconds, 17 seconds, 18 seconds, 19 seconds, 20 seconds, 21 seconds, 22 seconds, 23 seconds, 24 seconds, 25 seconds, 26 seconds, 27 seconds, 28 seconds, 29 seconds, 30 seconds, 31 seconds, 32 seconds, 33 seconds, 34 seconds, 35 seconds, 36 seconds, 37 seconds, 38 seconds, 39 seconds, 40 seconds, 41 seconds, 42 seconds, 43 seconds, 44 seconds, 45 seconds, 46 seconds, 47 seconds, 48 seconds, 49 seconds, 50 seconds, 51 seconds, 52 seconds, 53 seconds, 54 seconds, 55 seconds, 56 seconds, 57 seconds, 58 seconds, 59 seconds, or 60 seconds.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">It has been found that forming the water-soluble envelope <b>102</b> of PVOH may be particularly beneficial. For example, dissolved PVOH may act as a film-former (e.g., a conditioning agent) and/or a foam-boosting agent. Accordingly, a PVOH water-soluble envelope <b>102</b> may unexpectedly improve the properties of the hygiene product <b>104</b> by adding to suds, bubbles, and/or foam when in use.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The hygiene product pod <b>100</b> may be formed by sealing two or more sheets or layers of the water-soluble material around the hygiene product <b>104</b>. For example, the water-soluble envelope <b>102</b> may be formed by placing the hygiene product <b>104</b> between two sheets of the water-soluble material, and then sealing the perimeters of the two sheets so as to form a seal region <b>106</b> that extends around the entire perimeter of the hygiene product pod <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, the sheets may be partially sealed (e.g., sealed along three sides) to form the water-soluble envelope <b>102</b>, after which the hygiene product <b>104</b> may be inserted into an open end of the water-soluble envelope <b>102</b>.

respectively. The hygiene products were then packaged to form hygiene product pods as described herein. In particular, the hygiene products were encapsulated in a chamber formed between sheets of PVOH using a roll coater and a sealing device.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0162"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> shows a photograph of a sheet of hygiene product pods formed by the deposition and sealing of the hygiene product formulated according to Example 1 between two sheets of PVOH. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> shows photograph of a sheet of comparative hygiene product pods formed by depositing and sealing of a comparative hygiene product composition formulated according to Comparative Example 1 between two sheets of PVOH.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0163">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, the hygiene product of Example 1 had a relatively low viscosity that allowed for the formation of discrete deposits of the hygiene product on the underlying PVOH sheet. As such, the deposits could be discretely sealed and the sheet could be easily cut to form individual hygiene product pods. Similar results were obtained for Examples 2-12.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0164">The compositions of Examples 1-3 included relatively high amounts of the liquid amides dimethyl lauramide/myristamide (Ninol CAA) and surfactant lauryl lactyl lactate (Stephan Mild L3). The addition of these agents, combined with the removal of gelling agents, lowered the viscosity of the formulation. In particular, there was a gradual and slight improvement with regards to viscosity and thinning consistency as the total amounts of Ninol CAA and Stepan Mild 3 were increased from 22.7 wt % to 26 wt %. Unfortunately, there was a corresponding drop in foaming action and cleansing with the increase in liquid amides.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0165">Example 3 included a polyglyceryl fatty acid ester (polyglyceryl-2 caprate) and a corresponding reduction in surfactant content. As a result, Example 3 exhibited a substantial reduction in foaming as compared to Examples 1 and 2.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0166">Examples 4-8 were compositions that included a combination of two polyglyceryl fatty acid esters (polyglyceryl-2 caprate and polyglyceryl-6 esters) and reduced amounts of liquid amides. In particular, higher amounts of polyglyceryl-2 caprate were found to reduce viscosity of the compositions without significantly reducing foaming and cleansing performance. As such, polyglyceryl-2 caprate was shown to provide functions similar to water used in conventional shampoo. The addition of polyglyceryl-2 caprate was also found to allow the drastic reduction in the amounts of Ninol CAA and Stepan Mild L3, which were thought to be limiting with respect to foam height and cleansing ability.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0167">Examples 9-15 were compositions that included combinations of polyglyceryl-2 caprate and polyglyceryl-3 caprate, with the polyglyceryl-3 caprate being used in place of the polyglyceryl-6 esters of Examples 4-8. In particular, Examples 9-15 included varying amounts of both SCI powder and polyglyceryl-3 caprate, in order to maximize foam height while maintaining a thin viscosity that is rapidly self-leveling. Examples 9-15 demonstrated that amounts of SCI powder ranging from about 9.5 wt % to about 10.5 wt % provided unexpectedly good foaming and viscosity characteristics. In addition, polyglyceryl-3 caprate amounts above about 8 wt % decreased foam bubble size and wall stability, which unexpectedly provided a rich milky lather that dissipated quickly and did not build.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0168">In contrast to the exemplary hygiene product shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, the comparative hygiene product shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> had a relatively high viscosity, which resulted in tailing between deposits of the comparative hygiene product. In particular, the viscosity of the comparative hygiene product caused the product to form a &#x201c;tail&#x201d; between the deposits of the product on the underlying PVOH sheet and the deposition apparatus. As a result, the deposits overlapped one another, and the sealing process did not produce discretely sealed deposits that could be cut into individual sealed pods. Similar results were obtained for Comparative Examples 2-5.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0169">In particular, Comparative Examples 2-5 were formulated in an attempt to reduce the viscosity of the compositions and prevent tailing, by modifying the polyol amounts and compositions. Comparative Example 5 had the lowest viscosity. However, the sodium cocoyl isethionate was held in a gel-like suspension that was still too viscous to prevent tailing or provide self-leveling in Comparative Example 5.</p><heading id="h-0019" level="1">Example 17&#x2014;Characterization of Physical Properties</heading><p id="p-0174" num="0170">The resulting film thickness was measured using a digital handheld micrometer</p><p id="p-0175" num="0171">Films were analyzed for various qualities as described below, such as solubility in water, morphological homogeneity, flexibility/brittleness, tensile strength, and tackiness.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0172">Solubility in Water</p><p id="p-0177" num="0173">The film's solubility in water was measured using a modified MSTM-205 (MonoSol's standard test method for solubility).
