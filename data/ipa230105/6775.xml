CDMA can be implemented as a radio technology such as Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (UTRA) or CDMA2000. TDMA can be implemented as a radio technology such as Global System for Mobile communications (GSM)/General Packet Radio Service (GPRS)/Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE). OFDMA can be implemented as a radio technology such as Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11 (Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi)), IEEE 802.16 (Worldwide interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX)), IEEE 802.20, and Evolved UTRA (E-UTRA). UTRA is a part of Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS). 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Long Term Evolution (LTE) is part of Evolved UMTS (E-UMTS) using E-UTRA, and LTE-Advanced (A) is an evolved version of 3GPP LTE. 3GPP NR (New Radio or New Radio Access Technology) is an evolved version of 3GPP LTE/LTE-A.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">As more and more communication devices require a larger communication capacity, there is a need for mobile broadband communication enhanced over conventional radio access technology (RAT). In addition, massive Machine Type Communications (MTC) capable of providing a variety of services anywhere and anytime by connecting multiple devices and objects is another important issue to be considered for next generation communications. Communication system design considering services/UEs sensitive to reliability and latency is also under discussion. As such, introduction of new radio access technology considering enhanced mobile broadband communication (eMBB), massive MTC, and Ultra-Reliable and Low Latency Communication (URLLC) is being discussed. In the present disclosure, for simplicity, this technology will be referred to as NR (New Radio or New RAT).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">For the sake of clarity, 3GPP NR is mainly described, but the technical idea of the present disclosure is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the present disclosure, the term &#x201c;set/setting&#x201d; may be replaced with &#x201c;configure/configuration&#x201d;, and both may be used interchangeably. Further, a conditional expression (e.g., &#x201c;if&#x201d;, &#x201c;in a case&#x201d;, or &#x201c;when&#x201d;) may be replaced by &#x201c;based on that&#x201d; or &#x201c;in a state/status&#x201d;. In addition, an operation or software/hardware (SW/HW) configuration of a user equipment (UE)/base station (BS) may be derived/understood based on satisfaction of a corresponding condition. When a process on a receiving (or transmitting) side may be derived/understood from a process on the transmitting (or receiving) side in signal transmission/reception between wireless communication devices (e.g., a BS and a UE), its description may be omitted. Signal determination/generation/encoding/transmission of the transmitting side, for example, may be understood as signal monitoring reception/decoding/determination of the receiving side. Further, when it is said that a UE performs (or does not perform) a specific operation, this may also be interpreted as that a BS expects/assumes (or does not expect/assume) that the UE performs the specific operation. When it is said that a BS performs (or does not perform) a specific operation, this may also be interpreted as that a UE expects/assumes (or does not expect/assume) that the BS performs the specific operation.

When the PUSCH is transmitted in the DFT-s-OFDM waveform, the UE transmits the PUSCH by transform precoding. For example, when transform precoding is impossible (e.g., disabled), the UE may transmit the PUSCH in the CP-OFDM waveform, while when transform precoding is possible (e.g., enabled), the UE may transmit the PUSCH in the CP-OFDM or DFT-s-OFDM waveform. A PUSCH transmission may be dynamically scheduled by a UL grant in DCI, or semi-statically scheduled by higher-layer (e.g., RRC) signaling (and/or Layer 1 (L1) signaling such as a PDCCH) (configured scheduling or configured grant). The PUSCH transmission may be performed in a codebook-based or non-codebook-based manner.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary ACK/NACK transmission process.

More than four layers may be used for a 2-TB transmission, and up to four layers may be used for a 1-TB transmission. As a result, when spatial bundling is configured for a corresponding cell group, spatial bundling may be performed for a serving cell in which more than four layers may be scheduled among serving cells of the cell group. A UE which wants to transmit an HARQ-ACK response through spatial bundling may generate an HARQ-ACK response by performing a (bit-wise) logical AND operation on A/N bits for a plurality of TBs.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0087">For example, on the assumption that the UE receives DCI scheduling two TBs and receives two TBs on a PDSCH based on the DCI, a UE that performs spatial bundling may generate a single A/N bit by a logical AND operation between a first A/N bit for a first TB and a second A/N bit for a second TB. As a result, when both the first TB and the second TB are ACKs, the UE reports an ACK bit value to a BS, and when at least one of the TBs is a NACK, the UE reports a NACK bit value to the BS.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0088">For example, when only one TB is actually scheduled in a serving cell configured for reception of two TBs, the UE may generate a single A/N bit by performing a logical AND operation on an A/N bit for the one TB and a bit value of 1. As a result, the UE reports the A/N bit for the one TB to the BS.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0089">There are plurality of parallel DL HARQ processes for DL transmissions at the BS/UE. The plurality of parallel HARQ processes enable continuous DL transmissions, while the BS is waiting for an HARQ feedback indicating successful or failed reception of a previous DL transmission. Each HARQ process is associated with an HARQ buffer in the medium access control (MAC) layer. Each DL HARQ process manages state variables such as the number of MAC physical data unit (PDU) transmissions, an HARQ feedback for a MAC PDU in a buffer, and a current redundancy version.

A specific set may be used semi-statically, or a &#x3b2;<sub>offset </sub>set may be indicated dynamically by DCI (e.g., DCI format 0_1/0_2).

When it is configured by higher-layer signaling that the priority indicator will be provided for a corresponding DCI format, the UE performs blind-decoding for the DCI format, assuming the existence of the priority indicator. Without explicit signaling indicating that the priority indicator will be used for the DCI format by higher-layer signaling, the UE performs blind-decoding, assuming that a priority indicator field is not included in the DCI format. When no priority information is provided for a corresponding DL/UL signal, the UE may assume that the DL/UL signal has the LP (e.g., priority index=0). Those skilled in the art will understand that the priority indicator of DCI is a merely one of various means for indicating/configuring a priority, not the sole method.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0106">In an example of the above prioritization, a lower priority index may be configured/indicated for the LP, and a higher priority index may be configured/indicated for the HP, or a lower bit value (e.g., bit &#x2018;0&#x2019;) may be configured/indicated for the LP, and a higher bit value (e.g., bit &#x2018;1&#x2019;) may be configured/indicated for the HP.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0107">For example, a priority (e.g., LP or HP) may be configured/indicated for each PUCCH/PUSCH resource configured/indicated for each UCI type (e.g., HARQ-ACK, SR, and/or CSI) or for a corresponding UCI transmission. For example, the LP/HP may be indicated for an HARQ-ACK for a PDSCH by DL grant DCI that schedules the PDSCH. For example, the LP/HP may be indicated for (aperiodic) CSI by DCI (e.g., UL grant DCI scheduling a PUSCH).</p><p id="p-0096" num="0108">In another example, (i) a PUCCH resource set may be configured independently for each priority, and/or (ii) a maximum UCI coding rate for PUCCH transmission may be configured independently for each priority. In another example, (iii) a beta offset &#x3b2;<sub>offset </sub>for encoding UCI (e.g., for an HARQ-ACK and CSI Part 1/2, see Table 6) on a PUSCH may be configured independently for each priority and/or (iv) an HARQ-ACK codebook type may be configured independently for each priority. At least one or a combination of (i) to (iv) may be used.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0109">Depending on HARQ-ACK bit (payload) configuration methods, three HARQ-ACK codebook types are defined: Type-1, Type-2, and Type-3. In the case of a Type-1 codebook, HARQ-ACK payload is configured according to a combination of a candidate HARQ-ACK timing (K1) set and a candidate PDSCH occasion (SLIV) set (for a corresponding cell, which are configured on a cell basis) (e.g., a codebook of a fixed size semi-statically configured by RRC signaling). In the case of a Type-2 codebook, a codebook size may be dynamically changed according to the number of actually scheduled PDSCHs or the number of corresponding resource allocations. In the case of a Type-3 codebook, HARQ-ACK payload is configured by mapping an HARQ-ACK bit corresponding to a corresponding HARQ process number (HPN) on an HPN basis according to a maximum number of HARQ processes (configured for the corresponding cell on a cell basis) (e.g., one-shot A/N reporting).</p><p id="p-0098" num="0110">Specifically in the Type-1 codebook, with a set of a plurality of (e.g., N) candidate K1 values (for the corresponding cell on a cell basis), all SLIV combinations available for (or schedulable for transmission in) a DL slot earlier than an A/N transmission slot by K1 slots may be calculated, A/N sub-payload corresponding to the DL slot may be configured (including determination of an A/N bit position/order corresponding to each SLIV available for the slot) (this is defined as &#x201c;SLIV pruning&#x201d;), and an entire A/N codebook may be configured by concatenating the A/N sub-payload for the N K1 values. The set of (N) DL slots corresponding to each K1 value may be defined as a bundling window corresponding to an A/N transmission slot.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0111">Specifically regarding the Type-3 codebook, the BS may configure the UE with one of Mode 1 in which an HARQ-ACK and a corresponding new data indicator (NDI) are fed back together and Mode 2 in which only an HARQ-ACK is fed back without an NDI. When the UE is configured with Mode 1, the UE feeds back an HARQ-ACK for a PDSCH reception of a corresponding HPN, together with an NDI (indicated by DCI) on an HPN basis. When the UE is configured with Mode 2, the UE feeds back only an HARQ-ACK for a PDSCH reception of a corresponding HPN, on an HPN basis.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0112">To map/transmit a combination(s) of a plurality of UCIs configured/indicated as having different priorities (e.g., LP and HP) in the same one UL signal/channel (e.g., a PUCCH or PUSCH resource), a new rule/operation for a UCI encoding scheme, an RE mapping order, and/or a PUCCH resource determination needs to be defined.

A UE configured with DRX may reduce power consumption by receiving a DL signal discontinuously. DRX may be performed in an RRC_IDLE state, an RRC_INACTIVE state, and an RRC_CONNECTED state. The UE performs DRX to receive a paging signal discontinuously in the RRC_IDLE state and the RRC_INACTIVE state. DRX in the RRC_CONNECTED state (RRC_CONNECTED DRX) will be described below.</p><p id="p-0585" num="0669">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, a DRX cycle includes an On Duration and an Opportunity for DRX. The DRX cycle defines a time interval between periodic repetitions of the On Duration. The On Duration is a time period during which the UE monitors a PDCCH. When the UE is configured with DRX, the UE performs PDCCH monitoring during the On Duration. When the UE successfully detects a PDCCH during the PDCCH monitoring, the UE starts an inactivity timer and is kept awake. On the contrary, when the UE fails in detecting any PDCCH during the PDCCH monitoring, the UE transitions to a sleep state after the On Duration. Accordingly, when DRX is configured, PDCCH monitoring/reception may be performed discontinuously in the time domain in the afore-described/proposed procedures and/or methods. For example, when DRX is configured, PDCCH reception occasions (e.g., slots with PDCCH SSs) may be configured discontinuously according to a DRX configuration in the present disclosure. On the contrary, when DRX is not configured, PDCCH monitoring/reception may be performed continuously in the time domain. For example, when DRX is not configured, PDCCH reception occasions (e.g., slots with PDCCH SSs) may be configured continuously in the present disclosure. Irrespective of whether DRX is configured, PDCCH monitoring may be restricted during a time period configured as a measurement gap.</p><p id="p-0586" num="0670">Table 10 describes a DRX operation of a UE (in the RRC_CONNECTED state). Referring to Table 10, DRX configuration information is received by higher-layer signaling (e.g., RRC signaling), and DRX ON/OFF is controlled by a DRX command from the MAC layer. Once DRX is configured, the UE may perform PDCCH monitoring discontinuously in performing the afore-described/proposed procedures and/or methods.</p><p id="p-0587" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00010" num="00010"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="77pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="91pt" align="left"/><thead><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="3" rowsep="1">TABLE 10</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Type of signals</entry><entry>UE procedure</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>1<sup>st </sup>step</entry><entry>RRC signalling</entry><entry>Receive DRX configuration </entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>(MAC-</entry><entry>information</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>CellGroupConfig)</entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry>2<sup>nd </sup>Step</entry><entry>MAC CE</entry><entry>Receive DRX command</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>((Long) DRX</entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>command MAC CE)</entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry>3<sup>rd </sup>Step</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>Monitor a PDCCH during an </entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>on-duration of a DRX cycle</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0588" num="0671">MAC-CellGroupConfig includes configuration information required to configure MAC parameters for a cell group.
