Typically, whole blood is withdrawn through a needle inserted into a vein of the subjects arm and into a cell separator, such as a centrifugal bowl. Once the whole blood is separated into its various components, one or more of the components (e.g., plasma) can be removed from the centrifugal bowl. The remaining components can be returned to the subject along with optional compensation fluid to make up for the volume of the removed component. The process of drawing and returning continues until the quantity of the desired component has been collected, at which point the process is stopped. A central feature of apheresis systems is that the processed but unwanted components are returned to the donor. Separated blood components may include, for example, a high density component such as red blood cells, an intermediate density component such as platelets or white blood cells, and a lower density component such as plasma.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Many jurisdictions have regulations regarding the amount of whole blood and/or blood components that can be removed from a donor. For example, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (&#x201c;the FDA&#x201d;) sets both an upper limit on the volume of plasma that may be collected (e.g., 800 ml for an adult weighing more than 175 pounds) as well as an upper limit on the total collection volume (e.g., 880 ml for an adult weighing more than 175 pounds). Prior art plasma collection systems are unable to determine the total volume of plasma that has been collected (e.g., because the product collected is a mixture of plasma and anticoagulant) and, therefore collect based on the total collection volume, even if the total volume of plasma that has been collected is below the limit prescribed by the FDA.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with some embodiments of the present invention, a method for collecting plasma includes determining the weight and hematocrit of a donor, and inserting a venous-access device into the donor. Once the venous access device is inserted, the method may withdraw whole blood from the donor through the venous-access device and a draw line that is connected to a blood component separation device. The method may then introduce anticoagulant into the withdrawn whole blood through an anticoagulant line and separate, using the blood component separation device, the withdrawn whole blood into a plasma component and at least a second blood component. Once separated, the plasma component may be collected from the blood component separation device and into a plasma collection container. During processing, the method may calculate (1) a percentage of anticoagulant in the collected plasma component, and (2) a volume of pure plasma collected within the plasma collection container. The volume of pure plasma may be based, at least in part, on the calculated percentage of anticoagulant in the collected plasma component. The method may continue the process (e.g., withdrawing whole blood, introducing anticoagulant into the whole blood, separating the blood, collecting the plasma, and calculating the percentage of anticoagulant and volume of pure plasma) until a target volume of pure plasma is collected within the plasma collection container.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, the method may determine a change in volume within an anticoagulant container, and the calculated percentage of anticoagulant in the collected plasma may be based, at least in part, on the change in volume within the anticoagulant container. Additionally or alternatively, the method may determine a volume of anticoagulant introduced into the whole blood based on a number of rotations of an anticoagulant pump. In such embodiments, the calculated percentage of anticoagulant in the collected plasma may be based, at least in part, on the number of rotations of the anticoagulant pump. The method may also determine a volume of anticoagulant within the blood component separation device, and the calculated percentage of anticoagulant in the collected plasma may be based, at least in part, on the volume of anticoagulant within the blood component separation device.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In further embodiments, the method may monitor the volume and/or weight of the plasma component collected within the plasma collection container (e.g., using a weight sensor), and the calculated volume of pure plasma collected within the plasma collection device may be based, at least in part, on the monitored volume and/or weight of the collected plasma component. Additionally or alternatively, determining the hematocrit of the donor may include monitoring a volume of red blood cells collection within the blood separation device. In such embodiments, the determined hematocrit of the donor may be based, at least in part, on the monitored volume of red blood cells collected within the blood separation device and the volume of whole blood withdrawn from the donor.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The target volume of pure plasma may be based, at least in part, on the weight of the donor. The percentage of anticoagulant in the collected plasma component may include at least a portion of the anticoagulant introduced into the withdrawn blood and at least a portion of a volume of anticoagulant that is added to the system during a priming step. After collecting at least a portion of the target volume of pure plasma, the method may return the second blood component to the donor through a return line.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In accordance with additional embodiments, a system for collecting plasma includes a venous-access device for drawing whole blood from a subject and returning blood components to the subject, and a blood component separation device for separating the drawn blood into a plasma component and a second blood component. The blood component separation device has an outlet and is configured to send the plasma component to a plasma container. The system may also include a blood draw line fluidly connected to the venous-access device and an anticoagulant line connected to an anticoagulant source. The blood draw line transports drawn whole blood to the blood component separation device, and the flow through the blood draw line may be controlled by a blood draw pump. The anticoagulant line may introduce anticoagulant into the drawn whole blood.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Additionally, the system may include a controller that controls the operation of the centrifuge bowl. The controller may also calculate (1) a percentage of anticoagulant in the collected plasma component, and (2) a volume of pure plasma collected within the plasma container. The volume of pure plasma may be based, at least in part, upon the percentage of anticoagulant in the collected plasma component. The controller may stop the blood draw pump when a target volume of pure plasma (e.g., based, at least in part, on the weight of the donor) is collected within the plasma container. In some embodiments, the percentage of anticoagulant in the collected plasma component may be based, at least in part, on the volume of anticoagulant added to the drawn whole blood and the subject's hematocrit.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The system may also include an anticoagulant source weight sensor that measures the weight of the anticoagulant source. The controller may monitor the change in volume within the anticoagulant container based on the measured weight of the anticoagulant source, and the calculated percentage of anticoagulant in the collected plasma may be based, at least in part, on the change in volume within the anticoagulant source. Additionally or alternatively, the controller may monitor the number of rotations of an anticoagulant pump to determine a volume of anticoagulant introduced into the whole blood. In such embodiments, the calculated percentage of anticoagulant in the collected plasma may be based, at least in part, on the number of rotations of the anticoagulant pump.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments, the system may include an optical sensor located on the blood component separation device. The optical sensor may monitor the contents of the blood component separation device and determine if a volume of anticoagulant remains within the blood component separation device. The calculated percentage of anticoagulant in the collected plasma may be based, at least in part, on the volume of anticoagulant within the blood component separation device.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In additional embodiments, the system may also include a plasma container weight sensor that monitors a volume and/or weight of the plasma component collected within the plasma collection container. The calculated volume of pure plasma collected within the plasma collection container may be based, at least in part, on the monitored volume and/or weight of collected plasma component. The system may also have an optical sensor located on the blood component separation device. The optical sensor may monitor the volume of red blood cells collected within the blood separation device. The controller may then determine the subject's hematocrit based, at least in part, upon on the monitored volume of red blood cells collected within the blood separation device and the volume of whole blood withdrawn from the donor. The percentage of anticoagulant in the collected plasma component may include at least a portion of the anticoagulant introduced into the withdrawn blood and at least a portion of a volume of anticoagulant added to the system during a priming step.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The foregoing features of the invention will be more readily understood by reference to the following detailed description, taken with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> schematically shows a perspective view of a blood processing system in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> schematically shows a top view of the blood processing system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> schematically shows a disposable set installed within the blood processing system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a flowchart depicting a method of collecting plasma, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Illustrative embodiments of the present invention provide blood processing systems and methods for collecting a target volume of pure plasma. The system and method calculate a percentage of anticoagulant collected within a plasma collection container (e.g., in addition to the plasma that is collected within the container) based on the amount of anticoagulant added to the system and the hematocrit of the donor. The system/method may then calculate the volume of pure plasma (e.g., plasma without anticoagulant) that has been collected within the container. Details of the illustrative embodiments are discussed below.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, the blood processing system <b>100</b> includes a cabinet <b>110</b> that houses the main components of the system <b>100</b> (e.g., the non-disposable components). Within the cabinet <b>110</b>, the system <b>100</b> may include a first/blood pump <b>232</b> that draws whole blood from a subject, and a second/anticoagulant pump <b>234</b> that pumps anticoagulant through the system <b>100</b> and into the drawn whole blood. Additionally, the system <b>100</b> may include a number of valves that may be opened and/or closed to control the fluid flow through the system <b>100</b>. For example, the system <b>100</b> may include a donor valve <b>120</b> that may open and close to selectively prevent and allow fluid flow through a donor line <b>218</b> (e.g., an inlet line; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>), and a plasma valve <b>130</b> that selectively prevents and allows fluid flow through an outlet/plasma line <b>222</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). Some embodiments may also include a saline valve <b>135</b> that selectively prevents and allows saline to flow through a saline line <b>223</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">To facilitate the connection and installation of a disposable set and to support the corresponding fluid containers, the system <b>100</b> may include an anticoagulant pole <b>150</b> on which the anticoagulant solution container <b>210</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) may be hung, and a saline pole <b>160</b> on which a saline solution container <b>217</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) may be hung (e.g., if the procedure being performed requires the use of saline). Additionally, in some applications, it may be necessary and/or desirable to filter the whole blood drawn from the subject for processing.

Accordingly, to facilitate operation of the separation device <b>214</b>, the system <b>100</b> may also include a well <b>180</b> in which the separation device <b>214</b> may be placed and in which the separation device <b>214</b> rotates (e.g., to generate the centrifugal forces required to separate the whole blood).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">To allow the user/technician to monitor the system operation and control/set the various parameters of the procedure, the system <b>100</b> may include a user interface <b>190</b> (e.g., a touch screen device) that displays the operation parameters, any alarm messages, and buttons which the user/technician may depress to control the various parameters. Additional components of the blood processing system <b>100</b> are discussed in greater detail below (e.g., in relation to the system operation).</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic block diagram of the blood processing system <b>100</b> and a disposable collection set <b>200</b> (with an inlet disposable set <b>200</b>A and an outlet disposable set <b>200</b>B) that may be loaded onto/into the blood processing system <b>100</b>, in accordance with the present invention. The collection set <b>200</b> includes a venous access device <b>206</b> (e.g., a phlebotomy needle) for withdrawing blood from a donor's arm <b>208</b>, a container of anti-coagulant <b>210</b>, a centrifugation bowl <b>214</b> (e.g., a blood component separation device), a saline container <b>217</b>, and a final plasma collection bag <b>216</b>. The blood/inlet line <b>218</b> couples the venous access device <b>206</b> to an inlet port <b>220</b> of the bowl <b>214</b>, the plasma/outlet line <b>222</b> couples an outlet port <b>224</b> of the bowl <b>214</b> to the plasma collection bag <b>216</b>, and a saline line <b>223</b> connects the outlet port <b>224</b> of the bowl <b>214</b> to the saline container <b>217</b>. An anticoagulant line <b>225</b> connects the anti-coagulant container <b>210</b> to the inlet line <b>218</b>. In addition to the components mentioned above and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the blood processing system <b>100</b> includes a controller <b>226</b>, a motor <b>228</b>, and a centrifuge chuck <b>230</b>. The controller <b>226</b> is operably coupled to the two pumps <b>232</b> and <b>234</b>, and to the motor <b>228</b>, which, in turn, drives the chuck <b>230</b>. The controller <b>226</b> may be operably coupled to and in communication with the user interface <b>190</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In operation, the disposable collection set <b>200</b> (e.g., the inlet disposable set <b>200</b>A and the outlet disposable set <b>200</b>B) may be loaded onto/into the blood processing system <b>10</b> prior to blood processing. In particular, the blood/inlet line <b>218</b> is routed through the blood/first pump <b>232</b> and the anticoagulant line <b>225</b> from the anti-coagulant container <b>210</b> is routed through the anticoagulant/second pump <b>234</b>. The centrifugation bowl <b>214</b> may then be securely loaded into the chuck <b>230</b>. Once the bowl <b>214</b> is secured in place, the technician may install the outlet disposable set <b>200</b>B. For example the technician may connect a bowl connector <b>300</b> to the outlet <b>224</b> of the bowl <b>214</b>, install the plasma container <b>216</b> into the weight senor <b>195</b>, run the saline line <b>223</b> through valve <b>135</b>, and run the plasma/outlet line <b>222</b> through valve <b>130</b> and the line sensor <b>185</b>. Once the disposable set <b>200</b> is installed and the anticoagulant and saline containers <b>210</b>/<b>217</b> are connected, the system <b>100</b> is ready to begin blood processing.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a flowchart depicting an exemplary method of collecting plasma in accordance with various embodiments of the present invention. Prior to connecting the donor to the blood processing device <b>100</b>, it is beneficial (and perhaps necessary in some instances) to obtain/determine some information regarding the donor, namely, the donor's weight (Step <b>410</b>) and hematocrit (Step <b>415</b>). Not only does this information help determine if the individual is a viable donor and the volumes of blood components that may be withdrawn/collected (e.g., per the FDA guidelines), the hematocrit may be used during processing to help collect a target volume of plasma. The technician may obtain/determine the donor's weight by weighing the donor (e.g., on a scale). To obtain/determine the donor's hematocrit, the technician may draw a blood sample from the donor and test the sample of blood. Additionally or alternatively, as discussed in greater detail below, the system may determine the hematocrit during blood processing. For example, the blood processing device <b>100</b> may include a hematocrit sensor (not shown) that determines the hematocrit of the blood flowing into the blood processing device <b>100</b> and/or the system <b>100</b> may determine the hematocrit based on a volume of red blood cells collected within the bowl <b>214</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Once the lines <b>222</b>/<b>223</b> are in place and the technician has determined the donor's weight and/or hematocrit (if needed), the user/technician may insert the venous access device <b>206</b> into the donor's arm <b>208</b> (Step <b>420</b>). Next, the controller <b>226</b> activates the two pumps <b>232</b>, <b>234</b> and the motor <b>228</b>. Operation of the two pumps <b>232</b>, <b>234</b> causes whole blood to be drawn from the donor (step <b>425</b>), anticoagulant from container <b>210</b> to be introduced into the drawn whole blood (step <b>430</b>), and the now anticoagulated whole blood to be delivered to the inlet port <b>220</b> of the bowl <b>214</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">It should be noted that the anticoagulant line <b>225</b> may also include a bacteria filter (not shown) that prevents any bacteria in the anticoagulant source <b>210</b>, the anticoagulant, or the anticoagulant line <b>225</b> from entering the system <b>100</b> and/or the subject. Additionally, the anticoagulant line <b>225</b> may include an air detector <b>140</b> that detects the presence of air within the anticoagulant. The presence of air bubbles within any of the system <b>100</b> lines can be problematic for the operation the system <b>100</b> and may also be harmful to the subject if the air bubbles enter the blood stream. Therefore, the air detector may be connected to an interlock that stops the flow within the anticoagulant line <b>225</b> in the event that an air bubble is detected (e.g., by stopping the anticoagulant pump <b>234</b>), thereby preventing the air bubbles from entering the subject.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As the anti-coagulated whole blood is withdrawn from the subject and contained within the blood component separation device <b>214</b>, the blood component separation device <b>214</b> separates the whole blood into several blood components (Step <b>435</b>). For example, the blood component separation device <b>214</b> may separate the whole blood into a first, second, third, and, perhaps, fourth blood component. More specifically, the blood component separation device <b>214</b> (and the centrifugal forces created by rotation of the separation device <b>214</b>) can separate the whole blood into plasma, platelets, red blood cells (&#x201c;RBC&#x201d;), and, perhaps, white blood cells (&#x201c;WBC&#x201d;). The higher density component, i.e., RBC, is forced to the outer wall of the bowl <b>214</b> while the lower density plasma lies nearer the core. A buffy coat is formed between the plasma and the RBC. The buffy coat is made up of an inner layer of platelets, a transitional layer of platelets and WBC and an outer layer of WBC. The plasma is the component closest to the outlet port and is the first fluid component displaced from the bowl <b>214</b> via the outlet port <b>224</b> as additional anticoagulated whole blood enters the bowl <b>214</b> through the inlet port <b>220</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the system <b>100</b> may also include an optical sensor <b>213</b> that may be applied to a shoulder portion of the bowl <b>214</b>. The optical sensor monitors each layer of the blood components as they gradually and coaxially advance toward the core from the outer wall of the bowl <b>214</b>. The optical sensor <b>213</b> may be mounted in a position (e.g., within the well <b>180</b>) at which it can detect the buffy coat and/or the red blood cells reaching a particular radius, and the steps of drawing the whole blood from the subject/donor and introducing the whole blood into the bowl <b>12</b> may be altered and/or terminated in response to the detection.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Additionally, in some embodiments, the optical sensor <b>213</b> may be used to determine the hematocrit of the donor during processing. For example, as the bowl <b>214</b> fills with red blood cells and the optical sensor <b>213</b> detects the layer of red blood cells, the system <b>100</b> (e.g., the controller) can determine the volume of red blood cells within bowl <b>214</b> based on the location of the red blood cell layer and the fixed/known bowl volume. The system <b>100</b> may then calculate the donor hematocrit based on the volume of red blood cells within the bowl and the volume of whole blood that has been processed to that point.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Once the blood component separation device <b>214</b> has separated the blood into the various components, one or more of the components can be removed from the blood component separation device <b>214</b>. For instance, the plasma may be removed to a plasma container <b>216</b> (e.g., a plasma bottle) through line <b>222</b> (Step <b>440</b>). As noted above, some embodiments of the system <b>100</b> may include a weight sensor <b>195</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) that measures the amount of plasma collected. The plasma collection process may continue until the a target volume of pure plasma (discussed in greater detail below) is collected within the plasma collection container <b>216</b>. Although not shown, if the blood processing system <b>100</b> and/or the disposable set <b>200</b> include platelet, red blood cell, and/or white blood cell bags, each of the bags/containers may include similar weight sensors (e.g., load cells).</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some embodiments, the system <b>100</b> may also include a line sensor <b>185</b> (mentioned above) that can determine the type of fluid (e.g., plasma, platelets, red blood cells etc.) exiting the blood component separation device <b>214</b>. In particular, the line sensor <b>185</b> consists of an LED which emits light through the blood components leaving the bowl <b>214</b> and a photo detector which receives the light after it passes through the components. The amount of light received by the photo detector is correlated to the density of the fluid passing through the line. For example, if plasma is exiting the bowl <b>214</b>, the line sensor <b>185</b> will be able to detect when the plasma exiting the bowl <b>214</b> becomes cloudy with platelets (e.g., the fluid existing the bowl <b>214</b> is changing from plasma to platelets). The system <b>100</b> may then use this information to either stop the removal of blood components from the bowl <b>214</b>, stop drawing whole blood from the subject, or redirect the flow by, for example, closing one valve an opening another.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">It is important to note that during processing, the osmolarity of the red blood cells prevents the anticoagulant introduced into the whole blood from entering/remaining with the red blood cells (e.g., within the bowl <b>214</b>). Rather, the anticoagulant mixes with the plasma component. Therefore, the anticoagulant exits the bowl <b>214</b> with the plasma and is collected within collection container <b>216</b> along with the plasma. In other words, the weight of the product measured by the weight senor <b>195</b> is the weight of the plasma, as well as any anticoagulant that is mixed with the plasma&#x2014;the weight provided by the weight sensor <b>195</b> is not the weight of pure plasma.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Additionally, whole blood contains a variable amount of plasma, as determined by the donor's hematocrit. The hematocrit for typical donors can vary from 38% to 54%, which means that for 100 ml of whole blood, the volume of plasma can vary from 36 to 62 ml. Furthermore, the amount of anticoagulant added to the withdrawn whole blood is fixed (e.g., it does not depend on the hematocrit of the donor), meaning that the percentage of anticoagulant in the collected plasma may vary from 9.7% to 12.7% for donor hematocrits between 38% to 54%, respectively. Therefore, not only does the volume measured by the weight sensor <b>195</b> include the volume of anticoagulant, that volume of anticoagulant may vary from donor to donor based on the hematocrit.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">As mentioned above, some embodiments of the present invention continue the blood processing/separation procedure until a target volume of pure plasma (e.g., plasma only&#x2014;without the volume of any anticoagulant mixed with the plasma included in the target volume) is collected within the plasma collection container <b>216</b>. To that end, some embodiments of the present invention may calculate the volume of pure plasma within the plasma collection container <b>216</b>. For example, the technician or the system <b>100</b> (e.g., the controller) may calculate the percentage of anticoagulant within the collected plasma (Step <b>455</b>) (e.g., the plasma contained within the plasma collection container <b>216</b>) based on the amount of anticoagulant added/metered into the whole blood and the hematocrit of the donor. The technician and/or system can calculate the percentage of anticoagulant according to the following equation, where AC is the amount of anticoagulant added to the system <b>100</b>. As noted above, because the osmolarity of the red blood cells prevents the anticoagulant from mixing with it, essentially all of the anticoagulant exits the bowl <b>214</b> and is collected within the plasma collection container <b>216</b> along with the plasma.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mrow>   <mi>%</mi>   <mo>&#x2062;</mo>   <mi>A</mi>   <mo>&#x2062;</mo>   <mi>C</mi>  </mrow>  <mo>=</mo>  <mfrac>   <mn>1</mn>   <mrow>    <mn>1</mn>    <mo>+</mo>    <mrow>     <mrow>      <mo>(</mo>      <mrow>       <mrow>        <mi>A</mi>        <mo>&#x2062;</mo>        <mi>C</mi>       </mrow>       <mo>-</mo>       <mn>1</mn>      </mrow>      <mo>)</mo>     </mrow>     <mo>&#x2062;</mo>     <mrow>      <mo>(</mo>      <mrow>       <mn>1</mn>       <mo>-</mo>       <msub>        <mi>Hct</mi>        <mi>D</mi>       </msub>      </mrow>      <mo>)</mo>     </mrow>    </mrow>   </mrow>  </mfrac> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0041" num="0039">The amount of anticoagulant that is added to the system <b>100</b> can be determined in a number of ways. For example, the system <b>100</b> can base the amount of anticoagulant (e.g., the value of &#x201c;AC&#x201d; in the above equation) on the predetermined ratio of anticoagulant per unit of anticoagulated whole blood. In some embodiments, the value of &#x201c;AC&#x201d; may be the inverse of the predetermined ratio (e.g., &#x201c;AC&#x201d; would be 16 if the ratio of anticoagulant to anticoagulated whole blood was 1:16). Additionally or alternatively, the technician/system <b>100</b> can monitor the volume of anticoagulant added to the system. In such embodiments, the technician/system can monitor the volume of anticoagulant added to the system <b>100</b> based on the number of rotations of the anticoagulant pump (e.g., each rotation of the anticoagulant pump introduces a set volume of anticoagulant into the system <b>100</b>) and/or based on the change in weight of the anticoagulant container <b>210</b> as measured by a weight sensor (discussed in greater detail below).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0040">Once the technician/system <b>100</b> has calculated the percentage of anticoagulant within the plasma collection container <b>216</b>, the technician/system <b>100</b> may then use this information to calculate the volume of pure plasma within the plasma collection container <b>216</b> (Step <b>465</b>). For example, the technician/system <b>100</b> may determine the volume of anticoagulant within the container (based on the percentage of anticoagulant within the container <b>216</b>) and subtract this volume from the total volume of fluid within the container <b>216</b> as measured by the weight sensor <b>195</b>. The system <b>100</b> may continue to monitor the volume of pure plasma collected within the container <b>216</b> and continue processing whole blood (e.g., continue performing Steps <b>425</b>, <b>430</b>, <b>435</b>, <b>440</b>, <b>455</b>, <b>460</b> and <b>465</b>) until a target volume of pure plasma is collected within the plasma collection container <b>216</b> (Step <b>470</b>) (e.g., 800 mL for an adult donor weighing more than 175 pounds or other limit prescribed by the FDA or similar governing body).</p><p id="p-0043" num="0041">Once the system <b>100</b> has collected the target volume of pure plasma within the plasma collection container <b>216</b>, the system <b>100</b> can return the remaining components (e.g., the components remaining within the bowl <b>214</b>) to the subject (Step <b>475</b>). For example, when all the plasma has been removed and the bowl <b>214</b> is full of RBCs (and any other blood component not collected), the controller <b>226</b> stops the draw of whole blood from the subject and reverses the direction of the blood/first pump <b>232</b> to draw the RBCs (and other components) from the bowl <b>214</b> directly back to the subject. Alternatively, if the system <b>100</b> is so equipped, the system may return the components to the subject via a dedicated return line.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0042">In addition to the non-collected blood components (e.g., the components remaining in the bowl <b>214</b>), the system <b>100</b> may also return saline to the patient/subject. The saline may be used as a compensation fluid to make up for the volume of the blood component (e.g., plasma) that was removed and collected, and is not being returned to the patient. To that end, during the return step (e.g., Step <b>475</b>), the saline valve <b>135</b> may be opened to allow saline from the saline container <b>217</b> to flow through the saline line <b>223</b> and into the bowl <b>214</b> (via outlet <b>224</b>), where it can be returned to the patient/donor with or after the remaining blood components.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0043">It should be noted that some embodiments may perform some additional and optional steps to help determine the volume of pure plasma within the plasma collection container <b>216</b>. For example, as mentioned above, some embodiments may monitor the change in weight of the anticoagulant container <b>210</b> (e.g., as measured by a weight sensor/load cell on the anticoagulant container <b>210</b>) (step <b>445</b>). This measurement provides an indication of the volume of anticoagulant that has been added to the system <b>100</b>, and may be used help determine the percentage of anticoagulant within the plasma collection container <b>216</b>. Additionally or alternatively, some embodiments may similarly, monitor the change in weight and/or volume of the plasma and anticoagulant collected within the plasma collection container <b>216</b> (e.g., via weight sensor <b>195</b>) (step <b>450</b>). This measurement may be used to calculate of the total volume of pure plasma collected within the plasma collection container <b>216</b> (e.g., to obtain the total weight from which to subtract the calculated volume of anticoagulant).</p><p id="p-0046" num="0044">Some embodiments may also (optionally) monitor the volume of anticoagulant remaining in the bowl <b>214</b> (step <b>460</b>) (e.g., anticoagulant that did not mix with the plasma and/or otherwise remained in the bowl). For example, the system <b>100</b> may utilize the optical sensor on the bowl <b>214</b> to determine whether any anticoagulant remains within the bowl <b>214</b>. If it does, the method <b>400</b>/system <b>100</b> may modify the calculation of the amount of pure plasma collected within the plasma collection container (e.g., either increase the calculated amount or decreased the calculated amount), based on the volume of anticoagulant remaining within the bowl <b>214</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0045">Various embodiment of the present invention provide numerous benefits over prior art plasma collection systems. In particular, as noted above, prior art plasmapheresis devices end plasma collection based on a total volume of anticoagulated plasma (e.g., pure plasma plus the added anticoagulant). Although this is the easiest method because it requires only that the product collection container be weighed, the amount of true product&#x2014;the pure plasma&#x2014;is dependent on the donor's hematocrit. In other words, prior art systems will collect more plasma from low hematocrit donors than from high hematocrit donors because of the variation of the percentage of anticoagulant in the product. Various embodiments of the present invention address the issues of prior art systems by collecting a standard volume (e.g., a target volume) of pure plasma from each donor. As noted above, embodiments of the present invention accomplish this by using knowledge of the donor's hematocrit and the amount of anticoagulant collected within the plasma collection container <b>216</b> (e.g., by counting pump rotations and/or using scale/weight sensors, etc.) to determine the percentage of anticoagulant in the product. Additionally, by stopping the plasma collection process based on a volume of pure plasma collected, embodiments of the present invention are able to collect a greater volume of plasma as compared to prior art systems that stop based on a plasma/anticoagulant mixture.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0046">It is also important to note that, although the various embodiments discussed above are in relation to a blood processing system that collects plasma, the features discussed herein may be applied to any type of blood processing system.
