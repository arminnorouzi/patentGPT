Moreover, the present invention relates to laminated glass prepared with the interlayer film for laminated glass.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Since laminated glass generally generates only a small amount of scattering glass fragments even when subjected to external impact and broken, laminated glass is excellent in safety. As such, the laminated glass is widely used for automobiles, railway vehicles, aircraft, ships, buildings and the like. The laminated glass is produced by sandwiching an interlayer film for laminated glass between a pair of glass plates.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Moreover, as the laminated glass used for automobiles, a head-up display (HUD) has been known. In a HUD, it is possible to display measured information including automobile traveling data such as speed on the windshield of the automobile, and the driver can recognize as if the display were shown in front of the windshield.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the HUD, there is a problem that the measured information or the like is doubly observed.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to suppress double images, a wedge-shaped interlayer film has been used. The following Patent Document 1 discloses a sheet of laminated glass in which a wedge-shaped interlayer film having a prescribed wedge angle is sandwiched between a pair of glass plates. In such a sheet of laminated glass, by the adjustment of the wedge angle of the interlayer film, a display of measured information reflected by one glass plate and a display of measured information reflected by the other glass plate can be focused into one point to make an image in the visual field of a driver. For that reason, the display of measured information is hard to be observed doubly and the visibility of a driver is hardly hindered.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">RELATED ART DOCUMENT</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Patent Document</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Patent Document 1: JP H4-502525 T</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In recent years, an attempt has been made to make the display position recognized by the driver be farther from the driver, for example, by increasing the focal distance of the projector. However, in such a display, the display of measured information or the like can be more likely to be observed doubly compared with the case where the display position is close to the driver.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In conventional interlayer films, it is difficult to sufficiently suppress double image in the aforementioned case. Investigation carried out by the present inventors led to the finding that only controlling a wedge angle cannot sufficiently suppress double images in the aforementioned case.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">An object of the present invention is to provide an interlayer film for laminated glass with which double images can be significantly suppressed in laminated glass even when the display position is farther from the driver. Moreover, the present invention also aims at providing laminated glass prepared with the above-mentioned interlayer film for laminated glass.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Means for Solving the Problems</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to a broad aspect of the present invention, there is provided an interlayer film for laminated glass (in this specification, &#x201c;interlayer film for laminated glass&#x201d;

Then, for example, by passing the obtained laminate through pressure rolls or subjecting the obtained laminate to decompression suction in a rubber bag, the air remaining between the first lamination glass member and the interlayer film, and between the second lamination glass member and the interlayer film is removed. Then, the laminate is preliminarily bonded together at about 70 to 110&#xb0; C. to obtain a preliminarily press-bonded laminate. Next, by putting the preliminarily press-bonded laminate into an autoclave or by pressing the laminate, the laminate is press-bonded at about 120 to 150&#xb0; C. and under a pressure of 1 to 1.5 MPa. In this way, laminated glass can be obtained.</p><p id="p-0241" num="0239">The laminated glass can be used for automobiles, railway vehicles, aircraft, ships, buildings, and the like.

The laminated glass can be used for a windshield, side glass, rear glass, or roof glass of an automobile, and the like.
