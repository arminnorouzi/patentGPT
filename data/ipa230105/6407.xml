idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a configuration example of a control device <b>9</b> included in the laser annealing apparatus <b>1</b>. The laser annealing apparatus <b>1</b> (laser irradiation apparatus) is, for example, an excimer laser annealing (ELA) apparatus for forming a low temperature poly-silicon (LTPS) film.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The laser annealing apparatus <b>1</b> irradiates a silicon film formed on a substrate <b>8</b> with laser light. In this way, it is possible to convert an amorphous silicon film (a-Si film) into a polycrystalline silicon film (polysilicon film: p-Si film). For example, the substrate <b>8</b> is a transparent substrate such as a glass substrate.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As illustrated in the figure of the present embodiment, in a XYZ three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, a Z-direction is a vertical direction and is a direction perpendicular to the substrate <b>8</b>. An XY-plane is a plane parallel to a plane on which the silicon film of the substrate <b>8</b> is formed. For example, an X-direction is a longitudinal direction of the rectangular substrate <b>8</b>, and a Y-direction is a lateral direction of the substrate <b>8</b>. When using a &#x398;-axis stage <b>71</b> that can rotate from 0&#xb0; to 90&#xb0; about a Z-axis, the X-direction can be the lateral direction of the substrate <b>8</b> and the Y direction can be the longitudinal direction of the substrate <b>8</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The laser annealing apparatus <b>1</b> includes an annealing optical system <b>11</b>, a laser irradiation chamber <b>7</b>, and a control device <b>9</b>. The laser irradiation chamber <b>7</b> accommodates a base <b>72</b> and a stage <b>71</b> disposed on the base <b>72</b>. In the laser annealing apparatus <b>1</b>, a silicon film <b>201</b> is irradiated with laser light while the substrate <b>8</b> is conveyed in a +X-direction by the stage <b>71</b>. The laser annealing apparatus <b>1</b> further includes a biplanar phototube <b>62</b>, an OED sensor <b>63</b>, and an unevenness monitor <b>64</b> as a detection unit that detects information with regard to emitted laser light.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The annealing optical system <b>11</b> is an optical system for generating laser light for crystallizing an amorphous silicon film formed on the substrate <b>8</b> and converting the amorphous silicon film into a polysilicon film, and irradiating the amorphous silicon film with the laser light. The annealing optical system <b>11</b> is an optical system including a laser light source <b>2</b> including a first laser light source <b>21</b> and a second laser light source <b>22</b>, a first attenuator <b>31</b>, a second attenuator <b>32</b>, a synthetic optical system <b>5</b>, a beam shaping optical system <b>6</b>, an epi-illumination mirror <b>61</b>, and a projection lens <b>65</b> and emitting laser light obtained by synthesizing a plurality of laser light rays.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The laser light source <b>2</b> includes the first laser light source <b>21</b> and the second laser light source <b>22</b>, and includes a plurality of laser light sources <b>2</b>. In the present embodiment, a two-laser light source configuration of the first laser light source <b>21</b> and the second laser light source <b>22</b> is adopted. However, the disclosure is not limited thereto, and the laser light source <b>2</b> may include three or more laser light sources <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The first laser light source <b>21</b> and the second laser light source <b>22</b> are laser generators that generate pulsed laser light as laser light for irradiating the amorphous silicon film (processed object). The generated laser light is laser light for crystallizing a non-crystalline film on the substrate <b>8</b> to form a crystallized film, and is, for example, gas laser light such as excimer laser light having a center wavelength of 308 nm. Alternatively, gas laser light is not limited to excimer laser light, and may be another gas laser such as a CO<sub>2 </sub>laser.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the first laser light source <b>21</b> and the second laser light source <b>22</b>, a gas such as xenon is enclosed in a chamber, and two resonator mirrors are disposed to face each other with the gas interposed therebetween. A resonator mirror is a total reflection mirror that reflects all light, and a resonator mirror is a partial reflection mirror that transmits a part of light. Gas light excited by the gas is repeatedly reflected between the resonator mirrors, and amplified light is emitted from the resonator mirror as laser light. For example, the first laser light source <b>21</b> and the second laser light source <b>22</b> repeatedly emit pulsed laser light in a cycle of 500 Hz to 600 Hz. The first laser light source <b>21</b> emits the laser light toward the first attenuator <b>31</b>. The second laser light source <b>22</b> emits the laser light toward the second attenuator <b>32</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The first attenuator <b>31</b> and the second attenuator <b>32</b> attenuate incident laser light to adjust an energy density to a predetermined energy density. As a characteristic, these attenuators have a transmittance indicating a ratio of the emitted laser light to the incident laser light, and the transmittance is configured to be variable based on a signal from the control device <b>9</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The first attenuator <b>31</b> is provided in the middle of an optical path from the first laser light source <b>21</b> to the synthetic optical system <b>5</b>. The second attenuator <b>32</b> is provided in the middle of an optical path from the second laser light source <b>22</b> to the synthetic optical system <b>5</b>. The first attenuator <b>31</b> attenuates laser light emitted by the first laser light source <b>21</b> according to the transmittance. The second attenuator <b>32</b> attenuates laser light emitted by the second laser light source <b>22</b> according to the transmittance.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The density E11 of energy emitted from the first attenuator <b>31</b> is a value (E11=E1&#xd7;T1) obtained by multiplying the energy density E1 of laser light emitted from the first laser light source <b>21</b> by the transmittance T1 of the first attenuator <b>31</b>.
