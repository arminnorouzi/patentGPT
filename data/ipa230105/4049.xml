application relates to liquid crystal optical devices.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Optical gradient index devices are well known in the prior art, e.g., gradient index lenses and prisms (Moore, D. T., <i>Gradient</i>-<i>index optics: a review</i>. Applied Optics, 1980. 19(7): p. 1035-1038). Making these devices adaptable (enabling the dynamic change of their gradient) can increase significantly their functionality and efficiency. This would require optical materials that are sensitive to external stimuli. Various materials, including liquid crystals (LC) are sensitive to such stimuli, e.g., electric or magnetic fields (de Gennes, P.-G. and J. Prost, <i>The physics of liquid crystals</i>. Oxford University Press, USA, 1995. 2: p. 4). Thus, we could use electric field gradients to obtain the desired profile of refractive index by using LC materials (e.g., to build an electrically tunable LC lens or TLCL).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Indeed, different techniques have been developed to obtain such a gradient of electric field. One of the most straightforward ways is the use of patterned (circular, to obtain a lens, or linear, to obtain a prism) electrodes in a sandwich device (made of two substrates) containing the LC material. In the case of a lens-type device, one of its substrates is usually covered by a uniform transparent electrode (indium tin oxide or ITO), while the second one has a hole patterned electrode (HPE), <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a</i></figref>. In this case, the electric field will be strong in the periphery (where the HPE is facing the uniform ITO electrode) and will be decreasing when we consider positions closer to the center of the device (far from the HPE). The electric field's decrease will be gradual at distances comparable with the separation D (shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>b</i></figref>) of two electrode planes (thanks to the so-called &#xab;fringing field&#xbb; effect), but it will be significant if the diameter of the HPE (or the clear aperture, CA, of the device, shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a</i></figref>) is much larger compared to the D (in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a</i></figref>, we have a case when D=L, where L is the thickness of the LC layer). Thus, the electric field's profile, the reaction of the LC and the corresponding profile of the refractive index gradient will be defined by the ratio of CA over D. In fact, it was shown that the best ratio R=CA/D should be at the order of 2.5 to have a soft change of the electric gradient allowing the generation of an optical gradient index lens with acceptable aberrations (Sato, S., <i>Applications of liquid crystals to variable</i>-<i>focusing lenses</i>. Optical Review, 1999. 6(6): p. 471-485.)</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, there are several limitations here: the choice of the thickness L of the LC is usually limited (L must be relatively small because of light scattering and relaxation time requirements) and the separation of electrodes D must be as small as possible to limit voltages U required to generate enough electric field E (where E=U/D) to reorient LC molecules. This limitation is related to the electrical power consumption of the device which is proportional to the square of the voltage applied to the device. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>b </i></figref>demonstrate a case, where, instead of increasing the L, the top electrode layer is shifted further to keep the ratio R optimal (for a given CA), but further are these electrodes higher will be the voltage to drive the device.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">This is the reason why we cannot use the &#xab;fringing field&#xbb; approach for relatively large values of CA, e.g., in the range from 0.1 mm to 10 mm, or specifically, in the range from 0.5 mm to 5 mm, used for imaging, ophthalmic and augmented reality applications. It may be useful to notice that such TLCLs or LC gradient index (LC-GRIN) lenses can generally be characterized as having an optical power that is inversely proportional to the aperture CA. In some optical imaging systems, the aperture must be much larger. Thus, the traditional LC-GRIN lens can not provide a noticeable optical power variation range. This is limiting the application of these devices in systems with large CA. Solutions have been proposed to increase the optical power at larger apertures in LC-GRIN lenses, such as to have the same lens operate as a both negative lens and then as a positive lens. However, the clear aperture size requirements remain still a problem if we try to generate a tunable lens over the entire CA.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Various solutions have been proposed to build devices with millimetric range of CA. One approach uses a high resistivity or weakly conductive layer (WCL) next to the HPE to help further propagate the fringing field towards the center of the device (Kahn, F., Electronically variable iris or stop mechanisms. 1973, US patent; Loktev, M. Y., et al., Wave front control systems based on modal liquid crystal lenses. Review of scientific instruments, 2000. 71(9): p. 3290-3297), <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. However, for millimetric size CAs, the sheet resistance value Rs for such a layer is in the Mega Ohm (per square) region and it is extremely difficult to produce uniform layers with such Rs in a reproducible way and to insure that they are environmentally stable (since very often a non-stochiometric/incomplete oxidation of metals must be maintained to obtain such Rs values).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The use of a number of individually-driven (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>a</i></figref>) or resistively interconnected (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>b</i></figref>) concentric ring electrodes has been proposed without the use of any WCL, however, this design leads to some aberrations at the connection points for each ring electrode and can result in artifacts due to the steps in electric field caused by the discrete ring electrodes.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Capacitive coupling between ring electrodes has also been proposed to simplify the drive of the electrodes by providing a single drive signal in the absence of any resistive interconnection to thus remove the aberrations at the connection points. This is taught in U.S. Pat. No. 9,201,285. With capacitive coupling, the gaps between the ring electrodes are covered by coupling electrodes at different levels (two electrode layers being separated by a dielectric isolation layer), such that the electric field gradient is smaller than in the case of discrete concentric ring electrodes that provide zero-potential gaps between the rings. However, this design is more difficult to build and can still lead to some artifacts due to the steps in electric field caused by the electrode structure.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In U.S. Pat. No. 8,421,990, there is taught that a spiral electrode can be arranged for a circular lens in which the resistance of the spiral electrode can be used over its length to reduce voltage, thus providing a suitable electric field spatial distribution over the aperture, and without needing to provide any WCL. Provided that the spacing or pitch between turns of the spiral electrode are small enough, the artifacts due to the steps in electric field caused by the discrete turns of the spiral electrode can be insignificant. However, as described in this patent, the ITO stripes must be strongly spaced generating discrete field transitions, light scattering, and lens quality degradation for millimetric lenses. Thus, such an approach will require the use of a transparent electrode having rather high resistance or small enough pitch for this approach to be suitable for millimetric lenses, both requirements remaining significant challenges (see hereafter).</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another approach to resolving the problem of using a high resistance layer (or WCL) associated with a hole-patterned electrode for creating a spatial distribution of voltage was proposed in the paper titled &#x201c;Liquid crystal multi-mode lenses and axicons based on electronic phase shift control&#x201d; by Andrew K. Kirby, Philip J. W. Hands, and Gordon D. Love, published in Optics Express, Vol. 15, No. 21, 17 Oct. 2007. In this paper, an ITO film is placed on the surface of one substrate and used in conjunction with two strip electrodes placed on opposed sides of the substrate and driven by phase-shifted voltages. The use of different phases of drive signals applied to the strip electrodes has been found to create a spatial distribution of voltage when the opposed electrode is grounded such that the arrangement produces a cylindrical lens between the strip electrodes. As reported in the paper, when the opposed substrate also has orthogonally arranged strip electrodes (rotated at 90 degrees with respect to the previous strips), a second pair of driving voltages can be used to create a combination of cylindrical spatial distribution of electric fields that provide for a tunable lens. However, given that signals of opposed phase (e.g., +5 V and &#x2212;5 V) are simultaneously applied at the opposed edges of a conductor, significant current flows through the uniform ITO increasing dramatically the power consumption of the device.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the paper by Algorri and Love, a WCL is added to a similar lens design that provides for a lens without the use of phase shifted drive signals. However, this approach re-introduces the problem of needing a WCL. Like the earlier Love's paper, it has the problem that the desired spatial profile of the electric field over the aperture is difficult to maintain since it is dependent on a uniform layer of ITO or WCL.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Liquid crystal optical devices are known in the art that dynamically modulate beams.

In PCT patent application publication WO2016/082031 published on 2 Jun. 2016, a variety of optical arrangements including liquid crystal devices are described for steering a beam.

Such HDCLs may be fabricated much easier compared to WCLs (some examples of suitable HDCL materials can be found in the article titled &#x201c;High dielectric constant oxides&#x201d; by J. Robertson, published on 2 Dec. 2004 in The European Physical Journal&#x2014;Applied Physics). Examples of stepped electrode designs are found in the previously mentioned prior art and can include different designs as disclosed hereinbelow. While most polymers and glass have a dielectric constant e in the range of 4 to 6 (air has a dielectric constant of 1), it has been found that transparent materials having a dielectric constant of about e=20 or greater can be applied to the discrete (stepped) spiral or serpentine shaped electrodes with the effect that the resulting electric field does not cause the LC to exhibit artefacts caused by the spatial steps in the voltage of the electrode. An alternative &#x201c;smoothening&#x201d; effect can be obtained also if we apply phase shifted signals to the opposed edges of these discrete electrodes. The combination of both approaches can be even more beneficial.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The use of an HDCL can likewise be used also with a network of capacitively-coupled electrodes with a similar &#x201c;smoothening&#x201d; effect, while the discretization in this case may be of less importance, making even possible the use of capacitively coupled electrodes with appropriate modifications and without the HDCL, in applications and embodiments we shall describe hereafter.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one example, Applicant used a coating of Ti<sub>3</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, cast on a suitably shaped ITO electrode spiral. The Ti<sub>3</sub>O<sub>5 </sub>layer was 100 nm thick in the example. Such a coating demonstrated significant improvement in the electric potential's profile to make the transmitted light wavefront's modulation soft enough to be acceptable for imaging applications. Other solid material candidates (for the HDCL) may be other metal oxides, such as Hafnium Oxide (HfO<sub>2</sub>), Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, ZrO<sub>2</sub>, etc.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The case of HfO<sub>2 </sub>is particularly interesting and useful since, in addition of having e=20, it also has a refractive index that is very close to the refractive index of ITO. This may enable the fabrication of index matched layers (by optically &#x201c;hiding&#x201d; the ITO pattern) that would minimize Fresnel reflections and diffraction from the combined layer of the ITO and HDCL.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some embodiments, an LC-GRIN cell device has two opposed substrates containing liquid crystal material with a uniform electrode arrangement on a first one of the substrates and a stepped electrode arrangement and a HDCL, placed near the stepped electrode arrangement, on a second one of the substrates.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some other embodiments, an LC-GRIN cell device has opposed substrates of the second type; that is, the first substrate has a stepped electrode arrangement and an HDCL and a second stepped electrode and an HDCL are present also on the second substrates.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some other embodiments, the above-mentioned LC-GRIN devices may be built without the HDCL and driven with specific phase shifted electrical signals to smoothen the electric field's profile (by averaging in time).</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The device can include an alignment structure, film or layer, so that the liquid crystal is well-aligned in a ground state, such as a rubbed surface coating for planar alignment or homeotropic substrate bonding for homeotropic alignment. Stepped electrode arrangements can include continuous spiral, continuous or discontinuous serpentine electrodes, capacitively coupled segments or rings, individually driven electrode rings or segments, etc. The device can be a circular or cylindrical lens, a beam steering device or a beam broadening or scattering device.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Applicant has further discovered that the problem of providing an electrode arrangement that will produce a desired electric field spatial distribution in an LC-GRIN lens can be solved by linear stepped electrode arrangements provided on opposed substrates of a liquid crystal cell and oriented orthogonal to each other. In such a design, each arrangement of electrodes on each substrate provides a cylindrical lens electric field distribution and the combination of the two arrangements (driven appropriately with phase shifted signals and averaged in time) yields a suitable spherical lens distribution. The desired LC spatial distribution can be controlled by the arrangement of electrodes, for example the spacing of the electrode segments, resistance or capacitive coupling between segments, the thickness of the liquid crystal layer, its dielectric parameters, etc. will influence the shape of the electric field generated.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Unlike WCL coated hole-patterned electrodes whose electric field is difficult to control precisely over the device aperture, orthogonally-arranged, opposed linear stepped electrode arrangements can be printed or laid-out to have a desired voltage drop across the aperture. Unlike individual powering of concentric ring electrodes for a circular lens, drive signals can be supplied to the stepped electrodes from outside the aperture without creating cut-line artefacts.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some embodiments, an LC-GRIN lens device has opposed substrates (containing liquid crystal) with linear stepped electrode arrangements provided on opposed substrates orthogonal to each other. The device can include an alignment structure so that the liquid crystal is ordered in a ground state, such as a rubbed surface coating for planar alignment or homeotropic substrate bonding for homeotropic alignment. Stepped electrode arrangements can include continuous serpentine electrodes, capacitively coupled segments or rings, individually driven electrode segments, etc.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Applicant has further discovered that the problem of providing good optical power of an LC-GRIN lens in an optical system having a large aperture can be solved by providing an LC-GRIN lens device with an electrode arrangement that permits the formation of a lens at a variable position within the entire optical window of the lens device. While LC-GRIN lenses with segmented circular electrodes are known that can have an optical axis that is slightly (significantly less than the diameter of the lens) moved by adjusting voltages applied to segmented electrodes for the purposes of optical image stabilization, the selective powering of different segments of an electrode arrangement to have a lens move (more than its diameter) is not known in the art. Indeed, such selective powering can be used to move a lens within the device by a distance greater than the radius of the lens and typically greater than the diameter of the lens. It can also be used to change the size of the lens and its profile to generate various forms of desired aberrations, an axicon, a prism, a cylindrical lens, Powell lens, etc. It is important to mention that the anamorphic (or Matrix, or Foveal) lens design disclosed herein allows for almost any desired waveform to be created, including positive and/or negative, circular and/or cylindrical lenses, prisms, axicons, etc.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some embodiments, an LC-GRIN lens device with an electrode arrangement that permits the formation of a lens at a variable position within the lens device that has linear electrode arrangements provided on opposed substrates orthogonal to each other that can be individually powered to define the location of the formation of the lens, wherein the electric field provided by each linear electrode arrangement on each substrate allows for the formation of a cylindrical variation in the electric field, the combination of which can be used to form a circular lens when the electrical drive signals are phase shifted. The device can include an alignment structure so that the liquid crystal is ordered in a ground state, such as a rubbed surface coating for planar alignment or homeotropic substrate bonding for homeotropic alignment. The strip electrode arrangements can include thin strips only, or thin strips laid on a high dielectric constant layer or a weakly conductive layer or highly resistive layer, continuous serpentine electrodes, capacitively coupled segments or rings, individually driven electrode segments, etc.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Such a lens device can form one or simultaneously multiple lenses having a diameter of about 0.5 mm to about 5 mm, with positioning of the lens within the full aperture of the device being from about every 0.1 mm to about every 1 mm. The total size of the device (the optical window within which the above-mentioned lens can be created and shifted) is not essentially limited except by the application; for example, it can be several centimeters large if needed.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Furthermore, the driving of the above-mentioned millimetric lenses may be achieved either by applying a continuous sequence of signals or may be time sequenced (as it is done in traditional liquid crystal display industry) to obtain &#x201c;local&#x201d; responses over the desired coordinates (positions) on the surface of above-mentioned large (multiple centimeter sized) device. Indeed, as it is well known in the traditional liquid crystal display industry (see, e.g., P. J. Collings and J. S. Patel, Handbook of Liquid Crystal Research, Oxford University Press, 1997), the application of time sequenced electrical signals to various electrode contacts will enable the generation of the lens effect mainly in desired (restricted in space) areas of the entire optical window, keeping the rest of the window almost unchanged.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the application of such an LC-GRIN lens device in panoramic or fish-eye cameras, a movement detection can be incorporated to enable the identification of a specific area of the tunable LC-GRIN lens to be activated enabling, for example, the increase of resolution or modulation of distortion in specific desired direction, e.g., for surveillance purposes, etc.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the ophthalmic distance accommodation or virtual reality application of eyeglasses, such an LC-GRIN lens device can be controlled to cause a near focus/far focus lens to appear at a location defined by the direction where the user is looking. The eyeglasses can include an eye-tracking device so that the lens can be caused to appear in a direction of viewing. Eye-tracking of each eye can be used to determine the direction and the focal depth for the purposes of determining a desired optical power of the tunable lens. While such eyeglasses can require electrical power, programmable eyeglasses can be provided that may be used in addition to prescription lenses or that may replace prescription lenses. Such corrective lenses can correct for astigmatism, myopia and/or presbyopia. The remote control of drive parameters can allow doctors to adjust and optimize the performance of such glasses during an ophthalmic check-up. When such eyeglasses provide two spaced-apart LC-GRIN devices, two lenses can be caused to appear before the user's eyes such that magnification (optical zoom) of the image can be provided.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Applicant has also found that there is a need to controllably modulate a portion of a beam so as to reduce the light brightness in the portion (in a specific angular range), while leaving a remainder of the same beam unmodulated. Such a need existing both for beam transmission (e.g., in automotive industry for safe driving) as well as for receiving or collecting a beam of light (in Lidars, sensors of simply in photographic imaging).</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Liquid crystal optical devices are disclosed that allow for light modulation to be selectively controlled within a portion of an aperture of the liquid crystal

electrically variable LC lens that is built by using a patterned (circular, to obtain a lens, or linear, to obtain a prism) electrode on one of the substrates of a sandwich device containing the LC material. The second substrate of the sandwich is typically covered by a uniform transparent electrode (indium tin oxide or ITO). In the case of a circular lens, the first electrode is hole patterned electrode (HPE).</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">In this case, the electric field is strong in the periphery of the lens (where the HPE is facing closely the uniform ITO electrode) and is decreasing gradually when we consider positions closer to the center of the device (far from the HPE's internal limit). The reaction of the LC and the corresponding profile of the refractive index gradient will be defined by the ratio R of the clear aperture CA over the separation of electrodes D (in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a</i></figref>, we have used D=L, where L is the thickness of the LC layer). It was shown that the desired order of magnitude of R is 2.5.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">The above-mentioned approach can be successful in a very narrow range of CA. However, there are several limitations in the case of millimetric ranges: to maintain good optical aberrations, the thickness L of the LC must be increased. However, larger L provides stronger light scattering and longer relaxation times. We could alternatively increase D, but it will increase the electrical power consumption. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>b </i></figref>demonstrate such a case, where, instead of increasing the L, the top electrode layer is shifted further to keep the ratio R optimal (for a given CA).</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">This is the reason why we cannot use the &#xab;fringing field&#xbb; approach for relatively large CA values, e.g., in the range from 0.1 mm to 10 mm, or more specifically, in the range from 0.5 mm to 5 mm, used for imaging, ophthalmic and augmented reality applications.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Various solutions have been proposed to build devices with millimetric range of CA. One approach uses a high resistivity or weakly conductive layer (WCL) to help further propagate the fringing field towards the center of the device (Kahn, F., Electronically variable iris or stop mechanisms. 1973, US patent, Loktev, M. Y., et al., Wave front control systems based on modal liquid crystal lenses. Review of scientific instruments, 2000. 71(9): p. 3290-3297), <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. However, for millimetric size CAs, the sheet resistance value Rs for such a layer is in the Mega Ohm (per square) region and it is extremely difficult to produce uniform layers with such Rs in a reproducible way and to insure that they are environmentally stable (since very often a non-stochiometric/incomplete oxidation of metals must be maintained to obtain such Rs values).</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">Given that the main challenge (for obtaining the desired profile of electric potential) is related to the design of the substrate with non-uniform (e.g., hole patterned) electrode, we shall further consider various (known and new, proposed here) versions of it (which we could call a &#xab;control substrate&#xbb;), keeping in mind that, usually, we need the opposed substrate also to obtain the final device.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">The fabrication of ITO layers is currently well mastered in the industry (see hereafter). Thus, several approaches were proposed to use patterned ITO (without the WCL) to obtain the required gradient of the electric field.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">Thus, one of them uses multiple very closely positioned discrete (up to 80) circular electrodes (Li, L., D. Bryant, and P. J. Bos, Liquid crystal lens with concentric electrodes and inter-electrode resistors. Liquid Crystals Reviews, 2014. 2(2): p. 130-154), which are controlled individually (like in LC displays, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>a</i></figref>) or are partially resistively bridged (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>b</i></figref>). While the use of bridged electrodes reduces the number of individually controlled electrodes, this is still a very costly and complex (both for manufacturing and operation) solution.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">An alternative technique of using extremely narrow ITO as a very resistive &#xab;transmission line&#xbb; (and phase shifted driving technique) was suggested (J. F. Algorri, N. Bennis, V. Urruchi, P. Morawiak, L. Jaroszewicz, J. M. Sanchez-Pena, Voltage divider trans-line liquid crystal lens, PC20, 15th European Conference on Liquid Crystals, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) to propagate the electric potential further towards the center of the device in the desired way (by distributing different values of the electrical potential from the center to the periphery). However, if the resistance of the transmission line is not high enough, the only way to create a spatial profile of electric field will be the &#x201c;forced&#x201d; or phase shifted control. In contrast, to obtain a &#x201c;natural&#x201d; decrease of the potential (e.g., when one of the contacts is powered, while the second one is floating) for millimetric range devices, the width of a standard ITO &#xab;transmission line&#xbb; (with a Rs value between 50 to 100 Ohm/square) must be sub micrometric, which is extremely difficult to obtain in a reproducible way at the industrial scale. Thus, even for a 0.5 micrometer width of the ITO transmission line, the drop of potential over 10 mm is less than 12%. Thus, the electric potential's modulation depth is very poor.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">Another approach of a spiral shaped ITO electrode was proposed (in U.S. Pat. No. 8,421,990 B2, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>a</i></figref>), which seems to be simpler to produce and to control. Indeed, if the parameters of the system are well designed, only one electric signal (with respect to the ground) is needed here to create and to control the lens. The electric potential is applied to the external electric contact <b>1</b>, while the central end of the ITO is let floating. The opposed substrate bears a uniform transparent electrode that can be grounded.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">However, in this approach, to propagate (with gradual decrease) the electric potential to millimetric scales (with typical LC materials, thicknesses of at the order of 50 micrometers), the width w of the ITO lane and the gap g between neighboring ITO lanes must be chosen in a way that the pitch of the ITO pattern (w+g) becomes comparable with the thickness of the LC layer L. In this case, the LC material's reaction will be abrupt (step wise between the zones with and without ITO) since the corresponding fringing field will not be able to &#xab;smoothen&#xbb; the electric field between ITO lanes. This will create light scattering and degradation of its wavefront. This is demonstrated in the photo of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>b</i></figref>. To obtain this photo, the LC cell (with unidirectionally oriented nematic LC, or NLC, sandwiched between two substrates one bearing a uniform ITO and the second one bearing a spiral shaped ITO) was placed between crossed polarizer and analyzer. Light passing through the polarizer enters into the LC cell and generates two polarization modes (ordinary and extra ordinary). They propagate with different phase delays, which depends upon the position of observation: more the molecules are reoriented less the phase delay is. For a parabolic profile of molecular reorientation, the analyzer will allow the transmission of light or block it depending upon the local phase delay. This generates concentric rings the distance between which is showing the 2&#x3c0; phase delay between the two polarization modes. Thus, the phase profile of light (passing through the lens) is visualized (one half of the device is shown only) here as bright and dark fringes. We can see multiple additional (see hereafter) discrete &#x201c;mini&#x201d; fringes due to the above mentioned effect of abrupt changes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>b</i></figref>).</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">To resolve the above-mentioned problem of wavefront degradation, we propose the use of a relatively high dielectric constant layer (HDCL), including the real, imaginary or both components. The proposed HDCL must be cast near the ITO pattern (e.g., cast under or above the patterned ITO layer, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b><i>a </i></figref>and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b><i>b</i></figref>). Its dielectric constant e may preferably be in the range of e=20 or above to be used for the range of CAs we are interested in. As a reference, air has e=1 and most polymers and glass materials have e in the range of 4 to 6.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">The experimental verification demonstrates that the proposed HDCL indeed smoothens the electric potential's profile and makes the light wavefront acceptable for imaging applications (see the photo of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b><i>c</i></figref>, obtained in the same conditions and with the same device as the one shown in the photo of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>b</i></figref>, but a 100 nm thick Ti<sub>3</sub>O<sub>5 </sub>was cast on the patterned, spiral-shaped, ITO). In contrast to the WCL, there are many industrially well-mastered optical materials with high e (see, e.g., J. Robertson, High dielectric constant oxides, Eur. Phys. J. Appl. Phys. 28, 265-291 (2004)). Thus, other solid material candidates (for the HDCL) may be other metal oxides, such as Hafnium Oxide (HfO<sub>2</sub>), Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, ZrO<sub>2</sub>, etc.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">The case of HfO<sub>2 </sub>is particularly interesting and useful since, in addition of having e=20, it also has a refractive index that is very close to the refractive index of ITO. This may enable the fabrication of index matched layers that would minimize Fresnel reflections from the combined layer of the ITO and HDCL (since the ITO layer will be optically &#x201c;hidden&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">We can also find some photopolymerizable LC materials which have high e (often they are anisotropic, so e<sub>II </sub>and e<sub>&#x22a5;</sub> are different and their difference &#x394;e &#x2261;e<sub>II</sub>&#x2212;e<sub>&#x22a5;</sub> can be rather high, well above 10).</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">Thus, in a first embodiment, to obtain millimetric scale devices with gradually changing electric field we propose to use a high dielectric constant material layer in the close proximity to the pattern of the ITO electrodes (under or above).</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">In a different embodiment, the substrate, that is bearing the ITO spiral, can itself be a material with high value of e.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">In a different embodiment, the LC materials can itself be a material with high value of e.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">In a different embodiment, the HDCL material can be a combination of layers.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">In a different embodiment, the substrate, that is bearing the ITO spiral, can contain a transparent electrode (preferably on its external surface, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b><i>a </i></figref>and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b><i>b</i></figref>) that is connected to the central point of the inner spiral electrode (by a via, small hole, etc.). In this case, the application of the high potential to the inner electric contact (here No. 2) will generate stronger field in the center of the device. This will allow to create a lens with inversed optical power (defocusing light instead of focusing). This will allow increasing the dynamic range of optical power variations by creating first positive and then negative lens by the same device (if, e.g., we start by applying high potential at contact <b>1</b>, then reduce it and then apply high potential on contact <b>2</b>, etc.).</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">In another embodiment, PSD signals with various potentials (U<sub>1 </sub>and U<sub>2</sub>) can be applied simultaneously on contacts <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> with specific phases (&#x3a6;<sub>1 </sub>and &#x3a6;<sub>2</sub>), which will allow the additional re-shaping of the distribution of the electric potential in the transverse plane (containing the spiral) and in the area filled by NLC.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">Alternatively, in a different embodiment, the pattern of the ITO spiral may be rearranged in a way to create the second (inner or central) contact on the same substrate, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b><i>a</i></figref>. The small area used to bring the second contact to the center should be as narrow as possible to avoid the additional degradation of light wave front.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">This design also will allow the creation of a bipolar (positive or negative) lens (by respectively providing lower or higher potential to the contact <b>2</b>, which, in the second case, will generate higher electric field in the center of the lens), and thus enable larger dynamic range of total optical power variation. Indeed, for the same LC layer, we can also obtain a positive lens by applying higher potential to the contact <b>1</b> (which will generate higher electric field in the periphery of the lens).</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">The use of a high dielectric constant material (not shown here only for the sake of simplicity) is optional here, but it can additionally help if applied.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">In another embodiment, this &#x201c;cut-line&#x201d; approach can be used also to create segmented electrode zones (e.g., <b>2</b>), similar to refractive Fresnel lenses <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b><i>b</i></figref>. In this case, the contact <b>1</b> will control the external zone of the lens while the contact <b>2</b> will control the internal zone of the lens. Here also, the use of a high dielectric constant material is optional.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">The addition of the second contact in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b><i>a </i></figref>may also enable the use of various PSD driving techniques, including the case, when, for example, the high voltage is provided to one contact (U<sub>1</sub>), while the second one is ground (and U<sub>2</sub>=0). The voltage distribution will be different (and thus the properties of the lens will be different) if that second contact is kept &#xab;floating&#xbb; (not ground). Even more interesting here is the case, when we apply different voltages (say, U<sub>1 </sub>and U<sub>2</sub>) with different phases, &#x3a6;<sub>1 </sub>and &#x3a6;<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">The same PSD approach of applying different voltages and phases can be used to obtain various potential distribution in another embodiment of this invention where an Archimedean spiral (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b><i>c</i></figref>) is used to obtain the desired spatial profile of the electric potential. Here also, the use of a high dielectric constant material is optional.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">Such a PSD approach has been already demonstrated to obtain lensing effect (Andrew K. Kirby, Philip J. W. Hands, and Gordon D. Love, Liquid crystal multi-mode lenses and axicons based on electronic phase shift control, 17 Oct. 2007/Vol. 15, No. 21/OPTICS EXPRESS 13496). In that demonstration, two substrates are bearing uniform ITO layers. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b><i>a </i></figref>represents the operation principle in its simplest demonstration, for the case of a cylindrical lens. The bottom substrate here is grounded. The top substrate has two contacts at the opposed corners and the voltages (here sinusoidal), applied to those corners, are phase shifted at p. This phase shift (e.g., for &#x3c6;=180&#xb0;), generates a drop of the electrical potential from the periphery of the device (U=6.3V) to the center of the device (U=0V), generating thus a corresponding molecular reorientation pattern. Various modifications of this device are possible, including the change of p and/or adding a bias voltage <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref><i>b, </i></p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">In another article (J. F. Algorri, G. D. Love, and V. Urruchi, Modal liquid crystal array of optical elements, 21 Oct. 2013|Vol. 21, No. 21|DOI:10.1364/OE.21.024809|OPTICS EXPRESS 24809), authors describe a further application of the PSD by using parallel linear (finger like) electrodes and high resistivity or WCL layer (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b><i>a</i></figref>) to generate arrays of 4 (or 2&#xd7;2) lenses. In this case, each substrate is bearing 3 ITO (parallel linear) electrodes, but, to construct the cell, the second substrate (with a similar electrode structure) is rotated by 90&#xb0;. For this purpose, two electrodes at each extreme corner are shorted (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b><i>b</i></figref>) and driven with the same voltage and phase (V<sub>1 </sub>and &#x3a6;<sub>1 </sub>at the top substrate and V<sub>3 </sub>and &#x3a6;<sub>3 </sub>at the bottom substrate), but the middle electrodes are driven independently with specific voltages and phases (V<sub>2 </sub>and &#x3a6;<sub>2 </sub>at the top substrate and V<sub>4 </sub>and &#x3a6;<sub>4 </sub>at the bottom substrate). The device allows the simultaneous generation of 4 (or 2&#xd7;2) lenses, that can be controlled by the voltages and relative phase shifts between those electrodes.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">There are several problems here, but the most important is the use of WCL since its fabrication is not obvious. However, the role of the WCL is to &#x201c;re-shape&#x201d; the electrical potential distribution in the transversal plane. In what we shall propose next, this function can be performed without the use of a WCL.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">In a different embodiment, the previously described here &#x201c;circular&#x201d; spiral pattern of ITO (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b><i>a</i></figref>) may be replaced by linear-shaped electrode stripes or lanes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b><i>a</i></figref>) to generate electrically tunable prism or cylindrical lens functions. Thus, the application of the high electric potential U<sub>1 </sub>to the contact <b>1</b> will generate stronger LC reorientation on the upper part of the device, since this potential will decrease with different gradients (towards the electric contact <b>2</b>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b><i>b</i></figref>) depending upon the fact if the contact <b>2</b> is grounded U<sub>2</sub>=0 (this may generate a rapid drop of potential) or if it is left floating U<sub>F </sub>(this may generate a slower decrease of the electric potential. Such a substrate, combined with the opposed substrate with uniform grounded ITO (to form a sandwich with NLC) will enable the generation of a transversal gradient of the refractive index and a corresponding tilt of light, e.g., in the direction towards the contact <b>2</b> if the NLC has positive anisotropy. The situation may be inversed if the potential is applied to the second contact (bottom).</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">We can also generate a symmetrical electric potential profile (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b><i>b</i></figref>) if these two contacts are driven with specific potentials (U<sub>1 </sub>and U<sub>2</sub>) with specific phases (&#x3a6;<sub>1 </sub>and &#x3a6;<sub>2</sub>). This is a particularly interesting case since this type of substrate, combined with a similar substrate (to form a sandwich with first one) that is rotated at 90 degrees (see hereafter) and driven with PSD can be used even without the HDCL.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">Here also, many variations of PSD are possible in terms of voltages and phases applied to both contacts (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">In a different embodiment, the width w of the ITO lanes or their pitch (lane separation g) or both of those parameters (w and g) may be spatially varied (chirped) in a linear or non linear way to additionally shape the electric field across the transvers plane of the device (in all previous and following electrode designs). The value of e of the HDCL may be further optimized for these varying patterns of ITO.

Each of these external contacts may be powered (with different voltages in different phases), put to ground or let as floating. Another similar substrate, but with electrodes aligned in the perpendicular direction (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b><i>b</i></figref>) may be also fabricated.

This shows the influence of frequency at the fixed voltage of 2.8V on the performance and optical quality using a test cell having 1 mm diameter (the phase shift here is obtained by slight frequency shift of the corresponding electrical signal). Indeed, we demonstrate here that the lens control may be obtained also by the frequency.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">Alternatively, as predicted above, we can use the same device to create larger aperture lenses.

Such steering elements may be used for lighting as well as in integrated photonic/fiber circuits to adjust the efficiency of coupling between different components. For example, a flat bundle of fibers can be roughly positioned close to the entrance or exit channels of a photonic integrated circuit and an optimization software can be used to focus and steer light from each fiber to optimize the connection between the integrated circuit channels and the fiber bundle.

Alternatively, strip electrodes may be provided for the purposes of creating micro cylindrical lenses that can likewise be selectively activated for diverting light as desired.

The top modulator has its ground state NLC molecules oriented, for example, perpendicular to its stripe electrodes. In the same time, the bottom cell has a similar electrode configuration, but the NLC molecules are perpendicular with respect to the top modulator. Thus, they are parallel to the stripes of the bottom modulator. With this arrangement, the combined modulator can act on natural light having a mixture of two orthogonal polarizations. However, the operation of the device risk to be asymmetric (not the same for these polarization components). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b>B</figref> illustrates an embodiment in which two identical LC modulators are combined to act on both linear polarizations of light, however a polarization rotation element or half wave plate is placed between the two modulators while the orientation of the electrodes and of NLC molecules are the same for the top and the bottom modulators.

This technique can be used as in ordinary photography as well as in LIDARS and other sensing applications.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0181"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b>C</figref> illustrates an embodiment in which the proposed device can be used with an array of light sources or sensors <b>14</b><i>a</i>. This array of sources or sensors can be optionally associated with an array of primary optics <b>14</b><i>b </i>(collimating the outcoming beam from individual sources or focusing the incoming light in into individual sensors). With the use of the spatial control offered by the matrix device <b>15</b>, the operation of the array <b>14</b><i>a </i>can be significantly enhanced. For example, in addition to the creation of dark zones (as described above), we can also steer individual units into the same direction or divert them into various directions, or we can stretch light in one (e.g., vertical) or other (horizontal) directions by generating cylindrical lenses inside the matrix device, etc. We can also use the device as a block without having to perform spatial modulation control within <b>14</b><i>a</i>, etc.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0182"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b>D</figref> illustrates including in the combination with a tunable lens. By changing the optical power of the tunable lens, additional control over the dark zone properties is made possible. In the case of a narrow beam, such a tunable lens may be used to focus light. Most often, it can/should be positioned just after the primary optics. In the case if we wish to use it behind the matric lens, very often the beam diameter will be large, and the tunable lens may be an array of micro lenses. In this case, it can provide additional broadening angle. In all these cases, the projected beam's shape and form may be thus controlled additionally.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0183">Examples of applications for the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A through <b>3</b>D</figref> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>23</b>A to <b>23</b>C</figref>.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0184">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b>A</figref>, there is illustrated an application in which the headlight of a vehicle, car <b>1</b>, can be modulated using device <b>15</b>.
