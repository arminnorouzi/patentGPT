In special light observation, for example, by utilizing the wavelength dependency of absorption of light in a body tissue to irradiate light of a narrow band in comparison with irradiation light upon ordinary observation (namely, white light), narrow band observation (narrow band imaging) of imaging a predetermined tissue such as a blood vessel of a superficial portion of the mucous membrane or the like in a high contrast is performed. Alternatively, in special light observation, fluorescent observation for obtaining an image from fluorescent light generated by irradiation of excitation light may be performed. In fluorescent observation, it is possible to perform observation of fluorescent light from a body tissue by irradiating excitation light on the body tissue (autofluorescence observation) or to obtain a fluorescent light image by locally injecting a reagent such as indocyanine green (ICG) into a body tissue and irradiating excitation light corresponding to a fluorescent light wavelength of the reagent upon the body tissue. The light source apparatus <b>11203</b> can be configured to supply such narrow-band light and/or excitation light suitable for special light observation as described above.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0123"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> is a block diagram depicting an example of a functional configuration of the camera head <b>11102</b> and the CCU <b>11201</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0124">The camera head <b>11102</b> includes a lens unit <b>11401</b>, an image pickup unit <b>11402</b>, a driving unit <b>11403</b>, a communication unit <b>11404</b> and a camera head controlling unit <b>11405</b>.
