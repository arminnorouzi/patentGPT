This creates an artificial immune synapse and increases the efficiency of immune engagement and destruction of the cancer cells. The ligands in these bispecific proteins are derived from engineered targeted antibodies expressed together in such a way as to form a continuous therapeutic protein. These therapeutic proteins can be effective in cancer therapeutics.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Current bispecific therapeutics in development function via engagement of CD3, which is part of the T cell receptor complex. CD3 is expressed on cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, and helper CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Broad CD3 engagement may result in non-specific T cell activation away from the tumor site, leading to toxicities, including &#x201c;cytokine storm.&#x201d; More recently, some groups have begun targeting NK cells via the NKp46 or CD16 receptor.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">NKG2D expression is unique, however, because it is constitutively expressed on human CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and NK cells. Therefore, NKG2D targeting would enable engagement of both the innate and adaptive cytotoxic lymphocytes (CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and NK cells), resulting in a more robust anti-tumor activity.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure relates to a new class of bispecific (or multi-specific) therapeutic proteins which targets both the NK and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells via a ligand to the NKG2D receptor on one side, and a binding partner directed to a tumor-specific target on the other side. The NKG2D receptor can be bound via any specific ligand, such as a mono or polyclonal antibody, the Orthopoxvirus Major Histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-like protein (OMCP) ligand, or a native NKG2D ligand. The tumor target can be selected from any cell-surface target which is either specifically expressed in cancer cells or which has increased expression in cancer cells compared to normal tissues.</p><p

In an embodiment, a variant of OMCP can be a truncated or mutated OMCP that has a slightly lower binding affinity relative to the binding affinity of the full length OMCP. In another embodiment, a variant of OMCP can be a truncated or mutated OMCP that has a higher binding affinity relative to the binding affinity of the full length OMCP.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Methods to determine binding affinity of a ligand to target protein are known in the art and described above. For example, as described below in the examples, binding affinity can be determined by measuring surface plasmon resonance. OMCP specifically binds to NKG2D with a binding affinity of about 0.1 to about 5 nM. For example, OMCP specially binds to human NKG2D with a binding affinity of about 0.2 nM and mouse NKG2D with a binding affinity of about 3 nM.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In a preferred embodiment, the NKG2D ligand is OMCP or a variant thereof that binds to human NKG2D with a binding affinity of about 1000 nM to about 0.01 nM. In certain embodiments, OMCP or a variant thereof binds to human NKG2D with a binding affinity of about 100 nM to about 0.01 nM, about 10 nM to about 0.01 nM, or about 1 nM to about 0.01 nM. In other embodiments, OMCP or a variant thereof binds to human NKG2D with a binding affinity of about 1000 nM to about 1 nM, or about 1000 nM to about 10 nM, or about 1000 nM to about 100 nM. In still other embodiments, OMCP or a variant thereof binds to human NKG2D with a binding affinity of about 100 nM to about 1 nM, or about 100 nM to 10 nM. For example, the OMCP or a variant thereof can bind to human NKG2D with a binding affinity of about 1000 nM, about 500 nM, about 100 nM, about 50 nM, about 10 nM, about 9 nM, about 8 nM, about 7 nM, about 6 nM about 5 nM, about 4 nM, about 3 nM, about 2 nM, about 1 nM, about 0.9 nM, about 0.8 nM, about 0.7 nM, about 0.6 nM, about 0.5 nM, about 0.4 nM, about 0.3 nM, about 0.2 nM or about 0.1 nM. By way of further example, but not limitation, the OMCP or a variant thereof can bind to human NKG2D with a binding affinity of about 1000 nM to about 0.1 nM, about 100 nM to about 0.1 nM, about 10 nM to about 0.1 nM, or about 1 nM to about 0.1 nM. It should be understood that the foregoing disclosure regarding binding affinities can apply to a first amino acid sequence of polypeptides of the disclosure and any other NKG2D binding domain of the polypeptides of the present disclosure, such as, by way of example not limitation, the first amino acid sequences with homology to regions of SEQ ID NOs: 1-3.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The sequence information for the full length OMCP amino acid sequence can be found using, for example, the GenBank accession number 4FFE_Z, 4FFE_Y or 4FFE_X. A skilled artisan will appreciate that homologs of OMCP may be found in other species or viruses. For example, see Lefkowitz et al, Nucleic Acids Res 2005; 33: D311-316, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety, which describes eighteen OMCP variants between cowpox and monkeypox virus strains. In an embodiment, OMCP is from an orthopoxvirus. In a specific embodiment, OMCP is from a cowpox virus or a monkeypox virus. In another specific embodiment, OMCP is from the Brighton Red strain of cowpoxvirus. Homologs can be found in other species by methods known in the art. For example, sequence similarity may be determined by conventional algorithms, which typically allow introduction of a small number of gaps in order to achieve the best fit. In particular, &#x201c;percent identity&#x201d; of two polypeptides or two nucleic acid sequences is determined using the algorithm of Karlin and Altschul (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87:2264-2268, 1993). Such an algorithm is incorporated into the BLASTN and BLASTX programs of Altschul et al. (J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410, 1990). BLAST nucleotide searches may be performed with the BLASTN program to obtain nucleotide sequences homologous to a nucleic acid molecule of the invention. Equally, BLAST protein searches may be performed with the BLASTX program to obtain amino acid sequences that are homologous to a polypeptide of the invention. To obtain gapped alignments for comparison purposes, Gapped BLAST is utilized as described in Altschul et al. (Nucleic Acids Res. 25:3389-3402, 1997). When utilizing BLAST and Gapped BLAST programs, the default parameters of the respective programs (e.g., BLASTX and BLASTN) are employed. See www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov for more details.

A structural homolog may be a protein that is structurally related but the sequence is a distal homolog. For example, OMCP has low sequence identity for endogenous NKG2D ligands however it was discovered that OMCP would bind to NKG2D based on structural homology. Structural homologs can be found in other species by methods known in the art. For example, protein structure prediction may be determined by various databases, such as Phyre and Phyre2. Such databases generate reliable protein models that may be used to determine structural homologs. The main results table in Phyre2 provides confidence estimates, images and links to the three-dimensional predicted models and information derived from either Structural Classification of Proteins database (SCOP) or the Protein Data Bank (PDB) depending on the source of the detected template. For each match a link takes the user to a detailed view of the alignment between the user sequence and the sequence of known three-dimensional structure.

Monoclonal antibodies can be produced using e.g., hybridoma techniques well known in the art, as well as recombinant technologies, phage display technologies, synthetic technologies or combinations of such technologies and other technologies readily known in the art. The term &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; should also be understood to mean a functional monoclonal antibody, or an immunologically effective fragment thereof; such as an Fab, Fab&#x2032;, or F(ab&#x2032;)2 fragment thereof.

Additionally, included within the definition &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; are single-domain antibodies, generally designated sdAb, which is an antibody fragment consisting of a single monomeric variable antibody domain. A sdAb antibody may be derived from camelids (VHH fragments) or cartilaginous fishes (VNAR fragments). As used herein &#x201c;humanized antibody&#x201d; is an antibody that is composed partially or fully of amino acid sequence sequences derived from a human antibody germline by altering the sequence of an antibody having non-human complementarity determining regions (&#x201c;CDR&#x201d;). The simplest such alteration may consist simply of substituting the constant region of a human antibody for the murine constant region, thus resulting in a human/murine chimera which may have sufficiently low immunogenicity to be acceptable for pharmaceutical use. Preferably, however, the variable region of the antibody and even the CDR is also humanized by techniques that are by now well known in the art. The framework regions of the variable regions are substituted by the corresponding human framework regions leaving the non-human CDR substantially intact, or even replacing the CDR with sequences derived from a human genome. CDRs may also be randomly mutated such that binding activity and affinity for NKG2D is maintained or enhanced in the context of fully human germline framework regions or framework regions that are substantially human.

Non-limiting examples of cytokines include chemokines, interferons, interleukins, lymphokines, tumor necrosis factor, monokines, and colony stimulating factors. Cytokines may be produced by a broad range of cells including, but not limited to, immune cells such as macrophages, B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, mast cells and monocytes, endothelial cells, fibroblasts and stromal cells. A cytokine may be produced by more than one type of cell. Cytokines act through receptors and are especially important in the immune system, modulate the balance between humoral and cell-based immune responses, and regulate maturation, growth and responsiveness of cell populations. Cytokines are important in host responses to infection, immune responses, inflammation, trauma, sepsis, cancer and reproduction.

This family is further divided into three sub-families: the IL2 subfamily, the interferon (IFN) subfamily and the IL10 subfamily.

Interferons are named for their ability to &#x201c;interfere&#x201d; with viral replication by protecting cells from virus infection. IFNs also have other functions: they activate immune cells, such as natural killer cells and macrophages; they increase host defenses by up-regulating antigen presentation by virtue of increasing the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens. Based on the type of receptor through which they signal, human interferons have been classified into three major types: Type I IFN, Type II IFN, and Type III IFN. Type I IFNs bind to a specific cell surface receptor complex known as the IFN-&#x3b1;/&#x3b2; receptor (IFNAR) that consists of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 chains. Non-limiting examples of type I interferons present in humans are IFN-&#x3b1;, IFN-&#x3b2;, IFN-&#x3b5;, IFN-&#x3ba; and IFN-&#x3c9;.

Such compositions can be administered orally, parenterally, or topically in dosage unit formulations containing conventional nontoxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants, and vehicles as desired. Topical administration may also involve the use of transdermal administration such as transdermal patches or iontophoresis devices. The term &#x201c;parenteral&#x201d; as used herein includes subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, or intrasternal injection, or infusion techniques. Formulation of drugs is discussed in, for example, Gennaro, A. R., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa. (18th ed, 1995), and Liberman, H. A. and Lachman, L., Eds., Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Marcel Dekker Inc., New York, N.Y. (1980).</p><p id="p-0139" num="0137">Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, caplets, pills, powders, pellets, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active ingredient is ordinarily combined with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, examples of which are detailed above. Oral preparations may also be administered as aqueous suspensions, elixirs, or syrups. For these, the active ingredient may be combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents, coloring agents, and, if so desired, emulsifying and/or suspending agents, as well as diluents such as water, ethanol, glycerin, and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0138">For parenteral administration (including subcutaneous, intradermal, intravenous, intramuscular, and intraperitoneal), the preparation may be an aqueous or an oil-based solution. Aqueous solutions may include a sterile diluent such as water, saline solution, a pharmaceutically acceptable polyol such as glycerol, propylene glycol, or other synthetic solvents; an antibacterial and/or antifungal agent such as benzyl alcohol, methyl paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol, thimerosal, and the like; an antioxidant such as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfate; a chelating agent such as etheylenediaminetetraacetic acid; a buffer such as acetate, citrate, or phosphate; and/or an agent for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride, dextrose, or a polyalcohol such as mannitol or sorbitol. The pH of the aqueous solution may be adjusted with acids or bases such as hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. Oil-based solutions or suspensions may further comprise sesame, peanut, olive oil, or mineral oil.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0139">In certain embodiments, a composition comprising a therapeutic fusion peptide of the present disclosure can be encapsulated in a suitable vehicle to either aid in the delivery of the compound to target cells, to increase the stability of the composition, or to minimize potential toxicity of the composition. As will be appreciated by a skilled artisan, a variety of vehicles are suitable for delivering a composition of the present invention. Non-limiting examples of suitable structured fluid delivery systems may include nanoparticles, liposomes, microemulsions, micelles, dendrimers and other phospholipid-containing systems. Methods of incorporating compositions into delivery vehicles are known in the art.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0140">In one alternative embodiment, a liposome delivery vehicle may be utilized. Liposomes, depending upon the embodiment, are suitable for delivery of peptides in view of their structural and chemical properties. Generally speaking, liposomes are spherical vesicles with a phospholipid bilayer membrane. The lipid bilayer of a liposome may fuse with other bilayers (e.g., the cell membrane), thus delivering the contents of the liposome to cells. In this manner, the compound of the invention may be selectively delivered to a cell by encapsulation in a liposome that fuses with the targeted cell's membrane.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0141">Liposomes may be comprised of a variety of different types of phospholipids having varying hydrocarbon chain lengths. Phospholipids generally comprise two fatty acids linked through glycerol phosphate to one of a variety of polar groups. Suitable phospholipids include phosphatidic acid (PA), phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), diphosphatidylglycerol (DPG), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). The fatty acid chains comprising the phospholipids may range from about 6 to about 26 carbon atoms in length, and the lipid chains may be saturated or unsaturated. Suitable fatty acid chains include (common name presented in parentheses) n-dodecanoate (laurate), n-tretradecanoate (myristate), n-hexadecanoate (palmitate), n-octadecanoate (stearate), n-eicosanoate (arachidate), n-docosanoate (behenate), n-tetracosanoate (lignocerate), cis-9-hexadecenoate (palmitoleate), cis-9-octadecanoate (oleate), cis,cis-9,12-octadecandienoate (linoleate), all cis-9,12,15-octadecatrienoate (linolenate), and all cis-5,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoate (arachidonate). The two fatty acid chains of a phospholipid may be identical or different. Acceptable phospholipids include dioleoyl PS, dioleoyl PC, distearoyl PS, distearoyl PC, dimyristoyl PS, dimyristoyl PC, dipalmitoyl PG, stearoyl, oleoyl PS, palmitoyl, linolenyl PS, and the like.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0142">The phospholipids may come from any natural source, and, as such, may comprise a mixture of phospholipids. For example, egg yolk is rich in PC, PG, and PE, soy beans contains PC, PE, PI, and PA, and animal brain or spinal cord is enriched in PS. Phospholipids may come from synthetic sources too. Mixtures of phospholipids having a varied ratio of individual phospholipids may be used. Mixtures of different phospholipids may result in liposome compositions having advantageous activity or stability of activity properties. The above mentioned phospholipids may be mixed, in optimal ratios with cationic lipids, such as N-(1-(2,3-dioleolyoxy)propyl)-N,N,N-trimethyl ammonium chloride, 1,1&#x2032;-dioctadecyl-3,3,3&#x2032;,3&#x2032;-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchloarate, 3,3&#x2032;-deheptyloxacarbocyanine iodide, 1,1&#x2032;-dedodecyl-3,3,3&#x2032;,3&#x2032;-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchloarate, 1,1&#x2032;-dioleyl-3,3,3&#x2032;,3&#x2032;-tetramethylindo carbocyanine methanesulfonate, N-4-(delinoleylaminostyryl)-N-methylpyridinium iodide, or 1,1,-dilinoleyl-3,3,3&#x2032;,3&#x2032;-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchloarate.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0143">Liposomes may optionally comprise sphingolipids, in which spingosine is the structural counterpart of glycerol and one of the one fatty acids of a phosphoglyceride, or cholesterol, a major component of animal cell membranes. Liposomes may optionally, contain pegylated lipids, which are lipids covalently linked to polymers of polyethylene glycol (PEG). PEGs may range in size from about 500 to about 10,000 daltons.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0144">Liposomes may further comprise a suitable solvent. The solvent may be an organic solvent or an inorganic solvent. Suitable solvents include, but are not limited to, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), methylpyrrolidone, N-methylpyrrolidone, acetronitrile, alcohols, dimethylformamide, tetrahydrofuran, or combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0145">Liposomes carrying therapeutic fusion peptides of the present disclosure may be prepared by any known method of preparing liposomes for drug delivery, such as, for example, detailed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,241,046, 4,394,448, 4,529,561, 4,755,388, 4,828,837, 4,925,661, 4,954,345, 4,957,735, 5,043,164, 5,064,655, 5,077,211 and 5,264,618, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. For example, liposomes may be prepared by sonicating lipids in an aqueous solution, solvent injection, lipid hydration, reverse evaporation, or freeze drying by repeated freezing and thawing. In a preferred embodiment the liposomes are formed by sonication. The liposomes may be multilamellar, which have many layers like an onion, or unilamellar. The liposomes may be large or small. Continued high-shear sonication tends to form smaller unilamellar lipsomes.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0146">As would be apparent to one of ordinary skill, all of the parameters that govern liposome formation may be varied. These parameters include, but are not limited to, temperature, pH, concentration of methionine compound, concentration and composition of lipid, concentration of multivalent cations, rate of mixing, presence of and concentration of solvent.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0147">In another embodiment, the therapeutic fusion peptides may be delivered to a cell as a microemulsion. Microemulsions are generally clear, thermodynamically stable solutions comprising an aqueous solution, a surfactant, and &#x201c;oil.&#x201d; The &#x201c;oil&#x201d; in this case, is the supercritical fluid phase. The surfactant rests at the oil-water interface. Any of a variety of surfactants are suitable for use in microemulsion formulations including those described herein or otherwise known in the art. The aqueous microdomains suitable for use in the invention generally will have characteristic structural dimensions from about 5 nm to about 100 nm. Aggregates of this size are poor scatterers of visible light and hence, these solutions are optically clear. As will be appreciated by a skilled artisan, microemulsions can and will have a multitude of different microscopic structures including sphere, rod, or disc shaped aggregates. In one embodiment, the structure may be micelles, which are the simplest microemulsion structures that are generally spherical or cylindrical objects. Micelles are like drops of oil in water, and reverse micelles are like drops of water in oil. In an alternative embodiment, the microemulsion structure is the lamellae. It comprises consecutive layers of water and oil separated by layers of surfactant. The &#x201c;oil&#x201d; of microemulsions optimally comprises phospholipids. Any of the phospholipids detailed above for liposomes are suitable for embodiments directed to microemulsions. The composition of the invention may be encapsulated in a microemulsion by any method generally known in the art.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0148">In yet another embodiment, the therapeutic fusion peptide may be delivered in a dendritic macromolecule, or a dendrimer. Generally speaking, a dendrimer is a branched tree-like molecule, in which each branch is an interlinked chain of molecules that divides into two new branches (molecules) after a certain length. This branching continues until the branches (molecules) become so densely packed that the canopy forms a globe. Generally, the properties of dendrimers are determined by the functional groups at their surface. For example, hydrophilic end groups, such as carboxyl groups, would typically make a water-soluble dendrimer. Alternatively, phospholipids may be incorporated in the surface of a dendrimer to facilitate absorption across the skin. Any of the phospholipids detailed for use in liposome embodiments are suitable for use in dendrimer embodiments. Any method generally known in the art may be utilized to make dendrimers and to encapsulate compositions of the invention therein. For example, dendrimers may be produced by an iterative sequence of reaction steps, in which each additional iteration leads to a higher order dendrimer. Consequently, they have a regular, highly branched 3D structure, with nearly uniform size and shape. Furthermore, the final size of a dendrimer is typically controlled by the number of iterative steps used during synthesis. A variety of dendrimer sizes are suitable for use in the invention. Generally, the size of dendrimers may range from about 1 nm to about 100 nm.</p><heading id="h-0017" level="2">Administration</heading><p id="p-0151" num="0149">In certain aspects, a therapeutically effective amount of the therapeutic fusion peptides of the present disclosure may be administered to a subject. Administration is performed using standard effective techniques, including peripherally (i.e. not by administration into the central nervous system) or locally to the central nervous system. Peripheral administration includes but is not limited to intravenous, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, pulmonary, transdermal, intramuscular, intranasal, buccal, sublingual, or suppository administration. Local administration, including directly into the central nervous system (CNS) includes but is not limited to via a lumbar, intraventricular or intraparenchymal catheter or using a surgically implanted controlled release formulation. Pheresis may be used to deliver the therapeutic fusion peptides of the present disclosure. In certain embodiments, the therapeutic fusion peptides of the present disclosure may be administered via an infusion (continuous or bolus).</p><p id="p-0152" num="0150">Pharmaceutical compositions for effective administration are deliberately designed to be appropriate for the selected mode of administration, and pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as compatible dispersing agents, buffers, surfactants, preservatives, solubilizing agents, isotonicity agents, stabilizing agents and the like are used as appropriate. Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Co., Easton Pa., 16Ed ISBN: 0-912734-04-3, latest edition, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, provides a compendium of formulation techniques as are generally known to practitioners.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0151">Effective peripheral systemic delivery by intravenous or intraperitoneal or subcutaneous injection is a preferred method of administration to a living patient. Suitable vehicles for such injections are straightforward. In addition, however, administration may also be effected through the mucosal membranes by means of nasal aerosols or suppositories. Suitable formulations for such modes of administration are well known and typically include surfactants that facilitate cross-membrane transfer. Such surfactants are often derived from steroids or are cationic lipids, such as N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyl)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethyl ammonium chloride (DOTMA) or various compounds such as cholesterol hemisuccinate, phosphatidyl glycerols and the like.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0152">For therapeutic applications, a therapeutically effective amount of the therapeutic fusion peptides of the present disclosure is administered to a subject. A &#x201c;therapeutically effective amount&#x201d; is an amount of the therapeutic composition sufficient to produce a measurable response (e.g., tumor regression). Actual dosage levels of active ingredients in a therapeutic composition of the invention can be varied so as to administer an amount of the active compound(s) that is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular subject. The selected dosage level will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the therapeutic composition, formulation, the route of administration, combination with other drugs or treatments, tumor size and longevity, infection, and the physical condition and prior medical history of the subject being treated. In some embodiments, a minimal dose is administered, and dose is escalated in the absence of dose-limiting toxicity. Determination and adjustment of a therapeutically effective dose, as well as evaluation of when and how to make such adjustments, are known to those of ordinary skill in the art of medicine.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0153">The frequency of dosing may be once, twice, three times or more daily or once, twice, three times or more per week or per month, as needed as to effectively treat the symptoms or disease. In certain embodiments, the frequency of dosing may be once, twice or three times daily. For example, a dose may be administered every 24 hours, every 12 hours, or every 8 hours. In a specific embodiment, the frequency of dosing may be twice daily.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0154">In any of the foregoing embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition can be administered at a dose between about 0.1 &#x3bc;g/Kg and about 50 &#x3bc;g/Kg of the polypeptide of the present disclosure per patient body weight.

The duration of treatment can and will vary depending on the subject and the cancer to be treated. For example, the duration of treatment may be for 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 6 days, or 7 days. Or, the duration of treatment may be for 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 5 weeks or 6 weeks. Alternatively, the duration of treatment may be for 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 4 months, 5 months, 6 months, 7 months, 8 months, 9 months, 10 months, 11 months, or 12 months. In still another embodiment, the duration of treatment may be for 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, 5 years, or greater than 5 years. It is also contemplated that administration may be frequent for a period of time and then administration may be spaced out for a period of time. For example, duration of treatment may be 5 days, then no treatment for 9 days, then treatment for 5 days.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0156">The timing of administration of the treatment relative to the disease itself and duration of treatment will be determined by the circumstances surrounding the case. Treatment could begin immediately, such as at the time of diagnosis, or treatment could begin following surgery. Treatment could begin in a hospital or clinic itself, or at a later time after discharge from the hospital or after being seen in an outpatient clinic.</p><heading id="h-0018" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading><p id="p-0159" num="0157">In the following examples, the designations E0, E1, E2 and E3 refer to the constructs in the table below which are also schematically depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>E</figref> and have the sequences as disclosed below.

This broad-based expression on multiple types of cytotoxic lymphocytes makes it a unique ligand to target for broad activation of cytotoxicity across multiple cell types capable of tumor killing. Interestingly using purified CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell cultures the OMCP-EGFR construct significantly enhanced CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell cytotoxicity and even exceeded the functionality of the anti-CD3 OKT3-EGFR control. The use of KYK1-EGFR (E1) or KYK2-EGFR (E2) bispecific engagers did not enhance cytotoxicity over CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells alone. Taken together we can conclude that enhanced function of OMCP containing constructs may be due to the: 1) high affinity binding of OMCP to NKG2D; 2) coupled with lack of receptor internalization (see Campbell J A, <i>Zoonotic orthopoviruses encode a high</i>-<i>affinity antagonist of NKG</i>2<i>D, </i>J. Exp. Med. 204(6):1311-1317 (2007)). However our data points out that: 1) the use of anti-NK2D targeting allows for improved killing of targets over CD3 targeting due to engagement of not just T cells but NK cells as well; 2) the use of OMCP improves NKG2D bi-specific targeting over the use of established KYK1 and KYK2 antibodies.</p><heading id="h-0027" level="1">Example 5</heading><heading id="h-0028" level="1">In Vitro Cytokine Release Analysis</heading><p id="p-0189" num="0186">The use of anti-CD3 bispecifics has been complicated by side effects of cytokine release syndrome (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6003181/#). Since the engagement and crosslinking of the T cells receptor in the form of CD3 antibody can activate all T cells systemically (CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup>), not just at the site of the tumor, cytokine release syndrome, or cytokine storm has resulted in unexpected morbidity and mortality. In theory, NKG2D engagement should result in lower levels of such complications since NKG2D acts as a co-stimulatory rather than a primary-stimulating activating receptor on T cells. In addition NKG2D expression is most prominent on memory and effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Thus its engagement should not result in broad stimulation of na&#xef;ve and antigen inexperienced T cells (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0012635) or of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. The use of monomeric OMCP offers one more advantage over the use of bivalent anti-NKG2D antibodies. Since OMCP incorporated into our proposed bispecific construct is a monomer it cannot crosslink NKG2D. For this reason NKG2D activation by OMCP-containing bispecifics occurs only at the time of tumor engagement, i.e. once two or more tumor targeting domains engage the tumor ligand and bring the OMCP portion of the bispecific and their engaged NKG2D receptors into close proximity. Taken together both of these factors should provide a safety measure due to: 1) lack of non-specific and broad activation of na&#xef;ve T cells that are not tumor reactive; 2) lack of T cell activation outside of the tumor bed; 3) lack of NKG2D crosslinking in the absence of tumor based ligand.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0187">To evaluate lymphocyte activation and cytokine release cytokine production by bulk PBMCs incubated with EGFR-targeted bispecifics with different immune cell targeting domains: OMCP (E0), KYK1 anti-NKG2D scFv (E1), KYK2 anti-NKG2D scFv (E2), or OKT3 anti-CD3 scFv (E3) in the presence or absence of A549 tumor targets in vitro was studied.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0188">500,000 freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (isolated from fresh blood by Ficoll enrichment) were plated in round bottom 96 well plates in 150 ul of media consisting of RPMI, 10% FCS and 1% penn/strep antibiotics.

Mice will be injected with B16 melanoma subcutaneously at the flank with 1&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>cells per mouse. Treatment will begin 5 days later, when tumors have grown sufficiently to become visible and measurable. Initial tumor sizes and mouse weights will be taken, and mice will be randomized into groups of 10 mice such that the initial tumor sizes and mouse weights are similar between groups. The treatment groups will be as follows: Group 1&#x2014;saline control, Group 2&#x2014;OMCP-NT treatment, Group 3&#x2014;OMCP-anti-PMEL treatment, Group 4&#x2014;OMCP-anti-EGFR. All mice will be treated 2&#xd7; weekly for 3 weeks, a total of 5 doses. Group 1&#x2014;The mice will be intraperitoneally (i.p.) administered 200 &#x3bc;L saline for all treatments as a negative control. Group 2&#x2014;The mice will be i.p. administered 200 &#x3bc;g OMCP-NT in 200 &#x3bc;L saline. Group 3&#x2014;The mice will be i.p. administered 200 &#x3bc;g OMCP-anti-PMEL in 200 &#x3bc;L saline. Group 4&#x2014;The mice will be i.p. administered 200 &#x3bc;g OMCP-anti-EGFR in 200 &#x3bc;L saline.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0196">All tumors will be measured via caliper measurements and mouse weights measured every day during treatment. After the completion of the therapeutic course, mouse weights and tumors will be measured thrice weekly. Mice will be monitored throughout the study for signs of distress or other effects of the therapeutic treatment. All mice will be euthanized at a maximum tumor diameter of 20 mm, and tumors will be reserved for later analysis. Any mice that die prematurely from known or unknown causes will have a final measurement taken and tissues collected as soon as is possible.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0197">The B16 melanoma cell line was selected here due to the high level of expression of gp100 (PMEL) and EGFR. Therefore, potential outcomes may include a finding that treatment with OMCP-anti-PMEL will significantly attenuate tumor growth and increase survival times over the saline control group. We will further analyze residual tumors for lymphocyte infiltration via immunohistochemistry. Specifically, we will evaluate the intratumoral infiltration of CD8+ Teff cells and NK cells. Further, we will evaluate the apoptotic levels via a TUNEL assay (Millipore ApopTag Peroxidase In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit, Cat No. S7100). Potential outcomes include a finding that treatment with PDL1-mutIL2 and PDL2-mutIL2 increases CD8+ Teff an NK cell intratumoral infiltration significantly over either saline control mice or wt IL2 treated mice.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0198">These results would suggest that OMCP-anti-PMEL and OMCP-anti-EGFR have an enhanced therapeutic benefit against tumors with high target expression as compared to untreated mice. By using OMCP to engage both NK and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells specifically to the tumor surface, we expect to find that tumor infiltration and cytotoxic engagement for these key cell populations is significant.</p><heading id="h-0033" level="1">Example 8</heading><heading id="h-0034" level="1">Testing of Bi-Specific Fc Constructs</heading><p id="p-0203" num="0199">The following Fc constructs will be tested according to all of the foregoing examples as performed for the scFv constructs (E0, E1, E2, and E3).</p><p id="p-0204" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00004" num="00004"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1" tabstyle="monospace"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="112pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="168pt" align="left"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>SEQ&#x2003;ID</entry><entry/></row><row><entry>Construct</entry><entry>NOs</entry><entry>Description</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Asymmetric,&#x2003;bispecific</entry><entry>31&#x2003;&#x26;&#x2003;32</entry><entry>OMCP-Fc&#x2003;(KiH:Knob2)&#x2003;(SEQ&#x2003;ID&#x2003;NO:&#x2003;31)</entry></row><row><entry>(OMCP,&#x2003;anti-EGFR)</entry><entry/><entry>EGFR-Fc&#x2003;(KiH:Hole2)&#x2003;(SEQ&#x2003;ID&#x2003;NO:&#x2003;32)</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>Symmetric,&#x2003;bispecific</entry><entry>33</entry><entry>OMCP-WT&#x2003;Fc-EGFR</entry></row><row><entry>(OMCP,&#x2003;anti-EGFR)</entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>Single-arm&#x2003;asymmetric,</entry><entry>34&#x2003;&#x26;&#x2003;35</entry><entry>OMCP-EGFR-Fc&#x2003;(KiH:Knob2)&#x2003;(SEQ&#x2003;ID&#x2003;NO:</entry></row><row><entry>bispecific</entry><entry/><entry>34)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Fc&#x2003;(KiH:Hole2)&#x2003;(SEQ&#x2003;ID&#x2003;NO:&#x2003;35)</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>Monomeric&#x2003;Fc,&#x2003;bispecific</entry><entry>36</entry><entry>OMCP-mFc-EGFR</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0205" num="0200">It should be understood that the foregoing description provides embodiments of the present invention which can be varied and combined without departing from the spirit of this disclosure.
