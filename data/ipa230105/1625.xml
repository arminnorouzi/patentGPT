A moldable composite structure and a device for producing same are also described.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Description of the Prior Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The production of lightweight components for high-volume applications involves the use of continuous, fiber-reinforced, synthetic thermoplastics, which are mostly designed in the form of compact multilayer structures and laminates or sandwich structures with at least one structured layer, for example, in the form of a honeycomb core structure or an unstructured layer, for example, as foam core. For the purpose of improved durability and increased protection from mechanical damage, multilayer structures of such kind often have at least one continuous, fiber-reinforced cover layer which is applied at least to one side, and preferably to both sides.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to produce lightweight components, the multilayer structures are provided mostly in the form of flat, planar semifinished composite structure products which have at least one continuous, fiber-reinforced cover layer, in which continuous fibers of synthetically manufactured fiber materials such as glass, carbon, aramid or of natural fiber raw materials such as cellulose, bast or the like are embedded in a matrix made from thermoplastic material. The fibers may be arranged geometrically, for example unidirectionally side by side or each having an intersecting orientation in the form of a woven fabric, or chaotically, or they may be embedded in the thermoplastic matrix in the form of a tangled ball, a woven, or in the manner of a cottonwool wad.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The flat, semifinished composite structure products are typically processed to create intricately shaped lightweight components during pressing or thermoforming processes, in which the flat, solid semifinished composite structure product is heated to a processing temperature&#x2014;which is variable depending on the thermoplastic material&#x2014;prior to a molding processing step. In this context, the thermoplastic material in which the continuous fibers are embedded is heated above its melting temperature, which causes it to melt. This is essential to ensure that the continuous fibers are able to slide past each other within the thermoplastic melting areas during molding, so that after molding under pressure applied by a molding tool the composite solidifies optimally into a solid composite again. During the molding process, the fibers are at least one of shifted and re-orientated, which leads to significant changes and effects on the mechanical properties of the finished components. The re-orientation and shifting of the fibers within the molten matrix of thermoplastic material during the molding process must therefore be taken into account before and during the design and implementation of the process in order to avoid structural weaknesses of the lightweight component in the finished state which may occur within the fiber arrangement due to wrinkling or striations.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Heating of the newly created semifinished composite structure products is usually carried out using infrared radiation directed at the at least one cover layer that is to be heated on the semifinished composite structure products. Exposure of the cover layer that is to be heated with IR radiation results in even and homogeneous heating of the entire volume of the cover layer to produce the best possible conditions for allowing the fibers to slide within the cover layer. Specific controls enable homogeneous heating with infrared radiation above the melting temperature of the thermoplastic matrix system with temperature deviations of just a few Kelvin over the entire surface of the cover layer, see Dr. Mesut Cetin; Christian Herrmann; Stefan Schierl: Hochdynamisches and homogenes Aufheizen von Organoblechen, 16. ATZ-Fachtagung [Ultradynamic, homogeneous heating of organic sheets, 16th ATZ Conference], Hamburg 2018.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Apart from the heating process, the shaping process is also affected critically by the molding tool. Thus for example, optimal placement geometries for forming the fiber arrangement may also be created within the lightweight component by only defining the component design during the molding process.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The option also exists to influence the molding process positively with the aid of at least one of &#x201c;hold-down devices&#x201d; and die elements integrated in the molding tool. In this context, reference is made to WO 2018/060195 A1, which discloses a method for producing a continuous fiber-reinforced shaped part, in which the molding tool used includes a hold-down device which is able to generate locally elevated static friction forces between the continuous fibers plastic matrix for the purpose of fixing and stabilizing the fibers. Particularly with deeply curved components, in this way it is primarily possible to prevent wrinkling in the fiber course in laminate regions that are exposed to strong pressure. Depending on the complexity of the component, it is also possible to select a semifinished composite structure product with the alignment and arrangement of the continuous fibers that matches the degree of reshaping required. In this context, fibers that arranged side by side and aligned in the same direction have very low shaping capability, whereas fibers in the form of textile woven or knitted fabrics prevent tearing between the fibers during shaping, so that more intensive reshaping can be carried out.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another method for influencing the position of continuous fibers embedded in a softened thermoplastic matrix during a molding pressing process fixes the fibers to each other locally using binder methods before they are embedded in the thermoplastic material matrix in order to stabilize the geometric fiber arrangement, to prevent the fibers from being re-orientated during the thermally assisted molding process, for example. Known binder methods include for example joining the fibers using sewing techniques or substance-to-substance adhesive bonding.

To do this, it is intended to describe a suitable method by which a moldable thermoplastic, continuous fiber-reinforced composite structure is obtained, which has at least two layers, of which at least one layer contains continuous fibers embedded in a matrix of thermoplastic material, and which can be transferred to a subsequent thermal molding process.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">It is also intended to describe a moldable thermoplastic continuous fiber-reinforced composite structure associated therewith, which possesses the aforementioned properties. It is further intended to describe a device for producing a moldable, thermoplastic continuous fiber-reinforced composite structure of such kind.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The method according to the invention builds on the approach that is known per se of local bonding of fibers for the purpose of at least one stabilzsing and maintaining the shape and position of the continuous fibers embedded within the matrix of thermoplastic material, in order to counteract an undesirable shift of the fibers during at least one of a shaping process or to favor deformations and position changes of the continuous fibers in order to obtain the most ideal mechanical properties of the final molded composite structure.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to the invention, the method for producing a moldable thermoplastic continuous fiber-reinforced composite structure having the features of a semifinished composite structure product comprising the at least two layers, of which the least one layer in which the continuous fibers are contained is heated such that the matrix of thermoplastic material within at least one first surface region to or above a melting temperature which can be assigned to the thermoplastic material, and the matrix of thermoplastic material is kept to a temperature below the melting temperature within a second surface region directly adjoining the first surface region. The semifinished composite structure product heated is this way is provided as the moldable thermoplastic, continuous fiber-reinforced composite structure, the continuous fibers of which can be moved relative to each other within the first surface region and are spatially fixed relative to each other within the second surface region.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Similarly to the binder methods described previously, with which fibers are joined to each other locally in order to avoid undesirable re-orientations of the fibers in the course of a thermally assisted reshaping process, according to the invention the at least one second surface region, within which the matrix of thermoplastic material, in which the continuous fibers are embedded, is not melted and thus remains solid, functions as a stabilizing support region for the positioning pattern of the continuous fibers, in which the continuous fibers retain their fixed spatial position relative to each other even during a thermoforming process. The at least one second surface region thus represents a fixed matrix region after thermal treatment according to the invention, ensuring a matrix-based connection between the individual continuous fibers and corresponding to a joining region, which can be created otherwise using sewing techniques of adhesive bonds which are known per se.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Compared with known binder methods, the method according to the invention is characterized in particular in that the continuous fibers embedded within the thermoplastic matrix do nor require a work-intensive and expensive pretreatment such as sewing or adhesion. The number, position and shape of the respective second surface regions of the layer containing the continuous fibers, which correspond to the fixed joining points or regions, are predetermined solely by a specific procedure during heating of the semifinished composite structure product.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In an alternative method variant according to the invention, in which a semifinished composite structure product is also provided with the at least two layers, the at least one layer in which the continuous fibers are contained is heated in such manner that the matrix of thermoplastic material within at least one first surface region is heated to a first temperature T<b>1</b> above a melting temperature assigned to the thermoplastic material, and the matrix of thermoplastic material within a second surface region directly adjoining the first surface region is heated to a second temperature T<b>2</b>, which is at least equal to the melting temperature and is lower than the first temperature T<b>1</b>, and the semifinished composite structure product heated in this way is provided as the moldable thermoplastic, continuous fiber-reinforced composite structure of which the continuous fibers within the first surface region are able to move relative to each other more readily than the continuous fibers within the second surface region.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Through the targeted setting and selection of the two temperatures T<b>1</b> and T<b>2</b>, each above the melting point of the thermoplastic material, of which T<b>2</b> is selected to be smaller or lower than T<b>1</b>, it is possible to preset differing viscosities in the at least two directly adjacent first and second surface regions, the viscosities being decisive with regard to the ability of the continuous fiber components contained in both surface regions to move relative to each other in the two surface regions in the molten thermoplastic matrix in each case. Because of the higher temperature T<b>1</b> prevailing in the first surface region, the viscosity &#x3b7;<b>1</b> of the molten thermoplastic material in this surface region is lower than the viscosity &#x3b7;<b>2</b> of the molten thermoplastic material in the second surface region at temperature T<b>2</b>. This means that the ability of the continuous fibers to move relative to each other is greater within the first surface region than the ability of the continuous fibers to move relative to each other in the second surface region.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Depending on the nature of the downstream processes, particularly shaping processes, which the moldable, thermoplastic, continuous fiber-reinforced composite structure according to the solution undergoes afterwards, the relative movement capabilities of the continuous fibers in the at least two adjoining surface regions may be adjusted to the requirements of specific processes by varying the thermal input.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Advantageously, the ideal semifinished composite structure product is a flat, compact, solid multilayer structure that has two, and preferably more fixed layers, each made from full material, of which at least one cover layer of each multilayer structure is manufactured from thermoplastic material, in which the continuous fibers are embedded. Multilayer structures of such kind are also called organic sheets. Also suitable as semifinished composite structure products are flat, solid sandwich structures, with at least one core layer that is at least partly filled with air or gas, for example in the form of a honeycomb-structured layer structure or an unstructured foam layer, at least one side of which directly or indirectly adjoins a cover layer in which the continuous fibers are embedded in the matrix of thermoplastic material.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to a non-essential but preferred embodiment, all layers of the semifinished composite structure product are made from thermoplastic materials which have each been selected consistently or have identical or similar melting temperatures.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Regardless of the number of individual layers in the flat semifinished composite structure product as provided, the heating according to the invention is directed mainly at the outermost layer in each case, that is each of the one or more cover layers of the semifinished composite structure product in which the continuous fibers are embedded.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The purpose of heating precisely the cover layer is preferably served by a homogeneous infrared radiation field which may be generated by at least one radiation source, and which is directed towards the at least one cover layer. In this way, the cover layer is heated contactlessly by means of a continuous infrared radiation field.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In a first method variant, the infrared radiation field is directed in locally limited manner exclusively towards the first surface region or the respective first surface regions, in which it is intended to heat the matrix of thermoplastic material in the cover layer above the melting temperature thereof as homogeneously and completely as possible. At the same time, however, it is important to ensure that at least one of the second surface region directly adjoining the first surface region or the respective second surface regions directly adjoining the first surface regions are not exposed, or only exposed to a negligible degree, to the infrared radiation field, so that the thermoplastic material in each of these second surface regions remains below the melting temperature thereof and such remains in a solid aggregate state, with the result that each of the continuous fibers or continuous fiber regions extending within the respective second surface region remain joined in spatially fixed manner or attached to each other even after the heating process.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">With the application of the alternative method variant according to the solution, it is intended to heat the thermoplastic material matrix in the second surface region above the melting temperature to temperature T<b>2</b>, which is however lower than the temperature T<b>1</b> prevailing in the first surface region. In this way, the continuous fiber components in the second surface region remain movable relative to each other, but to a degree which is adjustable in controlled manner and less than the continuous fiber components within the first surface region. Thus, it is possible to create thermal conditions that are individually harmonised with each other within two adjoining surface regions, with viscosities that are each adjustable in controlled manner and associated relative movement capabilities of the continuous fiber components within the respective molten thermoplastic material matrix.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In order to shade or cover the respective second surface region of the cover layer, screens or masks can be used which are arranged as close as possible to the surface of the cover layer and thus confer a thermal shading effect to protect the respective second surface region or the respective second surface regions from the infrared radiation field which would otherwise act on the cover layer.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In a further preferred embodiment of the method according to the invention, in a first method step the entire surface of the at least one cover layer containing the continuous fibers of the semifinished composite structure product is heated homogeneously to a preheat temperature below the melting temperature of the thermoplastic material. In principle, the preheating may be carried out by any means, for example in at least one of a furnace and using at least one radiation source to generate an infrared radiation field directed towards the surface of the cover layer of the semifinished composite structure product.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In a second, subsequent method step, only the at least one first surface region of the cover layer of the semifinished composite structure product is heated to or above the melting temperature, with the result that the matrix of thermoplastic material present in this at least one first surface region is converted to a flowable or fluid aggregate state.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The heating of the cover layer of the semifinished composite structure product in the second method step is performed with at least one infrared radiation field in such manner that an element is introduced between an infrared radiation source emitting the at least one infrared radiation field and at least one second surface region of the cover layer, by which the at least one second surface region is shielded from the infrared radiation field. As was noted earlier, a preferred element suitable for performing this function is a screen or mask arrangement which at least one of absorbs and reflects the infrared radiation that impinges on it and thereby prevents the thermoplastic material within the respective second surface region from melting.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In a preferred variant of the method, a forced air or gas flow is generated in the heating chamber and at least intermittently passed along the at least one cover layer to be heated before, during and after heating of the at least one cover layer of the semifinished composite structure product, to avoid heat accumulation effects between the screen or mask arrangement and the surface of the cover layer, and thus also strengthen the selectivity between each first surface region to be softened thermally and the respective second surface region immediately adjacent thereto, in which the matrix of thermoplastic material remains in a solid aggregate state.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The number, shape and size of each of the first and second surface regions immediately adjoining each other is determined in each case by the design of the screen or mask arrangement which is discussed in greater detail later, with reference to an illustrated exemplary embodiment thereof.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The heating of the semifinished composite structure product is preferably ended as soon as the matrix of thermoplastic materials within the respective first surface region has melted uniformly at a predefined temperature.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The moldable thermoplastic continuous fiber-reinforced composite structure which has been thermally treated in this way is thus characterized according to the invention in that the matrix of thermoplastic material is melted within at least the one first surface region, with the result that the continuous fibers within the first surface region are able to move relative to each other, whereas the matrix of thermoplastic material within a second surface region immediately adjoining the first surface region retains its solid consistency, and the continuous fibers within the second surface region accordingly remain spatially fixed relative to each other.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In an advanced variant of the method according to the invention, the second heating step, in which the thermoplastic material within the at least first surface region has been melted homogeneously, is followed by a further heating step, whereby an area-specific temperature gradient is produced within each first surface region, that is at least one subsection of the region with a higher temperature than the prevailing temperature exists within a first surface region. By producing such an area-specific temperature gradient is possible to obtain technically usable thermal effects in the layers of thermoplastic material of the composite structure which are each at least one of directly and indirectly adjacent to the cover layer. For example, if the layer concerned is a structured core layer in the form of a honeycomb structure for example, positioned below the cover layer, it is thus possible to control the temperature of the honeycomb structure made of thermoplastic material locally and individually, and consequently to reshape areas thereof differently.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The concept on which the method according to the invention is based, that of local fixing or establishing a predetermined, preferably reduced relative movability in controlled manner of the continuous fibers embedded within a matrix of thermoplastic material inside a cover layer of a composite structure and creating softened surface regions of the cover layer for a controlled relative movement of the continuous fibers in the softened matrix as part of a subsequent thermopressing or thermoforming process, enables the thermal pretreatment of a moldable thermoplastic continuous fiber-reinforced composite structure to be carried out inexpensively and in a manner that lends itself to industrial manufacturing, which structure is then suitable as a semifinished product for a subsequent processing operation in which the composite structure is at least one of functionalized and molded.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Besides their suitability for a subsequent pressing or thermoforming process as described previously, the cover layer regions that have been melted according to the invention are suitable for attaching further thermoplastic parts or components, which may be joined to the first surface regions, each of which have been softened above their melting point, in an injection molding or casting process.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The invention will now be described for exemplary purposes without limitation of the general inventive thought on the basis of embodiments thereof and with reference to the drawing.

A core layer <b>4</b> is located immediately adjacent to the top cover layer <b>3</b>, and is constructed either from further continuous fiber-reinforced thermoplastic individual layers or a structured thermoplastic layer, in the form of a honeycomb structure for example. A bottom thermoplastic cover layer <b>5</b> is located immediately below the core layer <b>4</b>; continuous fibers <b>3</b> are also embedded in the thermoplastic matrix of the bottom cover layer. The thermoplastic materials of at least the top and bottom cover layers <b>2</b>, <b>5</b> are preferably identical. The flat semifinished composite structure product initially has a solid consistency.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In order to heat the respective top and bottom cover layers <b>2</b>, <b>5</b>, the semifinished composite structure product <b>1</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is positioned between two infrared radiation fields <b>6</b>, which are each emitted by a plurality of radiation sources <b>7</b> mounted on support structures <b>8</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref><i>a. </i>Both infrared radiation fields <b>6</b> have a homogeneous radiation intensity, with which the semifinished composite structure product <b>1</b>, mounted on a support grid structure <b>13</b>, is irradiated uniformly. The support grid structure <b>13</b> preferably is a metal grating which is transparent to infrared radiation but has no or negligibly weak infrared shading properties.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The surfaces of the top and bottom cover layers <b>2</b>, <b>5</b> of the semifinished composite structure product <b>1</b> are irradiated completely and uniformly in a preheating process until both cover layers <b>2</b>, <b>5</b> reach a temperature just below the melting point of the thermoplastic material. The melting temperature is defined as the crystallite melting point for semicrystalline thermoplastics and as the glass transition temperature for amorphous thermoplastics.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">After reaching a predetermined target temperature just below the melting temperature, typically 3 to 20 K below the melting temperature, screens <b>9</b>, preferably made from a metallic material, are placed close to the surface of the cover layers <b>2</b>, <b>5</b> between the IR radiation sources <b>7</b> and the semifinished composite structure product <b>1</b>, preferably each at a distance between 0.5 and 3 cm above or below the surface of the cover layer. The screens shield the top and bottom cover layers <b>2</b>, <b>5</b> from infrared radiation <b>6</b> for the purpose of further heating of the respective second surface region <b>10</b>, with the result that further heat input by the infrared radiation <b>6</b> in these respective second surface regions is prevented. The screens <b>9</b> are preferably arranged to be movable relative to the support grid structure <b>13</b>, so the screens <b>9</b> are each slidable above or below the top or bottom cover layer <b>2</b>, <b>5</b> respectively for purposes of shielding them from infrared radiation.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the subsequent phase of the process, the regions that are not shielded by the screens <b>9</b>, referred to as the first surface regions <b>11</b>, are heated further until the thermoplastic material within the first surface regions <b>11</b> of the top and bottom cover layers <b>2</b>, <b>5</b> is completely and uniformly molten.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Since the coefficient of thermal conductivity of the thermoplastic material in the top and bottom cover layers <b>2</b>, <b>5</b> is only small, and due to the colder air temperature in the atmosphere surrounding the semifinished composite structure product <b>1</b>&#x2014;compared with the temperature of the semifinished composite structure product&#x2014;little or only a negligible quantity of heat is input into the respective shielded second surface regions <b>10</b>. This enables a highly effective isolation of the respective solid thermoplastic matrix within the second surface regions <b>10</b> from the respective, molten first surface regions <b>11</b> which are directly adjacent thereto. The melting process according to the invention can be interrupted or ended instantaneously as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>c </i></figref>to prevent undesirable overheating and the associated material degradations within the softened thermoplastic material matrix.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The shape, number and size of each of the second surface regions <b>10</b> that remain in the solid aggregate state may be selected individually using individually configured and arranged screens <b>9</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">As the outcome, a moldable thermoplastic continuous fiber-reinforced composite structure <b>12</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is obtained, whose top and bottom cover layers <b>2</b>, <b>5</b> have first surface regions <b>11</b>, in which the continuous fibers <b>3</b> embedded in the locally melted thermoplastic matrix are movable relative to each other, whereas within the second surface regions <b>10</b> immediately adjoining the first surface regions <b>11</b> the continuous fibers <b>3</b> embedded in the respective solid thermoplastic matrix are joined fixedly. The fixed attachment of the continuous fibers within the second surface region <b>10</b> is ensures that the continuous fibers <b>3</b> within the first surface regions <b>11</b> can be re-orientated correctly in the course of subsequent reshaping process. The stabilization of the continuous fibers with each of the second surface regions <b>10</b> makes it possible to obtain more complex component geometries when producing continuous fiber-reinforced thermoplastic components with reversibly definable material properties.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The moldable, thermoplastic, continuous fiber-reinforced composite structure <b>12</b> can be removed from the infrared heater with the aid of a suitable gripping and transporting apparatus, which grips and handles the composite structure <b>12</b> only by the unmelted second surface regions <b>10</b>, and these leave no handling marks of any kind on the surfaces of the respective second surface regions <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The screens <b>9</b> explained previously lend themselves to use in the case of the alternative method variants, in which the second surface regions <b>10</b> are also heated to a temperature T<b>2</b> above the melting temperature but below the temperature T<b>1</b> prevailing in the respective first surface regions <b>11</b>. Contrary to the previous explanations, both cover layers <b>2</b>, <b>5</b> are preheated completely and uniformly to temperature T<b>1</b>, preferably just above the melting point of the thermoplastic material. The further heating is carried out as described earlier, using screens <b>9</b> that shield the respective second surface regions <b>10</b> contactlessly.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">LIST OF REFERENCE NUMERALS</heading><p id="p-0056" num="0055"><b>1</b> Semifinished composite structure product</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056"><b>2</b> Top cover layer</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057"><b>3</b> Continuous fibers</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058"><b>4</b> Core layer</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059"><b>5</b> Bottom cover layer</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060"><b>6</b> Infrared radiation field</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061"><b>7</b> Infrared radiation source</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062"><b>8</b> Support structure</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063"><b>9</b> Screen</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064"><b>10</b> Second surface region</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065"><b>11</b> First surface region</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066"><b>12</b> Composite structure</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067"><b>13</b> Support grid structure</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-01-19" num="01-19"><claim-text><b>1</b>-<b>19</b>.
