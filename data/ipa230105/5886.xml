LED displays have been competed to implement a large-area display in the field of display technology.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, there exist problems such as not-so-fast response time, low efficiency of light generated by backlight in case of LCDs, and there exist drawbacks such as short life span, not-so-good yield as well as low efficiency in case of OLEDs.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">On the contrary, when semiconductor light emitting elements (micro LEDs) having a diameter or a cross sectional area of 100 micrometers or less are used in a display, the display may provide a very high efficiency because it does not absorb light using a polarizing plate or the like. However, since a large-sized display requires millions of semiconductor light-emitting elements, it has difficulty in transferring the devices compared to other technologies.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Technologies currently in development for transfer processes include pick &#x26; place, laser lift-off (LLO), self-assembly, or the like. Among them, the self-assembly method, which is a method in which the semiconductor light-emitting element locates themselves in a fluid, is the most advantageous method for realizing a large-sized display device.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">On the other hand, the self-assembly method includes a method of directly assembling the semiconductor light-emitting element to a final substrate to be used in a product, and a method of assembling the semiconductor light-emitting element on an assembly substrate and then transferring the semiconductor light-emitting element to the final substrate through an additional transfer process. The direct assembly method on the final substrate is efficient in terms of process, and in the case of using the assembly substrate, there is an advantage in that a structure for self-assembly can be added without limitation, and therefore, the two methods are selectively used.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">An aspect of the present disclosure is to provide a display device having a structure in which a vertical semiconductor light-emitting element seated in a cell is electrically connected to a lower wiring through a solder layer filling an inside of the cell.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another aspect of the present disclosure is to provide a method of manufacturing a display device in which a vertical semiconductor light-emitting element is directly seated on a final substrate in a self-assembly method, and then a solder layer filling an inside of a cell is formed and electrically connected to a lower wiring.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A display device according to an embodiment of the present disclosure may include a base portion;
