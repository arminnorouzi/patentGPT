It is particularly applicable, but not limited, to motor vehicles.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">An element of a motor vehicle luminous device, known to those skilled in the art, such as an intermediate screen of a position light comprises an injection volume formed of a primary volume and a secondary volume. One of the volumes is smaller than the other. They each have an injection point through which material has been injected to form two parts of said element. A sequential injection process is used in which material is injected by means of a nozzle via the first injection point to fill the primary volume, then material is injected by means of the same nozzle via the second injection point to fill the smaller secondary volume, at the same time as the injection of the primary volume ends. The injection points are opened sequentially one after the other to inject the material.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A drawback of this prior art is that an overpressure occurs at the level of the nozzle during the filling of the secondary volume with the material, which creates a problem of so-called frosting which is transmitted around the second injection point and in a part of the secondary volume. Besides the problem of frosting, whitish halos may also appear around this second injection point.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In this context, the present invention aims to propose an element of a vehicle luminous device which also makes it possible to solve the drawback mentioned.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">To this end, the invention proposes an element of a vehicle luminous device made of synthetic polymer material and comprising an injection volume formed of a primary volume and a secondary volume, characterized in that said element further comprises a material injection channel comprising:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0007">at least two parts extending respectively in different directions, of which a first part comprises an injection point and a second part is connected to said secondary volume,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0008">at least one bend of variable angle connecting said at least two parts and comprising a protuberance.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0008" num="0009">Thus, as will be seen in detail below, the protuberance will make it possible to trap the volume of material which undergoes the overpressure during the second injection, this volume of material cooling while the rest of the material continues to flow in the other part of the injection channel. The volume of material remains stored in the protuberance. After the change of direction defined by the bend, the flow pressure of the material is more homogeneous, without overpressure in the secondary volume of the element.</p><p id="p-0009"

In one nonlimiting embodiment, the vehicle is a motor vehicle. The term motor vehicle is understood to mean any type of motorized vehicle. This embodiment is taken as a nonlimiting example throughout the remainder of the description. Throughout the remainder of the description, the vehicle is thus also called a motor vehicle.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0038">In one nonlimiting embodiment, the luminous device <b>2</b> is a position light T called a tail light. In one nonlimiting embodiment, the luminous device <b>2</b> further performs a signaling function TI, otherwise called an indicating function, the device being called a turn indicator. In one nonlimiting embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the signaling function TI is centered between two parts <b>11</b> and <b>10</b> of the luminous device <b>2</b>, the two parts making it possible to perform the position function T.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0039">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the luminous device <b>2</b> comprises at least one light source <b>20</b>, an optical element <b>21</b> such as, in nonlimiting examples, a reflector, a light guide or a lens, said element <b>1</b>, and a transparent outer output lens <b>22</b>. The optical element <b>21</b> is configured to generate a light beam F from light rays R emitted by the light source <b>20</b>, said light beam F illuminating said element <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0040">In one nonlimiting embodiment, said element <b>1</b> is an intermediate screen arranged between said optical element <b>21</b> and said outer output lens <b>22</b>. Said element <b>1</b> is thus backlit by the light beam F generated by the optical element <b>21</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the element <b>1</b> is made up of three layers, otherwise known as stations. In one nonlimiting embodiment, a first layer <b>1</b><i>a </i>is opaque (otherwise called opaque layer <b>1</b><i>a</i>), a second layer <b>1</b><i>b </i>is of opaline color (otherwise called opaline color layer <b>1</b><i>b</i>), and a third layer <b>1</b><i>c </i>is transparent. This last layer <b>1</b><i>c </i>is also called crystal layer <b>1</b><i>c. </i>The first layer <b>1</b><i>a </i>is in a nonlimiting example of black color, which makes it possible to have an esthetic function.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0041">In one nonlimiting embodiment, the element <b>1</b> is made of synthetic polymer. In one nonlimiting embodiment, the synthetic polymer is PMMA (polymethyl methacrylate) or PC (polycarbonate). Owing to the production in three layers, in one nonlimiting embodiment, three different injections are used to produce the three layers. It will be noted that the signaling function TI is located in the third layer <b>1</b><i>c. </i></p><p id="p-0041" num="0042">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, said element <b>1</b> comprises an injection volume V formed by a primary volume <b>10</b> and a secondary volume <b>11</b> which thus each define a part of the luminous device <b>2</b> to perform the position function T. In a first nonlimiting embodiment illustrated in the figures, the primary volume <b>10</b> and the secondary volume <b>11</b> are separated. In the nonlimiting example, they are separated by part of the crystal layer <b>1</b><i>c. </i>This part of the crystal layer <b>1</b><i>c </i>also makes it possible to perform the signaling function TI. In a second nonlimiting embodiment that is not illustrated, the primary volume <b>10</b> and the secondary volume <b>11</b> are not separated. They are edge to edge.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0043">In one nonlimiting embodiment, the primary volume <b>10</b> is approximately five times larger than the secondary volume <b>11</b>. The element <b>1</b> comprises a first injection point for the primary volume <b>10</b> and a second injection point for the secondary volume <b>11</b>. Material is injected first into the primary volume <b>10</b>, then second into the secondary volume <b>11</b>. Both injections end at the same time. The primary volume <b>10</b> thus comprises an injection point <b>100</b><i>a </i>(otherwise called the first injection point <b>100</b><i>a</i>), and the secondary volume <b>11</b>, which is smaller, thus comprises an injection point <b>120</b><i>a </i>(otherwise called the second injection point <b>100</b><i>a</i>). The first injection point <b>100</b><i>a </i>makes it possible to start an injection of material before an injection of material via the second injection point <b>120</b><i>a. </i>The injection of material via the first injection point <b>100</b><i>a </i>does not create any appearance defect, such as frosting. The injection of material via the second injection point <b>120</b><i>a </i>creates an appearance defect, such as frosting, which will be trapped in a protuberance <b>123</b> of a material injection channel <b>12</b> described below.

This change of direction makes it possible to prevent the frosting from spreading in the second part <b>121</b> of the material injection channel <b>12</b> and consequently in the secondary volume <b>11</b>. It is recalled that the frosting results in a set of localized or superimposed microbubbles which are distributed randomly around the injection point and the injection threshold and which can travel up to a distance of approximately <b>50</b> mm from an injection point. In addition to the frosting problem, the change of direction makes it possible to avoid a so-called free jet problem in the secondary volume <b>11</b>. It is recalled that the free jet problem is manifested by a projection of an uncontrolled material front due to a pressure difference between the inlet and the outlet of the injection threshold, which leads to nonhomogeneous filling of the material, which is manifested by a serpentine appearance.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0052">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the bend <b>122</b> comprises an inner periphery <b>122</b><i>a </i>and an outer periphery <b>122</b><i>b </i>(illustrated in dotted lines in the figure). In one nonlimiting embodiment, the bend <b>122</b> includes an angle of approximately 90&#xb0;. Thus, the first part <b>120</b> extends in a direction Ax, and the second part <b>121</b> extends in a direction Ay perpendicular to the first part <b>120</b>. This makes it possible to control the flow of the material well. In another embodiment, the bend <b>122</b> includes an acute angle. In one nonlimiting embodiment, the bend <b>122</b> has a sharp angle as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> or is rounded as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0053">In a first nonlimiting embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the element <b>1</b> comprises a single bend <b>122</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0054">In a second nonlimiting embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the element <b>1</b> comprises two bends <b>122</b><sub>1 </sub>and <b>122</b><sub>2</sub>. This makes it possible to increase the volume in which the material flows, and therefore in which the frosting extends. A bend <b>122</b><sub>1 </sub>comprises the protuberance <b>123</b>.

It is recalled that the injection via the material injection channel <b>12</b> represents the second injection for the element <b>1</b>, namely that for the secondary volume <b>11</b> which is the smallest volume. The material which undergoes the overpressure is trapped in the protuberance <b>123</b> and remains stored in the protuberance; it cools and hardens; while the rest of the material continues to flow in the second part <b>121</b> of the material injection channel <b>12</b>. It will be noted that the overpressure to which the injected material is subjected is limited in time. It lasts about 1.5 seconds. When the injection point <b>120</b><i>a </i>opens, the frosting defect propagates from the injection point <b>120</b><i>a </i>to the protuberance <b>123</b> and thus stops at the protuberance <b>123</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0056">In nonlimiting embodiments, the protuberance <b>123</b> has a trapezoidal or hemispherical or rectangular cross section.

Thus, the element <b>1</b> can be made of any injected synthetic polymer material. Thus, in one nonlimiting embodiment, the protuberance <b>123</b> can have the shape of a droplet. Thus, in other nonlimiting embodiments, said element <b>1</b> is composed of a single layer, of two layers or of more than three layers. In one nonlimiting variant embodiment, when it is composed of a single layer or of two layers, the material injection channel <b>12</b> is in this case covered by an additional part of the luminous device <b>2</b>, which makes it possible to make it invisible to the naked eye by an observer outside the vehicle.
