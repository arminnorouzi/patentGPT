The convertible roof can typically be moved between a closed position and at least one open position. When in the closed position, the convertible roof closes off the roof top opening and protects the occupants of the vehicle from various weather conditions. However, there are occasions where the weather is pleasant, and it is desired by the occupants of the vehicle to move the convertible roof to one of its open positions such that the vehicle essentially functions with a sunroof opening, exposing the front cockpit, or further back without a roof where the vehicle interior is exposed to the atmosphere. This allows the occupants of the vehicle to enjoy more favorable weather conditions.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, current designs for roof tops do not allow for the assembly to open and drop efficiently at the rear of the vehicle, and do not have the option to rotate down and are bulky&#x2014;making them difficult to move and taking up a lot of space. They also have limited visibility out of the back of the vehicle. Known tops are rather cumbersome to use and take up too much space when in open positions&#x2014;which is a significant issue due to the poor aerodynamics and wind drag thereby decreasing fuel efficiency while increasing noise from the assembly. Yet another known issue with conventional systems is lowered visibility due to hard rear corners. Theft deterrents are also desired.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, there exists a need for a rear hard enclosure interaction that provides improved visibility, security, and theft deterrent and improvement in controlling the motion of the roof top system roof for the vehicle that is capable of movement between a closed position and a plurality of open positions, including dropped down into the cargo hold area of the vehicle.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention is directed to a panel top assembly adapted for a vehicle, including, a pair of rear side window drip rails operably interfacing with a pair of hard rear side windows, combined with security (e.g., from theft, smash and grab, etc.) by providing the pair of hard rear side windows that wrap around from the side to the back of the vehicle, interface with a rear window, and are adapted to operably connect to the vehicle&#x2014;forming a rear hard corner with the added benefit of improved visibility. The wrapping pair of hard rear side windows are transparent or clear, including at the hard rear corners, and the rear window is transparent or clear, and the panels interface with each other and are adapted to selectively connect to the vehicle, all of which improves visibility and security and are significant advantages over conventional systems. A pair of hard rear drip rails operably interface to the pair of hard rear side windows.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The hard rear window and pair of hard rear side windows are selectively removable from the vehicle. An articulating portion of the top panel assembly is selectively moveable to operably move rearward and drop down into an open position into the rear cargo area of the vehicle. In addition, the pair of hard rear drip rails rock rearward bringing the back end to rest in the rear cargo area such that the drip rails are at a predetermined angle when the top panel assembly is in the open position.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further areas of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating the preferred embodiment of the invention, are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention will become more fully understood from the detailed description and the accompanying drawings, wherein:</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a side perspective view of the panel top assembly, in accordance with the present invention;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a detailed perspective view of the panel top assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> showing the folding feature of the panel top assembly of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is rear perspective view of the panel top assembly of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a rear view of the panel top assembly of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a left side perspective view of the panel top assembly of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a top perspective view of a removable side window assembly of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a rear perspective view of the removeable side window panel assembly in place on the exemplary vehicle, in accordance with the present invention;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is an inside detailed perspective view of the removeable side window assembly showing the securement latch for latching of the side window to the vehicle, in accordance with the present invention;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is an inside corner perspective view of the panel top assembly of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a is a rear corner perspective view of the panel top assembly of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a detailed perspective view of the latching attachment of the panel top assembly of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a detailed rear view of the panel top assembly of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a detailed perspective view of a rear latching assembly of the panel top assembly of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is rear side perspective view of the panel top assembly of the present invention in an open position;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is a rear view showing a hinge and attachment of the rear window of the panel top assembly of the present invention; and</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> is a side view showing the panel top assembly of the present invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The following description of the preferred embodiment(s) is merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its application, or uses.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>16</b></figref> generally, a panel top assembly is shown generally at <b>10</b>, adapted for operably attaching at a roof top opening of a vehicle <b>16</b> (e.g., sport utility vehicles), in accordance with the present invention.
