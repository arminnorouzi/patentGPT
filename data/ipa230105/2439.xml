id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to transition metal-free synthetic methods for producing tubulysin compounds having substitution of the amide nitrogen atom of the tubuvaline component, and intermediates thereof.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Tubulysins are a class of powerful cytostatic agents that exhibit their activity through inhibition of tubulin polymerization. Naturally-occurring tubulysins are linear tetrapeptides consisting of N-methyl D-pipecolic acid (Mep), isoleucine (Ile), tubuvaline (Tuv), an unnatural amino acid, and either tubutyrosine (Tut, an analog of tyrosine) or tubuphenylalanine (Tup, an analog of phenylalanine), both of which are unnatural amino acids, as shown in Formula T:</p><p id="p-0004" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-C00001" he="41.49mm" wi="108.03mm" file="US20230002440A1-20230105-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0005" num="0003">Tubulysins have been explored as potential cancer chemotherapeutics and as payloads on Ligand-Drug Conjugates (LDCs). Tubulysins comprising an N-substituted tubuvaline are of particular interest because of their potency (Sasse, F. et al. <i>J. Antibiot</i>. (<i>Tokyo</i>) (2000) 53(9): 879-885. The development of N-substituted tubulysin analogs and methods of more efficient preparations is of clinical importance.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0004">Generally, N-substituted tubulysins are assembled via peptide synthesis starting from N-substituted tubuvaline derivatives. An exemplary method of preparing such tubuvaline intermediates and the corresponding tubulysin compounds is provided by Patterson et al.&#x201c;Expedient Synthesis of N-Methyl Tubulysin Analogues with High Cytotoxicity&#x201d; <i>J. Org. Chem. </i>(2008) 73(12): 4362-4369.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0005">The methods of synthesis of tubulysin compounds having substitution of the amide nitrogen atom of the tubuvaline component reported in the literature to date involve multiple steps that are not easily scalable. Therefore, a need exists in the art for improved processes in producing N-substituted tubuvaline intermediates for preparation of tubulysin compounds, such as Tubulysin M, for conjugation in obtaining a therapeutic Antibody Drug Conjugate. A synthetic method that does not require the use of a heavy metal catalyst or has fewer steps requiring cryogenic temperatures (below &#x2212;70&#xb0; C.) would be particularly useful in the manufacturing of a medicant. Eliminating the use of heavy metal catalysts reduces the potential for heavy metal contamination in the therapeutic Conjugate. Those impurities must be carefully controlled and cannot exceed a threshold level for it to be suitable for human use, which adds to the cost of manufacturing. Cryogenic temperatures can also be problematic beyond benchtop scale due to cost, so a reaction sequence having fewer such steps would be beneficial. Therefore, the methods described herein address the unmet need for scalable methods at reduced cost for preparing the tubuvaline component of a tubulysin compound and therapeutic Conjugates related thereto.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0006">A principal embodiment of the invention provides for a method for preparing a tubuvaline compound of (R,R)-Formula 2:</p><p id="p-0009" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-C00002" he="19.30mm" wi="66.89mm" file="US20230002440A1-20230105-C00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0010" num="0007">or a composition comprised or consisting essentially of that compound, optionally in salt form, wherein: the circled Ar is a 1,3-phenylene or a nitrogen-containing 5- or 6-membered 1,3-heteroarylene, optionally substituted at the remaining positions;

Specifically, the present invention provides tubuvaline derivatives that are readily generated using a Michael addition by a carbamate anion that introduces a suitable protected secondary amine into a tubuvaline precursor without the need for difficult to control reaction conditions, particularly exceedingly low temperatures typically associated with generation of reactive anions thus increasing yields and shortening overall reaction times.

Invention embodiments also specifically include those compounds, compositions, compositions or methods that are, or that consist of, or that consist essentially of those specified components, elements or steps. For example, disclosed compositions, devices, articles of manufacture or methods that &#x201c;comprise&#x201d; a component or step are open and they include or read on those compositions or methods plus an additional component(s) or step(s). However, those terms do not encompass unrecited elements that would destroy the functionality of the disclosed compositions, devices, articles of manufacture or methods for its intended purpose. The term &#x201c;comprised of&#x201d; is used interchangeably with the term &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; and are stated as equivalent terms.

Furthermore, the term &#x201c;consisting essentially of&#x201d; admits for the inclusion of unrecited elements or steps that have no material effect on the functionality of the disclosed compositions, devices, articles of manufacture or methods for its intended purpose as further defined herein.

Reasonable deviations include those that are within the accuracy or precision of the instrument(s) used in measuring, determining or deriving the particular property. Specifically, the term &#x201c;about&#x201d; when used in this context, indicate that the numeric value or range of values can vary by 10%, 9%, 8%, 7%, 6%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 1%, 0.9%, 0.8%, 0.7%, 0.6%, 0.5%, 0.4%, 0.3%, 0.2%, 0.1%, or 0.01% of the recited value or range of values, typically by 10% to 0.5%, more typically by 5% to 1%, while still describing the particular property.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0029">With respect to subscript p, which denotes the average number of drug linker moieties in a Ligand Drug Conjugate composition as further defined herein, the term &#x201c;about&#x201d; reflects the accepted uncertainty in the art for determining that value from a distribution of Ligand Drug Conjugate compounds within that composition as determined by standard methods of size exclusion or HIC chromatography or HPLC-MS.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0030">&#x201c;Essentially retains&#x201d;, &#x201c;essentially retaining&#x201d; and like terms, as used herein, refers to a property, characteristic, function or activity of a compound or composition or moiety thereof that has not detectably changed or is within experimental error of determination of that same activity, characteristic or property of a compound or composition or moiety of related structure.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0031">&#x201c;Substantially retains&#x201d;, &#x201c;substantially retaining&#x201d; and like terms, as used herein, refers to a measured value of a physical property or characteristic of a compound or composition or moiety thereof that may be statistically different from the determination of that same physical property of another compound or composition or moiety of related structure, but which such difference does not translate to a statistically significant or meaningful difference in biological activity or pharmacological property in a suitable biological test system for evaluating that activity or property (i.e., biological activity or property is essentially retained). Thus the phrase &#x201c;substantially retains&#x201d; is made in reference to the effect that a physical property or characteristic of a compound or composition has on a physiochemical or pharmacological property or biological activity that is explicitly associated with that physical property or characteristic.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0032">&#x201c;Negligibly&#x201d; or &#x201c;negligible&#x201d;, as used herein, is an amount of an impurity below the level of quantification by HPLC analysis and if optical impurities are present represents from about 0.5% to about 0.1 w/w % of the composition that it contaminates. Depending on context, those terms may alternatively mean that no statistically significant difference is observed between measured values or outcomes or are within experimental error of the instrumentation used to obtain those values. Negligible differences in values of a parameter determined experimentally do not imply that an impurity characterized by that parameter is present in negligible amount.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0033">&#x201c;Predominately containing&#x201d;, &#x201c;predominately having&#x201d; and like terms, as used herein, refers to the major component of a mixture.

Typical protecting groups for atoms or functional groups are given in Greene (1999), &#x201c;Protective groups in organic synthesis, 3<sup>rd </sup>ed.&#x201d;, Wiley Interscience. Protecting groups for heteroatoms such as oxygen, sulfur and nitrogen are sometime used to minimize or avoid their unwanted reactions with electrophilic compounds. Other times the protecting group is used to reduce or eliminate the nucleophilicity and/or basicity of the unprotected heteroatom. Non-limiting examples of protected oxygen are given by &#x2014;OR<sup>PR</sup>, wherein R<sup>PR </sup>is a protecting group for hydroxyl, wherein hydroxyl is typically protected as an ester (e.g., acetate, propionate or benzoate). Other protecting groups for hydroxyl avoid its interference with the nucleophilicity of organometallic reagents or other highly basic reagents, for which purpose hydroxyl is typically protected as an ether, including without limitation alkyl or heterocyclyl ethers, (e.g., methyl or tetrahydropyranyl ethers), alkoxymethyl ethers (e.g., methoxymethyl or ethoxymethyl ethers), optionally substituted aryl ethers, and silyl ethers (e.g., trimethylsilyl (TMS), triethylsilyl (TES), tert-butyldiphenylsilyl (TBDPS), tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TB S/TBDMS), triisopropylsilyl (TIPS) and [2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxy]-methylsilyl (SEM)). Nitrogen protecting groups include those for primary or secondary amines as in &#x2014;NHR<sup>PR </sup>or &#x2014;N(R<sup>PR</sup>)<sub>2</sub>, wherein at least one of R<sup>PR </sup>is a nitrogen atom protecting group or both R<sup>PR </sup>together define a nitrogen atom protecting group.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0097">A protecting group is a suitable for protecting when it is capable of preventing or substantially avoiding unwanted side-reactions and/or premature loss of the protecting group under reaction conditions required to effect desired chemical transformation(s) elsewhere in the molecule and during purification of the newly formed molecule when desired, and can be removed under conditions that do not adversely affect the structure or stereochemical integrity of that newly formed molecule. In some aspects, suitable protecting groups are those previously described for protecting functional groups. In other aspects, a suitable protecting group is a protecting group used in peptide coupling reactions. For example, a suitable protecting group for the basic nitrogen atom of a tubuvaline compound's acyclic or cyclic Basic Unit is an acid-labile carbamate protecting group such as t-butyloxycarbonyl (BOC).</p><p id="p-0110" num="0098">&#x201c;Ester&#x201d; as used herein, unless otherwise stated or implied by context, refers to a substituent, moiety or group having the structure of &#x2014;C(&#x2550;O)&#x2014;O&#x2014; to define an ester functional group in which the carbonyl carbon atom of that structure is not directly connected to another heteroatom but is directly connected to hydrogen or another carbon atom of an organic moiety with which it is associated, and wherein the monovalent oxygen atom is either attached to the same organic moiety at a different carbon atom to provide a lactone or to a Markush structure or to some other organic moiety.

In some instances the abnormal cells having the antigen are hyper-proliferating cells in a mammal.

Typically, those abnormal cells are mammalian cells and more typically are human cells. In other aspects, the targeted cells are within the vicinity of the abnormal cells so that action of the Ligand Drug Conjugate on the nearby cells has an intended effect on the abnormal cells. For example, the nearby cells may be epithelial cells that are characteristic of the abnormal vasculature of a tumor. Targeting of those vascular cells by a Ligand Drug Conjugate will either have a cytotoxic or a cytostatic effect on these cells, which is believed to result in inhibition of nutrient delivery to the nearby abnormal cells of the tumor.

A Linker Unit (LU) is comprised of a primary linker (L<sub>R</sub>), which is a required component of that Unit, and an optional secondary linker (L<sub>O</sub>) that is present and intervenes between L<sub>R </sub>and D<sup>+</sup> within a quaternied drug linker moiety of a Ligand Drug Conjugate compound or between D<sup>+</sup> and L<sub>R </sub>of a Drug Linker compound, which in the latter instance may be represented as L<sub>R</sub>&#x2032; to explicitly indicate that is a precursor of L<sub>R </sub>in a Ligand Drug Conjugate. In some aspects, L<sub>R </sub>is comprised of a succinimide (M<sup>2</sup>) or succinic acid amide (M<sup>3</sup>) moiety and is sometimes further comprised of a Basic Unit (acyclic or cyclic) within a Linker Unit of a Ligand Drug Conjugate compound when L<sub>R </sub>is L<sub>SS </sub>or L<sub>S</sub>, and in other aspects, a primary linker is comprised of a maleimide (M<sup>1</sup>) moiety in a Drug Linker compound, and is sometimes further comprised of a Basic Unit (acyclic or cyclic), either in protected or protonated, when L<sub>R</sub>&#x2032; is L<sub>SS</sub>&#x2032;. As a Drug Linker compound as described herein is sometimes comprised of a maleimide (M<sup>1</sup>) moiety, attachment of a targeting agent, which results in a Ligand Unit (L), occurs to such a Drug Linker compound through a sulfur atom of a reactive thiol functional group of the targeting agent by way of Michael addition of that sulfur atom to the maleimide ring system of M<sup>1</sup>. When the targeting agent is an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof, the reactive thiol functional group in some aspects is provided by a cysteine thiol of the antibody resulting from disulfide bond reduction and/or other chemical modification of a native antibody amino acid residue and/or by introduction through genetic engineering. As a result of that addition, a Linker Unit of a Ligand Drug Conjugate compound contains a succinimide (M<sup>2</sup>) moiety having a thio-substituted succinimide ring system. When the Linker Unit contains a Basic Unit subsequent hydrolysis of that ring system under controlled conditions due to the presence of the acyclic or cyclic Basic Unit as part of a self-stabilizing linker (L<sub>SS</sub>), in which L<sub>R </sub>within a Ligand Drug Conjugate is L<sub>SS</sub>, results in a succinic acid-amide (M<sup>3</sup>) moiety, which is a component of self-stabilized linker (L<sub>S</sub>), as further described herein. As a result, L<sub>SS </sub>in a Ligand Drug Conjugate compound is hydrolyzed so that L<sub>R </sub>as L<sub>SS </sub>becomes L<sub>S</sub>. That hydrolysis is controllable due to the Basic Unit (BU), as further described herein, being in appropriate proximity to the succinimide ring system. If no Basic Unit is present in L<sub>R</sub>, hydrolysis of the succinimide moiety may still occur, but may do so in an uncontrolled manner</p><p id="p-0149" num="0135">&#x201c;Primary linker&#x201d; as the term is used herein, unless otherwise stated or implied by context, refers to a required component of Linker Unit (LU), which provides the site of attachment to the Ligand Unit for Ligand Drug Conjugates and in a Drug Linker compound is capable of providing that attachment. In some aspects, a primary linker is a self-stabilizing (L<sub>SS</sub>) linker in Ligand Drug Conjugate or Drug Linker compound and in other aspects is a self-stabilized (L<sub>S</sub>) linker in a Ligand Drug Conjugate, as further described herein. A L<sub>SS </sub>primary linker in a Drug Linker compound or a Ligand Drug Conjugate is characterized by a maleimide (M<sup>1</sup>) or succinimide (M<sup>2</sup>) moiety, respectively, in proximity to a Basic Unit, while a L<sub>S </sub>primary linker in a Ligand Drug Conjugate composition or compound thereof is characterized by a succinic acid amide (M<sup>3</sup>) moiety in proximity to a Basic Unit. An L<sub>SS </sub>or L<sub>S </sub>primary linker of the present invention is also characterized by a C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>12 </sub>alkylene moiety bonded to the imide nitrogen of the maleimide or succinimide ring system of M<sup>1 </sup>or M<sup>2 </sup>or the amide nitrogen of M<sup>3</sup>, wherein the alkylene moiety in some aspects is substituted by an acyclic Basic Unit and may be further substituted by optional substituents, or in other aspects incorporates a cyclic Basic Unit that is optionally substituted. A primary linker not containing a Basic Unit may also contain a C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>12 </sub>alkylene moiety bonded to the imide nitrogen of the maleimide or succinimide ring system of M<sup>1 </sup>or M<sup>2</sup>. Drug Linker compounds having a L<sub>SS </sub>primary linker are typically represented in general as L<sub>SS</sub>-L<sub>O</sub>-D<sup>+</sup> while Ligand Drug Conjugates having a L<sub>SS </sub>primary linker are typically represented in general as L-(L<sub>SS</sub>-L<sub>O</sub>-D<sup>+</sup>)<sub>p </sub>and those having a L<sub>S </sub>primary linker are typically represented in general as L-(L<sub>S</sub>-L<sub>O</sub>-D<sup>+</sup>)<sub>p </sub>in which the variable groups are as previously defined herein.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0136">A maleimide (M<sup>1</sup>) moiety of L<sub>SS</sub>, which is sometimes shown as L<sub>SS</sub>&#x2032; to explicitly indicate that it is a precursor to L<sub>SS </sub>in a Ligand Drug Conjugate in a Drug Linker Compound, or in other M<sup>1</sup>-containing primary linkers, is capable of reacting with a thiol functional group of a targeting agent to form a thio-substituted succinimide moiety (M<sup>2</sup>) in primary linker of a Ligand Drug Conjugate, wherein the thio-substituent is a Ligand Unit incorporating or corresponding to the structure of the targeting agent, and wherein the Ligand Unit is bonded to M<sup>2 </sup>through a sulfur atom from one of the targeting agent's thiol functional groups. As a result of that reaction, the targeting agent becomes covalently bonded to the primary linker as a Ligand Unit. Subsequent hydrolysis of M<sup>2 </sup>in a L<sub>SS </sub>primary linker results in a L<sub>S </sub>primary linker in which M<sup>2 </sup>is converted to a succinic acid amide moiety (M<sup>3</sup>). That linker moiety may exist as a mixture of two regioisomers (M<sup>3A </sup>and M<sup>3B</sup>), depending on the relative reactivity of the two carbonyl groups of the succinimide ring system to hydrolysis.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0137">&#x201c;Ligand covalent binding moiety&#x201d; as the term is used herein, unless otherwise stated or implied by context, refers to a moiety of a Linker Unit (LU) in an Ligand Drug Conjugate that interconnects the Ligand Unit (L) and the remainder of the Linker Unit and is derived from reaction of the corresponding ligand covalent binding precursor (L<sub>b</sub>&#x2032;) moiety in a Drug Linker compound with the targeting moiety. For example, when L<sub>b</sub>&#x2032; is comprised of a maleimide moiety (M<sup>1</sup>), reaction of that moiety with a reactive thiol functional group of a targeting moiety converts L<sub>b</sub>&#x2032; to a ligand covalent binding (L<sub>b</sub>) moiety so that a thio-substituted succinimide moiety is obtained, wherein its thio-substituent is comprised of a sulfur atom of the Ligand Unit corresponding to or incorporating the targeting moiety. In another example, when L<sub>b</sub>&#x2032; is comprised of an activated carboxylic acid functional group, reaction of that functional group with an epsilon amino group of a lysine in a targeting moiety converts the functional group to an amide, wherein that amide functional group is shared between L<sub>b </sub>and the attached Ligand Unit. Other L<sub>b</sub>&#x2032;-containing moieties and L<sub>b</sub>-containing moieties obtained therefrom are described in the embodiments of the invention. In some instances, a targeting moiety is derivitized with a bi-functional molecule to provide an intermediate that is condensed with a L<sub>b</sub>&#x2032; moiety. As a result of that condensation the L<sub>b </sub>moiety so formed has atoms attributable to the bi-functional molecule and L<sub>b</sub>&#x2032;.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0138">&#x201c;Ligand covalent binding precursor&#x201d; is a moiety of a Linker Unit, or substructure thereof used in the preparation of a Linker Unit, that is capable of covalent binding to a targeting moiety during the preparation of an Ligand Drug Conjugate whereupon the ligand binding moiety precursor (L<sub>b</sub>&#x2032;) moiety is converted to a ligand covalent binding (L<sub>b</sub>) moiety. In some aspects, a L<sub>b</sub>&#x2032; moiety typically has a functional group capable of reacting with a nucleophile or electrophile native to an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof or is introduced into the antibody or antigen-binding fragment by chemical transformation or genetic engineering. In some aspects, the nucleophile is an N-terminal amino group of a peptide comprising the antibody or antigen-binding fragment or the epsilon amino group of a lysine residue of that peptide. In other aspects, the nucleophile is the sulfur atom of a sulfhydryl group from a cysteine residue introduced by genetic engineering or from chemical reduction of interchain disulfide(s) of an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof.

A maleimide moiety (M<sup>1</sup>) is capable of participating in Michael addition (i.e., 1,4-conjugate addition) by a sulfur atom of a reactive thiol functional group of a targeting agent to provide a thio-substituted succinimide (M<sup>2</sup>) moiety, wherein the thio substituent is from a Ligand Unit that incorporates or correspond to the structure of the targeting agent as described herein in a Ligand Drug Conjugate composition or compound thereof. An M<sup>1 </sup>moiety of a Drug Linker compound is attached to the remainder of the primary linker through its imide nitrogen atom. Other than the imide nitrogen atom, an M<sup>1 </sup>moiety is typically unsubstituted, but may be asymmetrically substituted at the cyclic double bond of its maleimide ring system. Such substitution can result in regiochemically preferred conjugate addition of a sulfur atom of reactive thiol functional group of a targeting agent to the less hindered or more electronically deficient double bonded carbon atom (dependent on the more dominant contribution) of the maleimide ring system. That conjugate addition results in a succinimide (M<sup>2</sup>) moiety, which is thio-substituted by a Ligand Unit though the sulfur atom from the thiol functional group provided by the targeting agent.

In a third such aspect, those selections are made so the basic nitrogen on protonation does not increase the electrophilicity of the succinimide carbonyls by inductive electron withdrawal to an extent that would promote premature hydrolysis requiring compensation from an undesired excess of Drug Linker compound. In a final such aspect, some combination of those mechanistic effects contributes to catalysis for controlled hydrolysis of L<sub>SS </sub>to L<sub>S</sub>.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0168">Typically, an acyclic Basic Unit, which may act through one or more of the above mechanistic aspects, is comprised of 1 carbon atom or 2 to 6 contiguous carbon atoms, more typically of 1 carbon atom or 2 or 3 contiguous carbon atoms, wherein the carbon atom(s) connect the basic amino functional group of the acyclic Basic Unit to the remainder of the L<sub>SS </sub>moiety to which it is attached. In order for that basic amine nitrogen to be in the required proximity to assist in the hydrolysis of a succinimide (M<sup>2</sup>) moiety to its corresponding ring-opened succinic acid amide (M<sup>3</sup>) moiety, the amine-bearing carbon chain of an acyclic Basic Unit is typically attached to A<sub>R </sub>of L<sub>SS </sub>at the alpha carbon of that moiety relative to the site of attachment of A<sub>R </sub>to the succinimide nitrogen of M<sup>2 </sup>(and hence to the maleimide nitrogen of its corresponding M<sup>1</sup>-A<sub>R </sub>structure). Typically, that alpha carbon in an acyclic Basic Unit has the (S) stereochemical configuration or the configuration corresponding to that of the alpha carbon of <smallcaps>L</smallcaps>-amino acids.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0169">As previously described, BU in acyclic form or BU in cyclized form is typically connected to M<sup>1 </sup>or M<sup>2 </sup>of L<sub>SS </sub>or M<sup>3 </sup>of L<sub>S </sub>through an optionally substituted C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>12 </sub>alkylene moiety in which that moiety incorporates the cyclized Basic Unit or is substituted by the acyclic Basic Unit and is bonded to the maleimide or succinimide nitrogen of M<sup>1 </sup>or M<sup>2</sup>, respectively, or the amide nitrogen of M<sup>3</sup>. In some aspects, the C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>12 </sub>alkylene moiety incorporating the cyclic Basic Unit is covalently bonded to L<sub>O </sub>and typically occurs through intermediacy of an ether, ester, carbonate, urea, disulfide, amide carbamate or other functional group, more typically through an ether, amide or carbamate functional group. Likewise, BU in acyclic form is typically connected to M<sup>1 </sup>or M<sup>2 </sup>of L<sub>SS </sub>or M<sup>3 </sup>of L<sub>S </sub>through an optionally substituted C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>12 </sub>alkylene moiety of -A<sub>R</sub>-A<sub>O</sub>- which is substituted by the acyclic Basic unit at the same carbon of the C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>12 </sub>alkylene moiety that is attached to the imino nitrogen atom of the maleimide or succinimide ring system of M<sup>1 </sup>or M<sup>2 </sup>or the amide nitrogen of M<sup>3 </sup>subsequent to hydrolysis of the succinimide ring system of M<sup>2</sup>.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0170">In some aspects, a cyclic Basic Unit incorporates the structure of an acyclic BU by formally cyclizing an acyclic Basic Unit to R<sup>a2</sup>, which is a branched alkyl moiety of the C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>12 </sub>alkylene moiety of -A<sub>R</sub>-A<sub>O</sub>- and bonded to the carbon atom alpha to the imide nitrogen atom of M<sup>1</sup>/M<sup>2 </sup>or the amide nitrogen atom of M<sup>3 </sup>as the acyclic Basic Unit, thus forming a spirocyclic ring system so that a cyclic Basic Unit is incorporated into the structure of A<sub>R </sub>rather than being a substituent of A<sub>R </sub>as when BU is acyclic. In those aspects, the formal cyclization is to the basic amine nitrogen of an acyclic Basic Unit thus providing a cyclic Basic Unit as an optionally substituted symmetrical or asymmetrical spiro C<sub>4</sub>-C<sub>12 </sub>heterocyclo, depending on the relative carbon chain lengths in the two alpha carbon substituents, in which the basic nitrogen is now a basic skeletal heteroatom. In order for that cyclization to substantially retain the basic properties of the acyclic Basic Unit in a cyclic Basic Unit, the basic nitrogen atom of the acyclic Basic Unit nitrogen should be that of a primary or secondary amine and not a tertiary amine since that would result in a quaternied skeletal nitrogen in the heterocyclo of the cyclic Basic Unit. In that aspect of formal cyclization of an acyclic Basic Unit to a cyclic Basic Unit, in order to substantially retain the ability of the basic nitrogen to assist in hydrolysis of M<sup>2 </sup>to M<sup>3 </sup>in conversion of L<sub>SS </sub>to L<sub>S</sub>, the resulting structure of the cyclic Basic Unit in these primary linkers will typically have its basic nitrogen located so that no more than three, and typically one or two, intervening carbon atoms are between the basic nitrogen atom and the alpha spiro carbon of the A<sub>R </sub>component. Cyclic Basic Units incorporated into A<sub>R </sub>and the L<sub>SS </sub>and L<sub>S </sub>moieties having those as components are further described by the embodiments of the invention.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0171">&#x201c;Hydrolysis-enhancing moiety&#x201d; as used herein, unless otherwise stated or implied by context, refers to is electron withdrawing group or moiety that is an optional substituent of an L<sub>SS </sub>moiety and its hydrolysis product L<sub>S</sub>. A hydrolysis-enhancing [HE] moiety is an optional second Stretcher Unit (A<sub>O</sub>) or subunit thereof [HE] when present as a substituent of A<sub>R</sub>-A<sub>O</sub>- and thus is another component of L<sub>SS</sub>, wherein A<sub>R </sub>is bonded to the imide nitrogen of an M<sup>2 </sup>moiety, so that the electron withdrawing effect of [HE] can increase the electrophilicity of the succinimide carbonyl groups in that moiety for its conversion to a M<sup>3 </sup>moiety of L<sub>S</sub>. With A<sub>R </sub>incorporating or substituted by a cyclic Basic Unit or an acyclic Basic Unit, respectively, the potential effect of [HE] on the carbonyl groups of M<sup>2 </sup>for increasing the hydrolysis rate to M<sup>3 </sup>by induction and the aforementioned effect(s) of either type of BU, are adjusted so that premature hydrolysis of M<sup>1 </sup>does not occur to an appreciable extent during preparation of a Ligand Drug Conjugate from a Drug Linker compound comprised of the structure of M&#x2032;-A<sub>R</sub>(BU[HE]-. Instead, the combined effects of BU and [HE] to promote hydrolysis (i.e., conversion of an -M<sup>2</sup>-A<sub>R</sub>(BU)-[HE]- moiety of a Ligand Drug Conjugate compound to its corresponding -M<sup>3</sup>-A<sub>R</sub>(BU)-[HE]- moiety) under controlled conditions (as when pH is purposely increased so as to decrease protonation of the Basic Unit) are such that an undue molar excess of Drug Linker compound to compensate for hydrolysis of its M<sup>1 </sup>moiety is not required. Therefore, Michael addition of the sulfur atom of a reactive thiol functional group of the targeting agent to the maleimide ring system of M<sup>1</sup>, which provides a targeting Ligand Unit attached to a succinimide ring system of M<sup>2</sup>, typically occurs at a rate that effectively competes with M<sup>1 </sup>hydrolysis. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that at low pH, as for example when the basic amine of BU is in the form of a TFA salt, premature hydrolysis of M<sup>1 </sup>in a Drug Linker product is much slower than when the pH is raised to that suitable for base catalysis using an appropriate buffering agent and that an acceptable molar excess of Drug Linker compound can adequately compensate for any loss due to premature M<sup>1 </sup>hydrolysis that does occur during the time course for completion or near completion of the Michael addition of a sulfur atom of a targeting agent's reactive thiol functional group to a Drug Linker compound's M<sup>1 </sup>moiety.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0172">As previously discussed, enhancement of carbonyl hydrolysis by either type of Basic Unit is dependent on the basicity of its functional group and the distance of that basic functional group in relation to the M<sup>1</sup>/M<sup>2 </sup>carbonyl groups. Typically, [HE] is a carbonyl moiety (i.e., ketone or &#x2014;C(&#x2550;O)&#x2014;) or other carbonyl-containing functional group. When A<sub>O </sub>is comprised of HE, HE is sometimes located distal to the carbon atom of -A<sub>R</sub>-A<sub>O</sub>- that is bonded to M<sup>2</sup>, or M<sup>3 </sup>derived therefrom, and that also provides for covalent attachment of L<sub>SS </sub>or L<sub>S </sub>to the secondary linker (L<sub>O</sub>). Carbonyl-containing functional groups other than ketone include esters, carbamates, carbonates and ureas. When [HE] is a carbonyl-containing functional group other than ketone the carbonyl moiety of that functional group, which is shared with Lo, is typically bonded to the remainder of -A<sub>R</sub>-A<sub>O</sub>-. In some aspects, the HE moiety may be sufficiently distant from the imide nitrogen to which A<sub>R </sub>of -A<sub>R</sub>-A<sub>O</sub>- is covalently bonded so that no discernable or minor effect on hydrolytic sensitivity of the succinimide carbonyl-nitrogen bonds of an M<sup>2</sup>-containing moiety is observable, but instead is driven primarily by BU.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0173">&#x201c;Stretcher Unit&#x201d; as used herein, unless otherwise stated or implied by context, refers to an organic moiety in a primary or secondary linker of a Linker Unit that physically separates the targeting Ligand Unit from other intervening components of the Linker Unit that are more proximal to the Drug Unit. An A<sub>R </sub>Stretcher Unit is a required component in primary linker (L<sub>R</sub>) when that linker is a L<sub>SS </sub>or L<sub>S </sub>primary linker since it provides the Basic Unit. The presence of a first optional Stretcher Unit (A) and/or second optional Stretcher Unit (A<sub>O</sub>) may be required when there is insufficient steric relief from the Ligand Unit provided by an L<sub>R</sub>, L<sub>SS </sub>or L<sub>S </sub>primary linker absent one or both of those optional Stretcher Units to allow for efficient processing of a Linker Unit in a quaternized drug linker moiety of a Ligand Drug Conjugate for release of its quaternized Drug Unit as a tubulysin compound. Alternatively, or in addition to steric relief, those optional components may be included for synthetic ease in preparing a Drug Linker compound. A first or second optional Stretcher Unit (A or A<sub>O</sub>) can each be a single unit or can contain multiple subunits.

A Branching Unit (B) is present when more than one quaternized tubulysin Drug Units, typically 2, 3 or 4, are attached to a Linker Unit (LU) of a quaternized drug linker moiety in a Ligand Drug Conjugate compound or Drug Linker compound. In a Ligand Drug Conjugate having the afore-described generalized formula, the presence of a Branching Unit is indicated when subscript b of B<sub>b </sub>is 1, which occurs when subscript n greater than 1 in that formula. A Branching Unit is at least trifunctional in order to be incorporated into a secondary linker unit (L<sub>O</sub>). In aspects where n is 1, a Branching Unit is not present, as indicated when subscript b is 0. Drug Linker or Ligand Drug Conjugate compounds with a Branching Unit due to multiple D<sup>+</sup> units per LU have Linker Units containing the formula -B-A<sub>a</sub>-W&#x2014;Y&#x2014;, wherein subscripts a is 0 or 1 and W is a Peptide Cleavable Unit, or have Linker Units containing formula -B-A<sub>a</sub>-Y(W&#x2032;)&#x2014;, when W is a Glucuronide Unit of formula &#x2014;Y(W&#x2032;)&#x2014;, wherein subscript a is 0 or 1.

That greater reactivity in some aspects is due to a greater amount of enzymatic or non-enzymatic activity at the site of or within the abnormal cells and occurs to a sufficient extent so as to provide immunologically selective cytotoxicity by preferential exposure of the abnormal cells to a cytotoxic or cytostatic tubulysin compound, upon release of a quaternied tubulysin Drug Unit (D<sup>+</sup>) from a Ligand Drug Conjugate compound having that Linker Unit. The exposure from release of D<sup>+</sup> as a tubulysin compound is initiated by enzymatic or non-enzymatic action on the Linker Unit having that Cleavable Unit. In some aspects of the invention, a Cleavable Unit contains a reactive site cleavable by an enzyme whose activity or abundance is greater within or surrounding the hyper-proliferating, immune-stimulating or other abnormal cells compared to normal cells or within the vicinity of normal cells that are distant from the site of the abnormal cells so as to provide immunologically selective cytotoxicity. In some of those aspects of the invention, the Cleavable Unit is a substrate for a protease so that W is a Peptide Cleavable Unit, which in some aspects is a substrate for a regulatory protease. In other aspects, the Cleavable Unit is a Glucuronide Unit of formula &#x2014;Y(W&#x2032;)&#x2014; replacing W in the generalized formula of a Ligand Drug Conjugate or Drug Linker compound, wherein the Glucuronide Unit is a substrate for a glycosidase. In either of those aspects, the protease or glycosidase is sometimes located intracellularly in targeted cells (i.e., the reactive site of the Cleavable Unit is a peptide bond or glycoside bond, respectively, cleavable by the protease or glycosidase), or the peptide or glycoside bond of the Cleavable Unit is capable of selective cleavage by an intracellular regulatory protease, hydrolase or glycosidase in comparison to serum proteases, hydrolases, or glycosidases. In some of those aspects, the reactive site is more likely operated upon enzymatically subsequent to cellular internalization of a Ligand Drug Conjugate compound into a targeted abnormal cell.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0181">Functional groups that provide for cleavable bonds include, by way of example and not limitation, carboxylic or amino groups that form an amide bond, as in peptide bonds that are susceptible to enzymatic cleavage by proteases produced or excreted preferentially by abnormal cells in comparison to normal cells or by a regulatory protease within a targeted cell. Other functional groups that provide for cleavable bonds are found in sugars or carbohydrates having a glycosidic linkage that are substrates for glycosides, which sometimes may be produced preferentially by abnormal cells in comparison to normal cells. Alternatively, the protease or glycosidase enzyme required for processing of the Linker Unit to release a quaternized tubulysin Drug Unit as a tubulysin compound need not be produced preferentially by abnormal cells in comparison to normal cells provided the processing enzyme is not excreted by normal cells to an extent that would cause undesired side effects from premature release of D<sup>+</sup> as the tubulysin compound. In other instances, the required protease or glycosidase enzyme may be excreted, but to avoid undesired premature release of drug, some aspects of the invention typically require the processing enzyme be excreted in the vicinity of abnormal cells and remain localized to that enviroment, whether produced by abnormal cells or nearby normal cells in response to the abnormal enviroment caused by the abnormal cells. In that respect, W as a Peptide Cleavable Unit or W&#x2032; of a Glucuronide Unit is selected to be preferentially acted upon by a protease or glycosidase, respectively, in or within the enviroment of abnormal cells in contrast to freely circulating enzymes. In those instances, a Ligand Drug Conjugate compound is less likely to release D<sup>+</sup> as a tubulysin compound in the vicinity of unintended normal cells, nor would it be internalized to any appreciable extent into normal cells that do intracellularly produce but do not excrete the enzyme intended to be acted upon by the internalized Ligand Drug Conjugate compound to any appreciable extent since such cells are less likely to display a targeted moiety required for entry by that compound or have sufficient copy number of that targeted moiety.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0182">In some aspects, W in the generalized formula of a Ligand Drug Conjugate or Drug Linker compound is a Peptide Cleavable Unit comprised of an amino acid residue or is comprised or consists of one or more sequences of amino acids that provide a substrate for a protease present within abnormal cells or a protease localized to the environment of these abnormal cells. Thus, W may be comprised or consist of a dipeptide, tripeptide, tetrapeptide, pentapeptide, hexapeptide, heptapeptide, octapeptide, nonapeptide, decapeptide, undecapeptide or dodecapeptide moiety incorporated into a Linker Unit through an amide bond to a PAB or PAB-type moiety of a self-immolative Spacer Unit (Y) wherein the peptide provides a recognition sequence for that protease.

Proteases are classified into major six classes: serine proteases, threonine proteases, cysteine proteases, glutamic acid proteases, aspartic acid proteases and metalloproteases so named for the catalytic residue in the active site that is primarily responsible for cleaving the carbonyl-nitrogen bond of its substrate. Proteases are characterized by various specificities, which are dependent of identities of the residues at the N-terminal and/or C-terminal side of the carbonyl-nitrogen bond and various distributions.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0189">When W is a Peptide Cleavable Unit comprised of amide or other carbonyl-nitrogen containing functional group cleavable by a protease, the site of that cleavage is typically limited to those recognized by proteases that are found in hyper-proliferating cells or hyper-stimulated immune cells or within nominally normal cells particular to the environment in which hyper-proliferating cells or hyper-stimulated immune cells are present. In those instances, the protease is not necessarily required to be preferentially present or found in greater abundance in the cells targeted by a Ligand Drug Conjugate since the Conjugate will have poorer access to those cells that do not preferentially have the targeting moiety. Other times, the protease is preferentially excreted by abnormal cells or by nominally normal cells in the environment in which those abnormal cells are found in comparison to normal cells in the periphery, which are in their typical environment in which abnormal cells are not present. Thus, in those instances where the protease is excreted, the protease is necessarily required to be preferentially present or found in greater abundance in the vicinity of cells targeted by the Conjugate in comparison to that of distant normal cells.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0190">When incorporated into an Ligand Drug Conjugate, a peptide that comprises W as a Peptide Cleavable Unit will present a recognition sequence to a protease that cleaves a carbonyl-nitrogen bond in W resulting in fragmentation of the Linker Unit to cause release of an tertiary amine-containing drug from D<sup>+</sup>. Sometimes, the recognition sequence is selectively recognized by an intracellular protease present in abnormal cells to which the Conjugate has preferred access in comparison to normal cells due to targeting of the abnormal cells, or is preferentially produced by abnormal cells in comparison to normal cells, for the purpose of selectively delivering the drug to the desired site of action. Usually the peptide is resistant to circulating proteases in order to minimize premature expulsion of D<sup>+</sup> in the form of a tubulysin compound and thus minimize unwanted systemic exposure to that compound. Typically, the peptide will have one or more unnatural or non-classical amino acids in its sequence in order to have that resistance. Oftentimes, the amide bond that is specifically cleaved by a protease produced by an abnormal cell is an anilide wherein the nitrogen of that anilide is a nascent electron-donating heteroatom (i.e., J) of a self-immolative moiety of a self-immolative Spacer Unit whose structure are described elsewhere. Thus, protease action on such a peptide sequence in W results in release of D<sup>+</sup> as a tubulysin compound from the linker fragment by 1,4- or 1,6-elimination involving the (hetero)arylene component of the self-immolative moiety.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0191">Regulatory proteases are typically located intracellularly and are required for the regulation of cellular activities that sometimes becomes aberrant or dysregulated in abnormal cells. In some instances, when W is directed to a protease having preferential distribution intracellularly, that protease is a regulatory protease, which is involved in cellular maintenance or proliferation. In some instances, those proteases include lysosomal proteases or cathepsins. Cathepsins include the serine proteases, Cathepsin A, Cathepsin G, aspartic acid proteases Cathepsin D, Cathepsin E and the cysteine proteases, Cathepsin B, Cathepsin C, Cathepsin F, Cathepsin H, Cathepsin K, Cathepsin L1, Cathepsin L2, Cathepsin O, Cathepsin S, Cathepsin W and Cathepsin Z.

Lymphoma subtypes include precursor T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (sometimes referred to as a lymphoblastic leukemia since the T-cell lymphoblasts are produced in the bone marrow), follicular lymphoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, B-cell chronic lymphocytic lymphoma (sometimes referred to as a leukemia due to peripheral blood involvement), MALT lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, mycosis fungoides and its more aggressive variant S&#xe9;zary's disease, peripheral T-cell lymphomas not otherwise specified, nodular sclerosis of Hodgkin lymphoma, and mixed-cellularity subtype of Hodgkin lymphoma.</p><p id="p-0248" num="0224">&#x201c;Leukemia&#x201d; as used herein, unless otherwise stated or implied by context, refers to a hematological malignancy that usually develops from hyper-proliferating cells of myeloid origin, and include without limitation, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and acute monocyctic leukemia (AMoL). Other leukemias include hairy cell leukemia (HCL), T-cell lymphatic leukemia (T-PLL), large granular lymphocytic leukemia and adult T-cell leukemia.</p><p id="p-0249" num="0225">&#x201c;Hyper-proliferating cells&#x201d; as used herein, unless otherwise stated or implied by context, refer to abnormal cells that are characterized by unwanted cellular proliferation or an abnormally high rate or persistent state of cell division or other cellular activity that is unrelated or uncoordinated with that of the surrounding normal tissues. In some aspects, hyper-proliferating cells are hyper-proliferating mammalian cells. In other aspects, hyper-proliferating cells are hyper-stimulated immune cells as defined herein whose persistent state of cell division or activation occurs after the cessation of the stimulus that may have initially evoked the change in their cell division. In other aspects, the hyper-proliferating cells are transformed normal cells or cancer cells and their uncontrolled and progressive state of cell proliferation may result in a tumor that is benign, potentially malignant (premalignant) or frankly malignant. Hyperproliferation conditions resulting from transformed normal cells or cancer cells include, but are not limited to, those characterized as a precancer, hyperplasia, dysplasia, adenoma, sarcoma, blastoma, carcinoma, lymphoma, leukemia or papilloma. Precancers are usually defined as lesions that exhibit histological changes and are associated with an increased risk of cancer development and sometimes have some, but not all, of the molecular and phenotypic properties that characterize the cancer. Hormone associated or hormone sensitive precancers include without limitation, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), particularly high-grade PIN (HGPIN), atypical small acinar proliferation (ASAP), cervical dysplasia and ductal carcinoma in situ. Hyperplasias generally refers to the proliferation of cells within an organ or tissue beyond that which is ordinarily seen that may result in the gross enlargement of an organ or in the formation of a benign tumor or growth. Hyperplasias include, but are not limited to, endometrial hyperplasia (endometriosis), benign prostatic hyperplasia and ductal hyperplasia.</p><p id="p-0250" num="0226">&#x201c;Normal cells&#x201d; as used herein, unless otherwise stated or implied by context, refer to cells undergoing coordinated cell division related to maintenance of cellular integrity of normal tissue or replenishment of circulating lymphatic or blood cells that is required by regulated cellular turnover, or tissue repair necessitated by injury, or to a regulated immune or inflammatory response resulting from pathogen exposure or other cellular insult, where the provoked cell division or immune response terminates on completion of the necessary maintenance, replenishment or pathogen clearance. Normal cells include normally proliferating cells, normal quiescent cells and normally activated immune cells. Normal cells include normal quiescent cells, which are noncancerous cells in their resting G<sub>o </sub>state and have not been stimulated by stress or a mitogen or are immune cells that are normally inactive or have not been activated by pro-inflammatory cytokine exposure.</p><p id="p-0251" num="0227">&#x201c;Abnormal cells&#x201d; as used herein, unless otherwise stated or implied by context, refer to unwanted cells that are responsible for promoting or perpetuating a disease state to which a Ligand Drug Conjugate is intended to prevent or treat. Abnormal cells include hyper-proliferating cells and hyper-stimulated immune cells as these term are define elsewhere. Abnormal cells may also refer to nominally normal cells that are in the environment of other abnormal cells, but which nonetheless support the proliferation and/or survival of these other abnormal cells, such as tumor cells, so that targeting the nominally normal cells indirectly inhibits the proliferation and/or survival of the tumor cells.</p><p id="p-0252" num="0228">&#x201c;Hyper-stimulated immune cells&#x201d; as used herein, unless otherwise stated or implied by context, refer to cells involved in innate or adaptive immunity characterized by an abnormally persistent proliferation or inappropriate state of stimulation that occurs after the cessation of the stimulus that may have initially evoked the change in proliferation or stimulation or that occurs in the absence of any external insult. Oftentimes, the persistent proliferation or inappropriate state of stimulation results in a chronic state of inflammation characteristic of a disease state or condition. In some instances, the stimulus that may have initially evoked the change in proliferation or stimulation is not attributable to an external insult but is internally derived, as in an autoimmune disease. In some aspects, a hyper-stimulated immune cell is a pro-inflammatory immune cell that has been hyper-activated through chronic pro-inflammatory cytokine exposure.</p><p id="p-0253" num="0229">In some aspects of the invention, a Ligand Drug Conjugate compound of a Ligand Drug Conjugate composition binds to an antigen preferentially displayed by pro-inflammatory immune cells that are abnormally proliferating or are inappropriately or persistently activated. Those immune cells include classically activated macrophages or Type 1 T helper (Th1) cells, which produce interferon-gamma (INF-&#x3b3;), interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-10 (IL-10), and tumor necrosis factor-beta (TNF-&#x3b2;), which are cytokines that are involved in macrophage and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation.</p><p id="p-0254" num="0230">&#x201c;Bioavailability&#x201d; unless otherwise stated or implied by context, refers to the systemic availability (i.e., blood/plasma levels) of a given amount of a drug administered to a patient. Bioavailability is an absolute term that indicates measurement of both the time (rate) and total amount (extent) of drug that reaches the general circulation from an administered dosage form.</p><p id="p-0255" num="0231">&#x201c;Subject&#x201d; unless otherwise stated or implied by context, refers to a human, non-human primate or mammal having a hyper-proliferation, inflammatory or immune disorder or other disorder attributable to abnormal cells or is prone to such a disorder who would benefit from administering an effective amount of a Ligand Drug Conjugate. Non-limiting examples of a subject include human, rat, mouse, guinea pig, monkey, pig, goat, cow, horse, dog, cat, bird and fowl. Typically, the subject is a human, non-human primate, rat, mouse or dog.</p><p id="p-0256" num="0232">&#x201c;Carrier&#x201d; unless otherwise stated or implied by context refers to a diluent, adjuvant or excipient, with which a compound is administered. Such pharmaceutical carriers can be liquids, such as water and oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil. The carriers can be saline, gum acacia, gelatin, starch paste, talc, keratin, colloidal silica, urea.</p><p id="p-0257" num="0233">In addition, auxiliary, stabilizing, thickening, lubricating and coloring agents can be used. In one embodiment, when administered to a subject, the compound or compositions and pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are sterile. Water is an exemplary carrier when the compounds are administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid carriers, particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers also include excipients such as starch, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, talc, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene, glycol, water, and ethanol. The present compositions, if desired, can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents, or pH buffering agents.</p><p id="p-0258" num="0234">&#x201c;Salt form&#x201d; as used herein, unless otherwise indicated by context, refers to a charged compound in ionic association with a countercation(s) and/or counteranions so as to form an overall neutral species. In some aspects, a salt form of a compound occurs through interaction of the parent compound's basic or acid functional group with an external acid or base, respectively. In other aspects the charged atom of the compound that is associated with a counteranion is permanent in the sense that spontaneous disassociation to a neural species cannot occur without altering the structural integrity of the parent compound as when a nitrogen atom is quaternied. Accordingly, a salt form of a compound may involve a quaternied nitrogen atom within that compound and/or a protonated form of a basic functional group and/or ionized carboxylic acid of that compound each of which is in ionic association with a counteranion. In some aspects a salt form may result from interaction of a basic functional group and an ionized acid functional group within the same compound or involve inclusion of a negatively charged molecule such as an acetate ion, a succinate ion or other counteranion. Thus, a compound in salt form may have more than one charged atom in its structure. In instances where multiple charged atoms of the parent compound are part of the salt form, that salt from can have multiple counter ions so that a salt form of a compound may have one or more charged atoms and/or one or more counterions. The counterion may be any charged organic or inorganic moiety that stabilizes an opposite charge on the parent compound.</p><p id="p-0259" num="0235">A protonated salt form of a compound is typically obtained when a basic functional group of a compound, such as a primary, secondary or tertiary amine or other basic amine functional group interacts with an organic or inorganic acid of suitable pKa for protonation of the basic functional group, or when an acid functional group of a compound with a suitable pK<sub>a</sub>, such as a carboxylic acid, interacts with a hydroxide salt, such as NaOH or KOH, or an organic base of suitable strength, such as triethylamine, for deprotonation of the acid functional group. In some aspects, a compound in salt form contains at least one basic amine functional group, and accordingly acid addition salts can be formed with this amine group, which includes the basic amine functional group of a cyclic or acyclic Basic Unit. A suitable salt form in the context of a Drug Linker compound is one that does not unduly interfere with the condensation reaction between a targeting agent and the Drug Linker compound that is intended to provide a Ligand drug Conjugate.</p><p id="p-0260" num="0236">&#x201c;Pharmaceutically acceptable salt&#x201d; as used herein, unless otherwise indicated by context, refers to a salt form of a compound in which its counterion is acceptable for administration of the salt form to an intended subject and include inorganic and organic countercations and counteranions. Exemplary pharmaceutically acceptable counteranions for basic amine functional groups, such as those in cyclic or acyclic Basic Units, include, but are not limited to, sulfate, citrate, acetate, oxalate, chloride, bromide, iodide, nitrate, bisulfate, phosphate, acid phosphate, isonicotinate, lactate, salicylate, acid citrate, tartrate, oleate, tannate, pantothenate, bitartrate, ascorbate, succinate, maleate, mesylate, besylate, gentisinate, fumarate, gluconate, glucuronate, saccharate, formate, benzoate, glutamate, methanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate, and pamoate (i.e., 1,1&#x2032;-methylene-bis-(2-hydroxy-3-naphthoate)) salts.</p><p id="p-0261" num="0237">Typically, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt is selected from those described in P. H. Stahl and C. G. Wermuth, editors, <i>Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection and Use, </i>Weinheim/Z&#xfc;rich:Wiley-VCH/VHCA, 2002. Salt selection is dependent on properties the drug product must exhibit, including adequate aqueous solubility at various pH values, depending upon the intended route(s) of administration, crystallinity with flow characteristics and low hygroscopicity (i.e., water absorption versus relative humidity) suitable for handling and required shelf life by determining chemical and solid-state stability as when in a lyophilized formulation under accelerated conditions (i.e., for determining degradation or solid-state changes when stored at 40&#xb0; C. and 75% relative humidity).</p><p id="p-0262" num="0238">&#x201c;Inhibit&#x201d;, &#x201c;inhibition of&#x201d; and like terms, unless otherwise stated or implied by context, means to reduce by a measurable amount, or to prevent entirely an undesired activity or outcome. In some aspects, the undesired outcome or activity is related to abnormal cells and includes hyper-proliferation, or hyper-stimulation or other dysregulated cellular activity underlying a disease state. Inhibition of such a dysregulated cellular activity by a Ligand Drug Conjugate is typically determined relative to untreated cells (sham treated with vehicle) in a suitable test system as in cell culture (in vitro) or in a xenograft model (in vivo). Typically, a Ligand Drug Conjugate that targets an antigen that is not present or has low copy number on the abnormal cells of interest or is genetically engineered to not recognize any known antigen for use as a negative control.</p><p id="p-0263" num="0239">&#x201c;Treat&#x201d;, &#x201c;treatment,&#x201d; and like terms, unless otherwise indicated by context, refer to a therapeutic treatment, including prophylactic measures to prevent relapse, wherein the object is to inhibit or slow down (lessen) an undesired physiological change or disorder, such as the development or spread of cancer or tissue damage from chronic inflammation. Typically, beneficial or desired clinical benefits of such therapeutic treatments include, but are not limited to, alleviation of symptoms, diminishment of extent of disease, stabilized (i.e., not worsening) state of disease, delay or slowing of disease progression, amelioration or palliation of the disease state, and remission (whether partial or total), whether detectable or undetectable. &#x201c;Treatment&#x201d; can also mean prolonging survival or quality of life as compared to expected survival or quality of life if not receiving treatment. Those in need of treatment include those already having the condition or disorder as well as those prone to have the condition or disorder.</p><p id="p-0264" num="0240">In the context of cancer, the term &#x201c;treating&#x201d; includes any or all of inhibiting growth of tumor cells, cancer cells, or of a tumor, inhibiting replication of tumor cells or cancer cells, inhibiting dissemination of tumor cells or cancer cell, lessening of overall tumor burden or decreasing the number of cancerous cells, or ameliorating one or more symptoms associated with cancer.</p><p id="p-0265" num="0241">The term &#x201c;therapeutically effective amount&#x201d; unless otherwise stated or implied by context, refers to an amount of tubulysin compound or Ligand Drug Conjugate having a quaternized tubulysin Drug Unit effective to treat a disease or disorder in a mammal. In the case of cancer, the therapeutically effective amount of the Tubulysin compound or Ligand Drug Conjugate may reduce the number of cancer cells, reduce tumor size, inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and preferably stop) cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs, inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and preferably stop) tumor metastasis, inhibit, to some extent, tumor growth, and/or relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the cancer. To the extent the tubulysin compound or Ligand Drug Conjugate may inhibit growth and/or kill existing cancer cells, it may be cytostatic or cytotoxic. For cancer therapy, efficacy can, for example, be measured by assessing the time to disease progression (TTP) determining the response rate (RR) and/or overall survival (OS).</p><p id="p-0266" num="0242">In the case of immune disorders resulting from hyper-stimulated immune cells, a therapeutically effective amount of the drug may reduce the number of hyper-stimulated immune cells, the extent of their stimulation and/or infiltration into otherwise normal tissue and/or relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with a dysregulated immune system due to hyper-stimulated immune cells. For immune disorders due to hyper-stimulated immune cells, efficacy can, for example, be measured by assessing one or more inflammatory surrogates, including one or more cytokines levels such as those for IL-1&#x3b2;, TNF&#x3b1;, INF&#x3b3; and MCP-1, or numbers of classically activated macrophages.</p><p id="p-0267" num="0243">In some aspects of the invention, a Ligand Drug Conjugate compound associates with an antigen on the surface of a targeted cell (i.e., an abnormal cell such as a hyper-proliferating cell or a hyper-stimulated immune cell), and the Conjugate compound is then taken up inside the targeted cell through receptor-mediated endocytosis. Once inside the cell, one or more Cleavage Units within a Linker Unit of the Conjugate are cleaved, resulting in release of the quaternized tubulysin Drug Unit (D<sup>+</sup>) as a tubulysin compound. The compound so released is then free to migrate within the cytosol and induce cytotoxic or cytostatic activities, or in the case of hyper-stimulated immune cells may alternatively inhibit pro-inflammatory signal transduction. In another aspect of the invention, the quaternied tubulysin Drug Unit (D<sup>+</sup>) is released from a Ligand Drug</p><p id="p-0268" num="0244">Conjugate compound outside the targeted cell but within the vicinity of the targeted cell so that the resulting tubulysin compound from that release is able to subsequently penetrate the cell rather than being prematurely released at distal sites.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2.

Scale-up to gram scale proved more troublesome with the sealed tube reaction requiring 12 days at 85&#xb0; C. (77% yield). Attempts to hasten the reaction time so as to be more consistent with manufacturing requirements by increasing the temperature (125&#xb0; C., 60 hr) proved futile due to significantly reduced yield (41%).

Without being bound by theory, it is believe that such an extensive loss late in the reaction sequence in introducing a BOC protecting group, which should be a straightforward protection step, is due to a retro aza-Michael reaction. That aza-Michael reaction in the forward direction, as shown in step 2 of Scheme 2, allowed for direct introduction of the BOC-protected methylamino moiety early in the reaction sequence.

The combined organic extracts were washed with brine then dried over anhydrous Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, filtered, and concentrated to give the crude title compound (1.3 g, 96% isolated yield).</p><p id="p-1666" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00474" num="00474"><img id="EMI-C00474" he="51.31mm" wi="75.86mm" file="US20230002440A1-20230105-C00474.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">Example 5: 2-((1R,3R)-1-Acetoxy-3-((tert-butoxycarbonyl)(methyl)amino)-4-methylpentyl)thiazole-4-carboxylic acid</heading><p id="p-1667" num="1181">To a solution of 2-((1R,3R)-3-((tert-butoxycarbonyl)(methyl)amino)-1-hydroxy-4-methylpentyl)thiazole-4-carboxylic acid (3.51 mmol) in DCM (25 mL) was added pyridine (1.5 mL, 18.42 mmol) at 0&#xb0; C. over 5 minutes. To the solution was added Ac<sub>2</sub>O (1.5 mL, 16.84 mmol) over 10 minutes. The ice bath was removed, and the reaction solution was allowed to warm up to room temperature for 16 h. Water (10 mL) was added dropwise to the reaction mixture at 0&#xb0; C. The ice bath was then removed, and the reaction mixture was stirred vigorously at RT for 1 hour. The solution was diluted with DCM (10 mL). The organic layer was collected. The aqueous phase was extracted with DCM for three times. The organic phase was extracted with 10% citric acid solution followed by water. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, filtered, and concentrated to give crude material. The crude material was purified by flash chromatography, affording 1.215 g of the title compound (BOC-Tuv-OH) as a white foam (86% yield). <sup>1</sup>H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl<sub>3</sub>) is consistent with that reported for BOC-Tuv-OH (Columbo, R. et al. <i>J.
