These processes are performed repeatedly to form desired semiconductor device elements on a substrate. Conventional micro microfabrication techniques only manufacture transistors in one plane, while wiring or metallization is formed above the active device plane. Such devices are accordingly characterized as two-dimensional (2D) circuits, manufactured using 2D fabrication techniques. Although scaling efforts have greatly increased the number of transistors per unit area in 2D circuits, these 2D fabrication techniques are approaching physical atomic limitations with single digit nanometer semiconductor device fabrication nodes. Semiconductor device fabricators have expressed a desire for different manufacturing techniques and configurations of devices to increase density of semiconductor circuitry.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Three-dimensional (3D) integration, e.g., a stacking (or vertical arrangement) of multiple semiconductor devices (e.g., transistor structures), aims to overcome scaling limitations experienced in planar devices by increasing transistor density in volume rather than area. Although device stacking has been successfully demonstrated and implemented by the flash memory industry with the adoption of 3D NAND, applying similar techniques to random logic designs is substantially more difficult. 3D integration for logic chips, including central processing units (CPU), graphics processing units (GPU), and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) are being pursued.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">At least one aspect of the present disclosure is directed to a method.

It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the claims or this disclosure is thereby intended. Alterations and further modifications of the inventive features illustrated herein, and additional applications of the principles of the subject matter illustrated herein, which would occur to one skilled in the relevant art and having possession of this disclosure, are to be considered within the scope of the subject matter disclosed herein. Other embodiments may be used and/or other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present disclosure. The illustrative embodiments described in the detailed description are not meant to be limiting of the subject matter presented.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">This application relates to vertically oriented transistor devices and their methods of manufacture. More specifically, described herein are structures in which the current between the drain and source is primarily in the direction normal to the surface of the die, e.g., vertical field-effect transistor (VFET) and Complementary Field Effect Transistor (CFET) structures.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Logic devices are conventionally formed in horizontal planar configurations. However, limitations on the amount of area and required density of devices in a given footprint increasingly necessitate the use of novel structures. The present application provides devices oriented in a vertical, or 3D, direction. Devices are oriented such that current flows in the vertical or z-direction allowing arrays of transistors to be stacked relative to the primary planar surface of the array or underlying substrate.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to the techniques described, 3D VFET devices may be created on any suitable substrate including conductive, semiconductive, or dielectric substrates. The underlying substrate may be a passive structure such as a handle wafer or passive interposer, or may have active devices, such as memory devices, circuitry, etc. Advantageously, VFETs may be provided above other active devices allowing for close proximity between devices. The VFETs may also be stacked as all one conductivity type, e.g., N-type or P-type or the conductivity type may be combined, such one or more N-type devices over or under one or more P-type devices in the stack. Such configurations may include, but are not limited to so-called CFETs, i.e., complementary Field Effect Transistors. CFET structures which here include a gate-all-around (GAA) structure.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to certain implementations, one or more transistor structures are formed by stacking layers to form a source (or drain), gate, and drain (or source) separated by one or more dielectric layers to isolate each portion of the transistor. The channel is oriented in a z-direction, e.g., perpendicular to the direction that the layers are stacked. A high-k dielectric material is provided between the gate and the channel as will be described more fully below.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The techniques provided herein can utilize conductive dielectric materials (sometimes referred to herein as &#x201c;conductive channels&#x201d;), which may have similar properties to semiconductor materials, to fabricate vertical 3D transistors. For example, certain materials, when combined with oxygen, may form new materials that exhibit semiconductor properties (e.g., it can turn &#x201c;off&#x201d; with low off-state leakage current, or can become highly conductive under certain circumstances, etc.). Some examples of N-type conductive channels include In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, SnO<sub>2</sub>, InGaZnO, and ZnO. One example of a P-type conductive channel is SnO. Additionally or alternatively, the channel may comprise a 2D material. Some example 2D materials for use in forming the channel include, but are not limited to, WS<sub>2</sub>, WSe<sub>2</sub>, WTe<sub>2</sub>, MoS<sub>2</sub>, MoSe<sub>2</sub>, MoTe<sub>2</sub>, HfS<sub>2</sub>, ZrS<sub>2</sub>, and TiS<sub>2</sub>, GaSe, InSe, phosphorene, and other similar materials. These materials may be deposited by an atomic layer deposition (ALD) process and may be, for example, 5-15 angstroms thick, the thinness lending to their name&#x2014;2D material. The materials may be annealed during or after the device formation process to recrystallize or grow the crystals and thereby improve electrical characteristics. For the sake of simplicity, the use of conductive dielectrics will be disclosed.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Further, various techniques may be implemented to form the high-k barrier between the conductive channels and the gate electrode. One such technique utilizes a selective deposition of a high-k dielectric to form the transistor gates. In some implementations, a gate-recessing technique is utilized to allow a more uniform layer of doped conductive oxide material to form along the sidewall of the opening. Another, similar technique provides a non-selective deposition of the high-k dielectric in the gate-recessed opening, in conjunction with self-aligned directional etching. These techniques may also be implemented to fabricate stacked transistors of the same type by utilizing the same conductive oxide for two or more transistor layers. These and other aspects are described in further detail herein.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Reference will now be made to the Figures, which for the convenience of visualizing the 3D fabrication techniques described herein, illustrate a substrate undergoing a process flow in both top and cross-sectional views. Unless expressly indicated otherwise, each Figure represents one (or a set) of fabrication steps in a process flow for manufacturing the devices described herein.

A substrate <b>104</b> (e.g., Si, shown as &#x201c;Silicon&#x201d; in the legend) is provided which may be active or passive and may comprise dielectric, conductive or semiconductive materials or any combination thereof.

The term source/drain (S/D) will be used to describe layers that may be used as either a source or a drain of a transistor structure.

The gate layer <b>112</b> may be a different material than the first and second S/D layers <b>108</b>. A third insulating dielectric layer <b>110</b> may then be deposited on top of the second S/D layer <b>108</b> to complete a first transistor structure. In a multi-transistor stack these layers would constitute a first sub-stack. As shown in the cross-sectional view <b>102</b>, a transistor structure can include four dielectric layers (with the first transistor having one dielectric layer be the dielectric layer <b>106</b>, which separates the first transistor structure from the substrate <b>104</b>) and three conductive metal layers (the two S/D layers <b>108</b> and one gate layer <b>112</b>).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Subsequent transistor structures (e.g., second sub-stacks, third sub-stacks, etc.) may be stacked above the first transistor structure, by depositing similar layers. One or more insulating dielectric layers <b>114</b> may be deposited between adjacent transistor structures. These layers in the stack of layers may be formed without a mask, such that each layer forms a blanket layer over the prior layer. The gate layers <b>112</b> or <b>116</b> may be a different material than the S/D layers <b>108</b> to allow selectivity in etch and deposition processes. Moreover, the gate layer for a P-type device may be selected to be different from the gate layer of an N-type device. A non-exhaustive list of potential materials to use for the gate layer includes ruthenium (Ru), tantalum nitride (TaN), titanium nitride (TiN), and tungsten (W), tungsten nitride (VVN), titanium carbide (TiC), gallium (Ga), gadolinium (Gd), titanium oxynitride (TiON), tantalum silicon nitride (TaSiN), titanium silicon nitride (TiSiN), molybdenum (Mo), aluminum (Al), copper (Cu) and combinations/stacks/alloys of these or similar materials.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Once the layers are formed, each VFET structure or vertical group of VFET structures may be patterned as is well understood in the art to separate adjacent transistor structures in the x-y direction (e.g., where the x-y plane is perpendicular to the z-direction). As this pattern process is well described and documented elsewhere, it will not be expounded upon here in the interest of brevity and focus. Additionally, electrical connections between transistor structures may be formed by patterning the conductive layers described herein, as well as by forming vias to electrically connect different layers. As such, transistor stacks that are isolated in the x-y plane may be electrically connected with one another to form logical or electronic circuits.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Once the stack of layers has been formed to include one or more sub-stacks, the process flow proceeds to the next stage shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a top view <b>200</b> and a cross-sectional view <b>202</b> of a device at the next stage in the process flow. Either before or after patterning the structures into individual transistors or stacks of transistors, one or more channels (sometimes referred to as a &#x201c;transistor body openings&#x201d; or &#x201c;channel openings&#x201d;) may be formed. To form the channel openings, a mask (e.g., of a photoresist or other suitable masking material) may be formed over the final dielectric layer <b>118</b>, with openings that define the x-y cross-section of the channels (shown here as a circle). One or more etch techniques may be performed to remove the portion of the underlying layers aligned with the opening in the mask to form the transistor body opening. Any type of suitable etching techniques may be used, including but not limited to dry etching, wet etching, or plasma etching techniques. The mask may be removed once the channel openings are defined or may be retained to protect the underlying surface or to remain as part of the final structure.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a top view <b>300</b> and a cross-sectional view <b>302</b> of a device at the next stage in the process flow. Once the channel opening(s) are defined, one or more of the gate layers <b>112</b> may be etched slightly in the x-y direction to recess the gate from the channel opening. The etching process may be a selective etching process that etches the gate layers <b>112</b> to create recessed regions of a predetermined volume, by etching the gate layers <b>112</b> (the gate metal) by a predetermined amount. A gate dielectric, such as a high-k dielectric <b>120</b> (shown as &#x201c;High-k1&#x201d; in the legend), may be selectively formed on the gate layer <b>112</b>. The high-k dielectric <b>120</b> may be grown or deposited such that a predetermined amount of high-K dielectric <b>120</b> fills the recessed region of the gate layers <b>112</b>. Additionally or alternatively, the high-K dielectric <b>120</b> may be formed on recessed or non-recessed gate layer <b>112</b> so as to extend into the channel opening. The high-k dielectric <b>120</b> material may be selected to have desired attributes or properties, such as a desired dielectric constant.

As one example, a silicon oxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>) gate dielectric may be selectively formed on the gate layer. Additionally or alternatively, other gate dielectric materials may be utilized such as silicon oxynitride (SiO<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub>), silicon nitride (Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>), alumina (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), lanthanum oxide (La<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), zirconium oxide (ZrO<sub>2</sub>), hafnium oxide (HfO<sub>2</sub>), hafnium zirconium oxide (HfZrO), tantalum oxide (Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>), hafnium silicon oxide (HfSiO<sub>4</sub>), zirconium silicon oxide (ZrSiO<sub>4</sub>), titanium oxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>), strontium titanium oxide (SrTiO<sub>3</sub>), hafnium silicon oxynitride (HfSiO<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub>), zirconium silicon oxynitride (ZrSiO<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub>), hafnium oxynitride (HfO<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub>), zirconium oxynitride (ZrO<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub>), other suitable materials and combinations thereof. The resulting gate dielectric may be formed (or formed and then etched) to be slightly recessed, flush or slightly protruding relative to the channel opening depending on the desired device characteristics and process parameters.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">If multiple devices, such as N-type and P-type devices, are exposed in the opening, suitable dielectrics and thicknesses may be provided to each gate to achieve the desired characteristics.

Similar to the processes described above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the gate layer <b>116</b> may be recessed using an appropriate etching technique. Then, as shown, a second high-k dielectric <b>122</b> may be selectively formed on the gate layer <b>116</b>. A directional etching may be used to clean the second high-k dielectric <b>122</b> outside of the groove on the gate layer <b>116</b>. The second high-k dielectric <b>122</b> may be a different material than the first high-k dielectric <b>120</b> and may be deposited following an etching process to recess the gate layer <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates a top view <b>500</b> and a cross-sectional view <b>502</b> of a device at the next stage in the process flow. As shown, the channel opening can be deposit filled with a layer of material, such as a semiconductive-behaving material <b>126</b> (e.g., shown as &#x201c;Cond Oxide 1&#x201d; in the legend). The deposited material <b>126</b> can be any type of conductive oxide material with semiconductive properties. Although the example embodiments may show or describe the deposited material as a semiconductive-behaving material, the deposited material may be a conductive oxide, 2D material, or other similar material and combinations thereof. The semiconductive-behaving material <b>126</b> may be formed using certain elements that, when combined with oxygen, form a new material that exhibits semiconductive behavior. For example, the material can be &#x201c;turned off&#x201d; with a low off state leakage current or can be &#x201c;turned on&#x201d; and become highly conductive when voltage is applied. For example, the semiconductive-behaving material <b>126</b> may be an N-type (e.g., N+) conductive oxide, such as In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, SnO<sub>2</sub>, InGaZnO, and ZnO, among others. Alternatively, the semiconductive-behaving material <b>126</b> may be a P-type conductive oxide, such as SnO.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Following the deposition of the semiconductive-behaving material <b>126</b>, the semiconductive-behaving material <b>126</b> is then selectively etched to a predetermined height to define a first transistor device. In some implementations, the semiconductive-behaving material <b>126</b> may be formed such that the level of the semiconductive-behaving material <b>126</b> is at or around the same level as the uppermost S/D layer <b>108</b> in the z-direction for the first transistor structure. In a single VFET structure, the semiconductive-behaving material <b>126</b> may then be patterned and selectively etched to have an opening, thereby allowing the electrical characteristics of the channel region be defined based on the thickness of the remaining layer. This may form a donut or ring-shaped channel cylinder that is defined on its outermost edge by the channel opening and, if applicable, the gate dielectric layers <b>120</b> or <b>122</b>. If multiple VFET structures are to be stacked, the semiconductive-behaving material <b>126</b> of the bottommost VFET structure may not be selectively etched until semiconductive-behaving materials <b>126</b> are formed relative to the other VFET structures. By delaying this step, the channel regions may all be defined to their final dimensions simultaneously through the same removal step.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in the cross-sectional view <b>502</b>, in this implementation the stack of layers may include a single dielectric layer <b>114</b> between the S/D layers <b>108</b> of adjacent transistor devices. However, it should be understood that any number of dielectric layers may be interposed between adjacent transistor structures, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b></figref>. Various parameters (e.g., thickness or shape of one or more S/D layers <b>108</b>, thickness or shape of one or more layers of the gate layers <b>112</b> or <b>116</b>, thickness or shape of one or more layers, thickness or shape of the high-K dielectric <b>120</b>, thickness or shape of the layers of dielectric <b>106</b>, the diameter of the central channel, etc.) may be selected prior to the fabrication process to create transistors with desired properties. It should also be appreciated, that other materials may be used for the central channel, such as a 2D material or epitaxial material. In the case of an epitaxial layer, the channel opening etch will reach completely to the substrate <b>104</b>, which in such an embodiment would be a semiconductor such as silicon. Then, a first layer of material, e.g., SiGe, would be formed followed by the growth of the channel. The SiGe material would subsequently be removed and/or replaced by an isolation material (not shown). Additionally or alternatively, one or more of the channel materials may include an epitaxially grown or polycrystalline deposited semiconductor, such as Si, Ge, or GaAs, among others.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates a top view <b>600</b> and a cross-sectional view <b>602</b> of a device at the next stage in the process flow. Once the bottommost transistor is formed by providing the semiconductive-behaving material <b>126</b> within the channel opening, a capping layer <b>124</b> (shown as the &#x201c;Seed Layer&#x201d; in the legend) may be formed on the semiconductive-behaving layer <b>126</b>. The capping layer <b>124</b> may be an insulating, conductive or semiconductive layer, but preferably deposits or grows selectively on the semiconductive-behaving material <b>126</b>. By having the formation characteristics of the capping layer <b>124</b> selected to be preferential to the semiconductive-behaving layer <b>126</b>, no additional mask step is required. Alternatively, if a non-preferential capping layer <b>124</b> is selected, a mask layer may be used to deposit fill the channel opening on top of the semiconductive behaving material <b>126</b> with the capping layer <b>124</b>. In some implementations, the capping layer <b>124</b> may be etched by a predetermined amount, such that the thickness of the capping layer <b>124</b> maintains the height of the dielectric <b>114</b>. In some implementations, the selective formation of the capping layer <b>124</b> may deposit or form a predetermined amount of the capping layer <b>124</b> that matches the height of the dielectric layer <b>114</b>, eliminating the requirement for an etching step.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates a top view <b>700</b> and a cross-sectional view <b>702</b> of a device at the next stage of the process flow. As shown, in a multiple stacked VFET structure, an additional semiconductive-behaving material <b>126</b> is formed on the capping layer <b>124</b>. The additional semiconductive-behaving material <b>126</b> may be the same material as the underlying semiconductive-behaving material <b>126</b>, or it may be different, though the materials indicated above may be used. For example, utilizing different semiconductive-behaving type materials (e.g., the semiconductive behaving material <b>130</b>) than what underlies the capping layer provides different types of devices (N-type/P-type or P-type/N-type, for example). Moreover, semiconductive oxides may be used for one channel structure and epitaxial or polycrystalline semiconductors may be used for another channel structure. The structures may be repeated to provide an array of transistors in the x, y, and z directions. The semiconductive behaving material <b>126</b> may be deposited on the capping layer <b>124</b> using processes similar to those described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. The capping layer <b>124</b> may, in some implementations, may serve as a seed layer for the next layer of semiconductive-behaving material <b>126</b>. In such implementations, the semiconductive-behaving material <b>126</b> may be selectively formed and, thus, may not require further masking.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates a top view <b>800</b> and a cross-sectional view <b>802</b> of a device at the next stage of the process flow.

However, it should be understood that this is shown for example purposes only, and any type of material (e.g., the semiconductive-behaving material <b>126</b>, etc.) may be used in place of the semiconductive-behaving material <b>130</b>. This process may be repeated as many times as need to fill or nearly fill the channel opening for another device, shown here as a complementary transistor.

As shown in the cross-sectional view <b>902</b>, a patterning layer may be formed to expose a core area of the uppermost semiconductive-behaving material <b>130</b>. For example, a self-aligned layer of dielectric <b>114</b> may be formed (e.g., using an ALD technique) and etched to create a spacer within the channel opening, which can be used to define a core area that is generally in the center of the cylinder-shaped semiconductive-behaving materials <b>126</b> and <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> illustrates a top view <b>1000</b> and a cross-sectional view <b>1002</b> of a device at the next stage in the process flow.

The etching process may be any type of etching process, including a dry etching process, a wet etching process, or a plasma etching process, among others.

The dielectric may be deposited or otherwise formed using any suitable deposition technique. By defining a core region of dielectric material <b>114</b> in the transistor, the overall volume of the semiconductive-behaving material <b>126</b> and <b>130</b> are reduced, thereby changing the electronic characteristics of the resulting transistor devices. For example, when the volume of the semiconductive-behaving materials <b>126</b> and <b>130</b> is reduced, the amount of energy required to turn the transistor to an &#x201c;on&#x201d; state is also reduced. The size of the core area etched through the semiconductive-behaving materials can be selected to achieve desired transistor characteristics. Alternatively, these gaps may be left empty to leave an air gap (not shown). If an air gap is desired, the core area may be sealed at the uppermost end of the structure with a capping material (e.g., any of the dielectric materials <b>106</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>114</b>, or <b>118</b>) to prevent unwanted debris, liquid, moisture, or other material from entering the gap and potentially affecting the devices.

The second sub-stack can include at least three layers of at least one conductive material (e.g., the S/D layers <b>108</b> and at least one gate layer <b>112</b> or <b>116</b>) separated by one or more layers of at least one dielectric material (e.g., the dielectric materials <b>106</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>114</b>, or <b>118</b>). The first and second sub-stacks can be separated by one or more dielectric materials (e.g., the dielectric materials <b>114</b>). Additional transistor structures may also be formed by providing additional sub-stacks. The stack of layers may be formed using techniques similar to those described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">At step <b>1410</b>, the method <b>1400</b> can include forming a channel opening in the stack of layers. The channel opening (sometimes referred to as the &#x201c;transistor body opening&#x201d;) may be formed using any type of suitable etching technique, similar to the techniques described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The transistor body opening may extend through each of the transistor structures in the stack of layers. After defining the channel opening, high-k gate dielectrics (e.g., the gate dielectrics <b>120</b> or <b>122</b>) may be deposited on the gate layers (e.g., the gate layers <b>112</b> or <b>116</b>) in each sub-tack in the stack of layers. To do so, one or more of the gate layers may be recessed, and the high-k gate dielectric materials may be subsequently deposited using techniques similar to those described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. Additional high-k gate dielectrics may also be deposited on gate layers for other sub-stacks using techniques similar to those described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">At step <b>1415</b>, the method <b>1400</b> can include providing a first channel structure within the channel opening. The first channel structure can include a deposited material (e.g., the deposited material <b>126</b> or <b>130</b>) and can be aligned with the first transistor structure. The first channel structure may be deposited or grown using techniques similar to those described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. To do so, the semiconductive-behaving material may be selectively formed such that the level of the semiconductive-behaving material is at or around the same level as the uppermost layer in the first transistor structure. In some implementations, for example in a single transistor structure, the semiconductive-behaving material may then be patterned and selectively etched to have an opening, thereby allowing the electrical characteristics of the channel region to be defined based on the thickness of the remaining layer. This may form a donut or ring-shaped channel that is defined on its outermost edge by the channel opening and, if applicable, gate dielectric layers in the first sub-stack. If multiple transistor layers are desired, the process flow may proceed to step <b>1420</b>. In some implementations, following the deposition or formation of the first channel structure, the first channel structure may be directionally etched until a predetermined height is achieved (e.g., flush with, or extending slightly over, the top S/D layer of the first transistor structure).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">At step <b>1420</b>, the method <b>1400</b> can include selectively forming a capping layer (e.g., the capping layer <b>124</b>) on the first channel structure. To do so, techniques similar to those described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> may be performed. In some implementations, the capping layer may be a seed layer on which additional layers of material, such as conductive oxides, may be selectively deposited or grown. The capping layer may be selectively grown on the first channel structure, which is formed at step <b>1415</b>. The capping layer may be formed to match the thickness of a dielectric that separates the first and second sub-stacks, in a way that does not overlap, or does not substantially overlap, the bottommost S/D layer of the second sub-stack. In some implementations, the capping layer may be selectively etched to achieve a desired height. In some implementations, only a single transistor device layer may be formed, and step <b>1420</b> may be omitted from the method <b>1400</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">At step <b>1425</b>, the method <b>1400</b> can include providing a second channel structure within the channel opening. The second channel structure can include a semiconductive oxide material (e.g., the semiconducting-behaving material <b>126</b> or <b>130</b>), and can be aligned with the second transistor structure. The second channel structure be deposited or grown on the capping layer created in step <b>1420</b>. For example, the second channel structure may be selectively formed by utilizing the capping layer as a seed layer. The semiconductive behaving material may be any type of semiconductive-behaving material and may be an N-type semiconductive oxide or a P-type semiconductive oxide material. The first channel structure and the second channel structure may include same material or may include different materials (e.g., N-type/N-type, P-type/N-type, or N-type/P-type, among other combinations of additional transistor structures in the stack of layers). For example, if the second channel structure is different from the material used in the first channel structure, a CFET device may be formed. In some implementations, only a single transistor device layer may be formed, and steps <b>1420</b> and <b>1425</b> may be omitted from the method <b>1400</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">After the second channel structure has been formed, additional capping layers and channel structures may be formed to accommodate each transistor structure in the stack of layers. Once a channel structure has been formed for each transistor structure, a final layer of dielectric may be deposited using techniques described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. To do so, a self-aligned layer of may be formed (e.g., using an ALD technique) and etched to create a spacer within the channel opening, which can be used to define a core area that is generally in the center of the first and second channel structures. Once this layer of dielectric is formed, a core region of the first and second channel structures may be removed using etching techniques described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b> or <b>11</b>-<b>13</b></figref>. If the techniques described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> are used, the etched core region may be replaced with a core dielectric (e.g., the dielectric <b>114</b>), without removing the capping layers. If the techniques described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>-<b>13</b></figref> are performed, etching techniques may be used to remove both the core region and the capping layers that separate the transistor structures, as described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b> and <b>12</b></figref>. The etched core regions and the empty regions left by the etched capping layers may then be filled with a core dielectric using techniques described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Having now described some illustrative implementations, it is apparent that the foregoing is illustrative and not limiting, having been presented by way of example.
