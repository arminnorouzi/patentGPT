id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">Pre-molded leadframes for semiconductor devices are manufactured by molding electrically insulating material onto a laminar sculptured structure of electrically conductive material including semiconductor device component die pads. First and second die pads are coupled via a first extension from the first die pad and a second extension from the second die pad at neighboring locations on the front surface of the leadframe and a bridge formation coupling the first and second extensions at the bacpk surface of the leadframe. The bridge formation provides a sacrificial connection between the first and second extensions which is selectively removed after molding the electrically insulating material in order to decouple the first and second die pads from each other. The removal of the sacrificial connection leaves a cavity formed at the second surface of the leadframe without affecting the shape of the die pads.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="74.59mm" wi="158.75mm" file="US20230005824A1-20230105-D00000.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-D00001" he="239.95mm" wi="177.63mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230005824A1-20230105-D00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-D00002" he="216.32mm" wi="155.02mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230005824A1-20230105-D00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00003" num="00003"><img id="EMI-D00003" he="214.04mm" wi="167.98mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230005824A1-20230105-D00003.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure></drawings><description id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">PRIORITY CLAIM</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the priority benefit of Italian Application for Patent No. 102021000017231, filed on Jun. 30, 2021, the content of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety to the maximum extent allowable by law.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The description relates to manufacturing semiconductor devices.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">One or more embodiments may apply to manufacturing pre-molded leadframes for semiconductor devices.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Semiconductor devices may comprise one or more semiconductor integrated circuit chips or dice arranged (attached) on a substrate such as a leadframe.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Plastic packages are commonly used for semiconductor devices. Such packages may include a leadframe providing a base substrate comprising electrically conductive material such as copper, sized and shaped to accommodate semiconductor chips or dice and providing pad connections (leads) for these chips or dice.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The designation &#x201c;leadframe&#x201d; (or &#x201c;lead frame&#x201d;) is currently used (see, for instance the USPC Consolidated Glossary of the United States Patent and Trademark Office) to indicate a metal frame that provides support for an integrated circuit chip or die as well as electrical leads to interconnect the integrated circuit in the die or chip to other electrical components or contacts.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Leadframes are conventionally created using technologies such as a photo-etching technology. With this technology, metal (e.g., copper) material in the form of a foil or tape is etched on the top and bottom sides to create various pads and leads.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">So-called &#x201c;pre-molded&#x201d; leadframes include electrically insulating resin such as epoxy resin, for instance, molded onto a sculptured (e.g., photo-etched) metal leadframe structure using a flat molding tool, for instance.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Spaces left in the etched metal material are filled by pre-mold resin and the resulting leadframe has a total thickness which is the same thickness of the original etched leadframe.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">After pre-molding (with the molded resin solidified, via heat or UV curing, for instance), de-flashing and smearing processes can be applied to provide clean top/bottom metal surfaces of the leadframe.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Such pre-molded leadframes are used in a wide variety of semiconductor devices.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Certain pre-molded leadframes (for instance, for use in power semiconductor devices packaged in Quad-Flat No-leads (QFN) packages) may include plural die pads for arranging semiconductor chips or dies and associated components.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">These die pads are intended to be finally isolated from one another. However, connecting bars are useful in mechanically coupling these pads either to a metal (e.g., copper) frame in the leadframe and/or to other die pads in the leadframe while the pre-mold resin is molded onto the sculptured metal structure of the leadframe.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">These connecting bars are useful in avoiding negative phenomena such as undesired displacement of the die pads or &#x201c;flashing&#x201d; of the pre-mold resin over the metal surfaces of the leadframe.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The connecting bars are then removed, for instance during a subsequent (half) etching process applied to the pre-molded leadframe to form wettable flanks for soldering.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">This processing may however leave certain defects that are difficult to control in production and may result in part rejection or quality issues at the customer board level.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">There is a need in the art to contribute to avoiding the drawbacks outlined in the foregoing.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018">One of more embodiments relate to a method.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">One of more embodiments relate to a corresponding (pre-molded) leadframe.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">One of more embodiments relate to a corresponding semiconductor device.
