For example, when the charging device charges a mobile phone that supports a PD protocol, an output voltage of the charging device needs to be a form of continuously adjustable direct current.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the related art, a pulse transformer is usually provided in the charging device, so that pulse modulation is performed by a voltage on a primary side of the pulse transformer of a PWM control chip to adjust a voltage at an output terminal of the pulse transformer. However, because a turns ratio of the pulse transformer is generally fixed, if it wants to realize that the output terminal of the pulse transformer outputs the form of continuously adjustable direct current, then a voltage of a power supply needs to be within a certain range. Therefore, this scheme has higher requirements for a power supply. Once the voltage of the power supply fluctuates greatly or the supply voltage is too low or too high, a voltage adjustable range for the output terminal of the pulse transformer will be limited.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The above information disclosed in a background section is only used to enhance understanding of the background of the disclosure.

The charging device may be a charging apparatus, an adapter, or the like, for supplying power to an electronic device. Herein, the electronic device may be an intelligent or mobile terminal device equipped with a battery-powered system. The electronic device may also be but is not limited to, a rechargeable electronic device with a charging capability, such as a laptop, a mobile phone, an e-book reader, a smart wearable device, a mobile power supply (such as a power bank or a travel charger), an electronic cigarette, a wireless mouse, a wireless keyboard, a wireless headphone, a Bluetooth speaker, or the like.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The charging device includes a power supply inlet and a power supply circuit. The power supply inlet is used to receive an alternating current (AC) power supply. The charging device converts the AC power supply into a charging voltage and/or charging current allowed or required by the electronic device.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The charging device can operate in a voltage-following manner. Namely, an adapter and an electronic device to be charged conduct two-way communication. The adapter adjusts an output voltage and current according to a required charging voltage and current that the electronic device feeds back, so that the output voltage and current can be directly loaded on a battery of the electronic device to charge the battery. Thus, the electronic device does not need to adjust the charging voltage and current again.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Charging modes for a battery of an electronic device are roughly divided into a &#x201c;normal-charging mode&#x201d; and a &#x201c;quick-charging mode.&#x201d; The normal-charging mode means that an adapter outputs a relatively low current value (usually less than 2.5 A) or charges a battery in a device to be charged with relatively low power (usually less than 15 W). It usually takes several hours to fully charge a large-capacity battery (such as a 3000 mAh battery) in the normal-charging mode. The quick-charging mode means that the adapter can output a relatively high current (usually greater than 2.5 A, such as 4.5 A, 5 A, or even higher) or charge the battery in the device to be charged with relatively high power (usually greater than or equal to 15 W). Compared with the normal-charging mode, the charging speed of the adapter in the quick-charging mode is faster, and the charging time that is required to charge the battery with the same capacity fully can be significantly shortened.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, which is a block diagram illustrating a circuit structure of a power supply circuit according to an embodiment. In this embodiment, a power supply circuit is provided inside a charging device. The power supply circuit includes a pulse transformer circuit <b>1</b> and a first power supply conversion circuit <b>2</b>. The pulse transformer circuit <b>1</b> includes a pulse transformer <b>11</b> and a switch control circuit <b>12</b>. A primary winding of the pulse transformer <b>11</b> is provided to connect a power supply and the switch control circuit <b>12</b>. The switch control circuit <b>12</b> is used to modulate a voltage on the primary winding into a pulse voltage. An input terminal of the first power supply conversion circuit <b>2</b> is connected to a secondary winding of the pulse transformer to convert a voltage on the secondary winding of the pulse transformer to be within a first preset voltage range and then to be output in the case of a voltage output by the secondary winding being out of the first preset voltage range.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The power supply connected to the primary winding of the pulse transformer is an externally connected power supply. For example, a direct current (DC) power supply input directly into the primary winding of the pulse transformer winding is used to chop and modulate an incoming line of the DC power supply by the pulse transformer, thereby obtaining a required voltage on the secondary winding of the pulse transformer. In one embodiment, the power supply circuit further includes a rectification circuit <b>3</b>. An input terminal of the rectification circuit <b>3</b> is connected to the AC power supply to rectify the AC power supply. An output terminal of the rectification circuit <b>3</b> is connected to a first end of the primary winding of the pulse transformer.

The rectification circuit <b>3</b> may be a diode rectification circuit <b>3</b>, a full-bridge rectification circuit <b>3</b>, or a half-bridge rectification circuit <b>3</b> to perform full-wave rectification on the AC power supply. According to different selected conduction components, the rectification circuit <b>3</b> can be an uncontrollable rectification circuit <b>3</b>, a half-controlled rectification circuit <b>3</b>, or a fully-controlled rectification circuit <b>3</b>. In the uncontrollable rectification circuit <b>3</b>, rectification is completed in cooperation by a plurality of uncontrollable rectifier diodes. The half-controlled rectification circuit <b>3</b> is composed of a mixture of controllable elements and diodes to complete rectification. In the fully-controlled rectification circuit <b>3</b>, all rectifier elements are controllable (e.g., MOS transistors, SCRs, GTRs, GTOs, and the like). An average value and polarity of an output DC voltage of the fully-controlled rectification circuit <b>3</b> can be adjusted by controlling conducting conditions of elements.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In this embodiment, a diode rectification circuit <b>3</b> can be provided. Rectifier diodes in the full-bridge rectification circuit <b>3</b> or the half-bridge rectification circuit <b>3</b> are replaced with MOS transistors to reduce electric energy loss in the rectification circuit <b>3</b>. Thus, under the case of the same input electric energy, an output voltage of the rectification circuit <b>3</b> can be stepped up.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The DC power supply formed by the AC power supply after being processed through the rectification circuit <b>3</b> is approximately a continuous steamed-bread wave. In one example, frequency of the steamed-bread wave is approximately 100 Hz. A filter circuit can also be provided, followed by the rectification circuit <b>3</b> to further smooth the steamed-bread wave.

By controlling the switching transistors to be turned on and off, timing of transmitting electric energy from the primary winding of the pulse transformer T<b>1</b> to the secondary winding is controlled.
