The riser <b>30</b> may include an indent or other structural manipulation <b>60</b>, such as a perforation, to demarcate a middle fold <b>62</b> widthwise between lateral sides. The middle fold <b>62</b> may be used to facilitate folding such that a forward side <b>64</b> and a rearward side <b>66</b> adjoin when folded and flex outwardly when positioned in the stringers <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>.

One non-limiting aspect of the present invention contemplates a low-cost structure capable of being easily and quickly constructed and deconstructed to facilitate displaying items in an aesthetically pleasing manner. The stadium can described above may be so constructed from panels or blanks of corrugated or other materials whereby the individual panels, i.e., the planar form of the stringers, risers and runners, maybe stacked upon each other and shipped within a box having a relatively small footprint. A salesperson or partygoer can then open the box and fold each of the planar pieces into the stringers, risers and runners for easily and quickly setting up the stadium.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The stadium <b>10</b> is shown to include three sections <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> for exemplary purposes as the stadium <b>10</b> may be constructed using more or less sections, such as by using two side sections, one side section and one center section or multiple center and side sections. The stadium <b>10</b> is illustrated with the sections <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> being relatively sized and positioned at 22.5&#xb0; to demonstrate one manner of construction believed to be particularly beneficial for use with a 30&#x2033;&#xd7;6&#x2032; table or truck tailgate.
