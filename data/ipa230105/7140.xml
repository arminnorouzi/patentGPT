An information processing system <b>100</b> in the present embodiment includes a printer management server <b>101</b>, a notification management server <b>102</b>, a service provider server <b>103</b>, a printer <b>104</b> as a communication apparatus, and a mobile terminal <b>105</b> as an information processing apparatus.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Each of the printer management server <b>101</b>, the notification management server <b>102</b>, the service provider server <b>103</b>, and the mobile terminal <b>105</b> are connected to the Internet <b>110</b>. The printer <b>104</b> is able to be connected to the Internet through a router <b>106</b>. The printer management server <b>101</b> is able to receive information from the notification management server <b>102</b> through the Internet <b>110</b> and can transmit the information to the printer <b>104</b>. The communication between the printer <b>104</b> and the printer management server <b>101</b> is established by a control by using HTTP, XMPP, or the like. The communication may be established by using another protocol. In the present embodiment, each of the servers, the printer management server <b>101</b>, the notification management server <b>102</b>, and the service provider server <b>103</b>, is a server system including one or more server apparatuses.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the present embodiment, the service provider server <b>103</b> provides various services. For example, the services may include a service to give a point in accordance with the number of sheets printed by a user with a printer that is registered with the service, a service to automatically deliver consumables to the user of the printer registered with the service, and the like. Examples of the services are not limited to the modes, and any service may be applied as long as it is a service that allows for the registration of the printer <b>104</b> with the service. If the communication apparatus is not a printer, the service provided by the service provider server <b>103</b> may not necessarily be a service related to printing and may be a service depending on the type of the communication apparatus. In the present embodiment, the registration of the printer <b>104</b> with a service corresponds to management, by the service provider server <b>103</b>, of information on the printer <b>104</b> and the service as a registration target, in association with each other. In use of a service, for example, the printer <b>104</b> periodically transmits status information including various pieces of information such as the number of print sheets and a remaining amount of ink to the printer management server <b>101</b> with identification information identifying the printer <b>104</b> itself (for example, a serial number of the apparatus). The printer management server <b>101</b> transmits the information received from the printer <b>104</b> to an appropriate service provider server <b>103</b> depending on the service that the printer <b>104</b> subscribes (registers). In this case, a separate identification number (in the present embodiment, referred to as a registration ID) different from the identification information (a serial number) of the printer <b>104</b> is used between the printer management server <b>101</b> and the service provider server <b>103</b>. This is for responding to a case where a printer that already subscribes the service is transferred to another user, for example. For this reason, in a case where the user receives the service of the service provider server <b>103</b> (in other words, in a case of registering with the service), the identification information (a serial number) of the printer <b>104</b> and the registration ID need to be associated with each other in the printer management server <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the embodiments described below, there is described an example where it is possible to register the printer <b>104</b> (the communication apparatus) by a simple method in a case where the user registers the printer <b>104</b> with the service of the service provider server <b>103</b>.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">&#x3c;Configuration of Server&#x3e;</heading><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating an example of a hardware configuration of the printer management server <b>101</b> in the present embodiment.

The notification information is information for notifying the user of a service with which the printer <b>104</b> is not registered yet, for example. In the present embodiment, if there occurs an event that a manager of the service provider server <b>103</b> desires to notify each user of a corresponding printer managed by the printer management server <b>101</b>, the manager of the service provider server <b>103</b> generates the notification registration information. The notification information is then transmitted from the service provider server <b>103</b> to the notification management server <b>102</b>. The notification management server <b>102</b> notifies the printer management server <b>101</b> of all or a part of the information out of the notification registration information received from the service provider server <b>103</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0042">Thereafter, the printer management server <b>101</b> requests the notification information to the notification management server <b>102</b> in response to an inquiry from the printer <b>104</b> about whether there is the notification information.

In other words, the series of processing is performed by the CPU of each device deploying and executing the program code, which is stored in the disk device or the like, in the RAM. Otherwise, a part of or all the functions of the steps in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> may be implemented by hardware such as an ASIC or an electronic circuit. A sign &#x201c;S&#x201d; in a description of each processing means a step in the sequence diagram. Hereinafter, the CPUs included in the printer <b>104</b>, the printer management server <b>101</b>, the notification management server <b>102</b>, and the service provider server <b>103</b> have a central role in each processing. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the printer <b>104</b> is communicable with the printer management server <b>101</b> through the router <b>106</b> and is connected to the Internet <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0044">The present sequence is roughly divided into three phases.

The second phase is a phase in which the notification information is transmitted from the service provider server <b>103</b>. The third phase is a phase in which the printer <b>104</b> requests the notification information and then stores the notification information replied in response to the request into the printer <b>104</b>. Each phase is performed independently and separately.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0045">First, the first phase is described. In S<b>501</b>, the printer <b>104</b> transmits the printer information as information on the printer <b>104</b> itself to the printer management server <b>101</b>. For example, in a case where the user newly purchases the printer <b>104</b>, the printer <b>104</b> receives permission from the user for the connection with the printer management server <b>101</b>. Once receiving such permission, the printer <b>104</b> transmits the printer information to the printer management server <b>101</b> in S<b>501</b>. The printer information is information including identification information identifying the printer (for example, a serial number), a model name, product delivery information, and the like.

In the present embodiment, the printer management server <b>101</b> registers the serial number, the model name, and the product delivery information of the printer <b>104</b> with the printer management table <b>601</b> in association with the registration status with each Web service. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> illustrates a value of the printer management table <b>601</b> in a case where the printer <b>104</b> is registered, and a value indicating not registered is registered as an initial value of the registration status with each Web service. The registration status with each Web service is changed based on information on the registration with the Web service. For example, if the printer <b>104</b> is registered with a service A, a value indicating registration is registered as a value of the registration status with the service A as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>. The processing of registering a service is described later. The processing from S<b>501</b> to S<b>502</b> is processing of the first phase in which the information on the printer <b>104</b> is registered with the printer management server <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0048">Referring back to the sequence in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the second phase in which the notification information is transmitted from the service provider server <b>103</b> is described.

The notification registration information is notification information on a Web service provided by the service provider server <b>103</b> and is information for registering that there is the notification information to be transmitted to the communication apparatus with the notification management server <b>102</b>. The notification registration information transmitted from the service provider server <b>103</b> includes a specific notification ID for each notification information corresponding to the notification registration information. The notification registration information additionally includes an image download uniform resource locator (URL) of the notification information to be displayed on the printer <b>104</b> and a Web service name introduced by the and notification information. The notification registration information includes the model name and the product delivery information of the printer <b>104</b> that displays the notification information corresponding to the notification registration information, a display format of the notification information, a display timing, display start time, and display end time. The display format of the notification information is a value indicating the number of screens of the notification information, a screen layout, the number and the types of buttons to be displayed on the screen. The display timing is a value indicating the timing to display the notification information on the printer <b>104</b> and is, for example, a value indicating the timing of power-on or the like. The display start time and the display end time are an effective period in which the notification is displayed on the printer <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0049">In S<b>504</b>, the notification management server <b>102</b> registers a part of the notification registration information received in S<b>503</b> with a notification management table <b>701</b> stored in the database <b>209</b> of the notification management server <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of the notification management table <b>701</b> stored in the database <b>209</b> of the notification management server <b>102</b>.

As described later, the information to be used in a case of replying in response to the request of the printer management server <b>101</b> in the third phase is registered with the notification management table <b>701</b>. Thus, in S<b>504</b>, the notification management server <b>102</b> registers the information to be used in the third phase out of the notification registration information received in S<b>503</b> with the notification management table <b>701</b>.

In this case, the notification registration information including the notification ID of the notification information corresponding to the notification registration information, the model name of the printer <b>104</b> that displays the notification information, the Web service name introduced by the notification information, the product delivery, the display format, the display timing, the display start time, and the display end time is transmitted.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0052">In S<b>506</b>, the printer management server <b>101</b> registers the notification registration information received in S<b>505</b> with a notification display model table <b>801</b> and a notification information table <b>802</b> stored in the database <b>209</b> of the printer management server <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B</figref> are diagrams illustrating an example of various tables stored in the database <b>209</b> of the printer management server <b>101</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> illustrates the notification display model table <b>801</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref> illustrates the notification information table <b>802</b>. The notification display model table <b>801</b> is a table managing the printer that displays the notification information corresponding to the notification registration information and stores the model name, the product delivery, and the notification ID of the printer that displays the notification information. The notification information table <b>802</b> stores the notification ID, the Web service name introduced by the notification information, the display timing, the display format, the display start time, and the display end time. The printer management server <b>101</b> registers the notification ID, the model name, and the product delivery of the printer <b>104</b> that displays the notification information out of the notification information received in S<b>505</b> with the notification display model table <b>801</b>. Additionally, the printer management server <b>101</b> registers the notification ID, the Web service name introduced by the notification information, the display format, the display timing, the display start time, and the display end time with the notification information table <b>802</b>. The above-described processing is the second phase in which the notification registration information is transmitted from the service provider server <b>103</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0054">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the description is continued. Next, the third phase in which the printer <b>104</b> requests the notification information and stores the notification information replied in response to the request into the printer <b>104</b> is described.

This and the following processing including the inquiry is performed periodically in an arbitrary timing by the printer <b>104</b> in a case where, for example, 24 hours elapses after the last execution. For example, the processing is performed in a timing when the printer <b>104</b> is powered on.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0056">In S<b>508</b>, the printer management server <b>101</b> determines whether it is possible to display the notification information on the printer <b>104</b> based on the serial number, the model name, and the product delivery information received from the printer <b>104</b>. The present determination is comparable to the determination for controlling whether to execute the notification (display) based on the notification information by the printer <b>104</b>. If it is determined that the display is impossible, the process proceeds to S<b>509</b>, and a control on the printer <b>104</b> to do not execute the notification based on the notification information is executed.

The printer management server <b>101</b> then searches for the obtained notification ID from the notification information table <b>802</b> and obtains the data associated with the notification ID from the notification information table <b>802</b>. If there is the corresponding data, the printer management server <b>101</b> determines whether a current clock time of the printer management server <b>101</b> is within a period between the display start time and the display end time. If the current clock time is within the period, it is determined that it is the printer as the notification target, and the process proceeds to S<b>902</b>.

In other words, the URL for the registration with the Web service includes the serial number of the printer <b>104</b> as a character string. For example, the serial number of the printer <b>104</b> is included in the URL as a query parameter. Then, the two-dimensional code is generated from the thus-generated URL. The URL is a URL to be used in a case where the mobile terminal <b>105</b> accesses the notification management server <b>102</b> for the registration with the service. In other words, the URL generated in S<b>511</b> is a URL managed by the notification management server <b>102</b>.

For example, a mode in which the printer <b>104</b> is able to display the code information without receiving the notification information from the printer management server <b>101</b> may be applied. In this case, the printer <b>104</b> holds in advance various pieces of information (the URL for the registration with the Web service and the identification information of the printer) to be read by the mobile terminal <b>105</b> using the code information.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0129">Additionally, in the above descriptions, there is described a mode in which the screen based on the notification information is not displayed on the printer <b>104</b> in a case where the printer <b>104</b> is already registered with the Web service corresponding to the notification ID. However, it is not limited to the mode. For example, in a case where the printer <b>104</b> is already registered with the Web service corresponding to the notification ID, the notification management server <b>102</b> may not generate the two-dimensional code. Then, the notification management server <b>102</b> may generate the notification image based on not the two-dimensional code but the image including the notification message related to the Web service corresponding to the notification ID. The printer <b>104</b> that obtains such a notification image may not display the two-dimensional code but display the image including the notification message related to the Web service. Thus, the notification management server <b>102</b> may generate a different notification image depending on whether the printer <b>104</b> is already registered with the Web service corresponding to the notification information. Based on the control, the printer <b>104</b> may display a different screen depending on whether the printer <b>104</b> is already registered with the Web service corresponding to the notification information.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0130">Moreover, in the above descriptions, there is described a mode in which the notification information related to the Web service with which the printer <b>104</b> can be registered is registered with the printer management server <b>101</b>, and as a result, the notification based on the notification information related to the concerned Web service is executed by the printer <b>104</b>. However, notification information other than the notification information related to the concerned Web service may be registered with the printer management server <b>101</b>. In other words, a notification based on the notification information other than the notification information related to the concerned Web service may be executed by the printer <b>104</b>. The notification information other than the notification information related to the concerned Web service is, for example, a notification related to an application program for printing that is installable into the mobile terminal <b>105</b>. More specifically, the notification information is a notification to encourage the user to use the application program for printing and to encourage the user to execute printing using the application program for printing. As described above, depending on whether the printer <b>104</b> is already registered with the Web service, the execution of the notification based on the notification information related to the Web service is controlled, or the contents of the notification are controlled to be changed.
