However, there has been a problem in that the pure copper materials had poor stress relaxation resistance and cannot be used in high-temperature environments.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. 2016-056414 discloses a rolled copper sheet containing Mg in a range of 0.005 mass % or more and less than 0.1 mass %.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Since the rolled copper sheet described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. 2016-056414 has a composition in which Mg is contained in a range of 0.005 mass % or more and less than 0.1 mass % and the balance is composed of Cu and inevitable impurities, it has been possible to form solid solutions of Mg in the matrix of copper, and it has been possible to improve the strength and the stress relaxation resistance without significantly reducing the electrical conductivity.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Patent Document</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">[Patent Document 1]<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0009">Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. 2016-056414</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0010">Incidentally, in recent years, pure copper materials have been often used in high-temperature environments such as an engine room, and there has been a need to improve the stress relaxation resistance, which was also true conventionally. Furthermore, in order to further suppress the generation of heat when a large current is caused to flow, there has been a need to further improve the electrical conductivity. That is, there has been a demand for a copper material having an electrical conductivity and stress relaxation resistance that are improved in a well-balanced manner.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0011">In a case where the thickness has been increased, the bending conditions for forming components for an electric or electronic device become strict, and thus there is another demand for excellent bendability.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0012">This invention has been made in view of the above-described circumstances, and an objective of the present invention is to provide a copper alloy, a copper alloy plastically-worked material, a component for an electronic and electronic device, a terminal, and a busbar having high electrical conductivity and excellent stress relaxation resistance and being excellent in terms of bendability.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0013">As a result of intensive studies by the present inventors in order to solve this problem, it has been clarified that, in order to improve the electrical conductivity and the stress relaxation resistance in a well-balanced manner, a control of the composition alone is not sufficient, and it is necessary to perform a texture control according to the composition. That is, it was found that, when an optimum composition and a texture control are both achieved, it becomes possible to improve the electrical conductivity and the stress relaxation resistance in a well-balanced manner on a higher level than before. In addition, it was found that, when an optimum composition and a texture control are both achieved, it becomes possible to improve the bendability.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0014">The present invention has been made based on the above-described findings, and a copper alloy that is one aspect of the present invention has a composition including: 70 mass ppm or more and 400 mass ppm or less of Mg; 5 mass ppm or more and 20 mass ppm or less of Ag; and a Cu balance containing inevitable impurities; in which a P content is set to less than 3.0 mass ppm, in which an electrical conductivity is set to 90% IACS or more, and an average value of KAM (Kernel average misorientation) values is 3.0 or less, the KAM values being obtained by: analyzing orientation differences of each of crystal grains by using an EBSD method in a measurement area of 10000 &#x3bc;m<sup>2 </sup>or more in a step of a measurement interval of 0.25 &#x3bc;m, excluding measurement points having a CI value of 0.1 or less; calculating an average crystal grain size A by using area fraction, regions between neighboring measurement points where the orientation differences therebetween is 15&#xb0; or more being defined as crystal grain boundaries; measuring the orientation differences in a step of a measurement interval that is 1/10 or less of the average crystal grain size A; analyzing the orientation differences of each of the crystal grains in a plurality of view fields including 1000 or more of the crystal grains in total, each of the view fields having 10000 um<sup>2 </sup>or more of a measurement area, excluding measurement points where a CI value analyzed with data analysis software OIM is 0.1 or less; obtaining the KAM values as values when grain boundaries are defined as boundaries having 5&#xb0; or more of orientation differences between neighboring pixels.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0015">According to the copper alloy having this configuration, since the Mg, Ag, and P contents are specified as described above, and the average value of the KAM values is specified to 3.0 or less, it is possible to improve the stress relaxation resistance without significantly decreasing the electrical conductivity, and it becomes possible to achieve both high electrical conductivity of 90% IACS or more and excellent stress relaxation resistance.

When Mg is caused to form solid solutions in the matrix, excellent bendability can be obtained.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0048">In a case where the Mg content is less than 70 mass ppm, there is a concern that it may become impossible to sufficiently exhibit the action effect. On the other hand, in a case where the Mg content exceeds 400 mass ppm, there is a concern that the electrical conductivity may decrease.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0049">Based on what has been described above, in the present embodiment, the Mg content is set in a range of 70 mass ppm or more and 400 mass ppm or less.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0050">In order to further improve the strength and the stress relaxation resistance, the Mg content is preferably set to 100 mass ppm or more, more preferably set to 150 mass ppm or more, still more preferably set to 200 mass ppm or more, and far still more preferably set to 250 mass ppm or more. In order to reliably suppress a decrease in the electrical conductivity, the Mg content is preferably set to 380 mass ppm or less, more preferably set to 360 mass ppm or less, and still more preferably set to 350 mass ppm or less.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0051">(Ag: 5 mass ppm or more and 20 mass ppm or less)</p><p id="p-0052" num="0052">Ag is barely capable of forming solid solutions in the matrix of Cu within an operating temperature range of ordinary electric or electronic devices of 250&#xb0; C. or lower. Therefore, Ag added in a small amount to copper segregates in the vicinities of grain boundaries. This hinders the migration of atoms in the grain boundaries and suppresses grain boundary diffusion, and thus the stress relaxation resistance improves.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0053">In a case where the Ag content is less than 5 mass ppm, there is a concern that it may become impossible to sufficiently exhibit the action effect. On the other hand, in a case where the Ag content exceeds 20 mass ppm, the electrical conductivity decreases and the cost increases.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0054">Based on what has been described above, in the present embodiment, the Ag content is set in a range of 5 mass ppm or more and 20 mass ppm or less.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0055">In order to further improve the stress relaxation resistance, the Ag content is preferably set to 6 mass ppm or more, more preferably set to 7 mass ppm or more, and still more preferably set to 8 mass ppm or more. In order to reliably suppress a decrease in the electrical conductivity and an increase in the cost, the Ag content is preferably set to 18 mass ppm or less, more preferably set to 16 mass ppm or less, and still more preferably set to 14 mass ppm or less.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0056">(P:Less than 3.0 mass ppm)</p><p id="p-0057" num="0057">P that is contained in copper promotes the recrystallization of some crystal grains during a heat treatment at a high temperature and forms coarse crystal grains. When coarse crystal grains are present, the rough skin of the surface becomes large during bending, and stress concentrates in that portion, and thus the bendability deteriorates. Furthermore, P reacts with Mg to form crystals during casting and acts as an origin of fracture during working, which makes it easy for breaking to occur during cold working or bending.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0058">Based on what has been described above, in the present embodiment, the P content is limited to less than 3.0 mass ppm.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0059">The P content is preferably less than 2.5 mass ppm and more preferably less than 2.0 mass ppm.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0060">(Inevitable impurities)</p><p id="p-0061" num="0061">As inevitable impurities other than the above-described elements, Al, B, Ba, Be, Bi, Ca, Cd, Cr, Sc, rare earth elements, V, Nb, Ta, Mo, Ni, W, Mn, Re, Fe, Se, Te, Ru, Sr, Ti, Os, Co, Rh, Ir, Pb, Pd, Pt, Au, Zn, Zr, Hf, Hg, Ga, In, Ge, Y, As, Sb, Tl, N, C, Si, Sn, Li, H, O, S, and the like are exemplary examples. These inevitable impurities are preferably as little as possible since there is a concern that the inevitable impurities may decrease the electrical conductivity.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0062">(KAM (Kernel Average Misorientation) Value)</p><p id="p-0063" num="0063">The KAM (Kernel average misorientation) value that is measured by EBSD is a value calculated by averaging the orientation differences between one pixel and pixels surrounding the above-described pixel. Since the shape of the pixel is a regular hexagon, in a case where the proximity order is set to 1 (1st), the average value of the orientation differences with six neighboring pixels is calculated as the KAM value. The use of this KAM value makes it possible to visualize local orientation differences, that is, the distribution of strain.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0064">Since a region where this KAM value is high is a region where the density of dislocations introduced during working (GN dislocations) is high, high-speed diffusion of atoms through the dislocations as paths is likely to occur, and stress relaxation is likely to occur. Therefore, when the average value of the KAM values is controlled to 3.0 or less, it becomes possible to improve the stress relaxation resistance while maintaining the yield strength.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0065">The average value of the KAM values is, even within the above-described range, preferably 2.8 or less and more preferably 2.6 or less.

The CI value is calculated using a Voting method at the time of indexing an EBSD pattern obtained from a certain analysis point and has a value of 0 to 1. Since the CI value is a value that evaluates the reliability of indexing and orientation calculation, in a case where the CI value is low, that is, a clear crystal pattern cannot be obtained at the analysis point, it can be said that strain (worked texture) is present in the texture. In a case where strain is particularly large, the CI value has a value of 0.1 or less.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0067">(Electrical Conductivity: 90% IACS or More) In the copper alloy that is the present embodiment, the electrical conductivity is 90% IACS or more.
