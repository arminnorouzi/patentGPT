The electronic device <b>100</b> can access the memory card <b>200</b>. The electronic device <b>100</b> includes a circuit board <b>105</b>, as well as a processing unit <b>110</b>, a memory card access module <b>120</b>, and a memory card slot <b>130</b> that are disposed on the circuit board <b>105</b>. In some embodiments, the circuit board <b>105</b> is a printed circuit board (PCB) and includes a plurality of signal lines (i.e., printed lines or wires): a signal line <b>141</b>, signal line <b>142</b>, signal line <b>143</b>, and signal line <b>144</b>, which are, for example, arranged on the surface or inside of the PCB. The connection between the processing unit <b>110</b> and the memory card slot <b>130</b> includes the signal line <b>141</b>. The connection between the processing unit <b>110</b> and the memory card access module <b>120</b> includes the signal line <b>142</b>. The connection between the memory card access module <b>120</b> and the memory card slot <b>130</b> includes the signal line <b>143</b> and the signal line <b>144</b>. The memory card slot <b>130</b> allows the insertion of the memory card <b>200</b>. The memory card access module <b>120</b> is coupled between the processing unit <b>110</b> and the memory card slot <b>130</b>. The functions of the memory card access module <b>120</b> include: (1) directly transmitting the control signals (which include but are not limited to read signals, write signals, read addresses, or write addresses) generated by the processing unit <b>110</b> to the memory card <b>200</b>; (2) directly transmitting the data of the memory card <b>200</b> to the processing unit <b>110</b>; and/or (3) converting the formats of the control signals or data prior to transmission. More specifically, the signal line <b>141</b>, the signal line <b>142</b>, and the signal line <b>143</b> conform to the standard of a first signal transmission interface, the signal line <b>144</b> conforms to the standard of a second signal transmission interface, and the standard of the first signal transmission interface is different from the standard of the second signal transmission interface. One of the functions of the memory card access module <b>120</b> is to convert the signals or data from the standard of the first signal transmission interface to the standard of the second signal transmission interface or the other way around. The aforementioned term &#x201c;directly transmitting&#x201d; means that the signals or data are not converted, that is, the signals or data of the first signal transmission interface are still the signals or data of the first signal transmission interface after passing through the memory card access module <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">A signal line conforming to the standard of a signal transmission interface means that the signal line has a specific number of pins, and the signal line must be connected or loaded with capacitors and/or terminal resistors of specific value(s) on the circuit board <b>105</b>. For example, please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, which is a schematic diagram of a circuit board of an electronic device according to an embodiment of the present invention.

Through the conversion of the memory card access module <b>120</b>, the processing unit <b>110</b> can access the memory card <b>200</b> via the signal line <b>142</b>, the memory card access module <b>120</b>, and the signal line <b>144</b>. In other words, when the memory card <b>200</b> is an SD card that does not support the PCIe lane, there is no signal on the signal line <b>141</b> and the signal line <b>143</b> (i.e., no signal is transmitted through the signal line <b>141</b> and the signal line <b>143</b>).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Although the zeroth lane (i.e., the combination of the signal line <b>142</b>, the memory card access module <b>120</b>, and the signal line <b>143</b>) does not match the first lane (i.e., the signal line <b>141</b>) due to the presence of the memory card access module <b>120</b> on the zeroth lane, the equalization (EQ) mechanism of the PCIe protocol (which has been introduced since the third generation) can apply different gains to the signals on the two lanes according to the lane conditions to compensate for the signal attenuation caused by the unmatched components on the lanes. Thus, the SD card supporting two PCIe lanes can be accessed correctly. Furthermore, the de-skew mechanism of the PCIe protocol can compensate for the skew between the two lanes, ensuring the alignment of the data on the two lanes.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some embodiments, the memory card access module <b>120</b> can be embodied by the memory card access module (<b>230</b>) disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> of the U.S. Pat.
