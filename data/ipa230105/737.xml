The safety and efficacy of essential oils in dentistry have been reported in numerous clinical studies. See, e.g., Namrata Dagli, Rushabh Dagli, 1 Rasha Said Mahmoud, and Kusai Baroudi, &#x201c;Essential oils, their therapeutic properties, and implication in dentistry: A Review&#x201d; J Int Soc Prey Community Dent. Vol. 5, No. 5 (2015), pp. 335-340.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The safety and potential for adverse effects from synthetic ingredients, not only for humans but also larger ecosystem, have long been of concern. These issues were brought to the forefront by Rachel Carson, in her 1962 book, Silent Spring, which focused on the impact of pesticides, in particular DDT, on birds. A decade later, in 1973, the United States banned DDT. In that same year, manufacturers and producers of health foods and products began organic certification. Two years later, in 1975, Tom's of Maine introduced what it claimed to be the first mass-marketed &#x201c;natural&#x201d; toothpaste. The ensuing decades saw an explosive growth in demand for natural and organic products grew. By 1990, the organic industry had estimated sales of more than $1 billion. In 2006, Tom's of Maine was acquired by the Colgate-Palmolive Company. In 2015, Whole Foods had expanded to 365 stores and reported record revenues of almost $15.5 billion. While natural personal care products have gained &#x201c;mainstream&#x201d; consumer acceptance, concerns remain. Many so-called &#x201c;natural&#x201d; products are not &#x201c;natural&#x201d;, and contain significant amounts of synthetic ingredients. Other products include &#x201c;natural&#x201d; ingredients at de minimis concentrations, which do not provide health benefits; instead, natural ingredients are added to these products for purposes of &#x201c;label copy&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">As access to the internet became more widespread, consumers took steps to publicly question what is natural, posting blogs and comments calling attention to what can be viewed as deceptive or misleading use of the phrase natural. See, for example, reviews on sites like http://www.naturaltoothpastebrands.com. Additionally, the internet has made do-it-yourself personal product recipes (for skincare, haircare, and oral care) available to consumers. See, for example, http://www.healthyandnaturalworld.com/sage-and-sea-salt-homemade-toothpow-der/(&#xbc; cup fresh sage leaves combined with &#xbe; cup sea salt); see, also, http://www.sproutinghealthyhabits.com/homemade-natural-toothpaste/(2 teaspoons of Dead Sea salt; 3 teaspoons of Himalayan pink salt; 2 teaspoons of ground sage; &#x2153; cup of stevia powder; 7-8 Tablespoons Organic Unrefined Cold Pressed Coconut Oil; 8 drops of tea tree essential oil; 40 drops spear[mint] essential oil; 15 drops of pepper[mint] essential oil; 5 teaspoons of Sodium Bentonite Clay)</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Access to plethora of information on internet is not, however, without risk. Websites content is not subject to review and can be incomplete, inaccurate, or alarmist. Statements that a particular ingredient is &#x201c;toxic&#x201d; are often made without proper context. For example, a 1990 report issued US National Toxicology Program (NTP) reported a higher than expected number of cases of osteosarcoma found &#x201c;equivocal&#x201d; evidence of fluoridated drinking water can cause osteosarcoma in male rats. However, exposure to fluoride has been associated with dental and skeletal fluorosis.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Enamel is a quasi-translucent structure which allows the underlying dentin color to show through. Color of teeth (as perceived by others) is determined by the transparency of the enamel, the color tone of the underlying dentin and any imbedded staining contained between the dentin and the enamel surface. It is also associated with the light scattering and absorption properties of the enamel and dentin.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Tooth discoloration (staining) is multifactorial condition influenced by oral hygiene, diet (foods and beverages that are acidic and/or contain tannins and other chromogenic materials), tobacco usage, and aging. Extrinsic stains appear on the pellicle, the layer of adsorbed salivary proteins and other macromolecules on the dental enamel surface. These stains can be reduced, and future staining can be prevented, through brushing, rinsing and flossing.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Deeper &#x201c;intrinsic&#x201d; staining is caused by long-term accumulation of chromogens within the enamel. Intrinsic staining is typically addressed through professional bleaching procedures (either in-office or at-home). These procedures can include bleaching trays and strips.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Causal factors of xerostomia include disease (Sjogren's syndrome, HIV/AIDS, and diabetes), medication (more than 400 medicines, including for high blood pressure and depression, can cause the salivary glands to make less saliva), radiation therapy (directly damages salivary glands), chemotherapy (thickens saliva, causing the mouth to feel dry), and nerve damage.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention seeks to meet the long-felt but as yet unmet need for natural and naturally derived oral care products (in particular, dentrifices and mouthwashes) that contain safe and effective amounts of natural ingredients useful in cleaning and maintaining healthy, attractive teeth and gums. Products of the present invention are tailored to address sensitivity, xerostomia, as well as provide visibly whiter teeth and fresher/cleaner breath.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Periodontal disease affects not only oral health. Recent research has identified potential linkage with systemic conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, adverse pregnancy outcomes, rheumatic arthritis, aspiration pneumonia and Chronic Obstructive Airways Disease. Periodontal disease is also being investigated as a potential etiological factor in colorectal cancer, oral squamous cell carcinoma, pancreatic cancer and breast cancer.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Mechanical plaque control has limited effectiveness in ensuring oral health; it is arduous, repetitive and time-consuming. For this reason, there exists considerable interest in alternative or adjunct approaches to existing mechanical oral hygiene techniques&#x2014;notably mouthwashes. However, studies report widely varying levels of effectiveness prior art mouthwashes with regard to plaque removal, and reported side-effects include altered taste and discoloration. Prior art mouthwashes that contain chlorhexidine provide excellent short-term plaque control and concomitant improvement in gingival health. However, use of chlorhexidine mouthwashes is limited due to some of its side effects that include tooth staining and taste alterations after longer usage Moreover, chlorhexidine has been shown ex vivo to have a cytotoxic effect on cells. Thus, there is a continued need for new mouthwash formulations for improving plaque control. That need is met by the present invention.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an embodiment of the whitening strip of the present invention [10] attached to a release liner [20].

One method for measuring flexural stiffness of a polymeric strip is ASTM D2923-95, which employs a strain gauge wired to a microammeter. In accordance with this method, the rigidity of the strip is read directly from the microammeter and expressed as grams per centimeter of strip width. A non-limiting, but preferred, instrument for measuring flexural stiffness is HANDLE-0-METER&#xae;, available from Thwing-Albert Instrument Co. of Philadelphia, Pa.</p><p id="p-0220" num="0218">In certain embodiments of the present invention, the strip has a flexural stiffness of less than about 5 grams/cm, preferably a flexural stiffness less than about 4 grams/cm, more preferably less than about 3 grams/cm, and most preferably from about 0.1 grams/cm to about 1 grams/cm.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0219">In certain embodiments, the flexural stiffness of the strip is substantially constant and does not significantly change during normal use. For example, in these embodiments, the strip does not need to be hydrated for the strip to achieve flexural stiffness in the above-specified ranges.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0220">Low flexural stiffness (in the above-specified ranges) is an important property of the strip, which allows the strip to drape over, and conform to, the contoured surfaces of teeth of the wearer's mouth, including gaps between adjacent teeth. By designing strips to have a flexural stiffness within the above-specified ranges, there are minimal residual forces within the strip that would cause it to return to an original (i.e.) starting configuration which is substantially flat.</p><p id="p-0223" num="0221">Additionally, the flexibility (low flexural stiffness) of the strip enables the strip to contact soft tissue over an extended period of time without physical irritation.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0222">The time required for the active ingredients to be deliver to and act upon the teeth surface, and thereby provide a desired clinical outcome&#x2014;whitening and/or decreased sensitivity&#x2014;can range from several minutes to several hours. Accordingly, the second side of the strip (not facing the release liner) is designed to serve as a protective barrier to substantially prevent the whitening composition from coming into contact with saliva as well as the wearer's lips, tongue, and other soft tissue surrounding the teeth (e.g., papilla, marginal gingiva, gingival sulcus, inter dental gingiva, gingival gum structure on lingual and buccal surfaces up to and including muco-gingival junction and the pallet).</p><p id="p-0225" num="0223">The strip may be, and in certain embodiments is, coated with a uniform mixture of Dead Sea Salt, Coconut Oil and Lemon Oil.</p><p id="p-0226" num="0224">The strip may, in certain embodiments, be configured to have shallow recesses to create reservoirs (depots) for the whitening composition of the Invention and/or different oral care products.

The release liner preferably comprises a rigid sheet of material such as polyethylene, paper, polyester, or other material which is then coated with a non-stick type material. The release liner material may be coated with wax, silicone, polyester such as TEFLON&#xae;, fluropolymers, or other non-stick type materials. The release liner material may crack when the strip is flexed.</p><p id="p-0230" num="0228">The release liner may be cut to substantially the same size and shape as the strip or the release liner may be cut larger than the strip to provide a means for separating the release liner from the strip.</p><p id="p-0231" num="0229">The release liner may have a tab, or be scored, to facilitate separation from the strip.

Gingival indices and BOP were significantly reduced after use of either mouthwash, whereas they increased significantly in the absence of a mouthwash regimen.</p><p id="p-0331" num="0329">Comparative Study of Mouthwash of Invention on Oral Biofilm, pH Buffering, Dry Mouth, and Gingival Health</p><p id="p-0332" num="0330">A 3-leg study was conducted on ten patients each of whom was clinically diagnosed with xerostomia. In two legs, subjects used a test or control product for xerostomia intervention; in the third leg, they used no intervention for xerostomia. The &#x201c;test product&#x201d; was a mouthwash of the invention as described above and formulated for use in the treatment of dry mouth. The control product was Biotene.&#x2122;. Dry Mouth Oral Rinse.</p><p id="p-0333" num="0331">The study aims were as follows: (i) Use 2-Tone disclosing solution combined with digital photography and image analysis to quantify biofilm presence at baseline and after 7-day use of a test and a control product, each vs no xerostomia treatment product with a 1-week washout between the 3 legs of the study. (ii) Use conventional clinical indices (PI, mSBI, GI) to quantify gingival health at baseline and after 7-day use of a test and a control product vs no xerostomia treatment product with a 1-week washout between the 3 legs of the study. (iii) Quantify salivary volume, pH and pH-buffering performance at baseline and after each 7-day study leg. (iv) Document subject self-evaluation of dentinal sensitivity at baseline and after 7-day use of a test product and a control agen vs no xerostomia treatment product with a 1-week washout between each of the 3 legs of the study. (v) Document subject self-evaluation for dry mouth using a standardized questionnaire at baseline and after 7-day use of a test product and a control product vs no xerostomia treatment product with a 1-week washout between the 3 legs of the study</p><p id="p-0334" num="0332">Subjects were randomized with regard to sequence of the 3 legs of the study. Subjects also underwent plaque staining and standardized photography at baseline and at the end of each study leg. Digital image analysis was performed to identify plaque age (color-based) and surface coverage in the oral cavity. Plaque Index (PI), Gingival Index (GI) and Sulcus Bleeding Index (mSBI) were recorded at baseline and at the end of each study leg to provide a quantitative measure of gingival health. Salivary volume, pH and buffering capacity were determined by asking the subject to pool saliva in the floor of their mouth for a 5-minute duration, then expectorate the saliva into a sterile collecting cup. During the leg incorporating test and control product use, subjects rinsed with the test/control product. Saliva pooling/expectoration were collected twice, at t=10 and t=40 mins. During the &#x201c;no test product&#x201d; leg, subjects rinsed with water instead. Additionally, subjects completed a standardized self-evaluation questionnaire for dry mouth and dentinal sensitivity at each visit.</p><p id="p-0335" num="0333">The following results were observed:</p><p id="p-0336" num="0334">There was a significant reduction in old and new plaque presence after use of test or control products for 1 week vs no product (p&#x3c;0.05). Old and new plaque levels were similar for the test and the control products (p&#x3e;0.1). Old plaque presence fell to approximately 50% of the baseline value, while new plaque presence was reduced to approximately 60% of the baseline level.</p><p id="p-0337" num="0335">There was a significant reduction in clinical Plaque Index by approx. 60% after use of test or control products for 1 week (p&#x3c;0.05). Generally clinical indices were similar for the test and the control products (p&#x3e;0.1). The reduction in Gingival Index after 7 Days of test or control product use almost reached a significant level (p=0.0563 for test product, p=0.0643 for control product). All other values did not change significantly during the course of this study.</p><p id="p-0338" num="0336">Saliva volume doubled at the end of the test and control study legs, representing a statistically significant increase in each case (p&#x3c;0.05). In the study leg with no intervention, saliva production did not change significantly (p&#x3e;0.1).</p><p id="p-0339" num="0337">PH values did not differ significantly between study legs and time-points (p&#x3e;0.05).</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
