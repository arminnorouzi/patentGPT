The growth and proliferation of low-cost embedded wireless sensors and devices pose a new challenge of high volumes of low bandwidth devices vying for access to limited network resources. One of the primary challenges with these new traffic characteristics is the efficiency at which the shared network resources can be used. For common low bandwidth applications such a GPS tracking, the efficiency (useful/useless data ratio) can often be below 10%. This inefficiency is the result of large volumes of devices communicating in an uncoordinated environment. Addressing this problem is fundamental to the future commercial viability of large-scale sensor network deployments.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is desirable to have methods, apparatuses, and systems for coordinated access to a satellite link using data profiles.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An embodiment includes a method of coordinating access of a plurality of devices across a wireless link.

For at least some embodiments, the data profile allows a range of network access techniques to be simultaneously supported on a hub. This allows, for example, a hub that includes a data device such as a temperature sensor and another data device such as a mobile point of sale terminal to employ multiple data reporting techniques. For at least some embodiments, the data profiles allow routing and management of the data on a per packet level rather than on a data device level. That is, for example, the data profile of a data device may dictate that different packets of the data device may be communicated or reported differently. For example, temperature data (packets) may be reported periodically, but if the temperature exceeds a specified level, the temperature data (packets) is reported in real-time.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">For an embodiment, channel and transmission characteristics are known a priori for deterministic data types which can be used to significantly reduce the overhead on the network spent on passing this information between a hub and a base station. For at least some embodiments, transmissions by a hub of multiple disparate devices can be coordinated by a network management element via the data profiles and synchronization (that is, synchronization between different data devices) of packets provides traffic spreading and reduces the need for random access and other channel contention resources. For at least some embodiments, hub transmission timing can be coordinated between geographically disparate devices to eliminate the contention for shared network resources only for applicable application types such as periodic or schedule data while preserving the flexibility of real time transmissions.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a plurality of hubs <b>110</b>, <b>190</b> that communicate data of data sources <b>111</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>113</b>, <b>114</b>, <b>115</b> through satellite link(s) <b>116</b>, <b>117</b> to a base station <b>140</b>, according to an embodiment. As shown, the data sources <b>111</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>113</b>, <b>114</b>, <b>115</b> are connected to the hubs <b>110</b>, <b>190</b>. The hubs <b>110</b>, <b>190</b> communicate through modems <b>130</b>, <b>132</b> to a modem <b>145</b> of the base station <b>140</b> through the wireless satellite links <b>116</b>, <b>117</b>. The base station may also communicate with outside networks <b>170</b>, <b>180</b>. For an embodiment, the wireless satellite links <b>116</b>, <b>117</b> reflectively pass through a satellite <b>191</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">It is to be understood that the data sources <b>111</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>113</b>, <b>114</b>, <b>115</b> can vary in type, and can each require very different data reporting characteristics. The wireless satellite links <b>116</b>, <b>117</b> links are a limited resource, and the use of this limited resource should be judicious and efficient. In order to efficiently utilize the wireless satellite links <b>116</b>, <b>117</b>, each of the data sources <b>111</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>113</b>, <b>114</b>, <b>115</b> are provided with data profiles (shown as Dev profiles as a profile may be allocated for each device) <b>121</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>123</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>125</b> that coordinate the timing (and/or frequency) of reporting (communication by the hubs <b>110</b>, <b>190</b> to the base station <b>140</b> through the wireless satellite links <b>116</b>, <b>117</b>) of the data provided by the data sources <b>111</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>113</b>, <b>114</b>, <b>115</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">For an embodiment, a network management element <b>150</b> maintains a database <b>160</b> in which the data profiles <b>121</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>123</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>125</b> can be stored and maintained. Further, the network management element <b>150</b> manages the data profiles <b>121</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>123</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>125</b>, wherein the management includes ensuring that synchronization is maintained during the data reporting by the hubs <b>110</b>, <b>190</b> of the data of each of the data sources <b>111</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>113</b>, <b>114</b>, <b>115</b>. That is, the data reported by each hub <b>110</b>, <b>190</b> of the data of the data sources <b>111</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>113</b>, <b>114</b>, <b>115</b> maintains synchronization of the data reporting of each of the data sources <b>111</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>113</b>, <b>114</b>, <b>115</b> relative to each other. Again, the network management element <b>150</b> ensures this synchronization through management of the data profiles <b>121</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>123</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>125</b>. The synchronization between the data sources <b>111</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>113</b>, <b>114</b>, <b>115</b> distributes the timing of the reporting of the data of each of the data sources <b>111</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>113</b>, <b>114</b>, <b>115</b> to prevent the reporting of one device from interfering with the reporting of another device, and provides for efficiency in the data reporting.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">For at least some embodiments, the network management element <b>150</b> resides in a central network location perhaps collocated with multiple base stations and/or co-located with a network operations center (as shown, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). For an embodiment, the network management element <b>150</b> directly communicates with the base station <b>140</b> and initiates the transfer of data profiles across the network via the base station <b>140</b> to the hubs <b>110</b>, <b>190</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">For at least some embodiments, data profiles are distributed when new hubs are brought onto the network, when hubs change ownership, or when the hubs are re-provisioned. Other changes to data profile contents outside of these situations are more likely addressed by sync packets (for an embodiment, a sync packet is a packet to update the value of a specific field inside of a data profile, but not necessarily updating the structure of the data profile) where only small changes to profile fields are required.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">As described, the data profiles <b>121</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>123</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>125</b> control timing of when the hubs <b>110</b>, <b>190</b> communicate the data of the data sources <b>111</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>113</b>, <b>114</b>, <b>115</b> through wireless satellite links <b>116</b>, <b>117</b> (shared resource). Accordingly, the described embodiments coordinate access to the shared network resource (wireless satellite links <b>116</b>, <b>117</b>) to insure optimal usage of the network resource to avoid collisions between packets, the transmission of redundant information, and to reshape undesired traffic profiles.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">For at least some embodiments, the data profiles allow for the elimination of redundant data channel setup information which is already contained inside the data profile, which then are no longer needed to be shared upon the initiation of every packet sent across the network. This information may include the transmission size, sub-carrier (frequency) allocation, MCS (modulation and coding scheme) selection, and timing information. The result of this is a reduction in data resources consumed by the network to send a packet of data. In the example of sending a GPS data packet containing x, y, z, and time, the amount of redundant channel setup information is 8&#xd7; larger than the actual GPS data packet of interest, resulting in a very inefficient network for large volumes of narrowband traffic. Additionally, in the realm of satellite communications, the elimination of unnecessary channel setup messages reduces the latency between the initiation of sending, for example, a GPS packet across the network and actually receiving that packet by roughly half. For example, a normally 3 second latency can be reduced to as low as 0.25 seconds.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows each hub as including more than one data source, it is to be understood that each hub may include a single data source.

For an embodiment, this includes adjusting timing offsets (adjusting the timing offset includes adjusting the relative timing of periodic reporting) to smooth network traffic congestion and maintain network utilization for periodic data below X %, by measuring allocated versus free network resource units. For an embodiment, this includes updating data profiles when changing an application of a data device, triggered by user/owner operator intervention, for example, via a web console.

For an embodiment, this includes the network management element broadcasting rule sets used by hub to control/process the data profile(s). For an embodiment, when a hub receives the profile adaptor, if QOS of the data profile is less than x then the hub changes, for example, the periodicity of periodic transmissions of a data source for a threshold period of time or until another message (such as, another profile adaptor) with a new rule set is received.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">For an embodiment, the rule set includes device dependencies of the data profile. For example, the rule set may include time and location states of the data device dependency of the data profile.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">For an embodiment, the hub collects the data of the data devices, but does not transmit the data until the network management element solicits the hub for data transmission. For an embodiment, the hub informs the network management element of restrictions and/or requirements of the hub or the data device associated with the hub. For example, the hub may be specified by the data profile to transmit once a day, but the hub is available to transmit only at a particular time of the day (for example, 6 pm to 6 am). The hub may inform the network management element about its restrictions/requirements.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">For at least some embodiments, the data profile is used to parse (filter or selectively remove or eliminate) raw data from connected data sources. Most commercially available sensors are designed for terrestrial networks and are often overly verbose (include a large amount of excess data) when transmitting data. A core function of the utilization of the data profile is to understand and map the data schema of a sensor to extract &#x201c;filter&#x201d; only the relevant and most important information. For example, a data report that includes &#x201c;Engine RPM: 3000&#x201d; may be filtered by the data profile of the data device down to &#x201c;3000&#x201d; which is then interpreted in the context of the data profile. That is, for an embodiment, based upon prior information &#x201c;standard reporting of the specific device&#x201d; of the specific data devices the data profile is selected to only transmit the selected datums which are a subset of the standard reporting. This filtering of the reported data intelligently reduces the amount of data reported which reduces the demand on the resource (for example, the wireless link) used by each data device.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">As previously stated, the described embodiments of the data profiles allow for the elimination of redundant data channel setup information which is already contained inside the data profile, and is no longer needed to be shared upon the initiation of every packet sent across the network. This information may include the transmission size, sub-carrier (frequency) allocation, MCS selection, and timing information. The result of this is a reduction in data resources consumed by the network to send a packet of data.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Further, as shown for example by the data profile <b>420</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the data profile includes the ruleset for radio resource allocation. As an example, the ruleset for selecting transmission timing may include integrating forward in time a periodic phase offset the integrated periodicity of periodic reporting.

For an embodiment, the data profile of a data device is used to change, update, or modify link-layer or application layer encryption schemes as a function of a location of the data device, and/or the time of day. It may be desirable, for a data device to maintain a higher level of security of reported data based on the location of the data device, and/or the time of reporting of the data of the data device.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">For an embodiment, the data profile of a data device is used to change, update, or modify muting or attenuation of a transmission signal power of the reported data as a function location of the data device, the time of day, and/or network loading. For at least some embodiments, rulesets of the data profile are used for directing how and when to do channel estimation of the communication channel of the wireless link between the hub of the data device and the base station. For an embodiment, the data profile of the data device controls the timing of the channel estimation based on the application of the data device. For example, a mobile fleet management application may be directed by the device profile to do channel estimation more often (and/or as a function of velocity) and differently than a stationary agriculture sensor. That is, the channel of a mobile device will change more frequently than a stationary device, and the data profile of the mobile device will direct the communication channel of the mobile data device to be remeasured more frequently. For an embodiment, the rulesets of the data profiles control power management of the hub via satellite transmissions of the hub. As an example, a user case such as fishing where users charge their device every night may utilize higher MCS, less repetitions, more output power to achieve the most efficient and reliable link possible. Other applications such as long-distance trucking may utilize less spectrally efficient methods to transmit their data, but methods which are more energy efficient.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, at least some embodiments include adjusting the data profile for each data source based at least in part on a location of the device, wherein the data profile adjustment mitigates differences in propagation time of communication propagating from each hub to the base station.

For at least some embodiments, the data profiles for the data device include a function to calculate a timing advance based upon the location (for example, GPS location) of the data device, and a static location of the satellite the hub of the data device is wirelessly linked to the base station through.

For an embodiment, the data profile supports multiple data devices with overlapping transmission characteristics. Through management of the data profile, utilization of the wireless link between the hub and the base station can be more efficiently used. That is, transmission overhead, such as, random access transmission, and control message overhead, can be more efficient due to the management of the data profile for multiple data device. If for example, two different data devices have data to be transmitted within a threshold duration of time, a single data profile can be managed for the data devices. The data of the data devices can be merged. For an embodiment, the merging of the data means the data of the different data devices are transmitted from the hub to the base station using a single data blob (for example, a data packet) using a single grant message from the network management element. For an embodiment, the hub adds a proprietary wrapper/header to define data boundaries and associate data to different devices.

For at least some embodiments, different data sources of the hub have different data profiles that include differently controlled timing of communication of data of the different data sources of from the hub to the base station.

However, different data movement manifestations can occur in the context of the application layer. For an embodiment, an application layer transmission mode includes a store and forward mode. For an embodiment, the store and forward mode includes locally storing in memory one or many device datums to aggregate prior to sending the data over the network using one of the link layer mechanisms. The combination of data processing and/or routing and the selection of a link layer transmission mechanism creates an application layer transmission mechanism. For example, data from a sensor of a data device can be collected in a local buffer of the data device until the buffer reaches X capacity and then the data device (as dictated by the data profile of the data device) transmits that data immediately. This is an example of an application layer &#x201c;store and forward&#x201d; mechanism that is built with a real time link layer transmission combined with data storage and processing functions from the data profiles.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">For an embodiment, an application layer transmission mode as defined by the data profile of a data device includes a data pull mode.

For an embodiment, the hub pushes the data profile update to the network management element. For example, when the orientation of the hub is placed upside down, this sensed orientation of the hub can be sensed, and the data profiled of a data device connected to the hub can be adaptively updated to operate in a store and forward mode. For an embodiment, orientation of the hub is sensed and the data profile is updated based on the sensed orientation to affect radio transmission parameters of the wireless communication between the hub and the base station. For example, the orientation of the hub can be detected using a 9-axis IMU (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetic sensor, all sensing 3 orientations). Based on the sensed orientation of the hub, the data profile of the data device connected to the hub is adaptively updated to dictate, for example, the MCS, repetition, and/or other radio parameters to adjust for loss of gain from antenna or other link budget factors that are effected by the orientation of the hub.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">For at least some embodiments, the data profile sets a packet size of communication of data of a data source that is communicated through the wireless link. For an embodiment, the packet size is selected to help reduce overhead&#x2014;and save the shared resource (wireless link). Further, for an embodiment, the selected data profile includes a selected MCS (modulation and coding scheme) based on the data source and the application being served.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">For an embodiment, the packet size and/or list of datums that are transmitted over the network is updated based upon an &#x201c;active/not active&#x201d; flag. For an embodiment, setting the flag may come from directing sensing on the hub (for example, an IMU, GPS, temperature) or may come into the data profile directly from the sensor as a flag. Both sides of the wireless link (hub and base station) need to a priori know the packet size in order to support the wireless communication between the hub and the base station.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">For at least some embodiments, the data profiles include preamble codes, and wherein for real-time communication, the preamble codes are inserted into packets of the data sources to uniquely identify the data source of the packet during real-time communication. At least some embodiments further include the network management element selecting the preamble code for the data source based on a historical analysis of real-time transmission timings of the hub of the data source and other data sources. For an embodiment, different preamble codes are allocated to data sources that historically report within a margin of time, and similar codes are allocated to data sources that historically report at disparate times. For an embodiment, different preamble codes are assigned to data devices base on a QoS (quality of service) to minimize congestion of data traffic been the base station and the hubs.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">At least some embodiments further include processing, by one of more of the hubs, the data of the data source, and communicating the processed data through the wireless link to the base station. For an embodiment, the processing includes filtering the data. An embodiment includes only communicating (reporting) a type of data if a threshold condition is satisfied. For an embodiment, the processing includes synthesizing data of more than one data source. For an embodiment, synthesizing includes combining the data of more than one data source before reporting. For an embodiment, synthesizing includes filtering data of one source based on values of data of a second data source.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows a plurality of hubs <b>910</b>, <b>990</b> that communicate data of data sources <b>911</b>, <b>912</b>, <b>913</b>, <b>914</b>, <b>915</b> through a shared resource to a base station, according to an embodiment.

The hubs <b>910</b>, <b>990</b> communicate through modems <b>930</b>, <b>932</b> to a modem <b>945</b> of the base station <b>940</b> through the wireless links. For an embodiment, the wireless links are a shared resource <b>999</b> that has a limited capacity.

The shared resource <b>999</b> is a limited resource, and the use of this limited resource should be judicious and efficient. In order to efficiently utilize the shared resource <b>999</b>, each of the data sources <b>911</b>, <b>912</b>, <b>913</b>, <b>914</b>, <b>915</b> are provided with data profiles <b>921</b>, <b>922</b>, <b>923</b>, <b>924</b>, <b>925</b> that coordinate the timing (and/or frequency) of reporting (communication by the hubs <b>910</b>, <b>990</b> to the base station <b>940</b> through the shared resource <b>999</b>) of the data provided by the data sources <b>911</b>, <b>912</b>, <b>913</b>, <b>914</b>, <b>915</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">For an embodiment, a network management element <b>950</b> maintains a database <b>960</b> in which the data profiles <b>921</b>, <b>922</b>, <b>923</b>, <b>924</b>, <b>925</b> can be stored and maintained.

Again, the network management element <b>950</b> ensures this synchronization through management of the data profiles <b>921</b>, <b>922</b>, <b>923</b>, <b>924</b>, <b>925</b>. The synchronization between the data sources <b>911</b>, <b>912</b>, <b>913</b>, <b>914</b>, <b>915</b> distributes the timing of the reporting of the data of each of the data sources <b>911</b>, <b>912</b>, <b>913</b>, <b>914</b>, <b>915</b> to prevent the reporting of one device from interfering with the reporting of another device, and provides for efficiency in the data reporting.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">For at least some embodiments, the network management element <b>950</b> resides in a central network location perhaps collocated with multiple base stations and/or co-located with a network operations center (as shown, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>).

Other changes to data profile contents outside of these situations are more likely addressed by sync packets (for an embodiment, a sync packet is a packet to update the value of a specific field inside of a data profile, but not necessarily updating the structure of the data profile) were only small changes to profile fields are required.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">As described, the data profiles <b>921</b>, <b>922</b>, <b>923</b>, <b>924</b>, <b>925</b> control timing of when the hubs <b>910</b>, <b>990</b> communicate the data of the data sources <b>911</b>, <b>912</b>, <b>913</b>, <b>914</b>, <b>915</b> through the shared resource <b>999</b>.
