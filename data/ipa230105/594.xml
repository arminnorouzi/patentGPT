The appliance can include a shell <b>110</b> (e.g., a continuous polymeric shell or a segmented shell) having teeth-receiving cavities <b>111</b> that receive and resiliently reposition the teeth <b>121</b>. An appliance or portion(s) thereof may be indirectly fabricated using a physical model of teeth. For example, an appliance (e.g., polymeric appliance) can be formed using a physical model of teeth and a sheet of suitable layers of polymeric material. In some embodiments, a physical appliance is directly fabricated, e.g., using additive manufacturing techniques, from a digital model of an appliance. An appliance can fit over all teeth present in an upper or lower jaw, or less than all of the teeth. The appliance can be designed specifically to accommodate the teeth of the patient (e.g., the topography of the tooth-receiving cavities matches the topography of the patient's teeth), and may be fabricated based on positive or negative models of the patient's teeth generated by impression, scanning, and the like. Alternatively, the appliance can be a generic appliance configured to receive the teeth, but not necessarily shaped to match the topography of the patient's teeth. In some cases, only certain teeth received by an appliance may be repositioned by the appliance while other teeth can provide a base or anchor region for holding the appliance in place as it applies force against the tooth or teeth targeted for repositioning. In some cases, some or most, and even all, of the teeth may be repositioned at some point during treatment. Teeth that are moved can also serve as a base or anchor for holding the appliance as it is worn by the patient. Typically, no wires or other means may be provided for holding an appliance in place over the teeth. In some cases, however, it may be desirable or necessary to provide individual attachments or other aligner features for controlling force delivery and distribution Exemplary appliances, including those utilized in the Invisalign&#xae; System, are described in numerous patents and patent applications assigned to Align Technology, Inc. including, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,450,807, and 5,975,893, as well as on the company's website, which is accessible on the World Wide Web (see, e.g., the url &#x201c;invisalign.com&#x201d;). Examples of tooth-mounted attachments suitable for use with orthodontic appliances are also described in patents and patent applications assigned to Align Technology, Inc., including, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,309,215 and 6,830,450.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Optionally, in cases involving more complex movements or treatment plans, it may be beneficial to utilize auxiliary components (e.g., features, accessories, structures, devices, components, and the like) in conjunction with an orthodontic appliance. Examples of such accessories include but are not limited to elastics, wires, springs, bars, arch expanders, palatal expanders, twin blocks, occlusal blocks, bite ramps, mandibular advancement splints, bite plates, pontics, hooks, brackets, headgear tubes, springs, bumper tubes, palatal bars, frameworks, pin-and-tube apparatuses, buccal shields, buccinator bows, wire shields, lingual flanges and pads, lip pads or bumpers, protrusions, divots, and the like. Additional examples of accessories include but are not limited to opposing arch features, occlusal features, torsional rigidity features, occlusal cusp, and bridges. In some embodiments, the appliances, systems and methods described herein include improved orthodontic appliances with integrally formed features that are shaped to couple to such auxiliary components, or that replace such auxiliary components.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrates a tooth repositioning system <b>110</b> including a plurality of appliances <b>112</b>, <b>114</b>, <b>116</b>. Any of the appliances described herein can be designed and/or provided as part of a set of a plurality of appliances used in a tooth repositioning system. Each appliance may be configured so a tooth-receiving cavity has a geometry corresponding to an intermediate or final tooth arrangement intended for the appliance. The patient's teeth can be progressively repositioned from an initial tooth arrangement towards a target tooth arrangement by placing a series of incremental position adjustment appliances over the patient's teeth. For example, the tooth repositioning system <b>110</b> can include a first appliance <b>112</b> corresponding to an initial tooth arrangement, one or more intermediate appliances <b>114</b> corresponding to one or more intermediate arrangements, and a final appliance <b>116</b> corresponding to a target arrangement. A target tooth arrangement can be a planned final tooth arrangement selected for the patient's teeth at the end of all planned orthodontic treatment. Alternatively, a target arrangement can be one of some intermediate arrangements for the patient's teeth during the course of orthodontic treatment, which may include various different treatment scenarios, including, but not limited to, instances where surgery is recommended, where interproximal reduction (IPR) is appropriate, where a progress check is scheduled, where anchor placement is best, where palatal expansion is desirable, where restorative dentistry is involved (e.g., inlays, onlays, crowns, bridges, implants, veneers, and the like), etc. As such, it is understood that a target tooth arrangement can be any planned resulting arrangement for the patient's teeth that follows one or more incremental repositioning stages. Likewise, an initial tooth arrangement can be any initial arrangement for the patient's teeth that is followed by one or more incremental repositioning stages.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> illustrates a method <b>150</b> of orthodontic treatment using a plurality of appliances, in accordance with embodiments. The method <b>150</b> can be practiced using any of the appliances or appliance sets described herein. In step <b>160</b>, a first orthodontic appliance is applied to a patient's teeth in order to reposition the teeth from a first tooth arrangement to a second tooth arrangement. In step <b>170</b>, a second orthodontic appliance is applied to the patient's teeth in order to reposition the teeth from the second tooth arrangement to a third tooth arrangement. The method <b>150</b> can be repeated as necessary using any suitable number and combination of sequential appliances in order to incrementally reposition the patient's teeth from an initial arrangement towards a target arrangement. The appliances can be generated all at the same stage or in sets or batches (e.g., at the beginning of a stage of the treatment), or the appliances can be fabricated one at a time, and the patient can wear each appliance until the pressure of each appliance on the teeth can no longer be felt or until the maximum amount of expressed tooth movement for that given stage has been achieved. A plurality of different appliances (e.g., a set) can be designed and even fabricated prior to the patient wearing any appliance of the plurality. After wearing an appliance for an appropriate period of time, the patient can replace the current appliance with the next appliance in the series until no more appliances remain. The appliances are generally not affixed to the teeth and the patient may place and replace the appliances at any time during the procedure (e.g., patient-removable appliances). The final appliance or several appliances in the series may have a geometry or geometries selected to overcorrect the tooth arrangement. For instance, one or more appliances may have a geometry that would (if fully achieved) move individual teeth beyond the tooth arrangement that has been selected as the &#x201c;final.&#x201d; Such over-correction may be desirable in order to offset potential relapse after the repositioning method has been terminated (e.g., permit movement of individual teeth back toward their pre-corrected positions). Over-correction may also be beneficial to speed the rate of correction (e.g., an appliance with a geometry that is positioned beyond a desired intermediate or final position may shift the individual teeth toward the position at a greater rate). In such cases, the use of an appliance can be terminated before the teeth reach the positions defined by the appliance. Furthermore, over-correction may be deliberately applied in order to compensate for any inaccuracies or limitations of the appliance.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The various embodiments of the orthodontic appliances presented herein can be fabricated in a wide variety of ways. In some embodiments, the orthodontic appliances herein (or portions thereof) can be produced using direct fabrication, such as additive manufacturing techniques (also referred to herein as &#x201c;3D printing) or subtractive manufacturing techniques (e.g., milling). In some embodiments, direct fabrication involves forming an object (e.g., an orthodontic appliance or a portion thereof) without using a physical template (e.g., mold, mask etc.) to define the object geometry. For example, stereolithography can be used to directly fabricate one or more of the appliances herein. In some embodiments, stereolithography involves selective polymerization of a photosensitive resin (e.g., a photopolymer) according to a desired cross-sectional shape using light (e.g., ultraviolet light). The object geometry can be built up in a layer-by-layer fashion by sequentially polymerizing a plurality of object cross-sections. As another example, the appliances herein can be directly fabricated using selective laser sintering. In some embodiments, selective laser sintering involves using a laser beam to selectively melt and fuse a layer of powdered material according to a desired cross-sectional shape in order to build up the object geometry. As yet another example, the appliances herein can be directly fabricated by fused deposition modeling. In some embodiments, fused deposition modeling involves melting and selectively depositing a thin filament of thermoplastic polymer in a layer-by-layer manner in order to form an object. In yet another example, material jetting can be used to directly fabricate the appliances herein. In some embodiments, material jetting involves jetting or extruding one or more materials onto a build surface in order to form successive layers of the object geometry.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some embodiments, the direct fabrication methods provided herein build up the object geometry in a layer-by-layer fashion, with successive layers being formed in discrete build steps. Alternatively or in combination, direct fabrication methods that allow for continuous build-up of an object's geometry can be used, referred to herein as &#x201c;continuous direct fabrication.&#x201d; Various types of continuous direct fabrication methods can be used. Continuous liquid interphase printing is described in U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 2015/0097315, 2015/0097316, and 2015/0102532, the disclosures of each of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">As another example, a continuous direct fabrication method can achieve continuous build-up of an object geometry by continuous movement of the build platform (e.g., along the vertical or Z-direction) during the irradiation phase, such that the hardening depth of the irradiated photopolymer is controlled by the movement speed. Accordingly, continuous polymerization of material on the build surface can be achieved. Such methods are described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,892,474, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In another example, a continuous direct fabrication method can involve extruding a composite material composed of a curable liquid material surrounding a solid strand. The composite material can be extruded along a continuous three-dimensional path in order to form the object. Such methods are described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2014/0061974, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In yet another example, a continuous direct fabrication method utilizes a &#x201c;heliolithography&#x201d; approach in which the liquid photopolymer is cured with focused radiation while the build platform is continuously rotated and raised. Accordingly, the object geometry can be continuously built up along a spiral build path. Such methods are described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2014/0265034, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some embodiments, relatively rigid portions of the orthodontic appliance can be formed via direct fabrication using one or more of the following materials: a polyester, a co-polyester, a polycarbonate, a thermoplastic polyurethane, a polypropylene, a polyethylene, a polypropylene and polyethylene copolymer, an acrylic, a cyclic block copolymer, a polyetheretherketone, a polyamide, a polyethylene terephthalate, a polybutylene terephthalate, a polyetherimide, a polyethersulfone, and/or a polytrimethylene terephthalate.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some embodiments, relatively elastic portions of the orthodontic appliance can be formed via direct fabrication using one or more of the following materials: a styrenic block copolymer (SBC), a silicone rubber, an elastomeric alloy, a thermoplastic elastomer (TPE), a thermoplastic vulcanizate (TPV) elastomer, a polyurethane elastomer, a block copolymer elastomer, a polyolefin blend elastomer, a thermoplastic co-polyester elastomer, and/or a thermoplastic polyamide elastomer.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Optionally, the direct fabrication methods described herein allow for fabrication of an appliance including multiple materials, referred to herein as &#x201c;multi-material direct fabrication.&#x201d; In some embodiments, a multi-material direct fabrication method involves concurrently forming an object from multiple materials in a single manufacturing step using the same fabrication machine and method. For instance, a multi-tip extrusion apparatus can be used to selectively dispense multiple types of materials (e.g., resins, liquids, solids, or combinations thereof) from distinct material supply sources in order to fabricate an object from a plurality of different materials. Such methods are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,749,414, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Alternatively or in combination, a multi-material direct fabrication method can involve forming an object from multiple materials in a plurality of sequential manufacturing steps. For instance, a first portion of the object can be formed from a first material in accordance with any of the direct fabrication methods herein, then a second portion of the object can be formed from a second material in accordance with methods herein, and so on, until the entirety of the object has been formed.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In many embodiments, post-processing of appliances includes cleaning, post-curing, and/or support removal processes. Relevant post-processing parameters can include purity of cleaning agent, cleaning pressure and/or temperature, cleaning time, post-curing energy and/or time, and/or consistency of support removal process. These parameters can be measured and adjusted as part of a process control scheme. In addition, appliance physical properties can be varied by modifying the post-processing parameters. Adjusting post-processing machine parameters can provide another way to compensate for variability in material properties and/or machine properties.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Although various embodiments herein are described with respect to direct fabrication techniques, it shall be appreciated that other techniques can also be used, such as indirect fabrication techniques. In some embodiments, the appliances herein (or portions thereof) can be produced using indirect fabrication techniques, such as by thermoforming over a positive or negative mold. Indirect fabrication of an orthodontic appliance can involve one or more of the following steps: producing a positive or negative mold of the patient's dentition in a target arrangement (e.g., by additive manufacturing, milling, etc.), thermoforming one or more sheets of material over the mold in order to generate an appliance shell, forming one or more structures in the shell (e.g., by cutting, etching, etc.), and/or coupling one or more components to the shell (e.g., by extrusion, additive manufacturing, spraying, thermoforming, adhesives, bonding, fasteners, etc.). Optionally, one or more auxiliary appliance components as described herein (e.g., elastics, wires, springs, bars, arch expanders, palatal expanders, twin blocks, occlusal blocks, bite ramps, mandibular advancement splints, bite plates, pontics, hooks, brackets, headgear tubes, bumper tubes, palatal bars, frameworks, pin-and-tube apparatuses, buccal shields, buccinator bows, wire shields, lingual flanges and pads, lip pads or bumpers, protrusions, divots, etc.) are formed separately from and coupled to the appliance shell (e.g., via adhesives, bonding, fasteners, mounting features, etc.) after the shell has been fabricated.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some embodiments, the orthodontic appliances herein can be fabricated using a combination of direct and indirect fabrication techniques, such that different portions of an appliance can be fabricated using different fabrication techniques and assembled in order to form the final appliance. For example, an appliance shell can be formed by indirect fabrication (e.g., thermoforming), and one or more structures or components as described herein (e.g., auxiliary components, power arms, etc.) can be added to the shell by direct fabrication (e.g., printing onto the shell).</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The configuration of the orthodontic appliances herein can be determined according to a treatment plan for a patient, e.g., a treatment plan involving successive administration of a plurality of appliances for incrementally repositioning teeth. Computer-based treatment planning and/or appliance manufacturing methods can be used in order to facilitate the design and fabrication of appliances. For instance, one or more of the appliance components described herein can be digitally designed and fabricated with the aid of computer-controlled manufacturing devices (e.g., computer numerical control (CNC) milling, computer-controlled additive manufacturing such as 3D printing, etc.). The computer-based methods presented herein can improve the accuracy, flexibility, and convenience of appliance fabrication.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In some embodiments, computer-based 3-dimensional planning/design tools, such as Treat&#x2122; software from Align Technology, Inc., may be used to design and fabricate the orthodontic appliances described herein.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a method <b>200</b> for designing an orthodontic appliance to be fabricated, in accordance with embodiments. The method <b>200</b> can be applied to any embodiment of the orthodontic appliances described herein. Some or all of the steps of the method <b>200</b> can be performed by any suitable data processing system or device, e.g., one or more processors configured with suitable instructions.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In step <b>210</b>, a movement path to move one or more teeth from an initial arrangement to a target arrangement is determined. The initial arrangement can be determined from a mold or a scan of the patient's teeth or mouth tissue, e.g., using wax bites, direct contact scanning, x-ray imaging, tomographic imaging, sonographic imaging, and other techniques for obtaining information about the position and structure of the teeth, jaws, gums and other orthodontically relevant tissue. From the obtained data, a digital data set can be derived that represents the initial (e.g., pretreatment) arrangement of the patient's teeth and other tissues. Optionally, the initial digital data set is processed to segment the tissue constituents from each other. For example, data structures that digitally represent individual tooth crowns can be produced. Advantageously, digital models of entire teeth can be produced, including measured or extrapolated hidden surfaces and root structures, as well as surrounding bone and soft tissue.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The target arrangement of the teeth (e.g., a desired and intended end result of orthodontic treatment) can be received from a clinician in the form of a prescription, can be calculated from basic orthodontic principles, and/or can be extrapolated computationally from a clinical prescription. With a specification of the desired final positions of the teeth and a digital representation of the teeth themselves, the final position and surface geometry of each tooth can be specified to form a complete model of the tooth arrangement at the desired end of treatment.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Having both an initial position and a target position for each tooth, a movement path can be defined for the motion of each tooth. In some embodiments, the movement paths are configured to move the teeth in the quickest fashion with the least amount of round-tripping to bring the teeth from their initial positions to their desired target positions. The tooth paths can optionally be segmented, and the segments can be calculated so that each tooth's motion within a segment stays within threshold limits of linear and rotational translation. In this way, the end points of each path segment can constitute a clinically viable repositioning, and the aggregate of segment end points can constitute a clinically viable sequence of tooth positions, so that moving from one point to the next in the sequence does not result in a collision of teeth.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In step <b>220</b>, a force system to produce movement of the one or more teeth along the movement path is determined. A force system can include one or more forces and/or one or more torques. Different force systems can result in different types of tooth movement, such as tipping, translation, rotation, extrusion, intrusion, root movement, etc. Biomechanical principles, modeling techniques, force calculation/measurement techniques, and the like, including knowledge and approaches commonly used in orthodontia, may be used to determine the appropriate force system to be applied to the tooth to accomplish the tooth movement. In determining the force system to be applied, sources may be considered including literature, force systems determined by experimentation or virtual modeling, computer-based modeling, clinical experience, minimization of unwanted forces, etc.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Determination of the force system can be performed in a variety of ways. For example, in some embodiments, the force system is determined on a patient-by-patient basis, e.g., using patient-specific data. Alternatively or in combination, the force system can be determined based on a generalized model of tooth movement (e.g., based on experimentation, modeling, clinical data, etc.), such that patient-specific data is not necessarily used. In some embodiments, determination of a force system involves calculating specific force values to be applied to one or more teeth to produce a particular movement. Alternatively, determination of a force system can be performed at a high level without calculating specific force values for the teeth. For instance, step <b>220</b> can involve determining a particular type of force to be applied (e.g., extrusive force, intrusive force, translational force, rotational force, tipping force, torqueing force, etc.) without calculating the specific magnitude and/or direction of the force.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In step <b>230</b>, an appliance geometry and/or material composition for an orthodontic appliance configured to produce the force system is determined. The appliance can be any embodiment of the appliances discussed herein, such as an appliance having variable localized properties, integrally formed components, and/or power arms.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">For example, in some embodiments, the appliance comprises a heterogeneous thickness, a heterogeneous stiffness, or a heterogeneous material composition. In some embodiments, the appliance comprises two or more of a heterogeneous thickness, a heterogeneous stiffness, or a heterogeneous material composition. In some embodiments, the appliance comprises a heterogeneous thickness, a heterogeneous stiffness, and a heterogeneous material composition. The heterogeneous thickness, stiffness, and/or material composition can be configured to produce the force system for moving the teeth, e.g., by preferentially applying forces at certain locations on the teeth. For example, an appliance with heterogeneous thickness can include thicker portions that apply more force on the teeth than thinner portions. As another example, an appliance with heterogeneous stiffness can include stiffer portions that apply more force on the teeth than more elastic portions. Variations in stiffness can be achieved by varying the appliance thickness, material composition, and/or degree of photopolymerization, as described herein.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In some embodiments, determining the appliance geometry and/or material composition comprises determining the geometry and/or material composition of one or more integrally formed components to be directly fabricated with an appliance shell. The integrally formed component can be any of the embodiments described herein. The geometry and/or material composition of the integrally formed component(s) can be selected to facilitate application of the force system onto the patient's teeth. The material composition of the integrally formed component can be the same as or different from the material composition of the shell.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In some embodiments, determining the appliance geometry comprises determining the geometry for a customized aligner-teeth geometric interference.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The step <b>230</b> can involve analyzing the desired force system in order to determine an appliance geometry and material composition that would produce the force system. In some embodiments, the analysis involves determining appliance properties (e.g., stiffness) at one or more locations that would produce a desired force at the one or more locations. The analysis can then involve determining an appliance geometry and material composition at the one or more locations to achieve the specified properties. Determination of the appliance geometry and material composition can be performed using a treatment or force application simulation environment. A simulation environment can include, e.g., computer modeling systems, biomechanical systems or apparatus, and the like. Optionally, digital models of the appliance and/or teeth can be produced, such as finite element models. The finite element models can be created using computer program application software available from a variety of vendors. For creating solid geometry models, computer aided engineering (CAE) or computer aided design (CAD) programs can be used, such as the AutoCAD&#xae; software products available from Autodesk, Inc., of San Rafael, Calif. For creating finite element models and analyzing them, program products from a number of vendors can be used, including finite element analysis packages from ANSYS, Inc., of Canonsburg, Pa., and SIMULIA (Abaqus) software products from Dassault Syst&#xe8;mes of Waltham, Mass.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Optionally, one or more appliance geometries and material compositions can be selected for testing or force modeling. As noted above, a desired tooth movement, as well as a force system required or desired for eliciting the desired tooth movement, can be identified. Using the simulation environment, a candidate appliance geometry and composition can be analyzed or modeled for determination of an actual force system resulting from use of the candidate appliance. One or more modifications can optionally be made to a candidate appliance, and force modeling can be further analyzed as described, e.g., in order to iteratively determine an appliance design that produces the desired force system.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Optionally, step <b>230</b> can further involve determining the geometry of one or more auxiliary components to be used in combination with the orthodontic appliance in order to exert the force system on the one or more teeth. Such auxiliaries can include one or more of tooth-mounted attachments, elastics, wires, springs, bite blocks, arch expanders, wire-and-bracket appliances, shell appliances, headgear, or any other orthodontic device or system that can be used in conjunction with the orthodontic appliances herein. The use of such auxiliary components may be advantageous in situations where it is difficult for the appliance alone to produce the force system. Additionally, auxiliary components can be added to the orthodontic appliance in order to provide other desired functionalities besides producing the force system, such as mandibular advancement splints to treat sleep apnea, pontics to improve aesthetic appearance, and so on. In some embodiments, the auxiliary components are fabricated and provided separately from the orthodontic appliance. Alternatively, the geometry of the orthodontic appliance can be modified to include one or more auxiliary components as integrally formed components.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In step <b>240</b>, instructions for fabrication of the orthodontic appliance having the appliance geometry and material composition are generated. The instructions can be configured to control a fabrication system or device in order to produce the orthodontic appliance with the specified appliance geometry and material composition. In some embodiments, the instructions are configured for manufacturing the orthodontic appliance using direct fabrication (e.g., stereolithography, selective laser sintering, fused deposition modeling, 3D printing, continuous direct fabrication, multi-material direct fabrication, etc.). Optionally, the instructions can be configured to cause a fabrication machine to directly fabricate the orthodontic appliance with teeth receiving cavities having shapes, positions, and features, as discussed herein. In alternative embodiments, the instructions can be configured for indirect fabrication of the appliance, e.g., by thermoforming.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Although the above steps show a method <b>200</b> of designing an orthodontic appliance in accordance with some embodiments, a person of ordinary skill in the art will recognize some variations based on the teaching described herein. Some of the steps may comprise sub-steps. Some of the steps may be repeated as often as desired. One or more steps of the method <b>200</b> may be performed with any suitable fabrication system or device, such as the embodiments described herein. Some of the steps may be optional, and the order of the steps can be varied as desired.

In some embodiments, instructions stored on a computer readable medium that correspond to the steps in method <b>500</b> are executed by one or more processors, such as the processors shown and described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, which then carries out one or more of the steps of the method <b>500</b>.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">At step <b>502</b>, there may be only one treatment plan that is represented by initial or default settings for a treatment plan. During the steps of the process <b>500</b> one or more treatment plans pass from one step to the next, based on the conditions and actions performed at each step. When a step in the process creates a new branch of the treatment plan, one or more new, additional treatment plans are created. Each new treatment plan may inherit all the previous corrections and treatments indicated in the parent treatment plan, and then each new treatment plan continues through the process <b>500</b> to be modified based on the remaining steps in the process <b>500</b>. In this way, many different treatment plans are generated and evaluated as options for treating a patient. Using a large data set of treatment plans, each being generated for a particular patient with a particular malocclusion, permits the parallel evaluation of a much wider range of potential treatments than previously available and results in proposed treatment plans that may not have been consider or presented to a treating professional in the past, thereby resulting in improved outcomes. Improved outcomes may include shorter treatment time, less invasive treatment, and avoidance of other less desirable treatments.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> to <b>11</b></figref>, the shapes of each process step in the figures indicate the action of each step. Parallelogram shaped steps do not affect treatment plan content, rectangles with rounded corners are actions performed on the plan passing through the block, for example improving overbite or indicating that overbite is to be improved in the treatment plan. Some rectangles with rounded corners are forking steps in which a treatment plan is branched or forked to create one or more new treatment plans having different treatment indications based on the properties of the fork. Each branched treatment plan is passed to the next step in the process.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">In some embodiments, each treatment plan may include an initial position, final (or interim final) position, and settings associated with the treatment of malocclusion elements. In some embodiments, the treatment plan also includes the stages and/or tooth movement paths that move the teeth from the initial position to the final position, while in other embodiments, the treatment plans do not include the stages and tooth movement paths. For example, the tooth movement paths may be generated for the treatment plans at step <b>532</b>.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Rhombus shaped steps are condition steps where a measured tooth position is validated against the plan and depending on the result, the block determines the next step to which the treatment plan flows. For example, if a molar class problem is diagnosed in a treatment plan that passes through step <b>520</b>, then the plan is passed to step <b>522</b>, otherwise, the plan is passed to step <b>524</b>.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Rectangles with stripes at the left and right sides indicate that additional processes or procedures, such as a sub process, are executed for a treatment plan passed to the block.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">In step <b>504</b>, tooth movement restrictions are selected. A dental professional may select teeth that are to remain stationary relative to the other teeth in the mouth. In some embodiments, step <b>504</b>, or at least part of step <b>504</b>, may take place after scanning the teeth in step <b>506</b>. At least some teeth may be selected automatically, based on their condition. For example, a tooth prepared for a crown or bridge, that does not have the crown or bridge applied during scanning may be selected automatically by the system without input from the dental professional. Prepared teeth are generally ill-suited for movement using shell appliances, therefore the system may identify the tooth based on its prepared shape, which does not correspond to the shape of a natural tooth, crown, or bridge.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">In step <b>506</b>, the position of a patient's teeth is measured.

This may include additional measuring of the teeth or groups of teeth either relative to other teeth or relative to other facial structure or features and in various positions. For example, the amount of openbite may be measured based on a model of the upper and lower arches of the patient's teeth in normal occlusion. The amount of overjet of the molars, either positive or negative, may be measured for molar treatment. The amount of overjet or overbite may be measured for determining improvements to overbite. The amount of overjet of the canines may be measured for determining improvements to the position and location of the canines and other corrective measures, such as bicuspid extraction. Still other measurements of the teeth may be made to aid in correcting the malocclusions of a patient, as evidenced by the methods and steps described herein.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In step <b>510</b>, the tooth movement restrictions and other treatment settings may be set, received, or read by the system. For example, the system or process may receive instructions to improve all malocclusions, to restrict interproximal reduction to certain teeth or groups of teeth, and to restrict spaces, e.g., allow or not allow spaces between the one or more of the patient's teeth in the final position. In some embodiments, the treatment planning process continues using only the measured teeth positions and tooth movement restrictions. In some embodiments, the treatment planning process continues using only the measured teeth positions, tooth movement restrictions, and one or more of the settings described herein.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">In step <b>512</b>, the degree of malocclusion for multiple elements of a patient's malocclusion is measured and the system determines whether a treatment branch is formed. The treatment branches may include branches for correction of the elements of a patient's malocclusion, such as openbite, major class problem diagnoses, posterior crossbite, among others may be formed, as shown and described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, below. Each branch may branch a second time, third time, and so on. For example, two branches may be formed based on whether to treat an openbite type malocclusion or maintain the openbite. The openbite treatment branch and the maintain openbite branch may each then branch again based on whether the molar relationship is maintained or improved. The resulting four branches may then branch again based on whether to treat posterior cross bite, and then again based on other malocclusions that may be treated. In this way, multiple clinically distinct plans are generated based, at least in part, on the measured elements of the patient's malocclusion. For each branch, corrections on the final positions of the patient's teeth are determined to treat the corresponding malocclusions.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">In step <b>514</b>, an interim final position for one or more, preferably all, of the treatment plans generated in step <b>512</b> is determined. In some embodiments, rather than determining an interim final position at step <b>514</b> and elsewhere, for example, at steps <b>706</b>, <b>820</b>, <b>926</b>, and other final positions (FiPos) steps, the system stores the setting for each treatment plan without determining the final position and then determines the final positions for each treatment plan branch generated by the system is run later in the process, for example, at step <b>532</b>.

Upon completion of the correction of the bi-protrusion correction process, the process continues to step <b>519</b>.
