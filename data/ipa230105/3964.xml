However, in the case in which the number of lenses is increased as described above, the size of the optical device may be increased.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The auto-focusing function and the hand-shake compensation function are performed by moving or tilting several lenses, which are fixed to a lens holder and are aligned with an optical axis, along the optical axis or in a direction perpendicular to the optical axis, and to this end, a separate lens-driving device is required to drive a lens assembly composed of a plurality of lenses. However, the lens-driving device exhibits high power consumption, and the overall size of the conventional camera module is increased because a cover glass needs to be separately added to the camera module in order to protect the lens-driving device. In order to solve this, research has been conducted on a liquid lens unit, which performs the auto-focusing function and the hand-shake compensation function by electrically adjusting a curvature of an interface of two types of liquids.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, in the liquid lens, a focal length or diopter is deformed according to the temperature, and thus it is necessary to improve the accuracy.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">An embodiment is directed to providing a camera module that includes a lens capable of adjusting a position of an interface positioned between two liquids according to electrical energy and is capable of compensating for a change in a focal length or a diopter caused by deformation occurring according to the temperature of the lens that has a structure in which the two liquids lens can be housed.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">An embodiment is also directed to providing a camera module capable of adjusting a driving voltage that can adjust the movement of an interface, which is formed by two liquids, to correspond to a change in a spatial frequency response (SFR) according to a temperature change of a liquid lens in order to overcome the characteristics and tendency of the liquid lens, in which the degree of curvature and bias of the interface formed by the two liquids included in the lens are adjusted according to a supply voltage and the resolution of the lens is lowered due to deformation according to the temperature change.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Objectives to be solved by the embodiment are not limited to the above-described objective and will include objectives and effects which may be identified by solutions for the objectives and the embodiments described below.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Solution</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">One aspect of the present invention provides a camera module including a lens assembly including a liquid lens having a first liquid and a second liquid that form an interface, a temperature sensor configured to detect temperature information of the liquid lens, a controller configured to adjust the interface by applying a driving signal to the liquid lens, and a compensation unit configured to output feedback information, in which an inclination of a diopter of the liquid lens according to the driving signal is proportional to a temperature in a first region and an inclination of the diopter of the liquid lens according to the driving signal is inversely proportional to the temperature in a second region that is different from the first region, to the controller.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">A characteristic graph of the diopter of the liquid lens according to the driving signal may be divided into the first region and the second region on the basis of a point having an inflection point.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The camera module may further include a data unit configured to store a plurality of first driving signals for each temperature for a first diopter of the liquid lens in the first region, a plurality of second driving signals for each temperature for a second diopter of the liquid lens in the first region, a plurality of third driving signals for each temperature for the first diopter of the liquid lens in the second region, and a plurality of fourth driving signals for each temperature for the second diopter of the liquid lens in the second region, wherein the first diopter and the second diopter are different from each other.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The compensation unit may calculate a first-first driving function for the plurality of first driving signals, a second-first driving function for the plurality of second driving signals, a first-second driving function for the plurality of third driving signals, and a second-second driving function for the plurality of fourth driving signals.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In each of the first-first driving function and the second-first driving function, a curvature may be proportional to the temperature, but in each of the first-second driving function and the second-second driving function, the curvature may be inversely proportional to the temperature.

In addition, the lens assembly may be disposed above the main substrate <b>150</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In addition, in order to distinguish the first lens unit <b>110</b> and the second lens unit <b>130</b> from the liquid lens unit <b>140</b> in the lens assembly, the first lens unit <b>110</b> and the second lens unit <b>130</b> may be referred to as a &#x201c;first solid lens unit&#x201d; and a &#x201c;second solid lens unit,&#x201d; respectively.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The first lens unit <b>110</b> may be disposed on an upper side of the lens assembly and may be a region on which light is incident from the outside of the lens assembly. That is, the first lens unit <b>110</b> may be disposed above the liquid lens unit <b>140</b> in the holder <b>120</b>. The first lens unit <b>110</b> may be implemented as a single lens and may be implemented as two or more lenses that are aligned along a central axis to form an optical system. Here, the central axis may be an optical axis LX of the optical system, which is formed by the first lens unit <b>110</b>, the liquid lens unit <b>140</b>, and the second lens unit <b>130</b> included in the camera module <b>100</b>, and may be an axis parallel to the optical axis LX. The optical axis LX may be the same as an optical axis f of the image sensor <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">That is, the first lens unit <b>110</b>, the liquid lens unit <b>140</b>, the second lens unit <b>130</b>, and the image sensor <b>30</b> may be aligned and disposed along the optical axis LX through active alignment (AA). Here, the active alignment may be an operation of aligning the optical axes of the first lens unit <b>110</b>, the second lens unit <b>130</b>, and the liquid lens unit <b>140</b>, and adjusting an axis relationship or a distance relationship between the image sensor <b>30</b> and the lens units <b>110</b>, <b>130</b>, and <b>140</b> in order to obtain an improved image.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In one embodiment, the active alignment may be performed by an operation of analyzing image data generated by receiving light, which is incident from a specific object, by the image sensor <b>30</b> through at least one of the first lens unit <b>110</b>, the second lens unit <b>130</b>, and the liquid lens unit <b>140</b>. For example, the active alignment may be performed in the following sequence.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">As an example, after active alignment (first alignment) that adjusts relative positions between the first and second lens units <b>110</b> and <b>130</b>, which are fixed and mounted to the holder <b>120</b> and the image sensor <b>30</b>, is completed, active alignment (second alignment) that adjusts relative positions between the liquid lens unit <b>140</b>, which is inserted into the holder <b>120</b>, and the image sensor <b>30</b> may be performed. The first alignment may be performed while a gripper grips the middle base <b>172</b> and moves the middle base to various positions, and the second alignment may be performed while the gripper grips a spacer <b>143</b> of the liquid lens unit <b>140</b> and moves the spacer to various positions. However, the active alignment may be performed in a sequence different from the above-described sequence.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In addition, the holder <b>120</b> may include a holder upper region <b>120</b>U disposed above the liquid lens unit <b>140</b> and a holder lower region <b>120</b>D disposed below the liquid lens unit <b>140</b>. In this case, the first and second adhesive members <b>162</b> and <b>164</b> may respectively couple the holder upper region <b>120</b>U and the holder lower region <b>120</b>D to the liquid lens unit <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In addition, when the first and second adhesive members <b>162</b> and <b>164</b> are disposed, the liquid lens unit <b>140</b> may be stably fixed and coupled to the holder <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Further, the first lens unit <b>110</b> may include, for example, two lenses L<b>1</b> and L<b>2</b>, but this is exemplary, and the number of lenses included in the first lens unit <b>110</b> may be one or more.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In addition, an exposure lens may be disposed on an upper side of the first lens unit <b>110</b>. Here, the exposure lens may mean an outermost lens among the lenses included in the first lens unit <b>110</b>. That is, the lens L<b>1</b> positioned at the uppermost side of the first lens unit <b>110</b> may protrude upward and thus perform a function of the exposure lens. A surface of the exposure lens protrudes to the outside of the holder <b>120</b> and thus may be damaged. When the surface of the exposure lens is damaged, the quality of an image captured by the camera module <b>100</b> may be degraded. Accordingly, in order to inhibit or suppress damage to the surface of the exposure lens, a cover glass may be disposed, or a coating layer may be formed on an upper portion of the exposure lens. Alternatively, in order to inhibit damage to the surface of the exposure lens, the exposure lens may be implemented using a wear-resistant material having higher rigidity than other lenses in the lens unit.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Further, an outer diameter of each of the lenses L<b>1</b> and L<b>2</b> included in the first lens unit <b>110</b> may increase toward a lower portion (e.g., in a &#x2212;z-axis direction), but the embodiment is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Light incident on the first lens unit <b>110</b> from the outside of the camera module <b>100</b> may pass through the liquid lens unit <b>140</b> and may be incident on the second lens unit <b>130</b>. The second lens unit <b>130</b> may be implemented as a single lens or may be implemented as two or more lenses that are aligned along the central axis to form an optical system. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, the second lens unit <b>130</b> may include three lenses L<b>3</b>, L<b>4</b>, and L<b>5</b>, but this is exemplary, and two or less lenses or four or more lenses may be included in the second lens unit <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Further, an outer diameter of each of the lenses L<b>3</b>, L<b>4</b>, and L<b>5</b> included in the second lens unit <b>130</b> may increase toward a lower portion thereof (e.g., in the &#x2212;z-axis direction), but the embodiment is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In addition, unlike the liquid lens unit <b>140</b>, each of the first lens unit <b>110</b> and the second lens unit <b>130</b> may be a solid lens and may be formed of glass or plastic, but the embodiment is not limited to a specific material of each of the first lens unit <b>110</b> and the second lens unit <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Further, the liquid lens unit <b>140</b> may include first to fifth regions A<b>1</b>, A<b>2</b>, A<b>3</b>, A<b>4</b>, and A<b>5</b>. Specifically, the fourth region A<b>4</b> and the fifth region A<b>5</b> are positioned on outermost sides of the camera module <b>100</b>, and the first region A<b>1</b>, the second region A<b>2</b>, and the third region A<b>3</b> may be disposed between the fourth region A<b>4</b> and the fifth region A<b>5</b>. In addition, the third region A<b>3</b> may be disposed between the first region A<b>1</b> and the second region A<b>2</b>. In addition, the first region A<b>1</b> may be disposed between the fourth region A<b>4</b> and the third region A<b>3</b>, and the second region A<b>2</b> may be disposed between the third region A<b>3</b> and the fifth region A<b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In other words, the first region A<b>1</b> and the second region A<b>2</b> may be regions disposed in openings of side surfaces of the holder <b>120</b>. The third region A<b>3</b> may be a region between the first region A<b>1</b> and the second region A<b>2</b>. In addition, the fourth region A<b>4</b> and the fifth region A<b>5</b> are regions that protrude from openings in the holder <b>120</b>, and are regions disposed outside the holder <b>120</b> at the openings.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Hereinafter, the first adhesive member <b>162</b> and the second adhesive member <b>164</b> will be described, and the liquid lens unit <b>140</b> will be described below.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The first adhesive member <b>162</b> may include first and second adhesive portions <b>162</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>162</b>-<b>2</b>, and the second adhesive member <b>164</b> may include third and fourth adhesive portions <b>164</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>164</b>-<b>2</b>. The adhesive portion may include an adhesive, an epoxy, or the like.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">First, the first adhesive portion <b>162</b>-<b>1</b> couples the holder <b>120</b> and an upper surface <b>140</b>TS of the fourth region A<b>4</b> of the liquid lens unit <b>140</b>, and the third adhesive portion <b>164</b>-<b>1</b> couples the holder <b>120</b> and an upper surface of the fifth region A<b>5</b> of the liquid lens unit <b>140</b>. Here the upper surface <b>140</b>TS of each of the fourth region A<b>4</b> and the fifth region A<b>5</b> of the liquid lens unit <b>140</b> is exemplified as being an upper surface of a first connection substrate <b>141</b>, but the embodiment is not limited thereto. For example, when the liquid lens unit <b>140</b> does not include connection substrates <b>141</b> and <b>144</b> or the spacer <b>143</b>, the upper surface of the liquid lens unit <b>140</b> may be an upper surface of a liquid lens <b>142</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Further, the holder <b>120</b> may include a holder upper portion disposed above the liquid lens unit <b>140</b> (or the liquid lens <b>142</b>) and a holder lower portion disposed below the liquid lens unit <b>140</b> (or the liquid lens <b>142</b>). In addition, the holder <b>120</b> may also include a side wall facing a side surface of the liquid lens <b>142</b> or the liquid lens unit <b>140</b>. Each of the first adhesive portion <b>162</b>-<b>1</b> and the third adhesive portion <b>164</b>-<b>1</b> may couple the holder upper region <b>120</b>U and the liquid lens unit <b>140</b>. In this way, each of the first adhesive portion <b>162</b>-<b>1</b> and the third adhesive portion <b>164</b>-<b>1</b> couples the holder <b>120</b> and the liquid lens unit <b>140</b> so that the liquid lens unit <b>140</b> may be fixed to the holder <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Further, the second adhesive portion <b>162</b>-<b>2</b> may couple the holder <b>120</b> and a lower surface and a side surface of the fourth region A<b>4</b> of the liquid lens unit <b>140</b>. Here, the lower surface of the liquid lens unit <b>140</b> is exemplified as being a lower surface of a second connection substrate <b>144</b>, and the side surface of the liquid lens unit <b>140</b> is exemplified as being a side surface of the spacer <b>143</b>, but the embodiment is not limited thereto. For example, when the liquid lens unit <b>140</b> does not include the first and second connection substrates <b>141</b> and <b>144</b> or the spacer <b>143</b>, the lower surface and the side surface of the liquid lens unit <b>140</b> may be the lower surface and the side surface of the liquid lens <b>142</b>, respectively. Similarly, the fourth adhesive portion <b>164</b>-<b>2</b> may couple the holder <b>120</b> and a lower surface and a side surface of the fifth region A<b>5</b> of the liquid lens unit <b>140</b>. Here, the lower surface of the liquid lens unit <b>140</b> may be the lower surface of the second connection substrate <b>144</b>, and the side surface of the liquid lens unit <b>140</b> may be the side surface of the spacer <b>143</b>, but the embodiment is not limited thereto. For example, when the liquid lens unit <b>140</b> does not include the connection substrates <b>141</b> and <b>144</b> or the spacer <b>143</b>, the lower surface and the side surface of the liquid lens unit <b>140</b> may be the lower surface and the side surface of the liquid lens <b>142</b>, respectively.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In addition, each of the second adhesive portion <b>162</b>-<b>2</b> and the fourth adhesive portion <b>164</b>-<b>2</b> may couple the holder lower region <b>120</b>D and the liquid lens unit <b>140</b>. In this way, each of the second adhesive portion <b>162</b>-<b>2</b> and the fourth adhesive portion <b>164</b>-<b>2</b> may couple the holder <b>120</b> and the liquid lens unit <b>140</b> so that the opening of the holder <b>120</b> may be sealed. For example, the first adhesive portion <b>162</b>-<b>1</b> and the second adhesive portion <b>162</b>-<b>2</b> may be connected to each other, and the third adhesive portion <b>164</b>-<b>1</b> and the fourth adhesive portion <b>164</b>-<b>2</b> may be connected to each other, thereby performing the above-described sealing.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Although not shown in the drawings, the third adhesive member <b>166</b> may be disposed to fill a separation space (or gap) between the upper surface of the holder <b>120</b> and the first cover <b>170</b>.
