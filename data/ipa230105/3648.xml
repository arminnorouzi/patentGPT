More specifically, this disclosure relates to luminescence imaging.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The background of the present disclosure is hereinafter introduced with the discussion of techniques relating to its context. However, even when this discussion refers to documents, acts, artifacts and the like, it does not suggest or represent that the discussed techniques are part of the prior art or are common general knowledge in the field relevant to the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Imaging generally relates to a number of techniques that allow acquiring images of objects (typically, not visible directly) in a substantially non-invasive manner. For example, imaging techniques are routinely exploited in equipment for medical applications to inspect (inner) body-parts of patients for diagnostic, therapeutic and/or surgical purposes.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A specific imaging technique increasingly considered is luminescence imaging, and especially fluorescence imaging. Luminescence imaging is based on a luminescence phenomenon, consisting of the emission of light by luminescence substances when subject to any excitation different from heating; particularly, a fluorescence phenomenon occurs in fluorescence substances (called fluorophores), which emit light when they are illuminated (with an intensity depending on an amount of the fluorophores that are illuminated). For example, this phenomenon is leveraged in medical applications by administering fluorescence agents to the patients, and especially targeted fluorescence agents adapted to reaching a specific molecule of a desired target and then to remaining immobilized thereon (for example, thanks to a specific interaction with tumoral tissues).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For this purpose, (fluorescence) imaging apparatuses are used; the imaging apparatuses allow illuminating each object to be imaged (with an excitation light suitable to excite the fluorophores) and to acquire corresponding (fluorescence) images representing the fluorophores present in the object, often together with (photograph) images simply representing the object; particularly, in medical applications the fluorescence images represent the fluorescent agent immobilized on the corresponding target and the photograph images represent the body-parts under analysis.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The imaging apparatuses should be tested to verify their performance. This is especially important in medical applications, wherein the performance of the imagining apparatuses affects corresponding diagnostic, therapeutic and/or surgical results.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The test of the imaging apparatuses may be carried out with specific metering instruments. However, this does not allow verifying an illumination unit and an acquisition unit of the imaging apparatuses simultaneously. Another possibility is of using a curable polyurethane matrix or a composite phantom embedding quantum dots (small particles manufactured in a semiconductor process) in different concentrations, for example, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 9,167,240. However, the quantum dots exhibit a very high absorption of visible light (particularly, far higher than the one of the fluorescence agents typically used in medical applications), so that they may be used to verify the performance of the imaging apparatuses only in environments with controlled illumination.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to test the imaging apparatuses in a close simulation of their actual usage, it is instead possible to use samples of the same fluorophores to be imaged, i.e., the fluorescence agents in medical applications. Several testing devices are available for this purpose. For example, it is possible to use well plates (commonly used in laboratories for other purposes), loosely arranged tubes or capillary tubes being filled with different concentrations of the fluorescence agent. However, these testing devices require manual interventions (for example, on-site preparations and selections of regions of interest in the images), which are inconvenient and error-prone.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Moreover, &#x201c;Setting Standard for Reporting and Quantification in Fluorescence-Guided Surgery&#x201d; by Hoogstings et al., Mol Imaging Biol (2019) 21:11-18 proposes the use of a testing device by SurgVision called CalibrationDisk (trademarks thereof). This testing device is formed by an upper disk (holding eight tubes filled with different concentration of a fluorescence agent) and a base on which the upper disk may rotate.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">US-A-2003/146663 discloses a light calibration device, which comprises an array of low-power light supplies each having a known emission. US-A-2008080781 discloses a fluorescence standard, which has at least two areas with different fluorescent response. US-A-2007/200058 discloses a phantom device, which includes a body and a fluorescent light source internal to the body.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">A simplified summary of the present disclosure is herein presented in order to provide a basic understanding thereof; however, the sole purpose of this summary is to introduce some concepts of the disclosure in a simplified form as a prelude to its following more detailed description, and it is not to be interpreted as an identification of its key elements nor as a delineation of its scope.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In general terms, the present disclosure is based on the idea of detecting the testing device automatically.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Particularly, an aspect provides a method for testing a luminescence imaging apparatus.

The imaging system <b>100</b> comprises a (fluorescence) imaging apparatus <b>105</b> known per se and a testing device <b>110</b> according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The imaging apparatus <b>105</b> is used in medical applications to inspect body-parts of patients (not shown in the figure), for example, for diagnostic, therapeutic and/or surgical purposes. The imaging apparatus <b>105</b> comprises the following components. A trolley <b>115</b> houses a supply unit and a control unit (not visible in the figure) for supplying and controlling, respectively, the imaging apparatus <b>105</b>. Four casters <b>120</b> (only three visible in the figure) are arranged at corresponding lower corners of the trolley <b>115</b> to facilitate moving the imaging apparatus <b>105</b> (with a foot brake, not visible in the figure, that is provided for securing the imaging apparatus <b>105</b> in position). A pillar <b>125</b> extends upwards from a back surface of the trolley <b>115</b>. The pillar <b>125</b> has a handlebar <b>130</b> for moving the imaging apparatus <b>105</b> by an operator thereof. A cantilever <b>135</b> projects from the pillar <b>125</b>, above the trolley <b>115</b>. A primary monitor <b>140</b> (for displaying images to the operator) and a keyboard with a pointing device such as a mouse or a trackball <b>145</b> (for entering information/commands by the operator) are mounted on the cantilever <b>135</b>. A pivoting arm <b>150</b> is mounted on top of the pillar <b>125</b> (above the cantilever <b>135</b>). A secondary monitor <b>155</b> (for displaying images to a doctor, such as a surgeon) is mounted on the pivoting arm <b>150</b> (so as to allow turning it in either directions). An articulated arm <b>160</b> is mounted on top of the pillar <b>125</b> as well (next to the pivoting arm <b>150</b>). An imaging head <b>165</b> (for imaging a scene within its field of view, and particularly the body-parts under analysis) is suspended from the articulated arm <b>160</b>. The imaging head <b>165</b> is provided with two handlebars <b>170</b> for positioning it by the operator.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The testing device <b>110</b> is used to test the imaging apparatus <b>105</b> for verifying its performance. For example, the test is aimed at calibrating the imaging apparatus <b>105</b>, at ensuring that the imaging apparatus <b>105</b> operates correctly, at monitoring operation of the imaging apparatus <b>105</b> over time and/or at comparing the imaging apparatus <b>105</b> with different ones. For this purpose, the testing device <b>110</b> is rested on a supporting surface <b>175</b>, so as to be positioned within the field of view of the imaging head <b>165</b>; particularly, in the exemplary implementation shown in the figure the supporting surface <b>175</b> is defined by a top surface of the trolley <b>115</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a schematic block diagram is shown of the imaging apparatus <b>105</b> that may be used to practice the solution according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Particularly, the figure shows a functional structure of the imaging head <b>165</b> and of the control unit, denoted with the reference <b>205</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Starting from the imaging head <b>165</b>, it has an illumination unit and an acquisition unit for illuminating the scene in its field of view and for acquiring images thereof, respectively.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The illumination unit comprises the following components. An excitation light source <b>210</b> and a white light source <b>215</b> generate an excitation light and a white light, respectively. The excitation light has wavelength and energy suitable to excite the fluorophores of the fluorescence agent (such as of Near Infra-Red, or NIR, type), whereas the white light appears substantially colorless to the human eye (such as containing all the wavelengths of the spectrum that is visible to the human eye at equal intensity). Corresponding delivery optics <b>220</b> and delivery optics <b>225</b> deliver the excitation light and the white light, respectively, to the (same) field of view of the imaging head <b>165</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The acquisition unit comprises the following components. Collection optics <b>230</b> collect light from the field of view (in an epi-illumination geometry). The collected light comprises fluorescence light that is emitted by any fluorophores present in the field of view. Indeed, the fluorophores pass to an excited (electronic) state when they absorb the excitation light; the excited state is unstable, so that the fluorophores very shortly decay therefrom to a ground (electronic) state, thereby emitting the fluorescence light (at a characteristic wavelength, longer than the one of the excitation light because of energy dissipated as heat in the excited state) with an intensity depending on an amount of the fluorophores that are illuminated. Moreover, the collected light comprises visible light (in the visible spectrum) that is reflected by any object present in the field of view (illuminated by the white light). A beam-splitter <b>235</b> splits the collected light into two channels. For example, the beam-splitter <b>235</b> is a dichroic mirror transmitting and reflecting the collected light at wavelengths above and below, respectively, a threshold wavelength between a spectrum of the fluorescence light and a spectrum of the visible light. In one of the channels of the beam-splitter <b>235</b> with the (portion of the) collected light in the spectrum of the fluorescence light (such as the transmitted one), an emission filter <b>240</b> receives the fluorescence light and filters it to remove any excitation light (which might be reflected by objects in the field of view) and any ambient lights (which might be generated by background/inherent fluorescence). A fluorescence camera <b>245</b> receives the fluorescence light from the emission filter <b>240</b> and generates a corresponding fluorescence (digital) image representing the distribution of the fluorophores in the field of view. In the other one of the channels of the beam-splitter <b>235</b> with the (portion of the) collected light in the spectrum of the visible light (such as the reflected one), a photograph camera <b>250</b> receives the visible light and generates a corresponding photograph (digital) image representing a visualization of the objects in the field of view.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Moving to the control unit <b>205</b>, it comprises several units that are connected among them through a bus structure <b>255</b>. Particularly, one or more microprocessors (&#x3bc;P) <b>260</b> provide processing and orchestration functionalities of the control unit <b>205</b>. A non-volatile memory (ROM) <b>265</b> stores basic code for a bootstrap of the control unit <b>205</b> and a volatile memory (RAM) <b>270</b> is used as a working memory by the microprocessors <b>260</b>. The control unit <b>205</b> is provided with a mass-memory <b>275</b> for storing programs and data (for example, a Solid-State-Disk, or SSD). Moreover, the control unit <b>205</b> comprises a number of controllers <b>280</b> for peripherals, or Input/Output (I/O) units; particularly, the controllers <b>280</b> control the excitation light source <b>210</b>, the white light source <b>215</b>, the fluorescence camera <b>245</b> and the photograph camera <b>250</b> of the imaging head <b>165</b>; moreover, the controllers <b>280</b> control further peripherals, denoted as a whole with the reference <b>285</b>, such as the primary monitor, the keyboard, the pointing device, the secondary monitor, a drive for reading/writing removable storage units (such as of USB type) and a network interface card (NIC) for connecting to a communication network (such as a LAN and then the Internet).</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In operation, the imaging head <b>165</b> is used to image a body-part <b>290</b> of a patient <b>295</b> during an imaging process thereof (for example, a diagnostic analysis, a therapeutic treatment or a surgical intervention). For this purpose, a fluorescence agent is administered to the patient <b>295</b> (for example, intravenously or locally). The fluorescence agent is a target-specific fluorescence agent that is adapted to attaching to a specific (biological) target by means of a specific interaction therewith (such as tumoral tissues, nerves, blood-vessels, lymph-nodes, lymph-vessels and so on). The fluorescence agent is administered to the patient <b>295</b> in advance (such as 24-72 hours before the imaging process), so as to allow the fluorescence agent to circulate within a vascular system of the patient <b>295</b> until reaching the body-part <b>290</b> and binding to the desired target. During the imaging process, the imaging head <b>165</b> is positioned to have the body-part <b>290</b> within its field of view. At this point, the body-part <b>290</b> is illuminated with both the excitation light and the white light; fluorescence images (representing the distribution of the fluorescence agent, and then of its target, in the body-part <b>290</b>) and photograph images (representing the visualization of the body-part <b>290</b>) are acquired in succession. The fluorescence/photograph images are then displayed onto the primary/secondary monitors of the imaging apparatus, generally overlaid to each other into corresponding combined images (representing the target being contextualized on an anatomical structure of the body-part <b>290</b>).</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>-<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, different views are shown of the testing device <b>110</b> according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Starting from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, it shows a perspective view of the testing device <b>110</b>.

The holder <b>305</b> has a (bottom) resting surface <b>310</b> for resting the testing device <b>110</b> on any supporting surface, for example, the supporting surface <b>175</b> of the trolley of the imaging apparatus, not shown in the figure; the holder <b>305</b> has a (top) imaging surface <b>315</b> opposite the resting surface <b>310</b> for imaging the testing device <b>110</b>. The testing device <b>110</b> has one or more sites each comprising at least one luminescence substance. Particularly, in the exemplary implementation shown in the figure one or more seats <b>320</b> (four in this specific implementation, only one visible in the figure) are provided in the holder <b>305</b>. The seats <b>320</b> are configured to accommodate corresponding containers <b>325</b> (one shown outside the seat <b>320</b> and three shown inside the seats <b>320</b> in the figure). Each container <b>325</b> is filled with a liquid containing a fluorescence agent (or more); for example, the containers <b>325</b> are of different types each defined by the corresponding fluorescence agent and/or its concentration. The testing device <b>110</b> may be either in a basic version or in a complete version. In the basic version, the testing device <b>110</b> is provided without the containers <b>325</b> (to be acquired separately and then inserted into the seats <b>320</b> in a removable way). In the complete version, instead, the testing device <b>110</b> is provided with the containers <b>325</b> already inserted in the seats <b>320</b> (either in a removable way or in a non-removable way). Windows <b>330</b> corresponding to the seats <b>320</b> are opened in the imaging surface <b>315</b>. Each window <b>330</b> exposes part of the corresponding seat <b>320</b>; therefore, each window <b>330</b> also exposes a corresponding part of the container <b>325</b> accommodated in the seat <b>320</b> so as to allow imaging its fluorescence agent. For this purpose, at least the part of the container <b>325</b> exposed through the window <b>330</b> is transparent to both the excitation light and the fluorescence light (i.e., it is capable of allowing the excitation/fluorescence light to pass through it substantially without being excessively diffused, such as with a ratio, between the radiant power of a beam of excitation/fluorescence light exiting the container <b>325</b> in a direction defined by a corresponding angle of refraction and the radiant power of a beam of excitation/fluorescence light entering the same container <b>325</b> being slanted with respect to its surface, higher than 80%, preferably higher than 85% and even more preferably higher than 90%, such as between 95% and 100%).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the solution according to an embodiment of the present disclosure, the holder <b>305</b> has one or more markers <b>335</b>, <b>340</b> arranged on the imaging surface <b>315</b> (for example, formed by corresponding labels stitched thereon), which are machine-readable optically (for example, QR codes). The markers <b>335</b>, <b>340</b> operate as positional markers for determining a position (i.e., location and orientation) of the testing device <b>110</b>. Particularly, in this specific implementation a (central) marker <b>335</b> is arranged at a central point of the holder <b>305</b> and four (window) markers <b>340</b> are arranged in correspondence to the windows <b>330</b> (for example, alternated to each other). As described in detail in the following, the markers <b>335</b>, <b>340</b> may be used to detect the testing device <b>100</b> in a corresponding photograph image; this information then allows determining a representation of the windows <b>330</b> in a corresponding luminescence image for use to test the imaging apparatus <b>105</b> accordingly.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the specific implementation of the testing device <b>110</b> shown in the figure, one or more of the markers <b>335</b>, <b>340</b> may further operate as informative markers encoding (device) information of the testing device <b>110</b>. For example, one marker <b>335</b>, <b>340</b> or multiple makers <b>335</b>, <b>340</b> in combination encode a (unique) device identifier of the testing device <b>110</b> (for example, with the device identifier encoded in the marker <b>335</b>). The device identifier allows tracking a usage of the testing device <b>110</b>. The testing device <b>110</b> may have either a free configuration or a fixed configuration. In the free configuration, any types of containers <b>325</b> (with fluorescence agent of any nature and concentration) may be arranged in the seats <b>320</b>. In a fixed configuration, instead, pre-defined types of containers <b>325</b> (with fluorescence agent of specific nature and concentration) are to be arranged in the seats <b>320</b>. In the latter case, one or more of the markers <b>335</b>, <b>340</b> (either individually or in combination) encode (unique) container identifiers of the types of containers <b>325</b> to be accommodated in the seats <b>320</b> (for example, with each container identifier encoded in a corresponding marker <b>340</b> close to its seat <b>320</b>). The container identifiers allow verifying the correct configuration of the testing device <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The markers <b>335</b>, <b>340</b> are arranged at corresponding bottom surfaces of recesses (denoted with the same references), which extend from the imaging surface <b>315</b> inwards the holder <b>305</b> (downwards). The bottom surfaces of the recesses <b>335</b>, <b>340</b> are parallel to the resting surface <b>310</b>. Therefore, when the testing device <b>110</b> rests on the supporting surface <b>175</b> (substantially horizontally), the bottom surfaces of the recesses <b>335</b>, <b>340</b> are horizontal as well. This increases a visibility of the markers <b>335</b>, <b>340</b> (when observed from above). Moreover, the recesses <b>335</b>, <b>340</b> have corresponding edges at the imaging surface <b>315</b> which are chamfered. For example, the edges are chamfered to form an angle of 40-50&#xb0; (such as of 45&#xb0;) with the imaging surface <b>315</b>. This reduces any shadowing of the markers <b>335</b>, <b>340</b> when the testing device <b>110</b> is illuminated from above.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The holder <b>305</b> has a shape (in plant view) having point symmetry; in this specific implementation, the shape is octagonal, with four long edges and four short edges alternated to each other. The holder <b>305</b> then has a lateral surface <b>345</b> (extending between the resting surface <b>310</b> and the imaging surface <b>315</b>) with four big faces and four small faces alternated to each other (corresponding to the long edges and the short edges, respectively). The seats <b>320</b> comprise corresponding blind holes, which extend inwards from the lateral surface <b>345</b>, and more specifically from the small faces thereof. The windows <b>330</b> comprise corresponding through-holes, which reach the seats <b>320</b> from the imaging surface <b>315</b>. As a result, by placing a center of illumination of the imaging head defining its optical axis (not show in the figure) at the central point of the holder <b>305</b>, it is possible to have a same illumination of all the containers <b>325</b> through the windows <b>330</b> (symmetric thereto).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The windows <b>330</b> are opened in portions of the imaging surface <b>315</b> that are inclined with respect to the resting surface <b>310</b>. For example, the portions of the imaging surface <b>315</b> around the windows <b>330</b> are oriented inwards the holder <b>305</b> (downwards) moving towards its central point, so as to form an angle with the resting surface <b>310</b> of 5-15&#xb0; (such as 10&#xb0;). This reduces a reflection of the imaging surface <b>315</b> (at least close to the windows <b>330</b>) when the testing device <b>110</b> is illuminated from above.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The windows <b>330</b> have corresponding edges at the imaging surface <b>315</b> which are chamfered. For example, the edges are chamfered to form an angle of 40-50&#xb0; (such as of 45&#xb0;) with the imaging surface <b>315</b>. This reduces any shadowing of the windows <b>330</b> when the testing device <b>110</b> is illuminated from above.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The testing device <b>110</b> comprises a testing light source <b>350</b> at the imaging surface <b>315</b>, which testing light source <b>350</b> generates a testing light of the same type as the fluorescence light emitted by one or more fluorescence agents when illuminated by the excitation light (i.e., of NIR type). For example, the testing light source <b>350</b> is based on a frame of LEDs running around the marker <b>335</b>; the testing light source <b>350</b> is supplied by a replaceable/non-replaceable battery enclosed in the holder <b>305</b> and is turned on/off by acting on a switch (not visible in the figure). The testing light source <b>350</b> may be used to test the acquisition unit of the imaging apparatus alone (with its illumination unit turned off).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the fixed configuration of the testing device <b>110</b>, the holder <b>305</b> has corresponding seat indicators <b>355</b> on the imaging surface <b>315</b> (for example, formed by corresponding labels stitched thereon), which are human-readable (for example, in text form). The seat indicators <b>355</b> are arranged in correspondence to the seats <b>320</b> and provide a specification of the types of containers <b>325</b> to be accommodated therein. Particularly, the seat indicators <b>355</b> are color-coded; for example, the seat indicators <b>355</b> contain color names corresponding to the types of containers <b>325</b> (such as white, yellow, blue and green for increasing concentrations of a same fluorescence agent). The seat indicators <b>355</b> facilitate the insertion of the correct types of containers <b>325</b> into the seats <b>320</b> (especially when the testing device <b>110</b> is assembled on the field).</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In any (free/fixed) configuration of the testing device <b>110</b>, the containers <b>325</b> have corresponding container indicators, which are human-readable (for example, colors). The container indicators are arranged on parts of the containers <b>325</b> projecting from the seats <b>320</b> when the containers <b>325</b> are inserted therein (so as to remain visible) and provide a specification of their types. Particularly, the container indicators are again color-coded. For example, corresponding caps <b>360</b> of the containers <b>325</b> are colored according to the types of containers <b>320</b> as above, i.e., white, yellow, blue and green for increasing concentrations of the fluorescence agent (in this case, discernible by people affected by protanopia as well). The container indicators further facilitate the insertion of the correct types of containers <b>325</b> in the corresponding seats <b>320</b>; moreover, they also allow verifying that the testing device <b>110</b> has been assembled correctly at any time.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Moving to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, it shows a cross-section view of the same testing device <b>110</b>; particularly, the cross-section view is in a (vertical) symmetry plane, perpendicular to the resting surface <b>310</b>, of two opposed seats <b>320</b> (one with the container <b>325</b> outside it and the other one with the container <b>325</b> inside it in the figure). The seats <b>320</b> are inclined with respect to the resting surface <b>310</b> (i.e., a longitudinal axis thereof is not parallel to the resting surface <b>310</b>). Because of the inclination of the seats <b>320</b>, the containers <b>325</b> accommodated therein are inclined with respect to the resting surface <b>315</b> as well. Therefore, when the testing device <b>110</b> rests on the supporting surface <b>175</b> (substantially horizontally), the containers <b>325</b> are not horizontal. Moreover, each window <b>330</b> is spaced apart from a distal (top) end of the corresponding seat <b>320</b>, more distant from the resting surface <b>310</b> than another proximal (bottom) end thereof. As a result, any impurities that may be present in the containers <b>325</b> (such as air bubbles and small floating particles) naturally flow upwards and accumulate there, away from the corresponding windows <b>330</b>. This ensures that the parts of the containers <b>325</b> that are imaged through the windows <b>330</b> are substantially free of impurities. Moreover, the containers <b>325</b> may not be filled completely; in this case as well, air remaining in the containers <b>325</b> flows upwards and accumulate there, away from the corresponding windows <b>330</b>. This ensures that the parts of the containers <b>325</b> that are imaged through the windows <b>330</b> are substantially full of the fluorescence agent. All of the above significantly increases a quality of the imaging of the containers <b>325</b>, which reflects in an improved accuracy of any tests of the imaging apparatus performed with the testing device <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Particularly, the longitudinal axes of the seats <b>320</b> form an incline angle &#x3b1; of 5-30&#xb0;, preferably 7-20&#xb0; and still more preferably 9-15&#xb0;, such as 10&#xb0;, with the supporting surface <b>175</b>. These values of the incline angle &#x3b1; provide a fast flowing upwards of the impurities and the air (for example, so as to allow using containers <b>325</b> even filled by 70-90% only); at the same time, they do not adversely affect the imaging of the containers <b>325</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">A distance of the windows <b>330</b> (i.e., their upper borders) from the distal end of the corresponding seats <b>320</b> is 10-50%, preferably 20-40% and still more preferably 25-35%, such as 30% of a length of the seats <b>320</b> (along their longitudinal axis). These values of the distance ensure that any impurities and/or air in the containers <b>325</b> are never imagined through the windows <b>330</b> in most practical situations.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Each seat <b>320</b> has an external portion <b>405</b> with a constant section (for example, with a cylindrical shape) and an internal portion <b>410</b> with a section decreasing moving inwards the holder <b>305</b> (for example, with a frusto-conical shape). The corresponding window <b>330</b> exposes at least part of the external portion <b>405</b> of the seat <b>320</b>. The containers <b>325</b> accommodated in the seats <b>320</b> have a matching shape. For example, the containers <b>325</b> are commercial off-the-shelf vials of 1.5 ml. Each vial <b>325</b> comprises a (transparent) elongated bottle <b>415</b> (such as of plastic material) containing the liquid with the fluorescence agent, which vial <b>325</b> is closed by the cap <b>360</b> (for example, of screw-on type). Accordingly, the bottle <b>415</b> has a top portion <b>420</b> (proximal to an opening thereof) with a constant section (for example, with a cylindrical shape) and a bottom portion <b>425</b> (distal from the opening) with a section decreasing moving away from the opening (for example, with a frusto-conical shape). Therefore, the windows <b>330</b> expose at least part of the top portions <b>420</b> of the containers <b>325</b> (and particularly their lowest part). In this way, the containers <b>325</b> are imaged where they are substantially flat.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">One or more magnetic elements <b>430</b> (two in this specific implementation) are embedded in the holder <b>305</b>, close to the resting surface <b>310</b>. When the supporting surface <b>175</b> is of ferromagnetic material (such as iron), the magnetic elements <b>430</b> generate an attraction force that maintains the testing device <b>110</b> (rested thereon) fixed in position.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, a detail is shown of the imaging apparatus <b>105</b> according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The imaging apparatus <b>105</b> has a holding station <b>505</b>, which is used to hold the testing device <b>110</b> in a fixed (imaging) position on the supporting surface <b>175</b>; the testing device <b>110</b> is held in the imaging position in a removable way. For example, the holding station <b>505</b> is formed by a recess matching a footprint of the testing device <b>110</b> (defined by its resting surface, not visible in the figure), possibly with the addition of four lateral hollows for avoiding any interference of the parts of the containers <b>325</b> projecting from the holder <b>305</b>; in this way, the testing device <b>110</b> may be inserted into the holding station <b>505</b> by dropping it into the recess. The recess has a depth lower than a height of the holder <b>305</b>; in this way, the testing device <b>110</b> may be removed from the holding station <b>505</b> by grasping and lifting it from the recess.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Moreover, the imaging apparatus <b>105</b> has a (further) holding station <b>510</b>, which is used to hold the imaging head <b>165</b> in an (acquisition) position; the imaging head <b>165</b> as well is held in the acquisition position in a removable way. For example, the holding station <b>510</b> is formed by a ring matching a main body of the imaging head <b>165</b> (excluding its handlebars <b>170</b>); the ring is integral with a cantilever <b>515</b> fixed to the pillar <b>125</b> of the testing device <b>110</b>. In this way, the imaging head <b>165</b> may be inserted into the holding station <b>510</b> by sliding it into the ring from above, until the handlebars <b>170</b> abut against it; moreover, the imaging head <b>165</b> may be removed from the holding station <b>510</b> by lifting it until leaving the ring.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Alternatively (not shown in the figure), the holding station <b>505</b> and the holding station <b>510</b> may be combined into a single structure for holding both the testing device <b>110</b> in the imaging position and the imaging head <b>165</b> in the acquisition position. For example, this result may be achieved by a cylinder which is closed at the bottom by a base having a recess for inserting the testing device <b>110</b> and it is open at the top for sliding the imaging head <b>165</b> as above.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">When the testing device <b>110</b> is in the imaging position (defined by the holding station <b>505</b>) and the imaging head <b>165</b> is in the acquisition position (defined by the holding station <b>510</b>), the testing device <b>110</b> falls within the field of view of the imaging head <b>165</b>. Particularly, the central point of the holder <b>305</b> is on the optical axis of the imaging head <b>165</b>. This provides a controlled and repeatable illumination of the testing device <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the main software components are shown that may be used to implement the solution according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">All the software components (programs and data) are denoted as a whole with the reference <b>600</b>. The software components <b>600</b> are typically stored in the mass memory and loaded (at least in part) into the working memory of the control unit of the imaging apparatus when the programs are running, together with other software components not directly relevant to the solution according to the present disclosure (such as an operating system, medical applications and so on), which other software components are omitted for the sake of simplicity. The programs are initially installed into the mass memory, for example, from removable storage units or from the communication network (not shown in the figure). In this respect, each program may be a module, segment or portion of code, which comprises one or more executable instructions for implementing the specified logical function.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Particularly, corresponding drives, denoted as whole with the reference <b>605</b>, are used to drive the peripherals of the imaging apparatus, comprising its excitation light source, white light source, fluorescence camera, photograph camera, keyboard, pointing device, primary/secondary monitors and network interface card. An imaging manager <b>610</b> manages imaging processes of any body-parts. The imaging manager <b>610</b> interfaces with the drives <b>605</b>.

The testing manager <b>620</b> as well interfaces with the drives <b>605</b>. The testing manager <b>620</b> accesses (in read/write mode) an image repository <b>625</b>, a configuration repository <b>630</b> and a log repository <b>635</b>. The image repository <b>625</b> stores one or more fluorescence images and photograph images that are acquired during a test of the imaging apparatus that is in progress. The configuration repository <b>630</b> stores configuration information for the tests of the imagining apparatus. For example, the configuration information comprises a network address (such as a domain name) of a remote service provider (for example, a server of a manufacturer of the imaging apparatus), a descriptor of the testing device and a descriptor of the containers. The descriptor of the testing device indicates it by the corresponding device identifier. The descriptor of the testing device defines its configuration, i.e., free or fixed. The descriptor of the testing device defines its geometry; for example, the geometry of the testing device is defined in terms of shape of its holder and in terms of position of the windows, the markers, the seat indicators and the caps with respect to the holder (for example, their real-word coordinates in a reference system integral therewith). The descriptor of the testing device defines a specification of the containers for the markers, the seat indicators and the container indicators; for example, for each possible type of container there are provided its container identifier for the markers, its color name for the corresponding seat indicator and its color definition for the corresponding container indicator (the latter in terms of nominal values of one or more statistical parameters relating thereto, such mean value of color components, like RGB components). The descriptor of the testing device defines one or more usage rules thereof (for example, maximum usage in terms of length of the tests, maximum elapsed time from a production date and so on). The descriptor of the testing device defines one or more characteristics of each testing light generated by its testing light source (for example, wavelength and nominal values of one or more statistical parameters relating thereto, such as mean fluorescence intensity, or MFI). The descriptor of the containers defines each possible type of them; for example, each type of container (identified by its container identifier) is defined by nature and/or concentration of the corresponding fluorescence agent and by a fluorescence specification of the fluorescence light emitted by it (in terms of wavelength and nominal values of one or more statistical parameters relating thereto, such as mean fluorescence intensity). The log repository <b>635</b> stores information about the tests that have been performed by the imaging apparatus <b>105</b>. For example, the log repository <b>635</b> has a record for each test (for example, identified by its timestamp); the record comprises a length of the test, an indication of a result of the test and a change flag (which is asserted when the test has been performed with a new testing device and/or with new containers). The testing manager <b>620</b> exploits an object recognition engine <b>640</b>, which is used to find the position of the testing device in photograph/fluorescence images thereof. The object recognition engine <b>640</b> accesses (in read mode) the configuration repository <b>630</b> and it accesses (in write mode) a transformation repository <b>645</b>, which is also accessed (in read mode) by the testing manager <b>620</b>. The transformation repository <b>645</b> stores a definition of a transformation between the real-word coordinates of the testing device and corresponding image coordinates in the fluorescence/photograph images (for example, in the form of a transformation matrix).</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>-<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>C</figref>, an activity diagram is shown describing the flow of activities relating to an implementation of the solution according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Particularly, the activity diagram represents an exemplary process that may be used to test the imaging apparatus with a method <b>700</b>. In this respect, each block may correspond to one or more executable instructions for implementing the specified logical function on the control unit of the imaging apparatus.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The process is executed whenever the imaging apparatus has to be tested. For example, this may happen before any imaging process, after an installation or any maintenance of the imaging apparatus, upon request, periodically and so on, either in response to a corresponding request or automatically (as described in the following). In this event, the operator places the testing device onto the supporting surface and the imaging head above it (for example, by inserting the testing device and the imaging head into the corresponding holding stations if available). The operator then enters a test command with the keyboard or the pointing device; the test command may also specify a type of the test, selected between a test in a single position or a test throughout the field of view of the imaging head (for example, the first one by default). At the same time, the operator may also select a corresponding command when the containers or the whole testing device have been changed, in the latter case together with its device identifier. In any case, the test command is received at block <b>702</b> by the testing manager via the corresponding drive.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In response thereto, the process passes to block <b>704</b> wherein the testing manager initializes a temporary record for the test, with its time-stamp (set to a current time from an internal clock), start time (set to the same current time) and change flag (asserted if the containers or the testing device have been changed or deasserted otherwise); moreover, if the testing device has been changed, the testing manager downloads an indication of the (free/fixed) configuration of the testing device from the service provider (from its network address retrieved from the configuration repository) according to the device identifier, and then updates the descriptor of the testing device in the configuration repository accordingly. The testing manager at block <b>706</b> turns on the white light source and the excitation light source, and it commands the photograph camera and the fluorescence camera to acquire a photograph image and a fluorescence image, respectively, of their same field of view (via the corresponding drives), after that the testing manager turns off the white light source and the excitation light source. The photograph image is defined by a bitmap comprising a matrix of cells (for example, with 512 rows and 512 columns) each storing a value of a pixel, i.e., a basic picture element corresponding to a location of the field of view, which pixel value represents the visible light reflected by the location (such as its RGB components). The fluorescence image is defined by a bitmap comprising a matrix of cells (with either the same or different size with respect to the photograph image) each storing a pixel value representing the fluorescence light emitted by the corresponding location of the field of view (such as its intensity). The object recognition engine at block <b>708</b> searches for the testing device in the photograph image, i.e., its representation in a corresponding Region Of Interest (ROI), by exploiting image processing techniques known per se based on the known geometry of the testing device (as defined by its descriptor in the configuration repository). The testing manager at block <b>710</b> verifies whether the testing device has been found. Particularly, the image recognition engine may simply search for the holder of the testing device (according to its shape). In addition or in alternative, the image recognition engine searches for the markers (according to their specification) and verifies whether they are correct (i.e., in the right number and with the right format). The markers make the detection of the testing device more accurate (with respect to the use of the holder), especially when they are multiple (like the five markers in the example at issue). If the testing device has not been found (i.e., no holder and/or no correct markers), the process returns to the block <b>706</b> to repeat the same operations continually, up to a pre-defined time-out, after that the process returns to the block <b>702</b> (not shown in the figure) with the testing manager that displays an error message on the primary monitor (via the corresponding drive).</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The same operations may also be performed to start the test automatically in response to an appearance of the testing device within the field of view of the imaging head. For this purpose, in a non-operative condition of the imaging apparatus (i.e., when no imaging process is in progress), the testing manager monitors the field of view by continually performing a corresponding loop. The loop begins at block <b>712</b>, wherein the testing manager turns on the white light source and the excitation light source, and it commands the photograph camera and the fluorescence camera to acquire a photograph image and a fluorescence image, respectively, of their same field of view (via the corresponding drives), after that the testing manager turns off the white light source and the excitation light source. The object recognition engine at block <b>714</b> searches for the testing device in the photograph image as above. The testing manager at block <b>716</b> verifies whether the testing device has been found. If the testing device has not been found, the process returns to the block <b>712</b> to repeat the same operations periodically (for example, every 5-10 s). Conversely, as soon as the testing device has been found, the process descends into block <b>718</b>. At this point, the testing manager initializes the temporary record with its time-stamp and start time as above, and with the type of test set to the single position and the change flag deasserted. This allows starting the test by simply presenting the testing device into the field of view of the imaging head, without the need of any additional intervention by the operator.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In any case, the process continues to block <b>720</b> from the block <b>710</b> (as soon the testing device has been found) or from the block <b>718</b>. At this point, the testing manager determines a current position of the testing device with respect to the imaging head according to its representation in the photograph image (with image-processing techniques known per se); for example, the current position is defined by a location of the central point of the testing device in an imaging plane perpendicular to the optical axis of the imaging head, a distance of the testing device from the imaging head and a rotation angle of the testing device with respect to the imaging plane. This operation is completely automatic, and then fast and accurate. The testing manager at block <b>722</b> verifies whether the current position matches a target position (such as defined by the central point of the testing device on the optical axis of the imaging head, the testing device at a certain distance from the imaging head and parallel to its imaging plane). For example, the testing manager calculates a corresponding displacement between the current position and the target position as defined by translation and rotation components, and compares them with corresponding pre-defined thresholds (such as 0.1-1 cm and 1-5&#xb0;). If one or more translation/rotation components exceed the corresponding thresholds (meaning that the current position does not match the target position), the testing manager at block <b>724</b> displays a corresponding message on the primary monitor (via the corresponding drive). The message indicates a movement of the testing device and/or of the imaging head (given by the displacement), which is required for reaching the target position; for example, when the central point of the testing device is not on the optical axis of the imaging head, the operator is required to translate it, whereas when the testing device is not at the correct distance/angle with respect to the imaging head, the operator is required to translate/rotate the latter. The process then returns to the block <b>706</b> to repeat the same operations. In this way, the operator is provided with a very useful feedback, which allows placing the testing device and/or the imaging head in a correct reciprocal position even when no holding stations are available.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Referring back to the block <b>722</b>, if all the translation/rotation components do not exceed the corresponding thresholds (meaning that the current position matches the target position), the process descends into block <b>726</b>; particularly, this is always true when the testing device and the imaging head are inserted into the corresponding holding stations. At this point, the testing manager extracts the device identifier from the markers in the photograph image. The testing manager at block <b>728</b> retrieves usage information of the testing device from the log repository (for example, length of the tests that have been performed since a last change of the testing device or of its containers). In addition or in alternative, the testing manager downloads (further) usage information of the testing device from the service provider (from its network address retrieved from the configuration repository) according to its device identifier (assuming that it matches the one stored in the configuration repository); for example, this usage information may comprise an authenticity indicator of the testing device and its production date. The testing manager at block <b>730</b> verifies the usage information (retrieved and/or downloaded) against the usage rules (retrieved from the configuration repository); for example, the testing manager compares the length of the tests (since the last change of the testing device or of its containers) and/or a time elapsed from the production date with the corresponding maximum allowable values. The testing monitor then enables the test according to a result of this verification. If any usage rule is not satisfied (always true when the device identifier does not match the one stored in the configuration repository), the testing manager at block <b>732</b> aborts the test and displays a corresponding error message on the primary monitor (via the corresponding drive); the process then returns to the block <b>702</b> waiting for a next test command. Alternatively, as shown in dashed line in the figure, the testing manager simply displays a corresponding warning message on the primary monitor (via the corresponding drive), but the test is still allowed by continuing to block <b>734</b>. The same point is also reached directly from the block <b>730</b> if all the usage rules are satisfied.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">At this point, the testing manager generates the transformation matrix (between the real-word coordinates of the testing device and the image coordinates in its fluorescence/photograph images); for example, the transformation matrix is calculated by minimizing a mapping error between the real-word coordinates of the markers in the testing device (retrieved from the configuration repository) and the image coordinates of the markers in the photograph image (such as the mean square value of their differences). This operation may be based on a single marker with asymmetric readout (providing location and orientation of the testing device according to its specification); however, the use of multiple markers (like the five markers in the example at issue) adds further accuracy. The testing manager at block <b>736</b> further determines the seat indicators and the caps in the photograph image and the windows in the fluorescence image (i.e., their representations in corresponding ROIs) according to their image coordinates therein calculated by applying the transformation matrix to the corresponding real-word coordinates (retrieved from the configuration repository).</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The automatic detection of the position of the testing device in the photograph image and the automatic determination of the representation of the windows in the luminescence image accordingly avoid any human intervention for selecting the desired regions of interest. This expedites the test and makes it less prone to errors, with a beneficial effect on its cost and quality.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The testing manager now verifies the containers arranged in the seats. For this purpose, the testing manager at block <b>738</b> calculates the same statistical parameters, of the color definitions for the container indicators in the configuration repository, for the pixel values representing each cap in the photograph image, i.e., mean values of their RGB components in the example at issue. The flow of activity branches at block <b>740</b> according to the configuration of the testing device (retrieved from the configuration repository). If the testing device has the free configuration, the testing manager at block <b>742</b> estimates the types of containers arranged in the seats. For example, the testing manager calculates a distance between the colors of the caps in the photograph image and the color definitions of every permutation of four types of containers among all the possible ones defined in the configuration repository (such as equal to the mean square value of the differences between the mean values of the RGB components of each cap and the corresponding nominal values of the color definition of the corresponding type of container); the testing manager selects the permutation that provides the lowest distance. Referring back to the block <b>740</b>, if the testing device has the fixed configuration, the testing manager at block <b>744</b> extracts the container identifiers from the markers in the photograph image (indicating the types of containers that should be arranged in the seats). In this phase, the testing manager may also read the color names from the seat indicators in the photograph image (indicating the same expected types of containers that should be arranged in the seats). The testing manager verifies whether each pair of corresponding color name and container identifier refers to the same type of container (as indicated in the configuration repository). If not, the process returns to the block <b>702</b> (not shown in the figure) with the testing manager that displays an error message on the primary monitor (via the corresponding drive). In this way, it is possible to ensure that the testing device (in the fixed configuration) has been assembled correctly. The flow of activity then merges at block <b>746</b> from either the block <b>742</b> or the block <b>744</b>; at this point, a loop is entered with the testing manager that takes a (current) seat into account (starting from a first one in any arbitrary order). The testing manager at block <b>748</b> verifies whether the container arranged in the seat is of the expected type (i.e., the estimated one in the free configuration or the read one in the fixed configuration). For this purpose, the testing manager verifies whether the color of the cap matches the color definition of the expected type of container (retrieved from the configuration repository); for example, the testing manager calculates a difference between the mean value of each RGB component of the cap and the corresponding nominal value of the color definition, and compares them with a pre-defined threshold (such as 1-5% with respect to the color definition). If one or more differences exceed the threshold (meaning that the container is not of the expected type), the testing manager at block <b>750</b> aborts the test and displays a corresponding error message on the primary monitor (via the corresponding drive); the process then returns to the block <b>702</b> waiting for a next test command. Conversely, if no difference exceeds the threshold (meaning that the container is of the expected type), the testing manager at block <b>752</b> verifies whether a last seat has been processed. If not, the process returns to the block <b>746</b> to repeat the same operations for a next seat. Conversely, once all the seats have been processed (determining that all the containers of the expected types are arranged therein), the loop is exit by descending into block <b>754</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">At this point, the testing manager verifies the windows in the fluorescence image. For this purpose, the testing manager calculates the same statistical parameters, of the fluorescence specification for the corresponding type of container in the configuration repository, for the pixel values representing each window in the fluorescence image, i.e., mean fluorescence intensity in the example at issue; moreover, the testing manager calculates the same statistical parameters (i.e., mean fluorescence intensity) for the pixel values representing a background area different from the windows in the photograph image (for example, coincident with the central marker). A loop is then entered at block <b>756</b> with the testing manager that takes a (current) window into account (starting from a first one in any arbitrary order). The testing manager at block <b>758</b> verifies whether the window matches the fluorescence specification of the type of container arranged in the seat (retrieved from the configuration repository); for example, the testing manager calculates a difference between the mean fluorescence intensity of the window and the corresponding nominal value of the type of container, and compares it with a pre-defined threshold (such as 1-5% with respect to the fluorescence specification). In addition or in alternative, the testing manager calculates the ratios between the mean fluorescence intensity of the (current) window and the mean fluorescence intensity of each other window and of the background area; the testing manager further calculates the ratios between the corresponding nominal values (retrieved from the configuration repository for the types of containers of the other windows and set to almost zero for the background area). The testing manager then calculates a difference between each pair of ratios, and compares it with a pre-defined threshold (such as 1-5% with respect to the ratio of the nominal values). In any case, the testing manager adds a result of these verifications to the temporary record for the test. The testing manager at block <b>760</b> verifies whether a last window has been processed. If not, the process returns to the block <b>756</b> to repeat the same operations for a next window. Conversely, once all the windows have been processed, the loop is exit by descending into block <b>762</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">At this point, the testing manager verifies an alignment between the photograph image and the fluorescence image. For this purpose, the object recognition engine searches for the markers (i.e., their representations in corresponding ROIs) in the fluorescence image (as above). The testing manager at block <b>764</b> verifies whether the markers in the photograph image match the corresponding markers in the fluorescence image; for example, the testing manager calculates a distance between each marker in the photograph image and in the fluorescence image as defined by a mean value of corresponding translation components, and compares it with a pre-defined threshold (such as 1-5% of a maximum extent of the marker in the photograph image). The testing manager adds a result of this verification to the temporary record of the test.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The testing manager at block <b>766</b> may perform additional verifications of the imaging apparatus (according to the photograph image). For example, the testing manager determines a contrast of the acquisition unit according to a difference between the brightest pixel values and the least bright pixel values of the marks in the photograph image. In case the marks are tilted with respect to the row/columns of the photograph image (by an angle known from the geometry of the testing device retrieved from the configuration repository), the testing device determines the depth of field of the acquisition unit by applying the slanted edge method. The testing device may have a spatial resolution target on its imaging surface (for example, the 1951 USAF, IEEE or ISO one), which is further specified in the configuration repository; in this case, the object recognition engine searches for the spatial resolution target (i.e., its representation in a corresponding ROI) in the photograph image, and the testing manager then determines the spatial resolution of the acquisition unit according thereto. The testing device may have a color test target on its imaging surface (either distinct or combined with the spatial resolution target), which is further specified in the configuration repository; in this case, the object recognition engine searches for the color test target (i.e., its representation in a corresponding ROI) in the photograph image, and the testing manager then determines the color resolution of the acquisition unit according thereto. The testing device may have a reflectance standard on its imaging surface (either distinct or combined with the spatial resolution target and/or the color target), which is further specified in the configuration repository. In this case, the object recognition engine searches for the reflectance standard (i.e., its representation in a corresponding ROI) in the photograph image. The testing manager determines an ambient light as a difference between the white light generated by the white light source (as further defined in the configuration repository in terms of one or more statistical parameters relating thereto, such as its mean intensity) and a corresponding reflected light received from the reflectance standard (as defined by the same statistical parameters for the pixel values representing it in the photograph image, i.e., mean intensity in the example at issue). The testing manager then compares the ambient light (defined by the values of the statistical parameters for the reflected light minus the values of the corresponding statistical parameters for the white light) with a pre-defined threshold (such as 1-5% of the values of the statistical parameters for the white light). In addition or in alternative, the same operation may also be performed by determining the ambient light as a difference between the excitation light generated by the excitation light source (as further defined in the configuration repository in terms of one or more statistical parameters relating thereto, such as its mean intensity) and a corresponding (further) reflected light received from the reflectance standard (as defined by the same statistical parameters for the pixel values representing it in the fluorescence image, i.e., mean intensity in the example at issue). This allows verifying that the ambient conditions are suitable for correct operation of the imaging apparatus. In any case, the testing manager adds a result of these verifications to the temporary record of the test.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The testing manager at block <b>768</b> displays a message on the primary monitor (via the corresponding drive), requiring the operator to turn on the testing light source (via the corresponding switch of the testing device). As soon as the testing light source has been turned on, the process continues to block <b>770</b>. For example, this may happen in response to a corresponding command entered by the operator with the keyboard or the pointing device (received by the testing manager via the corresponding drive). Alternatively, this may happen automatically by monitoring the field of view with a corresponding loop which is performed continually (for example, every 1-2 s). Particularly, for this purpose the testing manager commands the fluorescence camera to acquire a fluorescence image of its field of view with the excitation light source turned off (via the corresponding drives), and then calculates the mean intensity of the fluorescence image; these operations are repeated until the mean intensity exceeds a threshold, such as 2-3 times the one corresponding to typical ambient fluorescence. In both cases, the testing manager now commands the fluorescence camera to acquire a (further) fluorescence image of its field of view (via the corresponding drives), while the white light source and the excitation light source are turned off. The testing manager verifies the acquisition unit alone of the imaging apparatus according to this luminescence image and the characteristics of the testing light (retrieved from the configuration repository); for example, the testing manager calculates a difference between the mean fluorescence intensity of the fluorescence image and its nominal value, and then compares this difference with a pre-determined threshold (such as 5-10% with respect to the nominal value). The testing manager adds a result of this verification to the temporary record of the test. The testing manager at block <b>772</b> verifies the illumination unit alone of the imaging apparatus according to the above-mentioned verifications of the imaging apparatus (as a whole) and of its acquisition unit (alone). For example, the testing manager conditions the statistical parameters (mean fluorescence intensity) calculated above for the pixel values representing each window in the previous fluorescence image (step <b>754</b>) according to the difference between the same mean fluorescence intensity of the (current) fluorescence image and its nominal value (so as to remove the effect of any mismatch of the acquisition unit); the testing manager then verifies again whether each window matches the fluorescence light emitted by the container arranged in the corresponding seat as above (steps <b>756</b>-<b>760</b>). The testing manager adds a result of this verification to the temporary record of the test.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The flow of activity branches at block <b>774</b> according to the type of test (as indicated in the temporary record). If the test has to be performed throughout the field of view of the imaging head, the testing manager at block <b>776</b> verifies whether it has been completed (i.e., the imaging apparatus has already been tested in all a set of predefined positions throughout the field of view, such as in a matrix with a pitch of 1-5 cm along every direction). If not, the testing manager at block <b>778</b> determines a movement of the testing device (according to the pitch) for reaching a further (new) position throughout the field of view; the testing manager then displays a corresponding message on the primary monitor (via the corresponding drive). As soon as the testing device has been moved to the new position, the process returns to the block <b>706</b> to repeat the same test of the imaging apparatus in its new position. For example, this may happen in response to a corresponding command entered by the operator with the keyboard or the pointing device (received by the testing manager via the corresponding drive). Alternatively, this may happen automatically by monitoring the field of view with a corresponding loop which is performed continually (for example, every 1-2 s). Particularly, for this purpose the testing manager turns on the white light, commands the photograph camera to acquire a photograph image of its field of view and then turns off the white light source (via the corresponding drives), the object recognition engine searches for the testing device in the photograph image, the testing manager verifies whether the testing device has been found and if so whether the current position of the testing device matches the new position (as above); these operations are repeated until the testing device has been found in the new position. The process instead descends into block <b>780</b> from the block <b>776</b> once the test has been completed (in all the positions throughout the field of view) or directly from the block <b>774</b> if the test has to be performed in a single position. In any case, the testing manager now determines a length of the test, from its start time (from the temporary record) to the current time (from the internal clock); the testing manager adds the length of the test to the temporary record.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The testing manager at block <b>782</b> saves the result of the test defined in the temporary record by adding it to the log repository. The testing manager at block <b>784</b> transmits the result of the test to the service provider (to its network address retrieved from the configuration repository). This allows implementing telemetric applications for tracking operation of the imaging apparatus remotely. The testing manager at block <b>786</b> displays the result of the test on the primary monitor (via the corresponding drive). The operator may then react accordingly. For example, if the result of the test indicates that the performance of the imaging apparatus is good, the corresponding imaging process may be performed (with a high degree of confidence on the information provided by the imaging apparatus). Conversely, the imaging process is aborted (since the information provided by the imaging apparatus might be misleading) and the operator may request an intervention to a support center of the manufacturer of the imaging apparatus. The process then returns to the block <b>702</b> waiting for a next test command.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">All of the above allows verifying the performance of the imaging apparatus with a high accuracy and in a reproducible manner. In this way, it is possible to detect any degradation of the performance of the imaging apparatus (for example, caused by corrupted light sources, dirty delivery/collection optics, mechanical wearing, parasitic light and so on), even when the degradation is not noticeable by the operator.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Modifications</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Naturally, in order to satisfy local and specific requirements, a person skilled in the art may apply many logical and/or physical modifications and alterations to the present disclosure.
