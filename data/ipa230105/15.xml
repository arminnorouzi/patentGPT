More particularly, the present disclosure relates a method and apparatus that involve a nested series of collection pans to adequately determine combine efficiency. Specifically, the present disclosure relates to a nested series of collection pans that may be remotely dropped via use of electromagnets to iteratively determine combine efficiency.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Agricultural harvesters are commonly known as &#x201c;combines&#x201d;. This term is derived from the use of multiple harvesting functions, namely being able to &#x201c;combine&#x201d; the use of picking a crop, threshing a crop, separating the crop and cleaning the crop desired to be harvested. Many times the combine may include a header which removes the crop from a field, a feeder which moves the crop matter into a threshing rotor which rotates within a perforated housing that allows grain to fall into a grain pan. After the grain pan, the grain is commonly cleaned using a cleaning system that blows air to discharge any chaff, debris or straw before the grain is deposited into a grain tank that is onboard the combine.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Various configurations of many of these mechanisms are required for different types of crops. The moisture content at harvesting, type of crop, amount of chaff, or the amount of straw, are all factors that may require that the combine be adjusted to monitor the combine efficiency. This adjustment may not always be readily apparent, and there may be too much grain lost amongst the chaff, straw or other debris. These lost grains lead to lost profits amongst farmers, an already low margin profession where profits are paramount to survival.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Previous grain loss receptacles have been releasably mounted beneath a body of a combine. A prior art receptacle may be dropped onto the ground during operation of the combine. The receptacle would then be filled with any chaff as well as lost grain that may be inadvertently blown from the combine to the ground. As a result, a single datapoint based on loss may be gathered based on the contents of this single tray. The single tray would then need to be collected, processed, and then reloaded onto the combine.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">As a result, there is a need for a new method and apparatus for determining combine efficiency using multiple trays mounted to a combine and actuatable in new ways.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one aspect, an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure may provide at least two pans attached by releasable magnets to a set of magnets on the main cover; a signal controller arranged to generate a signal when triggered by a user and arranged to be located remotely from the at least one pan; at least one electromagnet mounted on the at least one pan and the main cover being operative to electromagnetically retain the at least one pan on a vehicle body when supplied with electrical power; a battery operative to supply the electrical power to said at least one electromagnet in a normal operating mode; and a signal receiver operative to interrupt power to a select number of the at least one electromagnet causing at least one pan to be released from the vehicle body onto the ground in response to receipt of the wireless trigger signal from the signal controller.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one aspect, another exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure may provide a method of reducing crop loss comprising: providing at least one pan either directly attached or indirectly attached to a combine; using at least one electromagnet mounted on the at least one pan to electromagnetically retain the collection pan on a body of the combine; signaling on a signal controller to release at least one electromagnet; interrupting electrical power supplied to said at least one electromagnet in response to the signaling of the signal controller; dropping a first pan from the vehicle body together with the collection pan onto the ground displacing the combine harvester across the ground such that some of a crop is deposited onto the collection pan; dropping at least one second pan from the vehicle body by repeating the steps of signaling, interrupting and dropping; measuring the amount of crop contained within at least one pan; and adjusting the combine settings as a result of the measurements.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In yet another aspect, an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure may provide a method of measuring crop loss comprising: providing at least two pans either directly attached or indirectly attached to a combine; providing at least one sensor attached to a combine; using at least one electromagnet mounted on the at least one pan to electromagnetically retain the collection pan on a body of the combine; signaling on a signal controller to release at least one electromagnet; interrupting electrical power supplied to said at least one electromagnet in response to the signaling of the signal controller; dropping a first pan from the vehicle body together with the collection pan onto the ground; displacing the combine harvester across the ground such that some of a crop is deposited onto the collection pan; dropping at least one second pan from the vehicle body by repeating the steps of signaling, interrupting and dropping; and measuring the amount of crop contained within at least one pan; reading a sensor output to determine the amount of crop not staying within the combine; and adjusting the combine settings as a result of the measurements.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A sample embodiment of the disclosure is set forth in the following description, is shown in the drawings and is particularly and distinctly pointed out and set forth in the appended claims.

The third pan <b>32</b> has the first tab <b>32</b>G interface with the magnet <b>22</b>C and the second tab <b>32</b>H interface with magnet <b>22</b>F. The fourth pan <b>34</b> has the first tab <b>34</b>G interface with the magnet <b>22</b>D and the second tab <b>34</b>H interface with magnet <b>22</b>E.

This groove or recess <b>14</b>E along with a cover <b>14</b>F is operative to enclose a battery module <b>36</b> along with a portion of the signal receiver <b>24</b>. The battery module <b>36</b> further includes wiring that may power the signal receiver as well as wiring that interfaces with the magnets <b>22</b>. In some embodiments the battery module <b>36</b> is adjacent to the signal receiver <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">For the sake of simplicity, all magnets <b>22</b>A, <b>22</b>B, <b>22</b>C, <b>22</b>D, <b>22</b>E, <b>22</b>F, <b>22</b>G, <b>22</b>H are shown as the same height. One would understand that in order to properly nest the magnets would have to be at slightly different heights. For example, <b>22</b>A and <b>22</b>H may be at a first height, while <b>22</b>B and <b>22</b>G would be at a slightly increased second height as the second height would have to compensate for the distance added when the second pan <b>30</b> is nested in the first pan <b>28</b>. Similarly, the magnets <b>22</b>C and <b>22</b>F would have a third height greater than that of the second height and the magnets <b>22</b>D and <b>22</b>E would have a fourth height greater than that of the third height.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In an alternative embodiment, it is possible to use additional magnets with additional trays. For every additional tray, there would merely need to be two additional magnets. Further, additional systems <b>10</b> are able to be deployed around the combine <b>12</b>, as discussed earlier.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Further, an additional embodiment may not provide for tabs to be used on the trays but instead a nesting configuration with magnets attaching directly to trays at given locations when the trays may be selectively dropped in a method as will be discussed later.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Having thus described an exemplary non-limiting configuration of the system <b>10</b>, its operation will be discussed with reference to some exemplary features used with the various embodiments.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring specifically to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, an operational view of an exemplary pan being deployed into a field. As the combine <b>12</b> moves across a field, an operator of the combine <b>12</b> can decide that a measurement of grain loss is needed. The combine operator actuates the signal controller <b>26</b> that transmits a signal to the signal receiver <b>24</b>. Depending on which of the exemplary pans have been deployed prior and how many signals the signal receiver <b>24</b> has received determines which pan to drop. For example, if this is the first signal that the signal receiver <b>24</b> has received, the signal receiver may output to drop the first pan <b>28</b> through a controller. In an exemplary embodiment, the signal controller <b>26</b> can include one or more different types of RF devices such as cellular phones, Wi-Fi enabled devices, Bluetooth devices, etc. Additionally, the signal controller <b>26</b> may be wired. The signal receiver <b>24</b> would be matched to the controller <b>26</b> or vice versa in order to allow the two devices to properly communicate.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The controller, while not shown in the drawings, in one embodiment is mounted within the main cover and is in electrical connection with the battery <b>36</b> and magnets <b>22</b>. The controller is generally recessed relative to the pans <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> so as to not interfere with mounting of the pans relative to the combine <b>12</b> body. The controller is operative to control the supply of electrical power from the battery to the magnets and is operable between an off mode and a triggered or on mode. In the off mode, no electric power is being drawn from the battery by the magnets and the least one pan <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> is magnetically retained relative to the combine <b>12</b> body by the magnets. In the triggered or on mode, the controller is operative to cause electrical power to the magnets <b>22</b> in such a way that the magnets <b>22</b> attached to the tabs <b>28</b>G, <b>30</b>G, <b>32</b>G, <b>34</b>G of the pans <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> are released individually from the combine <b>12</b> for dropping the pan into the field. This mechanism for release may be through introducing an electrical signal to the magnet, causing a loss of magnetism, as will be discussed later herein.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The controller includes a receiver for receiving a signal from the signal receiver <b>24</b> and is configured to switch from the off mode to the triggered or on mode when the signal is received as well as a memory module responsive to data bearing records. The signal controller <b>26</b> has an independent housing with a respective power source therein for being situated remotely from the collection pan, for example with the combine operator. The signal controller <b>26</b> can be actuated by an operator that generates a wireless signal and transmits the signal wirelessly to the signal receiver <b>24</b> which passes it to the controller which then triggers the controller to interrupt power to the proper magnets <b>22</b> for dropping a pan <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> from the body of the combine <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In operation, the user positions the at least one pan <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> to be elongate in the lateral direction of the combine harvester and activates the magnets <b>22</b> to retain the pan to the underside of the combine <b>12</b> body, for example using a button <b>26</b>A externally located on the signal controller <b>26</b> to generate an activation signal transmitted to the signal receiver <b>24</b> then transmitted to the controller which switches from the off mode to the triggered or on mode upon receipt of the activation signal. The operator then operates the combine <b>12</b> in the usual manner, and selectively triggers the controller to release at least one pan <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> from the combine <b>12</b> body as the combine <b>12</b> travels across the field. In a known manner, the electromagnets are operable to switch between a default holding state exerting an external magnetic field, and a release state lacking said external magnetic field. The default holding state consumes no electrical power, and thus is also referred to herein as a de-energized state of the electromagnet, while the release state requires application of DC power to an electrical coil of the electromagnet, and is therefore herein as an energized state of the electromagnet. To enable control over the state of the electromagnets, the control circuit containing the wireless transmitter is also connected to the electrical coil of each electromagnet, and is configured to switch between an &#x201c;off&#x201d; state electrically isolating the power supply from the coils of the electromagnets, and an &#x201c;on&#x201d; state electrically connecting the power supply to the coils electromagnets. The control circuit is configured to maintain the &#x201c;off&#x201d; state by default. In response to a command signal sent to the receiver from the transmitter of a wireless controller <b>26</b>, whether operated by the driver of the combine harvester <b>12</b> or other personnel in the proximity thereof, the control circuit momentarily switches to the &#x201c;on&#x201d; state, thus delivering a momentary pulse of current from the power supply to the coils of the electromagnets to switch them from the holding state to the release state. After maintaining the &#x201c;on&#x201d; or release state of the circuit for the predetermined pulse length, the circuit automatically returns to the &#x201c;off&#x201d; or holding state, and remains in such off or holding state until a subsequent command signal is received producing another &#x201c;on&#x201d; or release state.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">For example, the memory module is operative to contain information regarding the number or sequence of pans that have been dropped. In the exemplary embodiment where there are four pans <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, the memory module may recall the number or which of the four pans that were dropped within its data bearing records and know which magnets to disengage when the signal controller <b>26</b> is actuated. The memory module may also be cleared if during a harvest all of the pans were not deployed, and would then be desired to start with an exemplary four pans <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> again.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In one embodiment, four exemplary pans <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> would be attached to their respective magnets <b>22</b>. The first pan <b>28</b> has the first tab <b>28</b>G interface with the magnet <b>22</b>A and the second tab <b>28</b>H interface with magnet <b>22</b>H. The second pan <b>30</b> has the first tab <b>30</b>G interface with the magnet <b>22</b>B and the second tab <b>30</b>H interface with magnet <b>22</b>G. The third pan <b>32</b> has the first tab <b>32</b>G interface with the magnet <b>22</b>C and the second tab <b>32</b>H interface with magnet <b>22</b>F. The fourth pan <b>34</b> has the first tab <b>34</b>G interface with the magnet <b>22</b>D and the second tab <b>34</b>H interface with magnet <b>22</b>E. As such, as the first pan <b>28</b> is closest to the ground initially in the exemplary embodiment, the memory module would be free of any memory relating to any of the pans having dropped. Then, when the signal controller <b>26</b> generates an activation signal, the activation signal is transmitted to the signal receiver <b>24</b> which switches from the off mode to the triggered or on mode upon receipt of the activation signal. In the case of the first pan <b>28</b>, the controller would trigger the magnet <b>22</b>A and the magnet <b>22</b>H to trigger the on mode releasing the connection from the first tab <b>28</b>G and second tab <b>28</b>H, respectively. This would cause the pan <b>28</b> to drop to the ground from the nested configuration with the rest of the pans <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>. The memory module would then create a record that may be accessed to remember that the first pan <b>28</b> had been deployed.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Continuing onward, the signal controller <b>26</b> may generate a further activation signal transmitted to the signal receiver <b>24</b> then transmitted to the controller which switches from the off mode to the triggered or on mode upon receipt of the activation signal. The memory module, knowing that the first pan <b>28</b> had been dropped, would then drop the second pan <b>30</b>. In the case of the second pan <b>30</b>, the controller would trigger the magnet <b>22</b>B and the magnet <b>22</b>G to trigger into the on mode and thus release connection from the first tab <b>30</b>G and second tab <b>30</b>H, respectively. This would cause the pan <b>30</b> to drop to the ground from the nested configuration with the rest of the pans <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>. The memory module would then create a record that may be accessed to remember that the second pan <b>30</b> had been deployed.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Further, the signal controller <b>26</b> may generate another further activation signal transmitted to the signal receiver <b>24</b> then transmitted to the controller which switches from the off mode to the triggered or on mode upon receipt of the activation signal. The memory module, knowing that the first pan <b>28</b> and second pan <b>30</b> had been dropped, would then drop the third pan <b>32</b>. In the case of the third pan <b>32</b>, the controller would trigger the magnet <b>22</b>C and the magnet <b>22</b>F to trigger into the on mode releasing the connection from the first tab <b>32</b>G and second tab <b>32</b>H, respectively. This would cause the pan <b>32</b> to drop to the ground from the nested configuration with the remaining pan <b>34</b>. The memory module would then create a record that may be accessed to remember that the third pan <b>32</b> had been deployed to the ground.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Further, the signal controller <b>26</b> may generate yet a further activation signal transmitted to the signal receiver <b>24</b> then transmitted to the controller which switches from the off mode to the triggered or on mode upon receipt of the activation signal. The memory module, knowing that the first pan <b>28</b>, second pan <b>30</b>, and third pan <b>32</b> had been dropped, would then drop the fourth pan <b>34</b>. In the case of the fourth pan <b>34</b>, the controller would trigger the magnet <b>22</b>D and the magnet <b>22</b>E to trigger into the on mode and thus release connection from the first tab <b>34</b>G and second tab <b>34</b>H, respectively. This would cause the pan <b>34</b> to drop to the ground. The memory module would then create a record that may be accessed to remember that the fourth pan <b>34</b> had been deployed to the ground.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Further configurations may use additional pans, and may use N pans. In such a case, the memory module would be operative to create and read data bearing records related to the number of pans that were still in the nested configuration versus those which were deployed. Further, additional magnets would be required to attach additional pans.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, an exemplary combine with pans shown attached to the combine <b>12</b> as well as in the field are shown. Typically, the combine harvester <b>12</b> includes a vehicle body supported on at least two ground engaging wheels <b>12</b>A for rolling movement in a forward working direction over ground. Often times that ground is carrying a crop <b>38</b> to be harvested. A header at the front end of the vehicle body includes a cutter bar <b>40</b> that spans laterally and perpendicularly to the forward working direction for cutting the crop <b>38</b> as the harvester <b>12</b> is displaced forwardly across the ground along a first direction.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The now cut crop is guided internally through the vehicle body by a feeder <b>42</b> to be threshed by a threshing <b>44</b> which functions to dislodge the grain from the remaining cut crop materials defining chaff. The crop <b>38</b> goes into a grain tank <b>46</b> while the chaff continues outward the body of the combine <b>12</b>. Sieves <b>48</b> within the harvester receive the material from the thresher for separating the grain from the chaff. A blower fan <b>50</b> is used to carry the chaff to a rear discharge of the harvester for discharging the chaff onto the ground along the bottom while a series of straw walkers <b>52</b> allow the straw of a top path to be chopped by a chopper <b>54</b> to be deposited on the ground. Depending upon the configuration of the sieves and the blower speed, varying amounts of grain from the crop can be undesirably blown from the combine harvester together with the chaff. As such, it is necessary to determine the amount of grain from crop that is interspersed with the discharged chaff in order to determine combine efficiency and optimize it for the crop.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Once a pan is dropped, the user may then collect the material deposited on the pan and separate the grain from the chaff using a separator sieve or other such device as known in the art. A measuring tube, or scale, or otherwise marked device for measuring the amount of grain collected in the pan would then be used. The various markings represent volume of grain per unit of collection area of the pan or may be weighed to give a numerical amount. Specifically, one may design a pan so that the collection area of the pan corresponds to a length of a header of the combine harvester <b>12</b> in a lateral direction of the combine harvester <b>12</b> by a width of the collection pan transverse to the lateral direction. Then, one is able to use correlation data between the volume or weight of grain collected in the pan and the length of the header of the combine harvester for the specified width of the collection pan and a specified grain type, the volume of separated grain in the measuring tube can be used to determine grain loss in units of bushels per acre.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Once a measure of grain loss has been determined, suitable adjustments can be made to the configuration of the combine harvester <b>12</b> including the configuration of the sieves <b>48</b> or the blower <b>50</b> speed for example to minimize and optimize the amount of grain loss during normal operation of the combine harvester <b>12</b>. Then, when it is desirable to gauge the grain loss of a different combine harvester <b>12</b>, or at a different portion of the combine harvester <b>12</b>, the main cover <b>14</b> housing the pans <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> are simply relocated to the different combine or alternative location on the vehicle body by releasing the magnets <b>18</b> and moving the main cover <b>14</b> together with the pans <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> to the different combine or alternative location on the vehicle body.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Various inventive concepts may be embodied as one or more methods, of which an example has been provided.
