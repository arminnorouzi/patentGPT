In particular, the present disclosure relates to cryoablation systems (e.g., cryospray systems, cryogenic ablation, cryosurgery systems etc.) that prevent or significantly inhibit cryospray gases from accumulating and progressing distally beyond a specific region within a body lumen.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Cryoablation is a surgical procedure in which diseased, damaged or otherwise undesirable tissue (collectively referred to herein as &#x201c;target tissue&#x201d;) is destroyed by focal delivery of a cryogen spray under pressure. These systems are typically referred to as cryoablation systems, cryospray systems, cryospray ablation systems, cryosurgery systems, cryosurgery spray systems and/or cryogen spray ablation systems. As typically used, &#x201c;cryogen&#x201d; refers to any fluid (e.g., gas, liquefied gas or other fluid known to one of ordinary skill in the art) with a sufficiently low boiling point (i.e., below approximately &#x2212;153&#xb0; C.) for therapeutically effective use during a cryogenic surgical procedure. Suitable cryogens may include, for example, liquid argon, liquid nitrogen and liquid helium. Pseudo-cryogens such as liquid carbon dioxide and liquid nitrous oxide that have a boiling temperature above &#x2212;153&#xb0; C. but still very low (e.g., &#x2212;89&#xb0; C. for liquid N<sub>2</sub>O) may also be used.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">During operation of a cryoablation system, a medical professional (e.g., clinician, technician, physician, surgeon etc.) directs a cryogen spray onto the surface of a treatment area via a cryogen delivery catheter. The medical professional may target the cryogen spray visually through a video-assisted device or scope, such as a bronchoscope, endoscope, colonoscope or ureteroscope. Cryogen spray exits the cryogen delivery catheter at a temperature ranging from 0&#xb0; C. to &#x2212;196&#xb0; C., causing the target tissue to freeze or &#x201c;cryofrost.&#x201d; As liquid cryogens exit the cryogen delivery catheter and impact upon the target, they convert to a gaseous state with a significant increase in volume. For example, 1 cubic centimeter (cm<sup>3</sup>) of liquid nitrogen converts to 694 cm<sup>3 </sup>of nitrogen gas at body temperature. If not properly vented from the patient, these expanding gases cause undue distention and may have life-threatening consequences, including, for example, pneumothorax of the lungs and perforations of the upper or lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">There is an ongoing need for cryoablation systems and methods which block the distal progression of expanding cryospray gases within body lumens, and actively or passively vent such gases outside of the patient.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure, in its various aspects, meets an ongoing need in the field of cryoablation for a system that prevents or significantly inhibits cryospray gases from accumulating and progressing distally beyond a specific region of a body lumen.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one aspect, the present disclosure provides a cryoablation system, comprising an endoscope which includes a proximal portion, a distal portion, and at least one working channel extending therebetween; a cryogen delivery catheter disposed within a working channel of the endoscope, the cryogen delivery catheter comprising a proximal end, distal end configured for the output of cryogen spray, and a lumen extending therebetween; and an expandable member moveable between a deflated configuration and an inflated configuration and including a conduit comprising a proximal inlet and a distal outlet, wherein the distal outlet is fluidly connected to an interior of the expandable member.

The expandable member may move from the deflated configuration to the inflated configuration by flowing a fluid into the interior of the expandable member. The expandable member may move from the inflated configuration to the deflated configuration by flowing a fluid through the conduit and out of the interior of the expandable member. The expandable member may comprise a non-compliant or semi-compliant material. For example, the non-compliant or semi-compliant material may comprise a polymer including, but not limited to, PEBAX, PET, PEN, PBT, PEEK, Hytrel, polyurethane and nylon.

As used herein, &#x201c;diameter&#x201d; refers to the distance of a straight line extending between two points and does not necessarily indicate a particular shape.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As used herein, the term &#x201c;passive venting&#x201d; refers to the unassisted egress of gases from within a body lumen to an external location, through body lumen and natural orifice or through a ventilation tube passing through the same. As used herein, the term &#x201c;active venting&#x201d; refers to the mechanically-assisted egress (e.g., via a suction source) of gases from with a body lumen to an external location through a ventilation tube.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As used herein, the term &#x201c;conduit&#x201d; may refer to a member containing one or more lumens (e.g., inflation, deflation, and/or venting lumens). Alternatively, a conduit may refer to multiple members containing one or more lumens (e.g., multiple members alongside each other each containing inflation, deflation, and/or venting lumens).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The present disclosure generally provides cryoablation systems configured to block the distal progression of materials and/or substances, including, but not limited to, cryospray gases (hereafter referred to as &#x201c;cryospray&#x201d;) within a body lumen, and simultaneously vent such cryospray to prevent their accumulation. Exemplary cryoablation systems in which the present disclosure may be implemented include, but are not limited to, those systems described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,301,796, and 9,144,449, and U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 11/956,890, 12/022,013, 14/012,320, and 14/869,814, each of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, in one embodiment a cryoablation system <b>10</b> of the present disclosure may include an endoscope <b>102</b> comprising a proximal portion <b>104</b>, a distal portion <b>106</b> and a first working channel <b>108</b><i>a </i>extending therebetween. The endoscope <b>102</b> may include any appropriate size, although smaller diagnostic endoscopes are preferably used to facilitate navigation within body passageways and facilitate patient comfort. The endoscope <b>102</b> may further include a second working channel <b>108</b><i>b </i>configured to vent the cryospray delivered from the cryogen delivery catheter <b>110</b> (discussed below). In one embodiment, the second working channel <b>108</b><i>b </i>is configured for passive venting of the cryospray. In another embodiment, the second working channel <b>108</b><i>b </i>is connected to a suction source (e.g., pump, not depicted) to facilitate active venting of the cryospray. In addition, or alternatively, a vent tube may be passed through the second working channel <b>108</b><i>b </i>for active or passive venting of the cryospray. As will be understood by those in the art, the diameter of the second working channel <b>108</b><i>b </i>through which the cryospray passively or actively vents must be adequate to ensure that organ or body cavity distention does not occur. In addition, or alternatively, a tube (e.g., sleeve) may be disposed around or independent of an outer surface of the endoscope for passive or active venting of cryospray, leaving the working channel(s) of the endoscope available for other medical tools. Passive venting of cryospray may also be achieved in the absence of an active or passive tube or working channel by managing the body lumen to maintain proper circulation and egress of gases. For example, the respective entry point (e.g., esophagus, rectum etc.) of the body lumen may be maintained in an open configuration to ensure that internal air pressure at or near the site of the cryoablation procedure remains equal to the atmospheric pressure (e.g., the pressure outside the body). In addition, or alternatively, the position of the patient on the operating table may be adjusted (i.e., lying flat, prone, inclined, declined, on their left or right side) to prevent the lumen from partially or completely collapsing under the patient's own weight.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">A cryogen delivery catheter <b>110</b> may be disposed within the first working channel <b>108</b><i>a </i>of the endoscope <b>102</b>. The cryogen delivery catheter <b>110</b> may include a proximal end <b>112</b>, a distal end <b>114</b> and a lumen <b>116</b> extending therebetween. The distal end <b>114</b> may include closed or open-ended configurations, with or without side apertures disposed around a portion or whole of the circumference thereof. Cryogen (e.g., liquid nitrogen) may be delivered from an external storage tank (not depicted) connected to the proximal end <b>112</b> of the cryogen delivery catheter <b>110</b>, through the lumen <b>116</b> to exit through side and/or end aperture(s) at distal end <b>114</b>. The distal end <b>114</b> of the cryogen delivery catheter <b>110</b> may include one or more apertures configured to convert the cryogen flowing through the lumen <b>116</b> into a pressurized, e.g., low pressure cryogen spray. The cryogen delivery catheter may include various sensors, e.g., temperature sensor, and may be connected to a console with controls that may be necessary or useful to control and monitor a cryospray procedure, including for example regulation of cryogen flow based on temperature feedback, other procedural parameters, venting, etc. In one embodiment, the cryogen delivery catheter may be constructed of three layers of flexible polyimide, surrounded by a stainless steel braid, which is coated with an outer layer of Pebax. As understood by those in the art, extrusion of Pebax over the stainless steel braid allows the Pebax to wick through the pitch of the steel braid, helping to prevent kinking, breaking or delaminating during retroflex of the cryogen delivery catheter.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">As apparent to those of skill in the art, the cryogen delivery catheter of the present disclosure may include a variety of suitable materials and/or dimensions depending on the demands of the particular application. As used herein, the term &#x201c;retroflex&#x201d; refers to the ability of a medical instrument to bend or turn approximately 180&#xb0; about a radius of curvature or 1 inch or less.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The cryoablation system <b>10</b> may further include an expandable member <b>118</b> configured to move from a deflated (i.e., collapsed) configuration to an inflated (i.e., expanded) configuration by flowing an inflation fluid into the interior of the expandable member through a conduit <b>120</b>. The conduit <b>120</b> may include a proximal inlet <b>122</b> fluidly connected to an external fluid source (not shown) and a distal outlet <b>124</b> fluidly connected to the interior of the expandable member <b>118</b>. In one embodiment, the conduit <b>120</b> may include a dual-lumen configuration for separate inflow (e.g., inflation lumen) and outflow (e.g., deflation lumen) of inflation fluid. In another embodiment, the conduit may include a single lumen for inflow and outflow of inflation fluid, and a separate/alternate working channel or guidewire lumen. In one embodiment, expandable member <b>118</b> may move from a deflated configuration to an expanded configuration by flowing the inflation fluid into the interior of the expandable member <b>118</b> through the conduit <b>120</b>. The expandable member <b>118</b> may return to the deflated configuration by flowing the inflation fluid from the interior of the expandable member <b>118</b> back to the external fluid source through the conduit <b>120</b>. The inflation fluid may include a variety of physiologically inert liquids (e.g., buffered solutions such as sterile saline) or gases (e.g., air, oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, helium etc.) as are known in the art. It should be appreciated that the inflatable member should be positioned sufficiently distal to the cryogen delivery catheter such that the cryospray does not cause the liquids within the expandable member to freeze, or the gases within the expandable member to condense to the point that the expandable member contracts/deflates. Alternatively, liquids resistant to freezing at cryogen temperatures may be chosen so the expandable member can be located closer to the cryogen delivery catheter. In one embodiment, an inner or outer surface of the expandable member may include one or more temperature sensors and/or pressure gauges to allow the temperature of the expandable member to be monitored during the cryospray procedure.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">It will be appreciated that the expandable member <b>118</b> may be provided in a variety of different inflated dimensions in order to block a range of lumen sizes. In one embodiment, the expandable member (e.g., balloon) may include a combination of elastomeric and semi-compliant to non-compliant materials, such as thermoplastics and/or thermosets. The semi-compliant nature of these materials is desirable in some embodiments to ensure that the expandable member does not over-expand within the target body lumen. Examples of thermoplastics include polyolefins; polyamides (e.g., nylon, such as nylon 12, nylon 11, nylon 6/12, nylon 6, nylon 66); polyesters (e.g., polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), polytrimethylene terephthalate (PTT)); polyethers; polyurethanes; polyvinyls; polyacrylics; fluoropolymers; copolymers and block copolymers thereof, such as block copolymers of polyether and polyamide (e.g., PEBAX&#xae;); and mixtures thereof. Examples of thermosets include elastomers (e.g., EPDM), epichlorohydrin, polyureas, nitrile butadiene elastomers and silicones. Other examples of thermosets include epoxies and isocyanates. Biocompatible thermosets may also be used. Biocompatible thermosets include, for example, biodegradable polycaprolactone, poly(dimethylsiloxane) containing polyurethanes and ureas and polysiloxanes. Ultraviolet curable polymers, such as polyimides and acrylic or methacrylic polymers and copolymers can also be used. Other examples of polymers that can be used in balloons include polyethylenes, polyethylene ionomers, polyethylene copolymers, polyetheretherketone (PEEK), thermoplastic polyester elastomers (e.g., Hytrel&#xae;) and combinations thereof. Other polymers are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Pub. No. 2005/0043679, filed on Aug. 21, 2003, entitled &#x201c;Medical Balloons,&#x201d; the disclosure of which is incorporated in its entirety herein by reference. Expandable members may be folded, pleated and/or covered by a sheath until deployed to protect the expandable member and facilitate delivery within/through body lumens. Radiopaque materials may be incorporated into or onto the compliant, semi-compliant or non-compliant materials to allow the location of the expandable member to be visualized with systems capable of detection of radiopaque materials within the patient.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In another embodiment, a compliant expandable member may be desirable to establish and maintain firm contact with the tissue wall of amorphous and/or asymmetrically shaped lumens. As compared to non-compliant or semi-compliant materials, an expandable member formed from a compliant material will expand indefinitely (i.e., does not have a fixed final diameter). These expandable members are composed of materials with compliances preferably in the range of 10% to 800%, and more preferably in the range of 50% to 200%. Examples of compliant materials include elastomers such as silicone rubber, ethylene-propylene-diene copolymers, butyl rubber, styrene-isobutylene-styrene copolymers, urethanes, and latexes, among others.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In another embodiment, the cryogen delivery catheter may be used independent of an endoscope. For example, the cryogen delivery catheter <b>110</b> may include a steerable distal end <b>114</b> with a camera and light source to allow the medical professional to navigate through the body lumen to the target tissue site. The cryogen delivery catheter may include a working channel, separate from the lumen <b>116</b>, through which an expandable member <b>118</b> may be introduced and deployed to a site distally beyond the target tissue. Alternatively, the expandable member <b>118</b> may be introduced and deployed into the body lumen through a separate delivery tube or sheath, independent of the cryogen delivery catheter. As discussed below, cryospray that advances distally beyond the expandable member <b>118</b> may be actively and/or passively vented through a vent tube <b>126</b> which passes through, and extends distally beyond, the expandable member <b>118</b>. Cryospray proximal of the expandable member <b>118</b> may be vented through the working channel of the cryogen delivery catheter <b>110</b> and/or through a separate vent tube. In addition, or alternatively, cryospray proximal of the expandable member <b>118</b> may be passively vented without the assistance of a vent tube or working channel by managing the lumen and/or patient to maintain proper circulation and egress of gases, as discussed above.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In another embodiment, the cryoablation system may include a separate cryogen delivery catheter and endoscope (i.e., the cryogen delivery catheter is not disposed within a working channel of the endoscope). The expandable member <b>118</b> may be introduced through: 1) a working channel of the endoscope, 2) a working channel of the cryogen delivery catheter or 3) through a separate vent tube independent of both the cryogen delivery catheter and endoscope. As discussed below, cryospray that advances distally beyond the expandable member <b>118</b> may be actively and/or passively vented through a vent tube <b>126</b> which passes through, and extends distally beyond, the expandable member <b>118</b>. Cryospray proximal of the expandable member may be vented through a working channel of the endoscope and/or through a separate vent tube. In addition, or alternatively, cryospray proximal of the expandable member <b>118</b> may be passively vented without the assistance of a vent tube or working channel by managing the lumen and/or patient to maintain proper circulation and egress of gases, as discussed above.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In use, and by way of example, the expandable member <b>118</b> may be introduced in the deflated configuration through the rectum <b>142</b> into the colon <b>144</b> distally beyond a target tissue <b>130</b>. Once properly positioned (e.g., between the splenic flexure <b>146</b> and hepatic flexure <b>148</b>), the expandable member <b>118</b> is moved to the inflated configuration such that at least a portion of the outer surface <b>119</b> contacts all, or substantially all, of the tissues about a circumference of the colon wall. With the expandable member positioned distally beyond the target tissue, the endoscope <b>102</b> is advanced into the colon <b>144</b> such that distal portion <b>106</b> is positioned adjacent to, or in the vicinity of, the target tissue <b>130</b>. The cryogen delivery catheter <b>110</b> is then advanced distally beyond the distal portion <b>106</b> of the endoscope <b>102</b> such that the distal end <b>114</b> of the cryogen delivery catheter is adjacent to the target tissue <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Alternatively, the endoscope <b>102</b> may be advanced distally beyond the target tissue <b>130</b> such that the distal portion <b>106</b> of the endoscope is positioned at the desired expandable member deployment site within the colon <b>144</b>. The expandable member <b>118</b> may then be advanced in a deflated configuration through a working channel (e.g., second working channel <b>108</b><i>b</i>) of the endoscope <b>102</b> and into the colon <b>144</b>. Once properly positioned within the colon <b>144</b>, the expandable member <b>118</b> is moved to the inflated configuration (as discussed above), and the endoscope <b>102</b> is retracted proximally to position the distal portion <b>106</b> adjacent to, or in the vicinity of, the target tissue <b>130</b>. The cryogen delivery catheter <b>110</b> is then advanced distally beyond the distal portion <b>106</b> of the endoscope <b>102</b> through the first working channel <b>108</b><i>a </i>such that distal end <b>114</b> is adjacent to the target tissue, as discussed above.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The medical professional then releases cryogen from an external cryogen source (not depicted) through the lumen <b>116</b> of the cryogen delivery catheter. The cryogen warms and boils as it exits the cryogen delivery catheter, resulting in a cold cryospray emerging from the distal end <b>114</b> onto the target tissue <b>130</b>. Freezing of the target tissue may be visualized by the acquisition of a white color, referred to as cryofrost. The white color indicates the onset of mucosal tissue freezing to initiate destruction of the target tissue. The medical professional may increase or decrease the duration of the cryospray treatment depending on the size and/or depth of the target tissue.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Cryospray that converts to gaseous form and accumulates within the lumen of the colon <b>144</b> may passively vent through the first working channel <b>108</b><i>a </i>of the endoscope to a location external to the patient. Alternatively, or in addition, cryospray that converts to gaseous form may be actively vented through the first working channel <b>108</b><i>a </i>under suction. As discussed above, passive venting of cryospray that converts to gaseous form may also be achieved in the absence of (or in addition to) active or passive venting through the first working channel <b>108</b><i>a </i>of the endoscope by managing the body lumen to maintain proper circulation and egress of gases. Once the cryoablation procedure is completed, and adequate venting is allowed to proceed, the expandable member is returned to the deflated configuration and the conduit with the expandable member, endoscope and cryogen delivery catheter are withdrawn from the patient.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> depicts an alternative embodiment, in which the cryoablation system depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> includes a vent tube <b>126</b> (e.g., cryogen decompression tube) to further assist in evacuation of the cryospray, and other undesirable fluids and particles etc. Although the vent tube <b>126</b> is depicted as extending distally beyond the distal portion <b>106</b> of the endoscope <b>102</b>, it will be appreciated that vent tube <b>126</b> may be positioned in a variety of locations relative to the distal portion <b>106</b> of the endoscope <b>102</b>. The vent tube may connect via supplied accessory connection tubing (not depicted) to an external suction canister (not depicted) for active venting of the treatment area. Alternatively, the vent tube may include dual-lumens that provide both active (i.e., connected to a suction pump) and passive (direct to ambient atmosphere) vent paths.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> depicts another alternative embodiment, in which the vent tube <b>126</b> passes through, and extends distally beyond, the expandable member <b>118</b>.

The expandable member forms a tight seal around the outer surface of the vent tube <b>126</b> such that the respective lumens of the expandable member and vent tube remain separated and uncompromised. In this configuration, the vent tube may actively and/or passively vent cryospray that has advanced distally beyond the expandable member <b>118</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, the expandable member <b>218</b> may be introduced in the deflated configuration through the mouth <b>242</b> into the esophagus <b>244</b> and distally beyond a target tissue <b>230</b>.
