Field</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The disclosure relates generally to an improved computer system and, more specifically, to a method, apparatus, computer system, and computer program product for automatically calculating tax credits values based on data from human capital management systems.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Information systems are used for many different purposes. For example, an information system may be used by a human resources department to maintain benefits and other records about employees. For example, the human resources department may manage health insurance, wellness plans, and other programs in an organization using the information system.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">As another example, the information system may be used to run a payroll to generate paychecks for the employees in the organization. The information system in the form of a payroll processing system performs functions, such as calculating salary payments, bonuses, deductions, withholdings, taxes, and other suitable functions involved with running the payroll for the organization.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Different: departments in the organization may have responsibilities that impact payroll processing. For example, a benefits department in the organization may have a retirement benefits policy that is used to manage retirement benefits. This department may manage eligibility, vesting schedules, withholdings, and other items relating to the retirement benefits.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">As another example, the human resources department may have a policy for uniform benefits. The human resources department may identify which employees may be eligible to receive a uniform allowance for dress codes for a particular position. The policy may define who is eligible for a uniform allowance, how claims are submitted, and how credits may be obtained.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Different policies in the different departments result in reimbursements, deductions, bonuses, and other items that are taken into account when processing tax liability for the organization. Determining a tax liability for the organization based on the policies of the different departments in the organization is complex and time-consuming. For example, for organizations having different geographic locations, the tax liability may be dependent on laws for a particular geographic location, such as a city, a state, or a country.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, it would be desirable to have a method and apparatus that take into account at least some of the issues discussed above, as well as other possible issues.

Instead, storyboard interface <b>218</b> provides an inventive concept that allows traders to visualize tax incentives more efficiently and accurately as well as generate documents for claiming these incentives. Rather than the routine or conventional use of computers or the Internet, storyboard interface <b>218</b> overcomes problems that are necessarily rooted in computer technology and that specifically arise in the realm of computer networks, resulting in an improvement to the capabilities of tax calculation system <b>202</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In this illustrative example, incentive calculator <b>206</b> in computer system <b>204</b> is configured to determine a tax incentive <b>220</b> for an employer. Tax incentive <b>220</b> can be, for example, one or more of a credit, a deduction, or an exemption. As used herein, a tax credit is a tax incentive which allows certain taxpayers to subtract the amount of the credit from the total they owe the state. It may also be a credit granted in recognition of taxes already paid or a form of state support. In contrast to a tax credit, a tax deduction is a reduction of income that is able to be taxed and is commonly a result of expenses, particularly those incurred to produce additional income. The difference between deductions, exemptions and credits is that deductions and exemptions both reduce taxable income, while credits reduce tax.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Incentive calculator <b>206</b> is configured to display a set of cards <b>222</b> on a storyboard interface <b>218</b>.

In this illustrative example, tax evaluation environment <b>300</b> includes components that can be implemented to determine a tax incentive under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">As depicted, the set of criteria <b>226</b> includes an eligible employer <b>302</b> criterion and a qualified wage criterion <b>304</b>. Under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, employers, including tax-exempt organizations, are eligible for the credit if they operate a trade or business during a calendar year and experience either: (a) the full or partial suspension of the operation of their trade or business during any calendar quarter because of governmental orders limiting commerce, travel, or group meetings due to COVID-19; or (b) a significant decline in gross receipts.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Determining either of a suspension of operations or a significant decline in gross receipts may require information from a number of different sources. For example, information <b>232</b> that is relevant to a particular criterion may be generated and maintained by a number of different systems, such as payroll, human resources, operations, accounting, and combinations thereof. Furthermore, jurisdictional mandates may be found outside of an employer's organization. In an illustrative example, incentive calculator <b>206</b> can retrieve information, such as payroll <b>306</b>, human resources <b>308</b>, operation <b>310</b>, and jurisdictional mandate <b>312</b>, from a number of disparate sources, and record them in a centralized location.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">As depicted, data fields <b>230</b> include work locations <b>316</b>, eligibility date <b>318</b>, and employee data <b>320</b>.

As used herein, a &#x201c;political map&#x201d; is a map that shows the geographic boundaries between governmental units such as countries, states, and counties. Incentive calculator <b>206</b> distinguishes particular ones of governmental units <b>324</b> within political map <b>322</b> based on an overlap of the operations <b>310</b> information and the jurisdictional mandate <b>312</b>. For example, jurisdictions in which the employer is doing business and have been affected by a shutdown order may be visually distinguished from other jurisdictions, such as by displaying governmental units <b>324</b> in one or more different colors.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In one illustrative example, calculating the tax incentive further comprises calculating a first portion <b>326</b> of the tax incentive based on a number of salaried employees <b>328</b>; and calculating a second portion <b>330</b> of the tax incentive based on a number of hourly employees <b>332</b>.
