In the interest of clarity, not all features of an actual implementation are described in this disclosure. Moreover, the language used in this disclosure has been selected for readability and instructional purposes, has not been selected to delineate or circumscribe the disclosed subject matter. Rather the appended claims are intended for such purpose.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Various embodiments of the disclosed concepts are illustrated by way of example and not by way of limitation in the accompanying drawings in which like references indicate similar elements. For simplicity and clarity of illustration, where appropriate, reference numerals have been repeated among the different figures to indicate corresponding or analogous elements. In addition, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the implementations described herein. In other instances, methods, procedures and components have not been described in detail so as not to obscure the related relevant function being described. References to &#x201c;an,&#x201d; &#x201c;one,&#x201d; or &#x201c;another&#x201d; embodiment in this disclosure are not necessarily to the same or different embodiment, and they mean at least one. A given figure may be used to illustrate the features of more than one embodiment, or more than one species of the disclosure, and not all elements in the figure may be required for a given embodiment or species. A reference number, when provided in a given drawing, refers to the same element throughout the several drawings, though it may not be repeated in every drawing. The drawings are not to scale unless otherwise indicated, and the proportions of certain parts may be exaggerated to better illustrate details and features of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary wireless power transfer system <b>100</b>. The wireless power transfer system includes a power transmitter (PTx) <b>102</b> and a power receiver (PRx) <b>104</b>. Power transmitter <b>102</b> may be any of a variety of devices, such as a charging mat, pad, or stand; a charging puck; or an electronic device that is capable of both receiving and delivering wireless power. Power receiver <b>104</b> can also be any of a variety of devices, including a battery-powered electronic device such as a smartphone, smart watch, tablet computer, laptop computer, a wireless accessory such as a stylus, wireless earphones, etc., or a charging case for any of the foregoing. In the illustrated embodiment, input power Pin is delivered to a regulator <b>110</b>, that in turn powers power transmitter <b>102</b>. In some embodiments, regulator <b>110</b> could be part of power transmitter <b>102</b>. In other embodiments, it may be a separate device, such as an AC/DC adapter that plugs into a wall socket to receive mains power. In any case, regulator <b>110</b> delivers DC power to an inverter <b>120</b>. Inverter <b>120</b> may be operated to generate an AC voltage that is delivered to the power transmitting coil Ltx, which magnetically couples to a power receiving coil Lrx in the wireless power receiver <b>104</b>, discussed in greater detail below. The power transmitter circuit path may also include a tuning capacitor Ctx. Details of wireless power transmitter design and construction beyond the scope of this disclosure are omitted for clarity and brevity. Suffice it to say that the circuits and systems described herein may be used in conjunction with a wide variety of wireless power transmitter types.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Wireless power receiver <b>104</b> may also take a number of forms. In the illustrated example, wireless power receiver <b>104</b> is a battery powered electronic device. Wireless power receiver <b>104</b> includes a power receiving coil Lrx that may be positioned so as to be magnetically coupled to the power transmitting coil Ltx. Wireless power receiver <b>104</b> may also include a tuning capacitor Crx. The magnetic coupling between transmitter coil Ltx and receiver coil Lrx allows energy to be delivered from wireless power transmitter <b>102</b> to wireless power receiver. More specifically, a voltage may be induced at the input of rectifier <b>140</b>, which may deliver a DC voltage to the various electronic systems of wireless power receiver <b>104</b> as described in greater detail below. Rectifier <b>140</b> may be a passive rectifier, for example a diode bridge, or may be an active rectifier made up of multiple switching components operated as a controlled rectifier. Further details of wireless power receiver design and construction beyond the scope of this disclosure are omitted for clarity and brevity. Suffice it to say that the circuits and systems described herein may be used in conjunction with a wide variety of wireless power receiver and electronic device types.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">As mentioned above, rectifier <b>140</b> may power a power management unit (PMU) <b>148</b> that delivers power to various subsystems of a portable electronic device. One example of such subsystem is a processing system <b>151</b>, which can for example include a system on a chip &#x201c;SoC&#x201d; or other processor/processor complex, including storage and memory systems, etc.). Another such subsystem is a communications system <b>153</b>, which can include cellular, WiFi, Bluetooth, and/or other radios and appurtenances. Another subsystem could be input/output system <b>155</b>, which can include displays, loudspeakers, microphones, touch or other input devices, etc. Additional or alternative electronic subsystems may be provided as appropriate for a given embodiment. Rectifier <b>140</b> may also supply power to a battery charger circuit <b>144</b>, which may be used to charge a battery <b>146</b>. Additionally, when other power sources, such as the wireless system or a separate wired power system are not available, the battery can supply power via PMU <b>148</b> to the various subsystems discussed above.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary battery powered electronic device <b>200</b> capable of bidirectional wireless power transfer. In other words, wireless power receiver <b>104</b> can either receive power from a wireless power transmitter <b>202</b> as described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> or can deliver power to a wireless power receiver. To accommodate bidirectional operation, rectifier <b>140</b> may be replaced with a bidirectional rectifier/inverter <b>240</b>. Thus, when a wireless power transmitter induces a voltage across receive coil Lrx, rectifier inverter may be operated as a rectifier to produce a DC output for powering the various subsystems and charging the battery as described above. Conversely if device <b>202</b> is a wireless power receiver, it may have a rectifier <b>220</b> (or an inverter/rectifier <b>220</b>). Rectifier/inverter <b>240</b> of the &#x201c;receiver&#x201d; may be operated as an inverter to drive &#x201c;receive&#x201d; coil Lrx so as to transmit power to magnetically coupled inductor Ltx. Thus, in the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, device <b>202</b> may be a wireless power transmitter, in which case inverter/rectifier <b>220</b> operates as an inverter and rectifier/inverter <b>240</b> operates as a rectifier. Alternatively, device <b>202</b> may be a wireless power receiver, in which case inverter/rectifier <b>220</b> operates as a rectifier and rectifier inverter <b>240</b> operates as an inverter to drive receiver coil Lrx as a transmitter coil. As a result, device <b>202</b> that is coupled to device <b>200</b> may be a wireless power transmitter, a wireless power receiver, or may be capable of both modes of operation.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">As a result of the above-described operating modes, the &#x201c;transmitter&#x201d; and &#x201c;receiver&#x201d; nomenclature may be slightly confusing; however, it is preserved for sake of consistency among the various embodiments. In any case, electronic device <b>200</b> may be operated in various modes. In a wireless power receive mode, it can receive power via its wireless power system <b>241</b>, which power may be used to power its various subsystems via PMU <b>248</b> and to charge its battery <b>246</b>. Alternatively, electronic device <b>200</b> may be operated in a battery powered mode, in which case the battery may be used to power the various subsystems via PMU <b>248</b>. (The various subsystems discussed above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> have been omitted from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> for brevity, but it should be understood that one or more of these various systems may also be present.) Additionally, in some embodiments, electronic device <b>200</b> in its battery powered mode can supply power to another device via wireless power system <b>241</b>. In some cases, electronic device <b>200</b> may also include a separate wired power system (not shown) that can be used as a separate power input, power output or both. To facilitate the bidirectional operation described above, in which device <b>200</b> can either charge its battery from wireless power system <b>241</b> (or optionally the wired power system not shown) or can use its battery <b>246</b> to power another device via wireless power system <b>241</b>, a three level buck boost converter <b>243</b> is provided, operation of which is described in greater detail below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>B</figref> illustrate operation of a three-level buck-boost converter in a buck mode (e.g., drawing power from the wireless system). More specifically, circuit block <b>301</b> illustrates a schematic of a three level buck boost converter. When operated in the buck mode, power flows from the input voltage Vin (which may be coupled to the Vbus voltage that is the output of rectifier <b>240</b>) to the output voltage Vout (VDDMAIN), which may be supplied to the PMU <b>248</b> and battery <b>246</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> above and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>6</b></figref> below. The three level buck converter can include a disconnect switch/diode arrangement <b>311</b>. This arrangement can allow power to flow from the rectifier output to the three level buck under any operating condition (via the diode). The switch may be turned on to reduce losses associated with the forward voltage drop of the diode. Likewise, power delivery (in the boost mode discussed below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) may be enabled by turning on the switch.

This requires higher charge currents, which can result in substantially increased conduction losses (sometimes called I<sup>2</sup>R losses). For example, doubling the charging current can increase conduction losses by a factor of four. This effect can be mitigated by switching from a single cell or fixed multi-cell battery design to a 2S/2P battery design. As used herein, 2S/2P battery design refers to a configuration in which the battery includes two (or more) cells that are configured so as to charge in series and discharge in parallel. By connecting the two cells in series for charging, the voltage is effectively doubled, meaning that the same power can be delivered with half the current (reducing the conduction losses). Discharging the cells in parallel can reduce the down conversion ratio required to supply various loads, potentially allowing for reduced device voltage ratings and increased operating efficiency.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates a simplified block diagram of a power system of a battery powered electronic device incorporating a three-level buck-boost converter (as described above) and a 2S/2P battery arrangement. The power system includes wireless system <b>241</b>, which, as described above, may be either a source of power for the device or may be used to wirelessly transfer power to another device. Wireless system <b>241</b> is coupled to a three level buck boost converter <b>243</b>, which may be operated as described above to either down convert (buck) power from the wireless system to the battery and PMU <b>248</b> or up convert (boost) power form the battery to wireless system <b>241</b>. The battery arrangement in this case includes two cells <b>246</b><i>a </i>and <b>246</b><i>b</i>, which may be charged in series (2S) and discharged in parallel (2P) via operation of switches S<b>1</b>-S<b>4</b> as described in greater detail below.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Facilitating the 2S/2P operation is a ladder of switching devices S<b>1</b>-S<b>4</b> coupled between three level buck converter <b>243</b> and ground. These switches may be turned on or off by controller <b>560</b> (which can be configured to generate suitable drive signals for switches S<b>1</b>-S<b>4</b>) to connect cells <b>246</b><i>a </i>and <b>246</b><i>b </i>in series or parallel depending on the mode of operation. More specifically, to facilitate series charging of cells <b>246</b><i>a </i>and <b>246</b><i>b</i>, switches S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b>, and S<b>4</b> may be turned off, while switch S<b>3</b> is turned on. This results in current path <b>502</b>, which charges cells <b>246</b><i>a </i>and <b>246</b><i>b </i>in series via three level buck boost converter <b>243</b>. Also, in the charging mode, PMU <b>248</b> receives power via cell <b>246</b><i>b</i>. Viewed another way, a portion of the charging current that charges cell <b>246</b><i>a </i>is diverted to PMU <b>248</b> before reaching cell <b>246</b><i>b</i>. Subsystems <b>151</b>, <b>153</b>, and <b>155</b> are omitted from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> for brevity, but it is understood that one or more such subsystems powered by PMU <b>248</b> may be present. In any case, because the presence of PMU <b>248</b> prevents cells <b>246</b><i>a </i>and <b>246</b><i>b </i>from being strictly in series, i.e., experiencing identical current, the difference between the charging current provided to cell <b>246</b><i>a </i>and to cell <b>246</b><i>b </i>(i.e., the charging current of cell <b>246</b><i>a </i>less the current to PMU <b>248</b>) can result in an imbalance between cells <b>246</b><i>a </i>and <b>246</b><i>b </i>that may be addressed as described in greater detail below.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">To facilitate parallel discharge of cells <b>246</b><i>a </i>and <b>246</b><i>b</i>, switches S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b>, and S<b>4</b> may be turned on, while switch S<b>3</b> is turned off (i.e., the complement or inverse of the switching state that permits 2S charging). This allows cell <b>246</b><i>a </i>to discharge via path <b>504</b><i>a</i>. In other words, switch S<b>4</b> being on allows current flow from cell <b>246</b><i>a </i>to three level buck boost converter <b>243</b> to power the wireless system to provide power to another wireless power transfer enabled device. Likewise, cell <b>246</b><i>a </i>can supply power to PMU <b>248</b> via switches S<b>4</b>, S<b>1</b>, and S<b>2</b>. Similarly, cell <b>246</b><i>b </i>can supply power to three level buck boost converter <b>243</b> via turned on switches S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b> via path <b>504</b><i>b</i>. Finally, PMU <b>248</b> may also draw power from cell <b>246</b><i>b </i>via its direct connection. To summarize, all loads, i.e., wireless system <b>241</b> via three level buck boost converter <b>243</b> and PMU <b>248</b> can both draw power from cells <b>246</b><i>a </i>and <b>246</b><i>b </i>in parallel. However, it will be appreciated that the cells are not strictly connected in parallel. For example, cell <b>246</b><i>a </i>can power three level buck boost converter <b>243</b> through a single switch S<b>4</b>, while cell <b>246</b><i>b </i>can power three level buck boost converter <b>243</b> through two switches, S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b>. Thus, there will be a slight difference in impedance as between the two current paths (including additional differences that may be introduced by different conductor lengths). Similarly, cell <b>246</b><i>b </i>can power PMU <b>248</b> with no intervening switches, while cell <b>246</b><i>a </i>can power PMU only through a current path that includes three switches S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b>, and S<b>4</b>. Thus, like in the charging case, an imbalance as between the cells can occur, although the imbalance introduced during discharge may be substantially smaller because it is caused by relatively small differences in current path impedance (including the relatively small ON-resistance of the various switching devices), while the discharging imbalance is occasioned by the relatively larger power draw of the PMU <b>248</b> and subsystems powered thereby.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates a power system of a battery powered electronic device incorporating a 2S/2P battery arrangement and a flyback-based cell balancer <b>600</b>. Flyback balancer <b>600</b> can be coupled across cell <b>246</b><i>a </i>at terminals C<b>1</b>X and C<b>1</b>Y and across cell <b>246</b><i>b </i>at terminals C<b>2</b>X and C<b>2</b>Y. Flyback cell balancer <b>600</b> can include coupled inductors L<b>1</b> and L<b>2</b> connected with the asymmetric polarity shown, together with corresponding switching devices S<b>5</b> and S<b>6</b>. Switches S<b>5</b> and S<b>6</b> may be turned off entirely, disabling flyback cell balancer <b>600</b>. In operation, switches S<b>5</b> and S<b>6</b> may be operated complementarily, that is, when S<b>5</b> is turned on, S<b>6</b> is turned off and vice-versa. The switches may be driven with a pulse width modulated (PWM) signal responsive to the difference in state of charge as between cells <b>246</b><i>a </i>and <b>246</b><i>b</i>. For identical cells, cell voltage may serve as a proxy for state of charge. For cells having different capacities and/or different chemistries, battery monitoring systems may be used to provide the respective cells' states of charge to the balancer controller <b>601</b>. Responsive to the degree of imbalance between the cells, balancer controller <b>601</b> can generate drive signals for switches S<b>5</b> and S<b>6</b> to facilitate charge transfer from the more charged cell to the less charged cell.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">More specifically, assume that the system illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is operating in a mode in which cells <b>246</b><i>a </i>and <b>246</b><i>b </i>are being charged from wireless system <b>241</b>. As discussed above, switch S<b>3</b> is closed, and switches S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b>, and S<b>4</b> are open. Charging current flows along illustrated path <b>502</b> through cells <b>246</b><i>a </i>and <b>246</b><i>b</i>. However, the current through the respective cells is not identical because a certain amount of current is delivered to PMU <b>248</b> to power other systems of the electronic device. Thus, cell <b>246</b><i>a </i>will charge at a faster rate than cell <b>246</b><i>b</i>. When this difference in state of charge (SoC) is detected, balancer controller <b>601</b> can generate PWM drive signals for switch S<b>5</b> and complementary drive signals for switch S<b>6</b> to transfer charge from cell <b>246</b><i>a </i>to <b>246</b><i>b</i>. When switch S<b>5</b> is turned on, cell <b>246</b><i>a </i>will cause a linearly increasing current to flow in inductor L<b>1</b>, storing energy therein. When switch S<b>5</b> is turned off and switch S<b>6</b> is turned on, the energy stored in the previous half switching cycle will be delivered from inductor L<b>2</b> via switch S<b>6</b> to cell <b>246</b><i>b</i>. Thus, balancer <b>600</b> can operate as a flyback converter to deliver energy from cell <b>246</b><i>a </i>to <b>246</b><i>b</i>, with switch S<b>5</b> acting as the main switch and switch S<b>6</b> acting as a synchronous rectifier switch. The reverse operation is also possible, namely to transfer energy from cell <b>246</b><i>b </i>to cell <b>246</b><i>a</i>, switch S<b>6</b> may be driven as the main switch, storing energy from cell <b>246</b><i>b </i>in the coupled inductor arrangement, and switch S<b>5</b> may be operated as a synchronous rectifier switch, delivering the stored energy to cell <b>246</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates a power system of a battery powered electronic device incorporating a 2S/2P battery arrangement and a switched capacitor voltage replicator based cell balancer <b>700</b>.
