More particularly, the present invention relates to a medical securement device for temporarily securing a portion of a tube within an insertion point of a medical patient's body.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In various instances in the medical field, one end of a medical device such as medical tubing, is inserted into an opening formed in a patient's skin and then the opposite end extends out through the opening. In many cases, the device is left in place for only a short period (e.g., hours or days). However, in other cases, it might be necessary to leave the device in place for a much longer time (e.g., days to weeks). One such device is a tracheostomy tube, which is a tube that may be inserted through a hole in a person's neck and then into the trachea to allow the person to breathe through the tube. Tracheostomy tubes are often used in conjunction with ventilators for long-term breathing assistance. Another device is a urinary catheter, which is a tube having one end that is inserted into the bladder and that allows urine to drain freely. There are several types of catheters, including both short-term and long-term catheters. A suprapubic catheter is a type of long-term catheter that may be left in place for several weeks. Rather than being inserted through the urethra like short-term (e.g., Foley) catheters, suprapubic catheters are inserted through a hole in the abdomen and then directly into the bladder.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In each case, the medical tubing is held in place by a device that permits the tubing to be removed and replaced as needed while also being securely held in place. One common securing method is with tape (or some other similar adhesive securement device), which is typically wrapped around the tube and then taped directly to the person's skin. Generally, the tape used to secure a catheter tube is spaced away from the opening/incision site. Then, gauze is separately taped over the insertion site in order to collect drainage, fluids, etc.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">This type of securement method causes a number of problems. First, each time the device is replaced, cleaned, repositioned, etc., the tape is generally pulled off of the person's skin and is replaced with new tape. Over time, the repeated removal of tape from the skin can cause the skin to become irritated and to break down. Another problem with these conventional securing methods is that they do not fully secure the tube in place and an insufficient amount of holding force is provided at the incision site, which can allow leakages to occur around the insertion site. Additionally, since the medical tube is not secured at the insertion site, there is a possibility that the tube can move internally, which can cause irritation at the insertion site and can cause patient discomfort. This movement is also problematic because the tube could potentially be moved out of the optimal position and, therefore, become less effective over time.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">What is needed, therefore, is a securement device for medical tubing and a method of use that assists in addressing the above-described issues.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="2">Notes on Construction</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The use of the terms &#x201c;a&#x201d;, &#x201c;an&#x201d;, &#x201c;the&#x201d; and similar terms in the context of describing embodiments of the invention are to be construed to cover both the singular and the plural, unless otherwise indicated herein or clearly contradicted by context.

The securement device includes a flat base having a top surface, a bottom surface configured to contact a skin surface of the patient, a central circular opening formed in the flat base. The device further includes a cylindrical wall having an outer surface, an inner surface configured for placement adjacent the medical tube, a bottom end surrounding the central circular opening, and a top end located opposite the bottom end. Adhesive is provided on the inner surface of the cylindrical wall and is configured to fix the medical tube at a selected position within the cylindrical wall such that a selected length of the medical tube extends below the bottom surface of the flat base.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In certain embodiments, the device further includes a first slot opening formed in the flat base that extends from the central circular opening to a periphery of the flat base. Additionally, a second slot opening extends from the bottom end of the cylindrical wall to the top end of the cylindrical wall. The first slot opening is joined together continuously with the second slot opening to form a continuous slot that extends along the flat circular base and the cylindrical wall. The continuous slot provides separable sides located adjacent either side of the continuous slot such that the circular wall can be widened or narrowed by moving the separable sides closer together or further apart in order to at least partially encircle the medical tube and where the medical tube has an outside diameter that is within a range of outside diameters that work with the securement device. In certain embodiments, the first slot opening expands and is wider at the periphery of the flat base than at the central circular opening.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In certain embodiments, the device includes a suture aperture in the flat base that is sized and configured to receive suture material that may be used in suturing the securement device to the patient. Preferably a suture aperture is located proximate each side of the continuous slot. Certain embodiments provide a plurality of suture apertures in the flat base along an entirety of the cylindrical wall, and each suture aperture is sized and configured to receive suture material used in suturing the securement device to the patient.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In certain embodiments, adhesive is provided exclusively on the inner surface of the cylindrical wall. In some embodiments, the securement device further includes an adhesive cover that is removably placed over the adhesive. The adhesive cover prevents contact with the adhesive such that the adhesive cover must be removed in order to make contact with the adhesive. In certain cases, a removal tab is provided on the adhesive cover and is sized to be grasped by a user for assisting in the removal of the adhesive cover from the adhesive. In preferred embodiments, the removal tab extends away from the top end of the cylindrical wall.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Also disclosed herein is a securement method that requires the steps of providing a medical tube and providing a securement device. The securement device includes a flat base having a top surface, a bottom surface, a central circular opening formed in the flat base. The securement device further includes a cylindrical wall having an outer surface, an inner surface, a bottom end surrounding the central circular opening of the flat base, and a top end located opposite the bottom end. An adhesive is provided on the inner surface of the cylindrical wall and is not located on the bottom surface of the flat base. The method also includes the step of placing a portion of the medical tube in a space within the cylindrical wall such that the inner surface of the cylindrical wall is adjacent an outer surface of the medical tube. Then, at a selected position within the cylindrical wall, the outer surface of the medical tube is contacted with the adhesive on the inner surface of the cylindrical wall such that a selected length of the medical tube extends below the bottom surface of the flat base. Next, the selected length of the medical tube is inserted into an opening formed in a skin surface of a patient. Finally, the securement device is fixed in place such that the bottom surface of the base operatively contacts the skin surface adjacent the opening formed in the skin.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In certain cases, the medical tube is a catheter having an inflatable balloon. In those cases, the method preferably further includes the step of inserting the medical tube sufficiently through the skin surface that the inflatable balloon rests below the skin surface and then fixing the securement device by inflating the inflatable balloon. In certain embodiments of the method, the securement device includes a suture aperture in the flat base. In those cases, the method preferably further includes the step of suturing the securement device to the skin surface by passing suture material through the suture aperture and through the skin surface. In certain cases, when the securement device is fixed in place, either by a balloon or a suture or by other means, the flat base exerts a constant pressure force on the skin surface. Preferably, the constant pressure force is sufficient to arrest bleeding caused by the insertion of the medical tube through the opening in the skin of the patient.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In certain embodiments of the method, the securement device further includes a first slot opening formed in the flat base that extends from the central circular opening to a periphery of the flat base. Additionally, a second slot opening extends from the bottom end of the cylindrical wall to the top end of the cylindrical wall. Preferably, the first slot opening is joined together continuously with the second slot opening to form a continuous slot that extends along the flat circular base and the cylindrical wall in order to provide separable sides located adjacent either side of the continuous slot such that the space within the circular wall can be increased or decreased by moving the separable sides closer together or further apart. In certain cases, the method includes the step of moving the separable sides of the circular wall to resize the space within the cylindrical wall. In certain cases, the method includes the step of placing a portion of the medical tube within the cylindrical wall by inserting the medical tube through the continuous slot.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Further advantages of the invention are apparent by reference to the detailed description when considered in conjunction with the figures, which are not to scale so as to more clearly show the details, wherein like reference numerals represent like elements throughout the several views, and wherein:</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a front perspective view illustrating a securement device according to an embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective view illustrating the securement device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> fitted to a medical tube that is inserted into a patient and then secured via a suture; and</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a sectional view of the securement device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> fitted to a medical tube that is inserted into a patient and then secured via an inflatable balloon placed below a skin surface.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring now to the drawings in which like reference characters designate like or corresponding characters throughout the several views, there is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>, there is provided a medical securement device <b>100</b> for use in securing a tube-like structure, such as a catheter tube, chest tube, gastric tube, or abscess tube, to a patient <b>300</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention. The term &#x201c;medical tube&#x201d; <b>200</b> is used generally throughout this description to refer to all such tube-like structures that may be secured to a patient <b>300</b> using securement device <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The securement device <b>100</b> includes a flat base <b>102</b> having a top surface <b>104</b>, a bottom surface <b>106</b> configured to contact a skin surface <b>302</b> of the patient, and a central circular opening <b>108</b> formed in the flat base. A cylindrical wall <b>110</b> having an outer surface <b>112</b>, an inner surface <b>114</b> configured for placement adjacent the medical tube <b>200</b>, a bottom end <b>116</b> surrounding the central circular opening <b>108</b>, and a top end <b>118</b> located opposite the bottom end. Adhesive <b>120</b> is provided on the inner surface <b>114</b> of the cylindrical wall <b>110</b> and is configured to adhere to and to fix the medical tube <b>200</b> at a selected position within the cylindrical wall such that a selected length L of the medical tube extends below the bottom surface <b>106</b> of the flat base <b>102</b> and the skin surface <b>302</b>. Also disclosed is a method for using the securement device <b>100</b> described above for the purpose of fixing or securing a medical tube <b>200</b> to a patient <b>300</b>. More particularly, securement device <b>100</b> is useful for securing and stabilizing a medical tube <b>200</b> to a patient <b>300</b>, where a length L of the medical tube extends through the skin surface <b>302</b> of the patient. This might include, for example, a catheter such as a suprapubic catheter, a chest tube, or other similar medical tubes. The securement device <b>100</b> may also be used in other situations for securing and stabilizing other tubes, including where the tube does not pass through an opening formed in a patient's skin.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">When the securement device <b>100</b> is used, an end <b>202</b> of the medical tube <b>200</b> is usually first inserted through an opening or incision (not shown) in the skin surface <b>302</b> of the patient <b>300</b> so that a selected length L of the medical tube extends below the bottom surface <b>106</b> of the flat base <b>102</b> and the skin surface <b>302</b>. Once the medical tube <b>200</b> has been correctly located, a portion of the medical tube <b>200</b> is placed into a space <b>122</b> formed within the cylindrical wall <b>110</b> such that the inner surface <b>114</b> of the cylindrical wall <b>110</b> is adjacent an outer surface <b>202</b> of the medical tube. The height H of the cylindrical wall <b>110</b>, measured from bottom end <b>116</b> to top end <b>118</b>, should be tall enough to allow for sufficient contact between the cylindrical wall and the medical tube <b>200</b> that a leak-proof seal can be formed. However, the cylindrical wall <b>110</b> should not be so tall that it interferes with clothing or movement of the patient.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In certain embodiments, the free end of the medical tube <b>200</b> (i.e. the end that has not been inserted through the skin surface <b>302</b>) may be inserted through the central circular opening <b>108</b> of the securement device. In other embodiments, the securement device <b>100</b> includes a first slot opening <b>124</b> that formed in the flat base <b>102</b> and that extends from the central circular opening <b>108</b> to a periphery <b>126</b> of the flat base. Additionally, a second slot opening <b>128</b> extends from the bottom end <b>116</b> of the cylindrical wall <b>110</b> to the top end <b>118</b> of the cylindrical wall. The first slot opening <b>124</b> is joined together continuously with the second slot opening <b>128</b> to form a continuous slot that extends along the flat circular base and the cylindrical wall. This, in turn, provides separable sides <b>130</b> located adjacent either side of the continuous slot such that the cylindrical wall <b>110</b> can be widened or narrowed by moving the separable sides closer together or further apart. This continuous slot allow for the separable sides <b>130</b> to be opened and for the securement device <b>100</b> to be placed around and to fully or partially encircle the medical tube <b>200</b>. In certain embodiments, the first slot opening <b>124</b> expands or flares and is wider at the periphery <b>126</b> than it is at the central circular opening <b>108</b>. This expansion of the first slot opening <b>124</b> may assist in more quickly and accurately placing the securement device <b>100</b> around the medical tube <b>200</b>. In particular, when in use, the slanted sides that form the flared slot opening <b>124</b> would tend to slide along the outer surface of the medical tube <b>200</b> and the automatically open the continuous slot to allow the medical tube to more quickly and easily be positioned within the cylindrical wall <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Advantageously, the separable sides <b>130</b> allow for the space <b>122</b> within the cylindrical wall <b>110</b> to be increased or decreased in order to accommodate medical tubes <b>200</b> having a range of outer diameters. Thus, the same sized securement device <b>100</b> may be used in conjunction with a range of medical tube sizes. Whether the medical tube <b>200</b> is partially or fully encircled by the cylindrical wall <b>110</b> depends on the circumference of the cylindrical wall and the outer diameter of the medical tube. Preferably, the cylindrical wall <b>110</b> surrounds at least a majority of the outer perimeter of the medical tube <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Next, the outer surface <b>202</b> of the medical tube <b>200</b> is placed into contact with the adhesive <b>120</b> that is located on the inner surface <b>114</b> of the cylindrical wall <b>110</b> in order adhere the securement device <b>100</b> to the medical tube such that the selected length L of the medical tube extends below the bottom surface <b>106</b> of the flat base <b>102</b>. Importantly, no adhesive is provided on the bottom surface <b>106</b> of the flat base <b>102</b>. As a result, there is no adhesion between the securement device <b>100</b> and the patient. Advantageously, this avoids the skin irritation issues that are common when securing medical tubes using conventional methods. In certain embodiments, adhesive is provided exclusively on the inner surface <b>114</b> of the cylindrical wall <b>110</b>. In certain preferred embodiments, a removable adhesive cover <b>132</b> is placed over the adhesive, prevents inadvertent contact with the adhesive, and must be removed in order to make contact with the adhesive. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a portion of the cover <b>132</b> is removed in order to illustrate the adhesive <b>120</b> that lies below the adhesive cover. The adhesive cover <b>132</b> may also be provided with a removal tab <b>134</b> that is formed integrally with the cover and is sized to be grasped by a user for assisting in the removal of the adhesive cover from the adhesive <b>120</b>. In preferred embodiments, the removal tab <b>134</b> extends upwards away from the top end <b>118</b> of the cylindrical wall <b>110</b>. Preferably, adhesive <b>120</b> can be easily removed with a solvent, such as isopropyl alcohol, such that the medical tube <b>200</b> can be selectively removed from the securement device.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Preferably, when the securement device <b>100</b> and medical tube <b>200</b> are attached to one another, the securement device is positioned such that the bottom surface <b>106</b> of the flat base <b>102</b> is in direct or indirect contact with the skin surface <b>302</b> of the patient <b>300</b> and surrounds the opening in the skin surface. For that reason, securement device <b>100</b>, as a whole or at least flat base <b>102</b> are preferably formed using a medical grade or biocompatible material, such as a medical-grade silicone, which will is suitable for contact with the skin surface <b>302</b>. Preferably, the flat base is formed from a stiff enough material and is sized with a diameter D that is sufficiently large to significant movement of the medical tube <b>200</b> at the incision site.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Preferably, the securement device <b>100</b> is then fixed in place such that the flat base <b>102</b> exerts a constant pressure force on the skin surface <b>302</b> directly at the incision site. Even more preferably, the constant pressure force is sufficient to arrest bleeding caused by the insertion of the medical tube <b>200</b> through the opening. Additionally, gauze (not shown) may be placed with the securement device <b>100</b> around the incision site in order to further reduce and absorb blood or other fluids.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">There are several ways that the securement device <b>100</b> can be secured to the skin surface <b>302</b> in the selected location to provide the desired amount of constant pressure. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, the securement device <b>100</b> may include a suture aperture <b>136</b> in the flat base <b>102</b> that is sized and configured to receive suture material <b>138</b> used in suturing the securement device to the patient. In preferred embodiments, a suture aperture <b>136</b> is located in the flat base <b>102</b> proximate each side of the continuous slot <b>124</b>/<b>128</b>. A separate suture <b>138</b> may be passed through each aperture <b>136</b> or, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a single suture may be passed through both apertures. In still other embodiments, the securement device may include multiple apertures <b>136</b> in the flat base <b>102</b>. In those cases, the apertures <b>136</b> preferably extend around the entirety of the cylindrical wall <b>110</b>. Again, each suture aperture is sized and configured to receive suture material <b>138</b> for use in securing the securement device <b>100</b> to the patient <b>300</b>. In other cases, suturing is not required when stabilization is provided through other means. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, certain medical tubes <b>200</b>, including certain catheters, include inflatable balloons <b>204</b> located at one end. Usually, after the end of the tube <b>200</b> having the balloon <b>204</b> is inserted into a patient, the balloon may be inflated in order to keep the tube in place. This same procedure may be used with the securement device <b>100</b>.
