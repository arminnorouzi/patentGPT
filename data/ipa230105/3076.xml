The member <b>12</b> is comprised of a scratch resistant material to inhibit an animal <b>18</b> from being able to scratch the weather stripping <b>16</b> beneath the member <b>12</b>. Additionally, the member <b>12</b> is comprised of an ultraviolet radiation resistant material to resist being degraded by sunlight. The member <b>12</b> is comprised of a thermally expansive material to withstand extreme temperatures.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The member <b>12</b> has a first surface <b>20</b>, a second surface <b>22</b> and a perimeter surface <b>24</b> extending between the first surface <b>20</b> and the second surface <b>22</b>, and the perimeter surface <b>24</b> has a lower side <b>26</b>, an upper side <b>28</b>, a first lateral side <b>30</b> and a second lateral side <b>32</b>. The member <b>12</b> is elongated between the upper side <b>28</b> and the lower side <b>26</b> to a length of at least 24.0 inches. The first surface <b>20</b> is positionable against the door jamb <b>14</b> having the lower side <b>26</b> being spaced from a lower portion <b>34</b> of the door jamb <b>14</b> to inhibit moisture from wicking upwardly along the member <b>12</b>. Furthermore, the first lateral side <b>30</b> is spaced from a door <b>36</b> that is hingedly disposed in the door jamb <b>14</b> to facilitate the door <b>36</b> to be closed unimpeded against the weather stripping <b>16</b>. The door jamb <b>14</b> may be a door jamb for an exterior door in a building and the door <b>36</b> in the door jamb <b>14</b> may be an exterior door.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The member <b>12</b> has a plurality of apertures <b>38</b> each extending through the first surface <b>20</b> and the second surface <b>22</b>. The apertures <b>38</b> are spaced apart from each other and are distributed between the upper side <b>28</b> and the lower side <b>26</b>, and each of the apertures <b>38</b> is positioned closer to the second lateral side <b>32</b> than the first lateral side <b>30</b>. Each of the apertures <b>38</b> has a bounding surface <b>40</b> and the bounding surface <b>40</b> of each of the apertures <b>38</b> has a first portion <b>42</b> extending from the first surface <b>20</b> toward the second surface <b>22</b>. The bounding surface <b>40</b> of each of the apertures <b>38</b> has a second portion <b>44</b> angling outwardly between the first portion <b>42</b> and the second surface <b>22</b> to define a countersink in each of the apertures <b>38</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">A plurality of fasteners <b>46</b> is each extendable through the member <b>12</b> to engage the door jamb <b>14</b> to retain the member <b>12</b> on the door jamb <b>14</b>. Each of the fasteners <b>46</b> has a head <b>48</b> and the head <b>48</b> has a bottom surface <b>50</b> which is sloped. Each of the fasteners <b>46</b> is extendable through a respective one of the apertures <b>38</b> having the bottom surface <b>50</b> of the head <b>48</b> abutting the second portion <b>44</b> of the bounding surface <b>40</b> of the respective aperture. In this way the head <b>48</b> is recessed with respect to the second surface <b>22</b> of the member <b>12</b>. Additionally, each of the fasteners <b>46</b> may comprise a screw, a nail or other type of penetrating fastener.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In an alternative embodiment <b>52</b> as is most clearly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, a pair of mating members <b>54</b> is provided and each of the mating members <b>54</b> is disposed on the first surface <b>20</b> of the member <b>12</b>. Each of the mating members <b>54</b> extends between the upper side <b>28</b> and the lower side <b>26</b> of the perimeter surface <b>24</b> of the member <b>12</b>. Each of the mating members <b>54</b> has an exposed surface <b>56</b> with respect to the first surface <b>20</b> of the member <b>12</b>. The exposed surface <b>56</b> of each of the mating members <b>54</b> is comprised of an adhesive material such that the exposed surface <b>56</b> of each of the mating members <b>54</b> can adhere to the door jamb <b>14</b>. A pair of protective sheets <b>58</b> is each removably positioned on the exposed surface <b>56</b> of a respective one of the mating members <b>54</b> for inhibiting the exposed surface <b>56</b> from being adhered to a surface.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In use, the member <b>12</b> is mounted to the door jamb <b>14</b> such that the weather stripping <b>16</b> is positioned between the member <b>12</b> and the door <b>36</b>. In this way an animal <b>18</b>, such as a domesticated dog, is not able to damage the weather stripping <b>16</b> when the animal <b>18</b> scratches on the member <b>12</b> to notify a pet owner that the animal <b>18</b> wishes to enter the door <b>36</b>. Thus, the door <b>36</b> can continue to function normally over extended periods of time without being damaged by the animal <b>18</b> scratching against the member <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">With respect to the above description then, it is to be realized that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of an embodiment enabled by the disclosure, to include variations in size, materials, shape, form, function and manner of operation, assembly and use, are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art, and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by an embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Therefore, the foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the disclosure. Further, since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the disclosure to the exact construction and operation shown and described, and accordingly, all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to, falling within the scope of the disclosure. In this patent document, the word &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; is used in its non-limiting sense to mean that items following the word are included, but items not specifically mentioned are not excluded. A reference to an element by the indefinite article &#x201c;a&#x201d; does not exclude the possibility that more than one of the element is present, unless the context clearly requires that there be only one of the elements.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>I claim:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
