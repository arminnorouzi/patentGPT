successor systems (e.g., LTE Advanced (LTE-A), New Radio (NR, also called 5G)), a Device to Device (D2D) technology in which terminals communicate directly with each other without a base station is under review (e.g., Non-Patent Document 1).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">D2D reduces traffics between terminals and base stations and enables communication between terminals even when a base station is unable to communicate in time of a disaster, etc. Although 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) refers to D2D as a &#x201c;sidelink&#x201d;, the term D2D is used herein more generally. However, in the description of the embodiment described below, sidelink is also used as needed.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">D2D communication is broadly classified into D2D discovery for discovering other terminals capable of communication and D2D communication (D2D direct communication, D2D communication, direct communication between terminals, etc.) for communicating directly between terminals. Hereinafter, when D2D communication, D2D discovery, etc. are not specifically distinguished, it is simply called D2D. A signal sent and received by D2D is called as a D2D signal. Various use cases of Vehicle to Everything (played V2X) services in NR have been studied (e.g., Non-Patent Document 2).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">PRIOR ART DOCUMENTS</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Non-Patent Documents</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0005">Non-Patent Document 1: 3GPP TS 36.211 V15.7.0 (2019-09)</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0006">Non-Patent Document 2: 3GPP TR 22.886 V15.1.0 (2017-03)</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Problem to be Solved by the Invention</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0007">Direct terminal-to-terminal communication in NR-V2X supports the operation of reporting the sidelink HARQ (Hybrid automatic repeat request) response to the base station. The number of slots in the Uu (the Radio interface between UTRAN and the User Equipment) starting from the PSFCH (Physical Sidelink Feedback Channel), via which the sidelink HARQ response is transmitted, is indicated to the terminal, thereby the timing of the PUCCH (Physical Uplink Control Channel) for transmitting the HARQ response is determined.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0008">However, if

Here, the existing technology is, for example, the existing LTE but is not limited to the existing LTE. The term &#x201c;LTE&#x201d; used in this specification has a broad meaning including LTE-Advanced and schemes after LTE-Advanced (for example, NR) or Wireless Local Area Network (LAN) unless otherwise specified.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0037">Also, according to an embodiment of the present invention, the duplexing scheme may be Time Division Duplexing (TDD), may be Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD), or may be other schemes (for example, Flexible Duplexing or the like).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0038">Further, according to an embodiment of the present invention, when a radio parameter or the like is &#x201c;configured&#x201d;,&#x201d;, it may mean that a predetermined value is pre-configured or may mean that a radio parameter indicated by a base station <b>10</b> or a terminal <b>20</b> may be configured.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating V2X.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, V2X is a collective term for Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V), which is a part of ITS (Intelligent Transport Systems), which means a form of communication between vehicles, Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I), which means a form of communication between vehicles and roadside equipment (RSU:Road-Side Unit), Vehicle to Network (V2N), which means a form of communication between vehicles and ITS servers, and Vehicle to Pedestrian (V2P), which means a form of communication between vehicles and mobile terminals carried by pedestrians.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0040">In addition, V2X using LTE or NR cellular communication and terminal-to-terminal communication is under review in 3GPP. V2X using cellular communication is also called cellular V2X. NR's V2X is being studied for realizing large capacity, low delay, high reliability, and QoS (Quality of Service) control.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0041">It is anticipated that V2X of LTE or NR will be studied not only in 3GPP specification but also in the future. For example, it is envisaged that interoperability, cost reduction by upper layer implementation, Radio Access Technology (RAT) combination or switching methods, regulatory compliance in each country, and data acquisition, distribution, database management and utilization method by LTE or NR V2X platforms will be considered.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0042">In embodiments of the present invention, it is primarily assumed that a communication device is mounted on a vehicle, but embodiments of the present invention are not limited to such embodiments. For example, a communication device may be a hand-held terminal, or a communication device may be a drone or airplane mounted device, or a communication device may be a base station, an RSU, a relay station (relay node), a terminal having scheduling capability, or the like.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0043">Note that Sidelink (SL) may be distinguished from Uplink (UL) or Downlink (DL) on the basis of any one of the following 1)-4) or combinations thereof.
