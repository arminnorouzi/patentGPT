In an example embodiment, the triggering event associated with the status of the vehicle may comprise, for example, a disconnection of a wireless connection between a mobile device and a vehicle system. For example, there may be a short-range wireless connection, for example, a Bluetooth connection, between the mobile device and the vehicle, and once the distance between the mobile device and the vehicle reaches a certain point, the short-range wireless connection is disconnected between the mobile device and the vehicle system. The vehicle system may comprise, for example, an audio system or a multimedia system of the vehicle. When the short-range wireless connection disconnects between the mobile device and the vehicle system, it may be interpreted so that the driver has left his vehicle. In another example embodiment, the predetermined triggering event may comprise a change in a locking status of doors of the vehicle. The locking status may refer, for example, that the driver locks the doors of the vehicle when leaving the vehicle to a parking space or when the locks of the vehicle lock automatically when the drives leaves the vicinity of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In another example embodiment, the predetermined triggering event may comprise information identifying an arrival of the vehicle to a parking space. The information identifying the arrival of the vehicle to the parking space may be obtained, for example, with a weighing arrangement associated with the parking space or with a sensor, for example, an optical sensor, monitoring whether the parking space is in use or not. The mobile device or the vehicle may receive information from the weighing arrangement or the sensor that the vehicle is now located at the parking space. In another example embodiment, the mobile device or the vehicle may deduce based on location and a signal from at least one sensor, for example, an acceleration sensor, that a drive of the vehicle has become to an end at a specific location. This may be interpreted as the predetermined triggering event.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">At <b>102</b>, transmission of the elevator call is caused based on the predetermined triggering event associated with the status of the vehicle. The elevator call may be sent to a cloud service over a wireless communication network, for example, a local wireless area network connection or a mobile communication network connection.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The elevator call may be a floor call from a predetermined floor. Alternatively, the elevator call may be a destination call to a predetermined floor. The predetermined floor may be, for example, pre-programmed by the user of the mobile device or the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In an example embodiment, the steps discussed above may be performed by a mobile device or a mobile device application. For example, the mobile device or mobile device application may identify the predetermined triggering event by obtaining information about the predetermined triggering event from the vehicle. Alternatively, the mobile device or mobile device application may identify the predetermined triggering event based on information obtained internally from the mobile device when, for example, the short-range wireless connection between the mobile device and the vehicle disconnects. In another example embodiment, the steps discussed above may be performed by the vehicle. In other words, the elevator call may originate either from the mobile device or the vehicle. In another example embodiment, a monitoring module connected to the weighing arrangement and/or sensor arranged in connection with the parking space may be configured to cause transmission of the elevator call. Alternatively, the monitoring module may transmit a signal to a service provided by a cloud service, and the service may cause transmission of the elevator call.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In an example embodiment, before causing transmission of the elevator call, it is possible to cause a transmission of information indicating an approaching passenger to enable parking optimization of at least one elevator based on the information indicative of the location.

The vehicle may be arriving to a location, for example, to a residential building or an office building, at which elevator service is available. At some point of the arrival, the information identifying the number of passengers may be obtained. The information may be determined based on one or more factors, for example, based on at least one of the following:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0052">Information from a weighing arrangement. When the vehicle arrives at a parking space, all the passengers are still in the car and the weighing arrangement associated with the parking space provides a first reading. A second, lower reading may be obtained when the passengers have exited the vehicle. By subtracting the second reading from the first reading, a weight corresponding to the exited passenger is obtained, and the number of passengers may be estimated based on this weight.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0053">The number of mobile phones connected to an audio system or a multimedia system of the vehicle.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0054">Data obtained by an internal camera associated with the vehicle.

In an example embodiment, the triggering event associated with the status of the vehicle may comprise, for example, a disconnection of a wireless connection between a mobile device and a vehicle system. For example, there may be a short-range wireless connection, for example, a Bluetooth connection, between the mobile device and the vehicle, and once the distance between the mobile device and the vehicle reaches a certain point, the short-range wireless connection is disconnected between the mobile device and the vehicle system. The vehicle system may comprise, for example, an audio system or a multimedia system of the vehicle. When the short-range wireless connection disconnects between the mobile device and the vehicle system, it may be interpreted so that the driver has left his vehicle. In another example embodiment, the predetermined triggering event may comprise a change in a locking status of doors of the vehicle. The locking status may refer, for example, that the driver locks the doors of the vehicle when leaving the vehicle to a parking space or when the locks of the vehicle lock automatically when the drives leaves the vicinity of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0080">In another example embodiment, the predetermined triggering event may comprise information identifying an arrival of the vehicle to a parking space. The information identifying the arrival of the vehicle to the parking space may be obtained, for example, with a weighing arrangement associated with the parking space or with a sensor, for example, an optical sensor, monitoring whether the parking space is in use or not. The mobile device or the vehicle may receive information from the weighing arrangement or the sensor that the vehicle is now located at the parking space. In another example embodiment, the mobile device or the vehicle may deduce based on location and a signal from at least one sensor, for example, an acceleration sensor, that a drive of the vehicle has become to an end at a specific location. This may be interpreted as the predetermined triggering event.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0081">At <b>114</b>, transmission of the elevator call is caused based on the predetermined triggering event associated with the status of the vehicle and the information identifying of the location. If information about the number of passenger is available, the elevator call may be based also on this information. The elevator call may be sent to a cloud service over a wireless communication network, for example, a local wireless area network connection or a mobile communication network connection. In another example embodiment, the elevator call may be sent directly to a controller controlling the nearby elevators.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0082">The location may identify, for example, a residential building or an office building, at which elevator service is available. As the location information is available, the elevator call may be a floor call from a predetermined floor. Alternatively, the elevator call may be a destination call from a predetermined floor to a predetermined floor. The predetermined floor for the floor call or predetermined floors for the destination call may be, for example, pre-programmed by the user of the mobile device or vehicle.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0083">In an example embodiment, the steps discussed above may be performed by a mobile device or a mobile device application. For example, the mobile device or mobile device application may identify the predetermined triggering event by obtaining information about the predetermined triggering event from the vehicle. Alternatively, the mobile device or mobile device application may identify the predetermined triggering event based on information obtained internally from the mobile device when, for example, the short-range wireless connection between the mobile device and the vehicle disconnects. In another example embodiment, the steps discussed above may be performed by the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0084">In other words, the elevator call may originate either from the mobile device or the vehicle. In another example embodiment, a monitoring module connected to the weighing arrangement and/or sensor arranged in connection with the parking space may be configured to cause transmission of the elevator call. Alternatively, the monitoring module may transmit a message to a service provided by a cloud service, and the service may cause transmission of the elevator call. The message may also comprise an indication of the number of passengers associated with the vehicle</p><p id="p-0069" num="0085">In an example embodiment, before causing transmission of the elevator call, it is possible to cause a transmission of information indicating an approaching passenger to enable parking optimization of at least one elevator based on the information indicative of the location.
