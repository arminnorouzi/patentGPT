id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">A coral reef-like nickel phosphide-tungsten oxide nanocomposite is disclosed. The coral reef-like nickel phosphide-tungsten oxide nanocomposite has a structure in which algae-like transition metal-doped nickel phosphide nanosheets are deposited on coral-like tungsten oxide nanostructures grown vertically on a substrate. This structure allows the coral reef-like nickel phosphide-tungsten oxide nanocomposite to have a large surface area, which leads to a significant increase in the number of catalytic active sites, and ensures high conductivity and electrochemical stability of the coral reef-like nickel phosphide-tungsten oxide nanocomposite. Due to these advantages, the coral reef-like nickel phosphide-tungsten oxide nanocomposite has a low overpotential and superior hydrogen evolution reaction or oxygen evolution reaction efficiency when applied to a water splitting catalyst under alkaline conditions. Also disclosed are a method for preparing the coral reef-like nickel phosphide-tungsten oxide nanocomposite and a catalyst for electrochemical water splitting including the coral reef-like nickel phosphide-tungsten oxide nanocomposite.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="44.96mm" wi="158.75mm"

Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Environmental destruction and the depletion of fossil fuels has urgently stimulated the need for developing clean and sustainable renewable energies. Among various ecofriendly energy candidates, hydrogen is considered an attractive energy storage source for transportation due to its high energy density. However, most hydrogen is currently produced by a steam reforming process, which inevitably causes issues due to the generation of CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Water electrolysis is an alternative, promising method to generate green hydrogen owing to its high efficiency and complete carbon-free characteristics. Key components of water electrolysis systems are the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts, whose electrocatalytic activities mainly determine the performances of devices. Pt-, Ir- and Ru-related noble materials are generally regarded as the most efficient HER/OER catalysts, but their high cost and low durability are bottlenecks in commercializing water electrolysis.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Various transition metal compounds have been studied as alternatives to noble metal catalysts owing to their natural abundances and appreciable catalytic activities. In particular, transition metal-nickel phosphide catalysts were shown to have enhanced catalytic activity in water splitting, resulting from the optimized electronic structures of transition metals and nickel. However, their catalytic activities were still far from those of noble metals, which was mainly due to the limited number of active sites and poor conductivity.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, there is a need to investigate and develop new materials that can avoid the problems of a limited number of catalytic active sites and low conductivity encountered in conventional transition metal-based non-noble metal catalysts.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">PRIOR ART DOCUMENTS</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Patent Documents</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">(Patent Document 1) Korean Patent No. 10-1670860</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention has been made in an effort to solve the above-described problems, and one object of the present invention is to provide a coral reef-like nickel phosphide-tungsten oxide nanocomposite that has an increased number of catalytic active sites and is highly conductive and electrochemically stable.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A further object of the present invention is to provide a catalyst for electrochemical water splitting including the coral reef-like nickel phosphide-tungsten oxide nanocomposite.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another object of the present invention is to provide an electrode including the catalyst for electrochemical water splitting.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another object of the present invention is to provide an electrochemical water splitting system including the electrode, a counter electrode, and an electrolyte or ionic liquid.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Still another object of the present invention is to provide a method for preparing a coral reef-like nickel phosphide-tungsten oxide nanocomposite.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention provides a coral reef-like nickel phosphide-tungsten oxide nanocomposite including a substrate, a core including a plurality of tungsten oxide nanostructures grown vertically on the substrate, and a shell including transition metal-doped nickel phosphide nanosheets covering a portion or the entirety of the surface of the core.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention also provides a catalyst for electrochemical water splitting including the coral reef-like nickel phosphide-tungsten oxide nanocomposite.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present invention also provides an electrode including the catalyst for electrochemical water splitting.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present invention also provides an electrochemical water splitting system including the electrode, a counter electrode, and an electrolyte or ionic liquid.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The present invention also provides a method for preparing a coral reef-like nickel phosphide-tungsten oxide nanocomposite, including: introducing a tungsten oxide precursor on a substrate, followed by primary thermal treatment under vacuum conditions to form a core including a plurality of tungsten oxide nanostructures grown along a vertical direction on the substrate; introducing a nickel precursor and a transition metal precursor on the tungsten oxide nanostructures, followed by electrodeposition to form a nickel hydroxide-tungsten oxide intermediate in which a shell including transition metal-doped nickel hydroxide nanosheets is deposited on the tungsten oxide nanostructures; and introducing a phosphorus precursor into the nickel hydroxide-tungsten oxide intermediate, followed by secondary thermal treatment.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The coral reef-like nickel phosphide-tungsten oxide nanocomposite of the present invention has a structure in which algae-like transition metal-doped nickel phosphide nanosheets are deposited on coral-like tungsten oxide nanostructures grown vertically on a substrate.

Inspired by natural coral reefs, the present inventors synthesized coral reef-like nickel phosphide-tungsten oxide nanocomposites by mimicking their structures and functions of natural coral reefs. A coral reef normally has mutual symbiotic coral and algae. Corals are composed of a solid, elongated wire-shaped calcium carbonate skeleton and provide algae with both CO<sub>2 </sub>from respiration and a physical habitat. Algae are plate-shaped seaweeds that are bound on corals, synthesizing O<sub>2 </sub>and nutrients through photosynthesis, while utilizing CO<sub>2 </sub>provided from corals and water in the sea.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The coral reef-like nickel phosphide-tungsten oxide nanocomposite of the present invention has a structure in which algae-like transition metal-doped nickel phosphide nanosheets are deposited on coral-like tungsten oxide nanostructures grown vertically on a substrate. This structure allows the coral reef-like nickel phosphide-tungsten oxide nanocomposite to have a large surface area, which leads to a significant increase in the number of catalytic active sites, and ensures high conductivity and electrochemical stability of the coral reef-like nickel phosphide-tungsten oxide nanocomposite. Due to these advantages, the coral reef-like nickel phosphide-tungsten oxide nanocomposite has a low overpotential and superior hydrogen evolution reaction or oxygen evolution reaction efficiency when applied to a water splitting catalyst under alkaline conditions. That is, charges are transported from the tungsten oxide nanostructures through the transition metal-doped nickel phosphide nanosheets having numerous active sites and react with an aqueous electrolyte. This charge transfer ensures high water electrolysis efficiency.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Specifically, the present invention provides a coral reef-like nickel phosphide-tungsten oxide nanocomposite including a substrate, a core including a plurality of tungsten oxide nanostructures grown vertically on the substrate, and a shell including transition metal-doped nickel phosphide nanosheets covering a portion or the entirety of the surface of the core.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The coral reef-like nickel phosphide-tungsten oxide nanocomposite may have a coral reef structure in which algae-like transition metal-doped nickel phosphide nanosheets are deposited on coral-like tungsten oxide nanostructures.

If the average length is less than 20 &#x3bc;m or the thickness is less than 0.5 &#x3bc;m, the reduced surface area may lead to a reduction in the number of active sites, causing deterioration of catalytic activity. Meanwhile, if the average length exceeds 100 &#x3bc;m or the thickness exceeds 10 &#x3bc;m, the excessively grown tungsten oxide nanostructures may collapse during the reaction because of their poor physical stability.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The tungsten oxide nanostructures have a layered structure and an interplanar distance (d-spacing) of 0.1 to 0.6 nm, preferably 0.2 to 0.5 nm, most preferably 0.31 to 0.42 nm, as measured by X-ray diffraction.
