In the lower assembly <b>3</b>, a plurality (four in the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) of storage/feeding units <b>20</b> are connected to the transporting unit <b>12</b>. Each storage/feeding unit <b>20</b> stores banknotes sent from the transporting unit <b>12</b>. In addition, the banknotes stored in each storage/feeding unit <b>20</b> can be fed out one by one to the transporting unit <b>12</b>. More specifically, each of the uppermost storage/feeding unit <b>20</b> and lowermost storage/feeding unit <b>20</b> among the four storage/feeding units <b>20</b> has one drum <b>22</b>. Then, the banknotes sent from the transporting unit <b>12</b> are wound on the drum <b>22</b> together with a pair of tapes in a state of being sandwiched between the pair of tapes one by one. When the drum <b>22</b> rotates in the direction opposite to the winding direction of the tapes, as the tapes are unwound from the drum <b>22</b>, the banknotes sandwiched between the pair of tapes are fed out one by one to the transporting unit <b>12</b>. Each of the second and third storage/feeding units <b>20</b> from the top among the four storage/feeding units <b>20</b> has two drums <b>24</b> and <b>26</b>. The two drums <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> have different maximum storage capacities of banknotes. In particular, these storage/feeding units <b>20</b> have two drums <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> with different lengths of tapes to be wound on the drum <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>. The banknotes sent from the transporting unit <b>12</b> are wound on each drum <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, with the pair of tapes in such a manner that the banknotes are sandwiched between the pair of tapes one by one. When each drum <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> rotates in the direction opposite to the winding direction of the tapes, as the tapes are unwound from the drum <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, the banknotes sandwiched between the pair of tapes are fed out to the transporting unit <b>12</b> one by one. The length of each tape to be wound on the drum <b>26</b> is larger than the length of each tape to be wound on the drum <b>24</b>. Thus, the maximum storage capacity of banknotes in the drum <b>26</b> is greater than the maximum storage capacity of banknotes in the drum <b>24</b>. In the banknote handling apparatus <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment, instead of using each storage/feeding unit <b>20</b> of tape-reel type as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a storage/feeding unit of stacker type for storing banknotes in a stacked manner may be used.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the lower assembly <b>3</b>, the transporting unit <b>12</b> is provided with a collecting unit <b>30</b>.

Then, all the banknotes stored in each storage/feeding unit <b>20</b> are fed out one by one to the transporting unit <b>12</b>. All the fed banknotes are sent to the collecting unit <b>30</b> by the transporting unit <b>12</b>. Specifically, a banknote storage bag (not shown) for storing banknotes is detachably attached to the collecting unit <b>30</b>. The banknotes sent from each storage/feeding unit <b>20</b> to the collecting unit <b>30</b> by the transporting unit <b>12</b> are stored in the banknote storage bag. When all the banknotes are sent from each storage/feeding unit <b>20</b> to the collecting unit <b>30</b> and stored in the banknote storage bag attached to the collecting unit <b>30</b>, the guard and the like of the cash in transit company opens the door of the lower assembly <b>3</b> to take out the banknote storage bag from the collecting unit <b>30</b>. In this manner, the banknotes are collected from the banknote handling apparatus <b>1</b> together with the banknote storage bag. In this way, when the banknote storage bag in which the banknotes are stored is taken out from the banknote handling apparatus <b>1</b>, collection process of banknotes in the banknote handling apparatus <b>1</b> is completed.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">As described above, in the present embodiment, a banknote recognized as a counterfeit note or suspect note by the recognition unit <b>14</b> is stored in one banknote storage unit (for example, the banknote storage unit <b>19</b>) among the two banknote storage units <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> when deposit processing of banknotes is performed. On the other hand, a dispense reject banknote which can not be dispensed to the outside of the housing <b>1</b><i>a </i>by the banknote ejecting unit <b>16</b> due to abnormal transportation and the like is stored in the other banknote storage unit (for example, the banknote storage unit <b>18</b>) when dispense processing of banknotes is performed. For this reason, compared with the case where only one banknote storage unit is provided and a banknote recognized as a counterfeit note or suspect note by the recognition unit <b>14</b> and a dispense reject banknote are stored in the same banknote storage unit, it is possible to perform flexible processing of banknotes according to the operation form. Specifically, if only one banknote storage unit is provided and a banknote recognized as a counterfeit note or suspect note by the recognition unit <b>14</b> and a dispense reject banknote are stored in the same banknote storage unit, the following problem may happen. That is, after the banknotes are taken out from the banknote storage unit, the operator must manually sort the banknotes taken out from the banknote storage unit into a counterfeit note, suspect note and dispense reject banknote, and such an operation is laborious for the operator. On the other hand, the banknote handling apparatus <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment can prevent such a problem.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the banknote handling apparatus <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment, when deposit processing of banknotes is performed, banknote data of deposit processing of one transaction (specifically, information such as serial number of deposited banknote) is temporarily stored in the upper substrate <b>50</b><i>b </i>of the controller <b>50</b>. On the other hand, banknote data related to the banknote that is judged to be a counterfeit note or suspect note by the recognition unit <b>14</b> and sent to the banknote storage unit (for example, the banknote storage unit <b>19</b>) selected by the destination selector <b>52</b> (that is, capture data, specifically information on serial number and image data of the counterfeit note or suspect note) is temporarily stored in the recognition unit <b>14</b>. When all the banknotes are fed out from the banknote inlet unit <b>10</b> into the housing <b>1</b><i>a </i>and sent to each storage/feeding unit <b>20</b>, banknote storage unit <b>19</b> or collecting unit <b>30</b>, the data processing substrate <b>50</b><i>a </i>sends a command to the recognition unit <b>14</b> and upper substrate <b>50</b><i>b</i>, respectively. As a result, capture data is sent from the recognition unit <b>14</b> to the data processing substrate <b>50</b><i>a</i>. In addition, banknote data of deposit processing of one transaction is sent from the upper substrate <b>50</b><i>b </i>to the data processing substrate <b>50</b><i>a</i>. Then, to the capture data and banknote data of deposit processing of one transaction sent to the data processing substrate <b>50</b><i>a</i>, information on date and time, identification number of money handling system, transaction number, information on presence/absence of return of banknote and the like are given in the data processing substrate <b>50</b><i>a</i>. Thereafter, the capture data and banknote data of deposit processing of one transaction to which the information on the date and time and the like is given are sent from the data processing substrate <b>50</b><i>a </i>to the POS register <b>200</b> by the communication interface unit <b>58</b>. In addition, the clerk of the store asks the customer to obtain information on the customer (for example, the identification number of the customers license, the name, the address, and the like), and enters the obtained information into the POS register <b>200</b>. As a result, the customers information is stored in the memory unit of the POS register <b>200</b>. At this time, customer information is linked to capture data and banknote data of deposit processing of one transaction sent to the POS register <b>200</b> from the data processing substrate <b>50</b><i>a</i>. In this way, when collecting a counterfeit note or suspect note and sending it to the central bank and the like, it is possible to track which customer originally have the counterfeit note or suspect note stored in banknote storage unit <b>19</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In the above description, the mode in which the destination selector <b>52</b> selects the storage unit, where a counterfeit note or suspect note among the banknotes transported by the transporting unit <b>12</b> is to be transported, from the two banknote storage units <b>18</b>, <b>19</b> has been described.
