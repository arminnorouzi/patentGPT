Typical wireless communication systems may employ multiple-access technologies capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing available system resources (e.g., bandwidth, transmit power, or the like). Examples of such multiple-access technologies include code division multiple access (CDMA) systems, time division multiple access (TDMA) systems, frequency division multiple access (FDMA) systems, orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems, single-carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) systems, time division synchronous code division multiple access (TD-SCDMA) systems, and Long Term Evolution (LTE). LTE/LTE-Advanced is a set of enhancements to the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) mobile standard promulgated by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A wireless network may include one or more base stations that support communication for a user equipment (UE) or multiple UEs. A UE may communicate with a base station via downlink communications and uplink communications. &#x201c;Downlink&#x201d; (or &#x201c;DL&#x201d;) refers to a communication link from the base station to the UE, and &#x201c;uplink&#x201d; (or &#x201c;UL&#x201d;) refers to a communication link from the UE to the base station.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The above multiple access technologies have been adopted in various telecommunication standards to provide a common protocol that enables different UEs to communicate on a municipal, national, regional, and/or global level. New Radio (NR), which may be referred to as 5G, is a set of enhancements to the LTE mobile standard promulgated by the 3GPP. NR is designed to better support mobile broadband internet access by improving spectral efficiency, lowering costs, improving services, making use of new spectrum, and better integrating with other open standards using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) with a cyclic prefix (CP) (CP-OFDM) on the downlink, using CP-OFDM and/or single-carrier frequency division multiplexing (SC-FDM) (also known as discrete Fourier transform spread OFDM (DFT-s-OFDM)) on the uplink, as well as supporting beamforming, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna technology, and carrier aggregation. As the demand for mobile broadband access continues to increase, further improvements in LTE, NR, and other radio access technologies remain useful.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In some implementations, an apparatus for wireless communication at a user equipment (UE) includes a memory; a transceiver; and one or more processors, coupled to the memory, configured to: receive, from a base station via the transceiver, an indication to apply an amplitude drooping based at least in part on an uplink band being adjacent to a downlink band in a full-duplex operation; and transmit, to the base station via the transceiver, an uplink transmission in the uplink band based at least in part on the amplitude drooping.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some implementations, an apparatus for wireless communication at a base station includes a memory; a transceiver; and one or more processors, coupled to the memory, configured to: transmit, to a UE via the transceiver, an indication to apply an amplitude drooping based at least in part on an uplink band being adjacent to a downlink band in a full-duplex operation; and receive, from the UE via the transceiver, an uplink transmission in the uplink band based at least in part on the amplitude drooping.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some implementations, a method of wireless communication performed by a UE includes receiving, from a base station, an indication to apply an amplitude drooping based at least in part on an uplink band being adjacent to a downlink band in a full-duplex operation; and transmitting, to the base station, an uplink transmission in the uplink band based at least in part on the amplitude drooping.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some implementations, a method of wireless communication performed by a base station includes transmitting, to a UE, an indication to apply an amplitude drooping based at least in part on an uplink band being adjacent to a downlink band in a full-duplex operation; and receiving, from the UE, an uplink transmission in the uplink band based at least in part on the amplitude drooping.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some implementations, a non-transitory computer-readable medium storing a set of instructions for wireless communication includes one or more instructions that, when executed by one or more processors of a UE, cause the UE to: receive, from a base station, an indication to apply an amplitude drooping based at least in part on an uplink band being adjacent to a downlink band in a full-duplex operation; and transmit, to the base station, an uplink transmission in the uplink band based at least in part on the amplitude drooping.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some implementations, a non-transitory computer-readable medium storing a set of instructions for wireless communication includes one or more instructions that, when executed by one or more processors of a base station, cause the base station to: transmit, to a UE, an indication to apply an amplitude drooping based at least in part on an uplink band being adjacent to a downlink band in a full-duplex operation; and receive, from the UE, an uplink transmission in the uplink band based at least in part on the amplitude drooping.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some implementations, an apparatus for wireless communication includes means for receiving, from a base station, an indication to apply an amplitude drooping based at least in part on an uplink band being adjacent to a downlink band in a full-duplex operation; and means for transmitting, to the base station, an uplink transmission in the uplink band based at least in part on the amplitude drooping.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some implementations, an apparatus for wireless communication includes means for transmitting, to a UE, an indication to apply an amplitude drooping based at least in part on an uplink band being adjacent to a downlink band in a full-duplex operation; and means for receiving, from the UE, an uplink transmission in the uplink band based at least in part on the amplitude drooping.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Aspects generally include a method, apparatus, system, computer program product, non-transitory computer-readable medium, user equipment, base station, wireless communication device, and/or processing system as substantially described herein with reference to and as illustrated by the drawings and specification.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The foregoing has outlined rather broadly the features and technical advantages of examples according to the disclosure in order that the detailed description that follows may be better understood.

A relay station is an entity that can receive a transmission of data from an upstream station (e.g., a base station <b>110</b> or a UE <b>120</b>) and send a transmission of the data to a downstream station (e.g., a UE <b>120</b> or a base station <b>110</b>). A relay station may be a UE <b>120</b> that can relay transmissions for other UEs <b>120</b>.

A base station <b>110</b> that relays communications may be referred to as a relay station, a relay base station, a relay, or the like.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The wireless network <b>100</b> may be a heterogeneous network that includes base stations <b>110</b> of different types, such as macro base stations, pico base stations, femto base stations, relay base stations, or the like. These different types of base stations <b>110</b> may have different transmit power levels, different coverage areas, and/or different impacts on interference in the wireless network <b>100</b>. For example, macro base stations may have a high transmit power level (e.g., 5 to 40 watts) whereas pico base stations, femto base stations, and relay base stations may have lower transmit power levels (e.g., 0.1 to 2 watts).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">A network controller <b>130</b> may couple to or communicate with a set of base stations <b>110</b> and may provide coordination and control for these base stations <b>110</b>. The network controller <b>130</b> may communicate with the base stations <b>110</b> via a backhaul communication link. The base stations <b>110</b> may communicate with one another directly or indirectly via a wireless or wireline backhaul communication link.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The UEs <b>120</b> may be dispersed throughout the wireless network <b>100</b>, and each UE <b>120</b> may be stationary or mobile. A UE <b>120</b> may include, for example, an access terminal, a terminal, a mobile station, and/or a subscriber unit. A UE <b>120</b> may be a cellular phone (e.g., a smart phone), a personal digital assistant (PDA), a wireless modem, a wireless communication device, a handheld device, a laptop computer, a cordless phone, a wireless local loop (WLL) station, a tablet, a camera, a gaming device, a netbook, a smartbook, an ultrabook, a medical device, a biometric device, a wearable device (e.g., a smart watch, smart clothing, smart glasses, a smart wristband, smart jewelry (e.g., a smart ring or a smart bracelet)), an entertainment device (e.g., a music device, a video device, and/or a satellite radio), a vehicular component or sensor, a smart meter/sensor, industrial manufacturing equipment, a global positioning system device, and/or any other suitable device that is configured to communicate via a wireless medium.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Some UEs <b>120</b> may be considered machine-type communication (MTC) or evolved or enhanced machine-type communication (eMTC) UEs. An MTC UE and/or an eMTC UE may include, for example, a robot, a drone, a remote device, a sensor, a meter, a monitor, and/or a location tag, that may communicate with a base station, another device (e.g., a remote device), or some other entity. Some UEs <b>120</b> may be considered Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, and/or may be implemented as NB-IoT (narrowband IoT) devices. Some UEs <b>120</b> may be considered a Customer Premises Equipment. A UE <b>120</b> may be included inside a housing that houses components of the UE <b>120</b>, such as processor components and/or memory components. In some examples, the processor components and the memory components may be coupled together. For example, the processor components (e.g., one or more processors) and the memory components (e.g., a memory) may be operatively coupled, communicatively coupled, electronically coupled, and/or electrically coupled.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In general, any number of wireless networks <b>100</b> may be deployed in a given geographic area. Each wireless network <b>100</b> may support a particular RAT and may operate on one or more frequencies. A RAT may be referred to as a radio technology, an air interface, or the like. A frequency may be referred to as a carrier, a frequency channel, or the like. Each frequency may support a single RAT in a given geographic area in order to avoid interference between wireless networks of different RATs. In some cases, NR or 5G RAT networks may be deployed.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some examples, two or more UEs <b>120</b> (e.g., shown as UE <b>120</b><i>a </i>and UE <b>120</b><i>e</i>) may communicate directly using one or more sidelink channels (e.g., without using a base station <b>110</b> as an intermediary to communicate with one another). For example, the UEs <b>120</b> may communicate using peer-to-peer (P2P) communications, device-to-device (D2D) communications, a vehicle-to-everything (V2X) protocol (e.g., which may include a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) protocol, a vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) protocol, or a vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P) protocol), and/or a mesh network. In such examples, a UE <b>120</b> may perform scheduling operations, resource selection operations, and/or other operations described elsewhere herein as being performed by the base station <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Devices of the wireless network <b>100</b> may communicate using the electromagnetic spectrum, which may be subdivided by frequency or wavelength into various classes, bands, channels, or the like. For example, devices of the wireless network <b>100</b> may communicate using one or more operating bands. In 5G NR, two initial operating bands have been identified as frequency range designations FR1 (410 MHz-7.125 GHz) and FR2 (24.25 GHz-52.6 GHz). It should be understood that although a portion of FR1 is greater than 6 GHz, FR1 is often referred to (interchangeably) as a &#x201c;Sub-6 GHz&#x201d; band in various documents and articles. A similar nomenclature issue sometimes occurs with regard to FR2, which is often referred to (interchangeably) as a &#x201c;millimeter wave&#x201d; band in documents and articles, despite being different from the extremely high frequency (EHF) band (30 GHz-300 GHz) which is identified by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) as a &#x201c;millimeter wave&#x201d; band.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The frequencies between FR1 and FR2 are often referred to as mid-band frequencies. Recent 5G NR studies have identified an operating band for these mid-band frequencies as frequency range designation FR3 (7.125 GHz-24.25 GHz). Frequency bands falling within FR3 may inherit FR1 characteristics and/or FR2 characteristics, and thus may effectively extend features of FR1 and/or FR2 into mid-band frequencies. In addition, higher frequency bands are currently being explored to extend 5G NR operation beyond 52.6 GHz. For example, three higher operating bands have been identified as frequency range designations FR4a or FR4-1 (52.6 GHz-71 GHz), FR4 (52.6 GHz-114.25 GHz), and FR5 (114.25 GHz-300 GHz). Each of these higher frequency bands falls within the EHF band.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">With the above examples in mind, unless specifically stated otherwise, it should be understood that the term &#x201c;sub-6 GHz&#x201d; or the like, if used herein, may broadly represent frequencies that may be less than 6 GHz, may be within FR1, or may include mid-band frequencies. Further, unless specifically stated otherwise, it should be understood that the term &#x201c;millimeter wave&#x201d; or the like, if used herein, may broadly represent frequencies that may include mid-band frequencies, may be within FR2, FR4, FR4-a or FR4-1, and/or FR5, or may be within the EHF band. It is contemplated that the frequencies included in these operating bands (e.g., FR1, FR2, FR3, FR4, FR4-a, FR4-1, and/or FR5) may be modified, and techniques described herein are applicable to those modified frequency ranges.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some aspects, a UE (e.g., UE <b>120</b>) may include a communication manager <b>140</b>.

Below some interference threshold, illustrated here as a dotted line, uplink and downlink may be adjacent to each other, but above the interference threshold, interference may degrade performance and a guard band separating the uplink and downlink may be useful. Where the dotted line interference threshold intersects the curved line, the vertical line indicates a corresponding uplink power below which interference may be small enough so that no guard band is used.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">An SBFD slot may be associated with an uplink band and a downlink band, wherein the downlink band may be adjacent to the uplink band.

However, full-duplex communications may be associated with self-interference between a downlink transmission and an uplink transmission. Self-interference may be an issue even with various self-interference mitigation techniques, such as separate panels for simultaneous transmit and receive operations, and/or using SBFD slots where a downlink and an uplink are associated with different portions of an SBFD slot. The self-interference may arise in an SBFD slot when tones closest to a downlink band, such as edges of an uplink band, cause the self-interference on the downlink band.

The UE may apply the amplitude drooping when an uplink band is adjacent to a downlink band in a full-duplex operation. The amplitude drooping may be associated with a change in signal power within a specified measurement window. The UE may apply the amplitude drooping by adjusting one or more coefficients associated with an RF filtering that is applied to a signal associated with an uplink transmission. The UE may adjust the one or more coefficients associated with the RF filtering to increase or decrease the amplitude drooping. The UE may transmit, to the base station, the uplink transmission in the uplink band based at least in part on the amplitude drooping. The UE may transmit the uplink transmission with the amplitude drooping to reduce a self-interference at the UE for a downlink reception in the downlink band that is adjacent to the uplink band. As a result, by intentionally adjusting the amplitude drooping for the full-duplex operation, the uplink transmission may not cause the self-interference on the downlink reception in the downlink band.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Amplitude drooping is generally not desirable, so intentionally adjusting the amplitude drooping for the purpose of reducing the self-interference in the full-duplex operation is not obvious in view of typical approaches that attempt to reduce the amplitude drooping. Amplitude drooping is a phenomenon that has previously been the subject of many attempts to eliminate due to its otherwise detrimental affect on signal quality.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In some aspects, the UE may exploit amplitude drooping (e.g., via RF filtering) for an uplink transmission to reduce self-interference to neighboring resource blocks in a downlink band in a full-duplex operation. In some aspects, the UE may report to the base station multiple amplitude drooping values that may be applied at the UE. The UE may report the multiple amplitude drooping values via uplink control information (UCI), a physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH), capability reporting, and/or UE assistance information. The base station may indicate to the UE, via layer <b>1</b> signaling or layer <b>2</b> signaling or semi-static signaling, which amplitude drooping value for the UE to apply.

Rather than the UE minimizing an amount of amplitude drooping, as in previous solutions, the base station may indicate to the UE to only compensate for a certain amount of amplitude drooping. In other words, the base station may effectively indicate to the UE to allow and/or create a certain amount of amplitude drooping for self-interference mitigation. The indication received from the base station may indicate an amplitude drooping value, where a relatively low amplitude drooping value may represent a relatively low level of amplitude drooping and a relatively high amplitude drooping value may represent a relatively high level of amplitude drooping.

The amplitude drooping values may correspond to various extents of amplitude drooping that the UE may achieve, which may be different than a UE capability.

In other words, the UE may apply an RRC configured amplitude drooping value for the active bandwidth part.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In some aspects, the UE may apply an amplitude drooping value based at least in part on a guard band between the downlink band and the uplink band, where the guard band may be defined based at least in part on an RRC configuration. As an example, the UE may be capable of applying one of four separate amplitude drooping values, where a first amplitude drooping value corresponds to a least amount of amplitude drooping and a fourth amplitude drooping value corresponds to a greatest amount of amplitude drooping. When the guard band between the downlink band and the uplink band is within a certain range, as defined by the RRC configuration, the UE may apply one of the four separate amplitude drooping values accordingly. As a result, the UE may implicitly apply different values of amplitude drooping based at least in part on the guard band between the downlink band and the uplink band.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">As shown by reference number <b>906</b>, the UE may apply the amplitude drooping based at least in part on the indication received from the base station. The UE may apply the amplitude drooping by adjusting one or more coefficients associated with an RF filtering that is applied to a signal associated with the uplink transmission.
