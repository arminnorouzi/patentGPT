The following description and drawings are illustrative of the invention and are not to be construed as limiting the invention. Numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of various embodiments of the present invention. However, in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order to provide a concise discussion of embodiments of the present inventions.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">An oral hygiene device <b>100</b> according to one or more embodiments may be used for removing tonsil stones. The device <b>100</b> may feature a main body <b>101</b> wherein the main body <b>101</b> includes a first end <b>102</b> and a second end <b>103</b> wherein the first end <b>102</b> may include a handle <b>104</b> and wherein the second end <b>103</b> may include an extraction tip <b>105</b> and wherein the main body <b>101</b> may be composed of a flexible material.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The device <b>100</b> is configured to remove tonsil stones in the palatine tonsils. Further, the device <b>100</b> is one that removes and or exposes tonsil stones without the use of suction. In one or more embodiments the device <b>100</b> is a manual device <b>100</b> that requires only rotation or application of manual (for example downward or inward) pressure, angled movement in the manner of a wedge or combinations thereof to safely and easily remove or expose a tonsil stone.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Flexibility, as used throughout this disclosure refers to a material's ability to move or bend when force is applied without breaking. In this context, flexibility is used to describe the device's <b>100</b> ability to be deformed when pressure is applied from a user's fingers or mouth. A flexible material allows the device <b>100</b> to deform such that if excess force is applied during use, the material will absorb the force and bend, rather than transfer the force to the user's tonsil. This absorption of force by the material and device <b>100</b> may prevent local tissue injury and provide more comfort to the user of the device <b>100</b>. Depending on the properties of the material, a flexible material used in the extraction tip <b>105</b> may also allow the extraction tip <b>105</b> to deform and compress the aperture <b>106</b>, trapping a tonsil stone using applied force rather than the tonsil stone being held in place using friction. The main areas where flexibility is utilized are in the neck <b>107</b> to the extraction tip <b>105</b>, to absorb extra force, and in the extraction tip <b>105</b>, to trap a tonsil stone. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>, the device <b>100</b> may have areas of flexibility extending a length from and including the neck <b>107</b> to the extraction tip <b>105</b> region. Flexibility, as used throughout this disclosure, also describes the ability of the flexible material to hold its shape when it is intentionally bent. The device <b>100</b> may be bent at an angle, hold the bent shape, and then be bent back to the original shape by the user. The ability for the device <b>100</b> to retain a customized bent shape is important for users to use the device <b>100</b> at different angles within their oral cavity to approach the tonsil crypts from different directions, therefore accessing tonsil stones that were previously inaccessible. Since people have different shaped tonsils which have different shaped and angled tonsil crypts, having the user manipulate the shape of the device <b>100</b> may allow for more successful extraction of the tonsil stones.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Other methods to achieve the shape customization include using a stimuli-responsive material using one or more stimuli selected from the group consisting of light, temperature, pH, humidity, electricity, and magnetism. Using a stimuli responsive material allows the user to customize the device <b>100</b> to meet the specific geometric requirements of their oral cavity and tonsillar crypt.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C</figref>, the device <b>100</b> may feature an aperture <b>106</b> in the extraction tip <b>105</b> wherein the aperture <b>106</b> is configured to hold a tonsil stone. The aperture <b>106</b> may be teardrop shaped <b>201</b> and the aperture <b>106</b> may have a first side <b>202</b> measuring less than 10 mm.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The teardrop shaped <b>201</b> aperture <b>106</b> may be described as comprised of a semicircular <b>203</b> aperture <b>106</b> connected to a triangular <b>204</b> aperture <b>106</b> which together form the overall teardrop shaped <b>201</b> aperture <b>106</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>. In one or more embodiments, the combination of the semicircular <b>203</b> aperture <b>106</b> and triangular <b>204</b> aperture <b>106</b> form a teardrop shaped <b>201</b> aperture <b>106</b> which may be longer than it is wide. For example, the triangular <b>204</b> shaped aperture <b>106</b> may be an isosceles triangle <b>204</b> in shape wherein a diameter of the semicircular <b>203</b> aperture <b>106</b> is substantially equal to a shortest side length of the teardrop shaped <b>201</b> aperture <b>106</b> defined by the triangular <b>204</b> aperture <b>106</b>. In further detail, the teardrop shaped <b>201</b> aperture <b>106</b> may be described as having a first side <b>202</b> length provided by one side length or leg of the triangular <b>204</b> aperture <b>106</b>. A second side <b>205</b> length may be considered an opposing side length or leg of the triangular <b>204</b> aperture <b>106</b>. The first side <b>202</b> length and second side <b>205</b> length may be of equal length and meet to form the acute angle <b>206</b> of the teardrop shaped <b>201</b> aperture <b>106</b>. The acute angle <b>206</b> of the teardrop shaped <b>201</b> aperture <b>106</b> may also be the narrowest part of the teardrop shaped <b>201</b> aperture <b>106</b> and may point towards the main body <b>101</b> of the device <b>100</b> or otherwise be adjacent to the main body <b>101</b>. Terminal ends of the first side <b>202</b> length and second side <b>205</b> length which extend away from the main body <b>101</b> may provide a maximum width <b>207</b> to the teardrop shape <b>201</b>. This may be considered a base of the triangular shape. This maximum width <b>207</b> may also be twice as long as a radius <b>208</b> of the semicircle <b>203</b>. An arcuate length provided by a curved section of the semicircle aperture <b>106</b> provides a rounded distal end to the teardrop shaped <b>201</b> aperture <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">An overall size of the teardrop shaped <b>201</b> aperture <b>106</b> may be described by a ratio between the radius <b>208</b> of the semicircle described above and the height <b>211</b> at the line of symmetry of the triangle <b>204</b>. For clarity, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> the dotted line labeled &#x201c;a&#x201d; represents the radius of the semicircle, and the dashed line labeled &#x201c;b&#x201d; represents the height <b>211</b> at the meridian. The ratio of &#x201c;a&#x201d; to &#x201c;b&#x201d; may be in the range of 1:0.25 to 1:10. In an embodiment the ratio is in the range of 1:2 to 1:5 as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>. In an embodiment, the aperture <b>106</b> shape may include but is not limited to teardrop, a symmetrical teardrop, an asymmetric teardrop, circular, triangular, rectangular, oblong, oval shape, or combination of.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">A narrowing geometry in the extraction tip <b>105</b> created by the teardrop shape <b>201</b> may aid in retaining the tonsil stone by acting as a &#x201c;wedge.&#x201d; The increased surface area created by the teardrop shape <b>201</b>, as opposed to a circular shape, provides more surface area for the tonsil stone to interact with, increasing the frictional forces on the stone, which may further contribute to holding the stone in place.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">A tonsil stone may be further held in place within the extraction tip <b>105</b> by the depth <b>209</b> of the aperture <b>106</b>. The depth <b>209</b> of the aperture <b>106</b> may create what is referred to in this disclosure as a platform <b>209</b>, such that a tonsil stone can be held in place on the platform <b>209</b>. The platform <b>209</b> may include internal geometric features for increased tonsil stone grip using frictional force. These geometric features may include but are not limited to texture, protruding or embossed, or curvature. The curvature may be conceptualized as the internal platform being concave, such that the outside edges around the aperture <b>106</b> are higher than the inside center of aperture <b>106</b>. The added texture or curvature may provide additional surface area to the platform <b>209</b> for the tonsil stone to interact with, increasing the frictional forces on the stone, which may further hold it in place. Depending on the flexibility of the material used to create the extraction tip <b>105</b>, the sides of the extraction tip <b>105</b> may compress with applied pressure to trap and grip a tonsil stone using applied force. There may also exist a combination of both internal protruding geometry and extraction tip <b>105</b> flexibility to maximize the grip on the tonsil stone such that when the extraction tip <b>105</b> is compressed, internal protruding geometry may be pressed into the stone to lock it in place.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The extraction tip <b>105</b> may be inserted into the tonsil crypt. As opposed to applying external pressure directly to the tonsil to express a tonsil stone, potentially damaging the tonsil tissue, inserting the extraction tip <b>105</b> directly into the crypt of the tonsil to capture the stone is a safer and more effective method of removing the stone since some stones are wedged in place within a tonsil such that no amount of applied external force would dislodge them from the crypt.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The extraction tip <b>105</b> may feature filleted edges <b>210</b> to eliminate any sharp or abrupt edges such that all edges are soft and non-damaging to tissue. A smooth filleted edge <b>210</b> may minimize potential damage to the tonsil tissue by preventing the tissue from being cut or scraped. According to another aspect of the invention every edge on the device <b>100</b> may be filleted so that the entirety of the device <b>100</b> is smooth with no rough or sharp edges.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The teardrop shaped <b>201</b> aperture <b>106</b> in the extraction tip <b>105</b> is specialized to not only remove the tonsil stone from the tonsil, but carry the tonsil stone out of the mouth for a significantly improved user experience. After removing the stone from the tonsil, it is preferable for users to also remove the stone from one's mouth. Although tonsil stones are safe to ingest, there is an &#x201c;ick&#x201d; factor in doing so, and users most commonly hack and spit the stones out of the mouth. The device <b>100</b> described herein addresses this issue by not only removing the stone from the tonsil crypt, but also carrying the stone out of the user's mouth without the need for hacking and spitting, increasing the satisfaction of using the device <b>100</b>. Water or other chemically compatible solution may be used to rinse the trapped tonsil stone from the extraction tip <b>105</b>. The trapped tonsil stone may also be removed from the extraction tip <b>105</b> by tapping the device <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">According to another embodiment, the device <b>100</b> may feature a handle <b>104</b> portion comprising a textured length <b>401</b> for producing a non-slip grip. The handle <b>104</b> may be part of a unitary structure with the main body, or it may be an additional attachment or overlay. For example, an ergonomic handle <b>104</b> may be attached over or on the main body's <b>101</b> handle <b>104</b> to provide a more comfortable user experience. Such ergonomic handles <b>104</b> could be made of a plushy silicone like material. The handle <b>104</b> may be attached using a variety of methods such as compression fit, mechanical attachment, or adhesive.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The device <b>100</b> may also feature a neck <b>107</b> between the extraction tip <b>105</b> and handle <b>104</b> wherein the neck <b>107</b> may be cylindrical or ovular in shape and may connect to the base of the extraction tip <b>105</b> at the smallest diameter and gradually taper to match the diameter of the handle <b>104</b>. Having a defined neck <b>107</b> as opposed to the main body <b>101</b> or handle <b>104</b> connecting to the extraction tip <b>105</b> allows for a slender geometry, allowing a user to see both the device <b>100</b> and their tonsils. Some people, most notably men, report frustration when using their fingers to express their stones due to the size of their finger both causing gag reflex and blocking the view of the tonsil. The slender tapered neck <b>107</b> may improve visibility and may reduce the gag reflex in users. Whereas too small of a device <b>100</b> could pose a choking risk, too large of a device <b>100</b> may increase the risk for triggering a gag reflex. Although the gag reflex is dependent on the person, it is usually triggered by larger objects. The device <b>100</b> described herein has a slender design which may minimize the risk for gaging.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">An oral hygiene device <b>100</b> according to one or more embodiments herein comprises a main body <b>101</b> extending between a handle <b>104</b> and an extraction tip <b>105</b>.
