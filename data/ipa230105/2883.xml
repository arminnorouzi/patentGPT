Holders for substrates can be attached to drums of drum coaters, and a film can be deposited or developed on the substrates. In certain implementations, it can be desirable to deposit or develop a film for which at least some portions have a relatively uniform thickness.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Disclosed herein are devices, systems and methods relating to film deposition.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In certain comparative systems, a drum coater includes multiple holders attached to surfaces of a drum. The holders have substantially flat surfaces. The drum of the drum coater may rotate (e.g., may be rotated by a motor) to expose, in turn, the substantially flat surfaces of the holders to a target from which a target material is sputtered. The sputtered target material deposits on the substantially flat surfaces to form films on the substantially flat surfaces.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the comparative systems, the drum may have a polygon shape, and the holders may be attached to respective sides of the polygon. As the drum rotates, certain portions of substantially flat surfaces of the substrates may be brought closer to the target than other portions of the substantially flat surfaces of the substrates. The film may develop to be thicker on the portions of the substantially flat surfaces of the substrates that are brought closer to the target, and relatively less thick on the portions of the substantially flat surfaces of the substrates that are brought less close to the target. This can result in the films having less uniform thicknesses than may be desired for certain applications.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some embodiments disclosed herein, a holder having an asymmetric shape (e.g., an asymmetric cross-section) is implemented. The asymmetric shape of the holder may be defined at least in part by certain portions of the holder being thicker than other portions of the holder. Such a holder may be referred to herein as an &#x201c;asymmetric holder.&#x201d; The asymmetric holder may include a base portion attached to the drum at a bottom surface of the holder. The base portion may have a substantially flat top surface opposite to the bottom surface. The asymmetric holder may include a top portion having a substantially non-uniform thickness. In such a system, certain portions of the base portion may be brought relatively less close to the target by the rotation of the drum, and certain other portions of the base portion may be brought relatively closer to the target by the rotation of the drum. The certain portions of the base portion that are brought relatively less close to the target by the rotation of the drum may correspond to (may be disposed below, or may underlie) relatively thicker portions of the top portion, and the certain portions of the base portion that are brought relatively closer to the target by the rotation of the drum may correspond to (may be disposed below, or may underlie) relatively thinner portions of the top portion. Thus, the asymmetry of the top portion of the asymmetric holder may at least somewhat account for variations in how close the portions of the base portion are brought to the target by the rotation of the drum, which can provide for a film deposition process that provides films having a more uniform thickness than the comparative systems described above.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, according to a first aspect, a system for film deposition includes a drum; a motor configured to rotate the drum in a direction of rotation; a target including a target material; and a holder attached to the drum.

The top surfaces <b>504</b>Sc and <b>504</b>Sd are inclined at respective angles relative to the top surface <b>504</b><i>b </i>of the base portion A, or relative to the surface <b>504</b>Sa.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0083">In some embodiments, one or more substrates <b>106</b> are mounted to the top surface <b>504</b>Sc, and no substrates <b>106</b> are mounted to the top surface <b>504</b>Sd. In such embodiments, the top surface <b>504</b>Sd may be referred to as &#x201c;dead space.&#x201d; In other embodiments, one or more substrates <b>106</b> may be mounted to the top surface <b>504</b>Sd (e.g., in addition to, or alternatively to, one or more substrates <b>106</b> being mounted to the top surface <b>504</b>Sc).</p><p id="p-0086" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates example configurations of surfaces of a holder <b>504</b>, according to embodiments of the present disclosure. The holder <b>504</b> may be the holder shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, and may include a base portion A, and a top portion B, and may have surfaces <b>504</b>Sa, <b>504</b>Sb, <b>504</b>Sc, <b>504</b>Sd. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the surfaces <b>504</b>Sc and <b>504</b>Sd may be inclined at various angles relative to the surface <b>504</b>Sb, or relative to the surface <b>504</b>Sa. Disclosed herein are ranges of angles for those surfaces, and lengths for those surfaces, that provide for improved and unexpected results, including development of a film having improved uniformity relative to holders (e.g., the holder <b>102</b>) that do not implement such angles or lengths. For example, the surface <b>504</b>Sc may be inclined at an angle in a range of 1 degree to 90 degrees (e.g., in a range of degree to 2 degrees) relative to the surface <b>504</b>Sb or <b>504</b>Sa. The surface <b>504</b>Sd may be inclined at an angle in a range of 1 degree to 90 degrees (e.g., in a range of 1 degree to 20 degrees) relative to the surface <b>504</b>Sb or <b>504</b>Sa. A sum of the length of the surface <b>504</b>Sc and <b>504</b>Sd may sum to 400 mm or less. Such configurations may provide for developing a film having a thickness uniformity of 2% or less, or a film wherein a difference in thickness between a thickest part of the film and a thinnest part of the film is less than 90 mm. In some embodiments, the holder <b>504</b> is configured to expose the substrate <b>106</b> to free particles of a target material such that a film of the target material is grown on the substrate <b>106</b>, wherein a difference in thickness between a thickest part of the film and a thinnest part of the film is less than 90 mm.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0085">As used herein and in the appended claims, singular articles such as &#x201c;a&#x201d; and &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; and similar referents in the context of describing the elements (especially in the context of the following claims) are to be construed to cover both the singular and the plural, unless otherwise indicated herein or clearly contradicted by context.

Certain features described in this specification in the context of separate embodiments can also be implemented in combination in a single embodiment. Conversely, various features described in the context of a single embodiment can also be implemented in multiple embodiments separately or in any suitable subcombination.
