For example, a mapping and guidance system can include a processor circuit configured to control an electrophysiology catheter to guide a therapeutic device to a treatment site.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Recently, there has been an increased focus on minimally invasive procedures to treat various neurological and physiological disorders, such as atrial fibrillation (AF) and hypertension. For example, AF is an abnormal heart rhythm characterized by rapid and irregular beating of the atria, and may be associated with heart palpitations, fainting, lightheadedness, shortness of breath, or chest pain. The disease is associated with an increased risk of heart failure, dementia, and stroke. AF may be caused by electrical pulses generated by secondary pacers at the ostium of the pulmonary veins. On the other hand, hypertension can be caused by renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) in which feedback from overactive renal sympathetic nerves causes increased blood pressure and can contribute to the deterioration of renal function.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">One way of treating such disorders includes ablating nerves and/or tissue to reduce the effect of the undesired neurological activity. Ablation can be performed in various ways, including radiofrequency (RF) ablation, ultrasonic ablation, electroporation ablation and cryoablation.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to guide a therapeutic device or therapeutic tool (e.g., ablation catheter, a diagnostic catheter or any endovascular tool) to the treatment site, the procedure is typically performed under external imaging, such as angiography or fluoroscopy. In conventional methods, angiographic and/or fluoroscopic procedures include injecting a contrast agent or dye into the vasculature to generate a roadmap image of the vasculature, and co-registering fluoroscopic images with the roadmap once the contrast agent has dissipated. The angiographic/fluoroscopic registration is used to show the location of the therapeutic tool, at least part of which is visible in the fluoroscopic image stream.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, angiography/fluoroscopy image guiding techniques suffer from a number of drawbacks. For example, some patients have negative reactions to contrast agent used to generate the roadmap of the vasculature. Further, it may beneficial to limit X-ray radiation exposure to the personnel and the patients.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another image guidance approach includes generating a map or image of an anatomy (e.g., atria of the heart, blood vessels, etc.) using electrodes to detect currents and/or voltages within the anatomy, for instance by means of an endovascular tool, such as an electrophysiology (EP) catheter. An anatomical image is generated based on electrograms provided by the electrodes. Based on knowledge of endovascular tool and/or therapeutic tool mechanics, the physician is able to guide and anchor the endovascular tool to a location such that the therapeutic tool (e.g., ablation balloon) can be deployed at the treatment site using the endovascular tool as a guide. However, during the procedure, for a number of reasons, the endovascular tool, such as the EP catheter, can move from the desired anchor location, thereby obliging the physician to reposition the endovascular tool, which can be time consuming and may considerably delay the procedure and may generate safety issue for the patient in the event the shift/move of the endovascular device changes some parameters derived from the detected currents and/or voltages within the anatomy which are not taken into account by the physician.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Aspects of the present disclosure provide devices, systems, and methods for visualizing a reference location of an electrophysiology device in an anatomical image. For example, according to one embodiment, an electrophysiological mapping and guidance system includes a processor circuit in communication with an endovascular device, such as a catheter, carrying a plurality of electrodes. The processor circuit controls the plurality of electrodes to obtain electrical measurements (e.g., voltage measurements) of an electrical field induced within an anatomical cavity. The electrical field may be induced by the electrodes of the catheter themselves, and/or by external body patch electrodes placed on the patient's skin, wherein the emitted electrical filed will be distorted by features of the anatomy. The processor circuit tracks the location of the electrodes based on distortions of the electrical field detected by the catheter electrodes. The physician can then visualize the current location of, for instance, the endovascular device (e.g. by assessment of the location of the electrodes comprised therewith) or the electrodes by watching a display that includes a computer-generated image of the anatomical cavity and a marker representative of the real-time location of the endovascular device or the electrodes. Once the physician has determined that the electrodes are at a location of interest, the physician initiates a user input via a user input device. In response to the user input, the processor circuit designates the location of the electrodes at the time the trigger signal is received as a reference location. The processor circuit can then simultaneously output a first visualization of the current location of the electrodes and a second visualization of the designated reference location of the electrodes. In this way, if the catheter moves during the procedure, the physician can guide or have guided the catheter back to the reference location based on the first and second visualizations.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to an exemplary embodiment, an apparatus for guiding an instrument (such as a tool, a device, a catheter or any other implement suitable to be (partially) introduced and subsequently guided into a body of a subject) within an anatomical cavity includes: a processor circuit configured for communication with a plurality of electrodes disposed on the instrument.

It is nevertheless understood that no limitation to the scope of the disclosure is intended. Any alterations and further modifications to the described devices, systems, and methods, and any further application of the principles of the present disclosure are fully contemplated and included within the present disclosure as would normally occur to one skilled in the art to which the disclosure relates. For example, although the following disclosure may refer to embodiments that include balloon therapy procedures, cryoablation, cyroballoons, cryocatheters, balloon angioplasty, RF balloon ablation, or RF balloons, it will be understood that such embodiments are exemplary, and are not intended to limit the scope of the disclosure to those applications. For example, it will be understood that the devices, systems, and methods described herein are applicable to a variety of treatment procedures in which a balloon is used to occlude a body lumen or body cavity. In particular, it is fully contemplated that the features, components, and/or steps described with respect to one embodiment may be combined with the features, components, and/or steps described with respect to other embodiments of the present disclosure. For the sake of brevity, however, the numerous iterations of these combinations will not be described separately.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As mentioned above, fluoroscopy-based approaches used in guiding intracavity therapy procedures, including navigation and deployment of a therapeutic balloon at the therapy site (e.g., blood vessel stenosis, pulmonary vein ostium), suffer from various drawbacks. It may be desirable to provide an approach for guiding a treatment procedure without using fluoroscopy and/or contrast agent. The present disclosure provides systems, methods, and devices for guiding a therapy procedure using electrical field detection for device visualization within an anatomical image or map. In particular, the present disclosure describes systems, methods, and devices for visualizing a reference location of a device relative to the current location of the device within the anatomical cavity. The systems and methods further provide such visualizations for guiding the procedures referred to.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some instances, imaging and/or therapeutic devices may unintentionally be moved from a desired location, such as a treatment site, during an imaging or therapeutic procedure. In that regard, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a graphical view of an inflated ablation balloon <b>132</b> positioned at the ostium of the pulmonary vein <b>10</b>. In an exemplary embodiment, the balloon <b>132</b> is cryoballoon. The cryoballoon <b>132</b> is configured to be inflated and then at least partially filled with a cooling fluid to cool the cryoballoon to a temperature (e.g., below &#x2212;65&#xb0; C.) that causes an electrically-isolating lesion or firewall in the tissue. For example, the cryoballoon <b>132</b> may be in fluid communication with a source or reservoir of cooling fluid via one or more fluid lines positioned within a flexible elongate member <b>134</b>. Further, the cryoballoon <b>132</b> may be in fluid communication with an air or gas source, e.g., for balloon inflation, via one or more fluid lines positioned within the flexible elongate member <b>134</b>. The balloon <b>132</b> may be coupled to a distal portion of a flexible elongate member <b>134</b> that is protruding out a distal end of a sheath <b>136</b>. The balloon <b>132</b> and flexible elongate member are parts of a cryoballoon catheter. The EP catheter may be slidably introduced within a lumen of the cryoballoon catheter, i.e. a lumen within the flexible elongate member. In some embodiments, the sheath <b>136</b> is first introduced into the left atrium, and used to guide the EP catheter <b>120</b> to a reference location associated with an ablation site (e.g., pulmonary vein ostium). The balloon <b>132</b> attached to the flexible elongate member may then be moved over the EP catheter <b>120</b> to the ablation site and positioned (anchored) such that a full circumference of the balloon <b>132</b> can be or is in contact with an entire circumference of the ostium of the pulmonary vein <b>10</b> once the balloon is guided over the EP catheter towards the treatment site or position (ablation site), and such that the ablation can be delivered around the entire circumference of the pulmonary vein. Although the example refers to cryoballoon catheters, it is exemplary of many more types of balloon assisted treatments as referred to herein before.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">It is possible that, before moving the balloon <b>132</b> over the EP catheter <b>120</b> to the ablation site, the distal end of the EP catheter <b>120</b> carrying a plurality of electrodes <b>124</b> moves away from the desired location. For example, the balloon ablation procedure may involve one or more steps in which the balloon <b>132</b> is inflated, advanced toward from the PV ostium, or retracted away from the PV ostium. These movements of the balloon <b>132</b> are made relative to the EP catheter <b>120</b>, which is positioned within a lumen of the sheath <b>136</b>. Thus, in some instances, inflating and/or moving the balloon <b>132</b> may incidentally cause the position and/or orientation of the distal end of the EP catheter <b>120</b> relative to the anatomy to change. If the EP catheter <b>120</b> has substantially moved from its reference position, it is possible that the balloon <b>132</b> will not be correctly positioned to fully occlude the pulmonary vein <b>10</b> if the balloon <b>132</b> is guided over the EP catheter <b>120</b>. Thus, the physician may choose to delay the ablation procedure until the EP catheter <b>120</b> can be repositioned and/or oriented at the reference location.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">To ensure patient safety, it may be desirable to perform therapeutic procedures as quickly as possible. There is therefore a need to ensure that the physician can quickly guide an instrument, such as an imaging and/or therapeutic device, back to the reference location. Using the techniques described below, simultaneous visualization of the reference location and the current location of the electrodes and/or the distal end of the EP catheter allows the physician to more readily navigate the device (EP catheter) back to the reference location if the device has moved. Such movement of the EP catheter is particularly likely to happen during manipulation of a guided member which slides over the EP cathteter such as the cryoballoon. Accordingly, therapeutic workflows can be improved.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The systems and methods are thus not limited to cryoballoon or balloon therapy procedures, but are of advantage for other procedures where a medical insturment comprises the guide member and a guided member guided by the guidemember while the instrument is deployed within a subject undergoing to the medical procedure.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The foregoing may be achieved by a computer-implemented method configured to save (in a memory) parameters indicative of a reference location or treatment site (e.g., ablation site) for an imaging and/or treatment device. In particular the parameters for the guide member of the instrument are then saved. Such parameters may include (i) location, (ii) position, and (iii) orientation. Further, such parameters may be automatically determined or selected based on information set by a user, or manually selected by the user following an interaction with the user interface (e.g. clicking a button, saying a phrase, etc.). The saved parameters are translated into a visualization or graphical representation on a user interface relative to an anatomy of the heart in a manner that is distinctive (e.g. color, transparency, contrast) from a real time location of the same ablation catheter.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">According to one embodiment of the present disclosure, a method for visualizing a reference location and current location of an instrument includes: receiving electrical signals from a plurality of electrodes disposed on the instrument; determining a plurality of parameters associated with a predetermined section of the instrument based on the electrical signals received by the plurality of electrodes, wherein said parameters are indicative of location, position and orientation of the predetermined section of the instrument; receiving, at a first time, a trigger or instruction to save the determined parameters of the predetermined section of the ablation device; displaying, on a display, the reference parameters relative to a representation of the instrument at the first time, and relative to the anatomical cavity; and displaying a real-time representation of the ablation device at a second time, which second time follows the first time, on the display concomitantly to the reference representation, wherein the reference representation differs from the real-time representation, thereby enabling the instrument to be aligned per the reference parameters at a third time.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a diagrammatic schematic view of an EP cryoablation system <b>100</b>, according to aspects of the present disclosure. The EP cryoablation system <b>100</b> includes an EP catheter <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, the EP catheter <b>120</b> extends through a lumen of a cryoballoon catheter <b>130</b>. The EP catheter <b>120</b> is communicatively coupled to an EP catheter interface <b>112</b>, which is communicatively coupled to a mapping and guidance system <b>114</b>. The cryoballoon catheter <b>130</b> may include an inflatable cryoballoon <b>132</b> coupled to a distal portion of a flexible elongate member <b>134</b>, which may comprise a sheath. The EP catheter <b>120</b> may be positioned at least partially within a lumen of the flexible elongate member <b>134</b> such that a distal portion <b>122</b> of the EP catheter <b>120</b>, which comprises a plurality of electrodes positioned on an elongate tip member, may protrude out a distal end of the cryoballoon catheter <b>130</b>. For example, the cryoballoon catheter <b>130</b> may comprise a lumen configured to slidably receive the EP catheter <b>120</b>. The EP catheter <b>120</b> may comprise a flexible elongate member configured to be positioned within the cryoballoon catheter <b>130</b>. In some embodiments, the cryoballoon catheter <b>130</b> may be introduced into the body cavity first and the EP catheter <b>120</b> may be advanced distally within the cryoballoon catheter <b>130</b> until the distal portion <b>122</b> of the EP catheter <b>120</b> protrudes out of the distal end of the cryoballoon catheter <b>130</b> at a region of interest (e.g., an ablation site).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The distal portion <b>122</b> of the EP catheter may comprise a plurality of electrodes positioned on the elongate tip member. In some embodiments, the EP catheter comprises between 8 and 10 electrodes. However, the EP catheter can include other numbers of electrodes, including 2, 4, 6, 14, 20, 30, 60, or any other suitable number of electrodes, both larger and smaller. The elongate tip member may be configured to be positioned distally of the cryoballoon, and may be biased, shaped, or otherwise structurally configured to assume a shape, such as a circular shape, in which the electrodes are spaced from one another about one or more planes. For example, the EP catheter can be a spiral mapping catheter (SMC) in which electrodes are distributed along an elongate tip member in a spiral configuration. Other configurations may be used.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Such shapes may be advantageous as they may be used to position or releasably anchor the EP catheter to a desired location in a subject cavity having a shape and/or size, by assuming the shape once maneuvered to the location.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">While in the current examples EP catheters are used as an example to explain the workings of the aspects and embodiments of the current disclosure, the use of EP catheters as guide members is not needed perse, i.e. the principles of the present disclosure are more generally applicable to any type of system, method that makes use of guided devices guided by a guide member. In such case the guide member of such device needs to have one and preferably more than one electrode at a section which is used for reversibly anchoring the device at a reference location and which may be used to determine the location of such electrode and therewith the section of the device during a treatment.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">For example, in some embodiments the treatment device (guided member) is one to be used in structural organ repair such as needed within procedures of structural heart disease or vein occlusion. The treatment device may thus be an implantable device such as e.g. a stent, mitral clip or the like while the guide member is a guide wire or catheter used to guide the treatment device to a particular site where it is needed.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some embodiments, commercially-available EP catheters are used as the guide member with the system <b>100</b>, including the Achieve&#x2122; and Achieve Advance&#x2122; Mapping catheters manufactured by Medtronic&#x2122;. The EP catheter can be designed for use with the Arctic Front&#x2122; Family of Cardiac Cryoablation Catheters and/or the FlexCath&#x2122; Advance Steerable Sheath, manufactured by Medtronic&#x2122;. In some embodiments, the cryoballoon <b>132</b> comprises a plurality of electrodes positioned on an exterior surface of the cryoballoon <b>132</b> and configured to obtain data used to determine occlusion at an ablation site. Further details regarding EP catheters and assemblies can be found in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,002,955, titled &#x201c;Stabilized Electrophysiology Catheter and Method for Use,&#x201d; the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The system <b>100</b> further comprises a plurality of body patch electrodes <b>140</b> and a reference patch electrode <b>142</b> communicatively coupled to a patch electrode interface <b>116</b>, which is in communication with the mapping and guidance system <b>114</b>. For example, the patch electrodes <b>140</b> and the reference electrode <b>142</b> may be coupled to the patch electrode interface <b>116</b> via electrical cables. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the system <b>100</b> comprises six external body patch electrodes <b>140</b> and one reference electrode <b>142</b>. However, in some embodiments, the system <b>100</b> comprises fewer or more body patch electrodes <b>140</b> than are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, including 1, 2, 4, 8, 10, 12, 20, or any other suitable number of body patch electrodes, both lager and smaller. Further, in some embodiments, the system <b>100</b> may include more than one reference electrode <b>142</b>, including 2, 4, 5, or any other suitable number of reference patch electrodes.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The patch electrodes <b>140</b> and reference electrode <b>142</b> may be used to generate images or models of a body cavity, such as the chambers of the heart, body lumens that provide access to the body cavity, and other features identified to be electrically isolated from the body cavity (e.g., the pulmonary vein). For example, the patch electrodes <b>140</b> may be used in pairs to generate electrical fields in different directions and at different frequencies within a body cavity of a patient. The patch electrodes <b>140</b> may be controlled by the mapping and guidance system <b>114</b> and/or the patch electrode interface <b>116</b> to generate the electrical fields. Mapping data is obtained by the electrodes of the EP catheter <b>120</b> by detecting distortions in the electrical fields. The mapping data may then be used to generate the image or model of the body volume, such as a cavity of the heart. The mapping and guidance system <b>114</b> may then output the generated map of the cavity to a display.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Further, the mapping and guidance system <b>114</b> may be configured to determine a location of the EP catheter within the body cavity and output a visualization to the display that indicates a position of the EP catheter <b>120</b> within the map. For example, based on the mapping data acquired by the electrodes of the EP catheter, the mapping and guidance system <b>114</b> may be configured to determine the position of the electrodes of the EP catheter, and output a visualization indicating the position of each of the electrodes on the map. Further, based on the determined position of the electrodes of the EP catheter, the mapping and guidance system <b>114</b> may be configured to determine or estimate a location of the cryoballoon <b>132</b> within the body cavity. A more detailed explanation of the use of body patch electrodes and catheter electrodes to map body volumes and visualize the locations of EP catheters within the map can be found in, for example, U.S. Pat.

The anatomy of the patient causes distortions in the induced electrical fields, resulting in non-homogenous electric fields. The bending of the electric fields caused by the anatomy can be detected by measuring the voltages at each of the catheter electrodes. In particular, each catheter electrode measures the potential (voltage) associated with each of the electric fields induced by the body patch electrodes. In some embodiments, different pairs or subsets of body patch electrodes induce different electric fields (e.g., different frequencies). The processor circuit detects the changes in the electric fields caused by the anatomy based on the voltage measurements at the catheter electrodes. In that regard, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates a topographical view <b>310</b> of a non-homogenous electrical field within a chamber of the heart, such as the left atrium. The various tissue structures surrounding the left atrium cause distortions to the electrical field induced by body patch electrodes. The spatial variances and/or distortions of the electrical field can be detected by the plurality of electrodes. In particular, the processor circuit converts the voltage measurements (mV) of the catheter electrodes into corresponding distances (mm) based on preconfigured calibration data associated with the particular catheter currently in use. Known methods as disclosed by the references hereinbefore may be used for that purpose.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In step <b>204</b>, the processor circuit generates a map or image of the anatomical cavity based on the electrical signals. In particular, the detected distortions in the electrical field are used to locate tissue structures surrounding an anatomical cavity. In some embodiments, preconfigured calibration data and/or other information associated with the electrodes is stored on a memory in communication with the processing system. The physician may select an instrument (e.g., EP catheter) being used from a dropdown menu to identify and recall the associated preconfigured calibration data for that particular instrument. Using the preconfigured calibration data for the instrument carrying the plurality of electrodes, and known spatial relationships of the electrodes (e.g., spacing, order), the processor circuit solves equations representing the positions of the catheter electrodes in such a manner that at least a threshold percentage (e.g., 80%, 90%, 95%) of all locations of the electrodes match an allowed orientation of the electrodes as determined by the calibration process. Based on the bending of the electric fields (e.g., gradient) as measured by the voltages at the electrodes and corresponding positions of the electrodes, the anatomical image is created.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In some embodiments, the plurality of electrodes positioned within the anatomical cavity are also configured to emit an electrical signal at a particular frequency. Further, all of the electrodes may be configured to detect the electrical signals emitted by the other electrodes at the other frequencies, in addition to the electrical signal emitted by the electrode. For example, a first electrode may be configured to emit a first electrical signal at a first frequency, and a second electrode may be configured to emit a second electrical signal at a second frequency. In an exemplary embodiment, the first electrode is used to detect the first electrical signal at the first frequency, and the second electrical signal is used to detect the second electrical signal at the second frequency. However, in other embodiments, the first electrode may detect the second electrical signal at the second frequency in addition to its own first electrical signal at the first frequency. Similarly, the second electrode may detect the first electrical signal at the first frequency in addition to its own second electrical signal at the second frequency.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The plurality of electrodes is moved around the anatomical cavity to obtain electrical field measurements at a variety of locations. Using the information obtained by the plurality of electrodes moving to a plurality of locations within the cavity, a voltage field map of the electromagnet field can be generated. Based on the voltage map, the distortions in the electrical field can be computed by the processor circuit. The processor circuit uses these detected distortions to locate the tissue structures and build a map.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">With reference to step <b>204</b> of the method <b>200</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows a user interface <b>320</b> that includes three-dimensional anatomical images <b>322</b>, <b>324</b>, or views of the left atrium. For example, a first atrial view <b>322</b> is a perspective three-dimensional view of the internal structure of the left atrium <b>20</b> and pulmonary veins <b>10</b>. The view <b>322</b> includes an EP catheter indicator <b>326</b> that shows a location and/or orientation of the electrodes at the distal portion or an EP catheter. In some embodiments, the view <b>322</b> can be manipulated (e.g., oriented, re-sized, moved) by a user to provide different views or angles of the left atrium. A second atrial view <b>324</b> may comprise a flattened panoramic view of the left atrium <b>20</b>. For example, the second view <b>324</b> may be generated by translating, stretching, distorting, or otherwise modifying the first view <b>322</b>. The second view <b>324</b> shows the ostia of the pulmonary veins in a 3D flattened configuration, which may be advantageous for planning and performing ablation procedures, particularly in order to carry out the full ablation procedure without repeated manipulation and frequent changes in projection of the 3D reconstructed image. The views <b>322</b>, <b>324</b> can be used to locate the desired treatment site, and to guide placement of a therapeutic balloon at the treatment sites, and/or otherwise plan the treatment procedure. In some embodiments, one or more locations of the EP catheter are recorded during the mapping procedure described with respect to step <b>204</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In step <b>206</b>, the processor circuit tracks the location of the plurality of electrodes based on the detected electrical field. In an exemplary embodiment, the processor circuit determines the location based on detected distortions in the electrical field(s) within the anatomical cavity. In one embodiment, the plurality of electrodes is positioned on a distal tip or portion of an EP catheter. The distal tip of the EP catheter may be shaped in a circle, ellipse, loop, or biased to maintain such shapes, such that the electrodes are spaced from one another in various directions in three-dimensional space. In some embodiments, the electrodes are configured to continuously or repeatedly measure the electrical field and transmit electrograms or electrical signals representative of the electrical field to the processor circuit. In some embodiments, the electrodes used to emit the EM field include a plurality of body patch electrodes, a plurality of catheter-mounted electrodes, and/or any other suitable type of electrode. Further, it will be understood that the EM field may include multiple EM fields having different parameters or properties, such as different frequencies. In an exemplary embodiment, the electrodes of the EP catheter <b>120</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> may be used to emit the EM field. The processor circuit detects or computes distortions in the electrical field, and determines a current or real-time location of the electrodes based on the detected distortions.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In step <b>208</b>, the processor circuit displays a marker of the real-time location of the plurality of electrodes. In some aspects, displaying the marker may include generating a signal representative of the marker based on the determined location, and outputting the signal to a display in communication with the processor circuit. The signal may comprise any suitable type of communication, such as an electrical signal (e.g., digital electrical signal) representative of image data. For example, the electrical signal may be in a format suitable for display by a display device (e.g., computer monitor, television screen, mobile computing device display, etc.). In some embodiments, step <b>208</b> includes displaying the marker with respect to a view or map of the anatomical cavity as generated in step <b>204</b>. For example, the marker may be overlaid on the anatomical map generated as described above. In that regard, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> depicts a graphical user interface <b>400</b> that includes a three-dimensional anatomical image <b>410</b> of a left atrium, and a marker <b>412</b> of the current location of the EP catheter. The marker <b>412</b> comprises a shape that is representative of the shape of the distal portion of the EP catheter on which the electrodes are disposed. The marker <b>412</b> is output to the display at a position relative to the anatomical image <b>410</b> to illustrate the current location of the distal portion of the EP catheter within the anatomy, as determined in step <b>206</b>. Accordingly, the position, shape, and orientation of the marker <b>412</b> illustrates the position, shape, and orientation of the distal portion of the EP catheter, in three-dimensions. Further, the marker <b>412</b> includes electrode indicia that show the arrangement and relative positions of the individual electrodes at the distal portion of the EP catheter. In particular, the electrode indicia include numerals identifying the corresponding electrode. Because the shape of the distal portion of the EP catheter may change during the procedure, the processor circuit may be configured to update the shape of the marker <b>412</b> to show the changes in the shape, orientation, and/or location of the distal portion of the EP catheter.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In step <b>210</b>, the processor circuit receives a user input or command to designate a particular instantaneous location of the plurality of electrodes as a reference location. In some embodiments, the user input may be received from a user input device, such as keyboard, computer mouse, touch screen display, physical button, microphone, foot pedal, or any other suitable type of user input device. For example, once the physician has determined, by viewing the marker <b>412</b> of the current location of the EP catheter, that the distal portion of the EP catheter is positioned at a desired reference location, the physician may trigger the designation of the location as the reference location by pressing a key on a keyboard, clicking a mouse button, or speaking a phrase into a microphone of a voice command system. The processor circuit then designates the location as the reference location by, for example, saving the electrical parameters or measurements associated with the location to a memory.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In step <b>212</b>, the processor circuit displays a second marker of the reference location simultaneously with the marker of the current, or real-time location of the plurality of electrodes.

The second marker <b>414</b> of the reference location may be referred to as a landmark or a shadow for the purposes of the present disclosure. Thus, when the current location of the EP catheter deviates from the reference location and/or orientation, the physician can determine the relative position, orientation, and/or extent of deviation in order to navigate the EP catheter back to the reference location and orientation.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the first marker <b>412</b> of the current location and the second marker <b>414</b> of the reference location are created and generated in a same procedure. For example, a physician may trigger the designation of the reference location to display the second marker <b>414</b> while the first marker <b>412</b> continues to be displayed. Alternatively, in some embodiments, the parameters associated with the second marker <b>414</b> may be recalled in a later procedure. In that regard, the reference location may be designated in an imaging procedure at a first time, before performing a therapy. The imaging procedure may be paused or terminated before returning to perform the therapeutic procedure at a later second time. During the later therapeutic procedure, the first marker <b>412</b> is again shown within the anatomical cavity of the anatomical image. The parameters associated with the reference location are recalled and the second marker <b>414</b> is displayed simultaneously with the first marker <b>412</b>. Accordingly, the physician is allowed more flexibility in determining how and when to perform the imaging and therapy procedures. In that regard, it will be understood that, while the visualization techniques described herein may refer to visualizing current and reference locations of electrodes as part of a therapy procedure, the present disclosure contemplates that the visualization techniques may be performed during an imaging procedure that does not include therapy. Further, the present disclosure also contemplates the visualization of the current and reference locations in which both imaging and therapy procedures are performed.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In some embodiments, the processor circuit is further configured to calculate a distance between the reference location and the current location of the plurality of electrodes, and output a graphical representation of the distance to the display. The graphical indication of the distance can be used as an indicator of how well a placement of the guide member (e.g. EP catheter) is during a procedure. When it becomes to large, the physician may decide to suspend further manipulation of the guided member (e.g. cryoballoon) until he has repositioned the guide member closer to its original or reference position. He may also use the distance indicator to assist his efforts of repositioning.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In that regard, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows a textual indicator <b>416</b> that provides a real-time distance measurement between the current location and the reference location. The second marker <b>414</b> may have one or more visual characteristics that differ from one or more corresponding visual characteristics of the first marker <b>412</b>. For example, the second marker <b>414</b> may have a different color, degree of transparency, brightness, pattern, outline, or any other suitable visual characteristic that can indicate the distinction between the first marker <b>412</b> and the second marker <b>414</b>.

For example, in some embodiments, the processor circuit is configured to analyze the anatomical image to identify an anatomical feature of interest. The anatomical feature of interest may be associated with a treatment location and/or a reference location. For example, the anatomical feature may be a pulmonary vein or pulmonary vein ostium. Once the anatomical feature of interest is identified, the processor circuit is configured to determine a desired reference location automatically. In some embodiments, the user input is representative of a location within the anatomical image. For example, instead of triggering a save-to-memory of the currently displayed location of the electrodes, the physician may select, using a touch screen interface, a trackball, mouse, or other user interface device, a location on the anatomical image.
