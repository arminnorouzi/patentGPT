In doing so, the network service communicates with a pool of service providers over the given geographic region, each operating a vehicle for providing services and one or more computing devices (&#x201c;service provider devices&#x201d; or &#x201c;provider devices&#x201d;). The network system receives requests for services (e.g., a transport service, a delivery service, etc.) from requesting users via a designated user or client application (&#x201c;user application&#x201d;) executing on the users' mobile computing devices (&#x201c;user devices&#x201d;). In response, the network system identifies one or more available service providers to fulfill each user's request.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In various aspects, a query can be submitted from a user device of a requesting user. The query can include a desired service location determined using location data generated by the user device or inputted by the requesting user via the user application. In one example, the query can be submitted in response to the user launching or activating the user application. The query can also be submitted in response to the user's selection of a user interface feature (e.g., a soft selection feature for &#x201c;Search&#x201d; or &#x201c;Submit&#x201d;). In response, the network system can identify a plurality of available nearby entities (e.g., entities located within a predetermined distance from the service location, or within a specified region, etc.) and/or a number of available items offered by those entities. As referred to herein, an entity can correspond to an individual, a company, a group, a vendor or merchant, etc., that provides one or more goods or items for sale (e.g., a chef, a baker, a restaurant, a caf&#xe9;, a store, etc.). The user device can also transmit data corresponding to a request for service that includes the requesting user's selection of one or more selected items from the available items. In response, the network system can transmit data corresponding to selected items to each of a sub-set of the plurality of entities (e.g., entities that provide the one or more selected items). The network system can also select a service provider(s) to fulfill the request for service and determine a route for the selected service provider(s). In one example, the route can include route segments to the locations of each of the sub-set of entities (e.g., in a specified order) and a route segment to the service location. For example, the route can include a first route segment from a location (e.g., current location of the selected service provider) to the location of a first one of the sub-set of entities, a second route segment from the first one of the sub-set of entities to a second one of the sub-set of entities, etc. The route can further include a last route segment from the location of one of the sub-set of entities to the service location. Using the network service, a requesting user can view available items without the need to first select or be restricted to one particular entity from the plurality of nearby entities. The requesting user can also select items from multiple entities in a single request.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to embodiments, the network system associates timing information or timing data (referred to herein as &#x201c;preparation time(s)&#x201d;) with individual entities and/or with items offered by individual entities in the given geographic region in order to manage the network service within the given geographic region. In certain contexts, such as for food or restaurant vendors or merchants, a preparation time can include one or more of the following: (i) an estimated duration of time for someone to receive requests, (ii) an estimated duration of time for someone to process requests, (iii) an estimated duration of time for someone to gather ingredients for the selected items, (iv) an estimated duration of time for someone to prepare the selected items, or (v) an estimated duration of time for someone to ready the selected items for pickup by service providers. In other examples, the preparation times can include other durations of time (e.g., buffer times between the listed durations, etc.). The preparation times can be determined based on historical data. For instance, the network system can maintain, in one or more databases, historical records of the preparation times associated with each selected item and analyze the historical records (e.g., using statistical modeling, machine learning, etc.) to estimate or determine each item's preparation time. The preparation times can also be determined dynamically, and/or periodically, using real-time data received from the entities and/or based on the current date or time when the preparation times are determined. For example, the network system can receive, from an entity, real-time data regarding currently pending requests received by the entity to estimate or determine a preparation time associated with an item offered by the entity. Furthermore, the preparation times can be pre-determined using data collected through trial runs in preparing the offered items. For example, trial runs for one or more items can be conducted and preparation times can be measured and recorded based on the trial runs. The preparation times can also include anticipated or estimated delays associated with, for example, order backlogs at entities. In some examples, the preparation times can be adjusted based on estimated or anticipated demand (or current demand and/or number of requested placed during a duration of time) or other circumstances (e.g., a sporting event, weather conditions, etc.). For instance, the network system can adjust preparation times to take into account delays associated with expected backlogs of requests received by entities during high-demand periods.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In various examples, the network system receives a query from a user device operated by a requesting user to view available items (e.g., restaurant menu items) offered by a plurality of available entities. The query can include data regarding a service location. The service location can be determined based on geo-location data generated by the user device (e.g., GPS, GLONASS, or Galileo data etc.). The service location can also be inputted by the user through the user application or auto-populated based on historical data pertaining to the user (e.g., a home location, a favorite location, etc.). The network system can identify the plurality of available entities based on the service location (e.g., within a certain distance from the service location, within the same geographic region or sub-region as the service location, within a certain estimated time of travel from the service location, etc.). In examples herein, each entity can be associated with a location that the network system can access to determine whether an entity should be one that is available in response to a query or request.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some examples, the network system can also identify available items for selection by the requesting user from items offered by the plurality of entities. The identification of available items can be based on preparation times associated with the offered items. As one example, the requesting user can enter a desired service time (e.g., a desired time for ordered items to arrive at the service location, such as now or in fifty minutes, etc.). The network system can identify a sub-set of the items offered by the plurality of entities as the available items based on the desired service time and estimated service durations (e.g., estimated time for an item to arrive at the service location). The estimated service durations can include, or be estimated based on, respective preparation times associated with the items. For instance, if an item can be prepared in time to arrive at the service location around (e.g., within a predefined window of time) or at the desired service time, the network system can identify the item as an available item. The identification of available items can also be based on factors such as inventory at the plurality of available entities (e.g., inventory of available raw materials or ingredients), user preferences and other profile information (e.g., food allergies), menu item information (e.g., information indicating that an item is unsuitable for travel time of longer than <b>20</b> minutes), etc. In doing so, the network system can identify and cause the user application to selectively display those available items that are particularly suitable for selection in response to the requesting user's query.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to embodiments, the user device operated by the requesting user can receive content data corresponding to the available items and information related thereto (e.g., preparation times, values associated with the available items, entity information, user reviews, and ratings, etc.) from the network system. The user device can display one or more menus or lists of the available items for viewing and selection by the requesting user. In response to the requesting user's selection of one or more items, the user device can generate and transmit data corresponding to a request to the network system.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In various examples, the network system can receive the request data from a user device corresponding to the user's selection of one or more selected items from the available items. In response, the network system can process the request data, identify which items were selected, identify the appropriate entities (e.g., a sub-set of the plurality of available entities) that provide those items (e.g., using an identifier of the item and/or the identifier of the entity), and transmit information regarding the one or more selected items to the appropriate entities. Such information can allow the entities to begin preparing the one or more selected items. In addition, the network system can determine an optimal route for a service provider to take in fulfilling the requested service. The route can include route segments to each of the locations of the sub-set of entities (e.g., a first route segment from the current location of the selected service provider to a first one of the sub-set of entities, a second route segment from the first one of the sub-set of entities to a second one of the sub-set of entities, etc.) and a route segment to the service location (e.g., a last route segment from the last one of the sub-set of entities to the service location). The network system can determine the optimal route based on the respective preparation times associated with the one or more selected items. For instance, the network system can determine the optimal route such that the selected service provider arrives at an entity at or around the time when the entity is estimated to have finished preparing a corresponding selected item. Furthermore, the network system can determine an entity order (e.g., sequence of entities that the service provider is to travel to on the route) based on the preparation times of the one or more selected items. For instance, a first entity can be sequenced before a second entity based on the network system's determination that a first item(s) to be prepared by the first entity is estimated to be prepared before a second item(s) to be prepared by the second entity, based on the preparation times associated with the first and second items. The network system can also optimize the route based on travel time and/or travel distance. In doing so, the network system can minimize wait time by the service provider (e.g., waiting for items to be prepared at the respective entities locations) and by the requesting user. The network system can further leverage the respective preparation times of the one or more selected items to inform the service provider of an appropriate time to depart for the entities or to inform the service provider of an estimated wait time upon arriving at an entity. In various aspects, the network system can also determine the optimal route based on traffic information (e.g., historical traffic patterns, real-time traffic data, predicted traffic patterns, etc.).</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to embodiments, the network system can select a service provider(s) from a pool of service providers in the geographic region to fulfill the service request from the requesting user. The network system can communicate with provider devices operated by service providers to receive data including data regarding location (e.g., geo-location data generated by the provider device) and status (e.g., indicating whether a service provider is available to fulfill a service request). The network system can select a service provider to fulfill the service request based on service provider's location and status. For example, the network system can select a service provider that is located proximately (e.g., within a mile) to one or more entities and/or to the service location. The network system can also select a service provider based on a provider type associated with the service provider (e.g., automobile, motorcycle, bicycle, on-foot, etc.). For instance, the network system can select a service provider based on the service provider's provider type that is determined to particularly suit the service location, entity locations, and/or a route (or a portion thereof) determined by the network system (e.g., route to the entity locations and to the service location). For instance, if the service location, entity locations, and/or the route are located in a particularly dense urban environment, the network system can determine to select a service provider having a bicycle provider type. On the other hand, if the route includes a segment over a highway or an expressway, the network system can select a service provider having an automobile provider type.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to embodiments, the network system can determine one or more values (e.g., cost, surcharge, etc.) associated with each of the available items, each of the plurality of entities, and/or the requested service. The one or more values can be dynamically determined based on an estimated amount of supply and/or an estimated amount of demand in the geographic region for each of the available items, each of the plurality of entities, and/or the requested service. For instance, the network system can estimate a likelihood or number of requests for service that may be made at any given time or interval based on a number of active users (e.g., users interacting with user applications) in the given geographic region (or in a sub-region within the given geographic region). The network system can also base the determination on real-time data received from the plurality of entities that indicate, for example, a number of backlogged requests. The network system can also determine the one or more values based on extrapolation, analysis, or machine learning algorithms performed on historical data. For instance, the network system can estimate the likelihood or number of requests for service that may be made based on historical data collected for a specific day and/or time (e.g., amount of requests or interactions with the user applications during a specific time and/or day, such as weekdays between noon and <b>1</b> PM, etc.) or based on occurrence of events (e.g., a sporting event such as a football game).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In various aspects, the dynamically determined one or more values can be associated with each item available for selection by the requesting user. In some examples, the network system can determine a dynamic value associated with the service request, separate and apart from the items selected by the user. Such a dynamically determined value can be associated with expedited or high priority processing, handling, and preparation by the entities and/or service providers, thereby resulting in an accelerated service time. Furthermore, the network system can adjust one or more dynamically determined values in exchange for the user's selection of items ahead of the desired service time (e.g., pre-order) or in exchange for the user's acceptance of an alternate service time (e.g., off-peak service time).</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some examples, the network system can create and maintain user profiles that store information regarding users can be utilized by the network system to provide an improved user experience managing the network service. For instance, a user profile can store the corresponding user's preferences and data (e.g., favorite items, usual order times, preset or favorite service locations, allergies, disliked items, etc.) that can be used in improving the user experience in requesting services using the network service. For instance, using user profile information, the network system can determine suggestions regarding available items (e.g., suggested entities, suggested items, suggested item pairings) to the user. In various aspects, the network system can also create and maintain entity profiles that store information regarding entities (e.g., entity location, historical order data, etc.) that can be used by the network system to manage the network service.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to embodiments, to fulfill a request for a first service (e.g., a delivery service), the network system can leverage a second service (e.g., a transport service, a delivery service). The second service can be a currently-in-progress service or can be a service that is planned or scheduled for a future time. In some examples, the network system can determine that a service provider is in progress of providing the second service to the requesting user. In response, the network system can determine or retrieve a second service duration indicating a duration of time remaining for the second service. The system can also estimate a first service duration related to the first service (e.g., estimated time to fulfill the request for the first service by matching a nearby service provider with the request). The first service duration can be estimated based on respective preparation times associated with one or more items selected by the requesting user for the first service. The network system can select a service mode for the first service based on the first service duration and the second service duration.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">For example, the network system can determine that a second service provider is currently in progress of providing a second service for a user to a service location. In response to this determination, the network system can identify a plurality entities and/or a number of available items offered by the plurality of entities based on information related to the first service (e.g., service location, route, service duration, etc.). Content data corresponding to the plurality of entities and/or the number of available items can be transmitted to a user device operated by the user for viewing and selection. The network system can receive a request for a first service from the user device, the request including data regarding the user's selection of one or more selected items from the available items. The network system can select a first service mode and a second service mode for the first service. In response to selecting the first service mode, the network system can identify a first service provider to fulfill the first service. The network system, can determine, for the first service provider, an optimal route that includes route segments to each of a subset of the plurality of entities and a route segment to the service location. In response to selecting the second service mode, the network system can update a route of the second service such that the updated route includes segments to each of a subset of the plurality of entities and a segment to the service location. The network system can transmit data regarding the updated route and/or additional information (e.g., pickup information) to the second service provider.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In certain implementations, the network system can select between the first service mode and the second service mode based on a comparison of the first service duration and the second service duration. For instance, in response to determining that the first service duration is longer (e.g., by a threshold value) than the second service duration, the network system can select the first service mode. In contrast, in response to determining that the second service duration is longer than the first service duration (e.g., by a threshold value), the network system can select the second service mode. In some examples, the determination to select the first service mode and the second service mode can also be based on evaluation of the updated route for the second service. For instance, if updated route represents a significant additional detour compared to the original route (e.g., in terms of distance, time, etc.) the system can select the first service mode for fulfill the request for the first service.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to embodiments, the requesting user can be prompted for confirmation within a user application to continue with the selection of one or both of the service modes. For example, the dedicated user application for the first service can display a prompt informing the user that the second service mode (e.g., re-routing the second service provider that is scheduled or in-progress of providing the second service) can be selected. The user can select (e.g., by activating a user interface feature within the dedicated user application) to confirm the selection of the second service mode to fulfill the first requested service. The user can also select to reject the selection of the second service mode. If the user rejects the selection of the second service mode, the network system can cancel the selection of the second service mode and continue to fulfill the request for the first service in the first service mode.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In various aspects, the network system can maintain communications with one or more additional systems related to the second service in order to leverage the second service in fulfilling the first service. In some examples, the network system and the one or more additional systems communicate with a single user application executing on the user device. The single user application allows the user to arrange both the first service and the second service. In other examples, the network system communicates with a first user application for requesting the first service and the one or more additional systems communicate with a second user application for requesting the second service. The first user application and the second user application can share data (e.g., locally on the user device or over a network) to facilitate interactions between the first service and the second service (e.g., leveraging the second service in fulfilling a request for the first service, etc.).</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to embodiments, the one or more additional networks can perform one or more steps related to the second service during the process to fulfill the first service by leveraging the second service (e.g., re-routing the second service provider etc.). For instance, the one or more additional systems can determine and update the second service duration (e.g., amount of time remaining for the second service, estimated time of arrival at the service location, etc.). The network system can access real-time data regarding the second service duration by retrieving data from a cache or a database of the one or more additional systems. In addition, the one or more additional systems can update the route for the second service provider and transmit data corresponding to the updated route to a provider device of the second service provider.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Among other benefits, examples described herein improve existing mapping and routing techniques, and technology that connect service providers with requesting users in connection with a network service. Whereas in conventional approaches, requesting users wishing to select items provided by multiple entities must submit separate queries and requests over the network, users interacting with an exemplary network system described herein can submit a single query and request. In response, the network system is configured to select a single service provider to fulfill such a request by utilizing timing information associated with items for selection by requesting users. In this manner, network and computing resources are more efficiently utilized by the network system described herein since resource-intensive processes to identify and select among candidate service providers and routing the selected service provider need only be performed once. The methods described herein have the additional benefit of more efficiently managing service providers and reducing their wait times at entities that provide the items selected by users. In addition, conventional approaches generate routes that are sub-optimal and can result in excessive wait times leading to additional resources (e.g., other service providers) needing to be dispatched by the network system to complete the service request. The network system described herein can avoid such waste of resources and the associated computing resources needed to perform such actions by generating routes for the selected service provider that takes into account timing information, including real-time data, associated with items provided by the entities. As a result, the routes are generated and updated such that the selected service provider arrives at the appropriate times at each entity.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Furthermore, the examples described herein achieve a technical effect of improving user experience in interacting and requesting services through the network service. For example, by associating estimated preparation times with items offered by nearby entities, the network system allows users to select items offered by a plurality of entities for each request for service. In this manner, the user is not restricted or limited to requesting items from a single selected entity for each request for service. In addition, by selecting appropriate service providers and determining optimal routes based at least in part on the preparation times, the network system is able to effectively and efficiently manage resources such as service providers in fulfilling users' requests for service over the geographic region. Some example benefits in this regard include reduced wait times for service providers and increased efficiency.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Additionally, in conventional network services, a requesting user may be scheduled for or in progress of two different services at or around the same time. This may lead to conflicts or undesirable effects. For instance, a first service may require the presence of the requesting user, who may be in progress of a second service. Using conventional network services may result in the first service provider being forced to wait an excessive amount of time for the requesting user to complete the second service. This decreases efficiency and results in waste. Furthermore, the conventional network service cannot leverage existing resources such as in progress or scheduled instances of another service to fulfill requests for service. By leveraging a second in-progress or scheduled service to fulfill the request for service, the network system is able to avoid these shortcomings and improve user experience. For instance, the network system is able to determine an appropriate service mode based on a service duration of the second service. The requesting user can be prompted to confirm to, for example, re-route a second service provider for the second service to fulfill the first service. In doing so, the network system can ensure that the first service is performed in an appropriate manner in view of the service duration of the second service. For example, the network system can optimize the first service such that the first service provider arrives at the service location at an appropriate time in view of the service duration of the second service (e.g., at the same time or shortly after the second service provider arrives at the service location). As another example, the network system can select or suggest a service mode in which the second service provider is re-routed to fulfill the first service in addition to completing the second service. Furthermore, in addition to improving user experience, the network system can also better manage resources such as service providers by, for example, reducing wait times for service providers and increasing efficiency.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As used herein, a computing device refers to devices corresponding to desktop computers, cellular devices or smartphones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), laptop computers, virtual reality (VR) or augmented reality (AR) headsets, tablet devices, television (IP Television), etc., that can provide network connectivity and processing resources for communicating with the system over a network.

For instance, historical value data <b>152</b> can indicate, for a specific day and/or time (e.g., Fridays at 7 P.M.), information relevant to the determination of values <b>111</b> (e.g., number of requests by a specific entity and/or for a specific item and/or, total number of requests received by the network system <b>100</b>, number of active users of the network system <b>100</b>, etc.). Historical value data <b>152</b> can also include historical values (e.g., average or median values on Fridays at 7 P.M.) for each of the available and/or selected items on which the determination of the values <b>111</b> can be based. The value engine <b>110</b> can also perform analysis, such as regression modeling, extrapolation, and/or machine learning algorithms, of the historical value data <b>152</b> to determine the values <b>111</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">According to embodiments, the network system <b>100</b> can include preparation time estimation <b>105</b> to estimate or determine preparation times <b>106</b> associated with items offered by entities. The preparation times <b>106</b> can be determined based on historical data such as historical preparation time <b>151</b> retrieved from database <b>150</b>. The historical preparation time <b>151</b> can include data corresponding to average or median preparation times associated with each item offered by entities measured over a period of time. For instance, the historical preparation time <b>151</b> can indicate that over the past month, the average historical preparation time for a particular item is six minutes. The preparation time estimation <b>105</b> can estimate the preparation time <b>106</b> associated with the particular item based on the historical average of six minutes. In some examples, the preparation time estimation <b>105</b> can determine the preparation time <b>106</b> by performing machine learning techniques (e.g., using an artificial neural network), regression algorithms, Markov analysis, and the like on historical data such as historical preparation time <b>151</b>. According to embodiments, the preparation time estimation <b>105</b> can also estimate preparation time <b>106</b> based on real-time data, including, for example, entity data <b>186</b> received from the entities <b>185</b>. The entity data <b>186</b> can include data corresponding to, for example, pending or received orders at the entity.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">According to embodiments, the network system <b>100</b> can include a provider routing and selection engine <b>120</b> for determining an optimal route for the selected service provider in fulfilling the request for service. In this context, an optimal route can be a route that is optimized based on various parameters and pieces of information available to the network system <b>100</b> including, for example, preparation times <b>106</b> of the one or more selected items, information regarding the request <b>199</b> from the requesting user <b>197</b>, and the like. For instance, the provider routing and selection engine <b>120</b> can optimize the route based on the preparation times of the one or more selected items indicated in the request <b>199</b>. In this manner, the network system <b>100</b> can schedule the times of arrival of the selected service provider at each entity on the route in view of the preparation times of the one or more selected items. For example, based on the preparation times, the provider routing and selection engine <b>120</b> can optimize the route such that the selected service provider arrives at the location of an entity at or around the time that a selected item being prepared by the entity is estimated to be ready for pick-up. In this manner, wait times for both the service provider <b>192</b> and the requesting user <b>197</b> can be minimized. As another example, the provider routing and selection engine <b>120</b> can optimize the route by determining an entity order for the route (e.g., order of entities visited by the selected service provider on the route). This determination can also be based on the preparation times associated with the one or more selected items. For example, in response to a request for service for two selected items&#x2014;a first item offered by a first entity and a second item offered by a second entity&#x2014;the provider routing and selection engine <b>120</b> can determine the route such that the first entity is ordered ahead of the second entity based on based on the preparation times associated with the first and second selected items. In this manner, the wait times for the service provider <b>192</b> and the requesting user <b>197</b> can be further reduced. In addition, the provider routing and selection engine <b>120</b> can dynamically update the route based on real-time data from the entities <b>185</b> regarding status of the one or more selected items (e.g., preparation status, etc.). Accordingly, the route for the selected service provider can be dynamically updated to take into account, for example, any delays at the entities <b>185</b> in preparing the one or more selected items. Furthermore, the provider routing and selection engine <b>120</b> can further optimize the route to minimize the travel distance and/or travel time. For example, the provider routing and selection engine <b>120</b> can take into account traffic information to optimize the route to reduce travel distance and/or travel time. The provider routing and selection engine <b>120</b> can also be configured to dynamically balance the various factors and parameters being optimized (e.g., travel distance, travel time, service provider wait time, requesting user wait time, item idle time (e.g., time after items is prepared and before being picked up by the selected service provider), etc.) in determining the optimal route. For instance, during a time period of service provider shortage, the provider routing and selection engine <b>120</b> can determine the optimal route such that service provider wait time is weighted more heavily in the optimization process.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">To determine the optimal route, the provider routing and selection engine <b>120</b> can receive information (e.g., provider routing and selection data <b>154</b>) from the database <b>150</b>. The provider routing and selection data <b>154</b> can include, for example, data regarding preparation times of the one or more selected items stored in the database <b>150</b>. The provider routing and selection engine <b>120</b> can further receive traffic information (e.g., real-time traffic data, predicted traffic information, etc.) over the network (e.g., from a third party) to determine the optimal route. In addition, the provider routing and selection engine <b>120</b> can receive request information <b>127</b> from the request processing <b>125</b> to determine the optimal route. The request information <b>127</b> can include information regarding the one or more selected items, the identification and/or locations of the entities offering the one or more selected items, and the like.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">According to embodiments, the provider routing and selection engine <b>120</b> is further configured to select a service provider from a plurality of service providers <b>192</b> to fulfill the requested service. The selection can be based on respective locations of the plurality of service providers <b>192</b> with respect to the service location and/or to one or more entities. As such, the provider routing and selection engine can receive provider data <b>193</b> transmitted by the provider devices <b>190</b> that includes, for example, real-time location information generated by the provider devices. The provider routing and selection engine <b>120</b> can select a service provider in close proximity to the service location and/or to one or more entities to, for example, reduce travel time. The provider routing and selection engine <b>120</b> can further select a service provider based on a route <b>121</b> (or a portion thereof) determined by the provider routing and selection engine <b>120</b> for the requested service. For instance, the plurality of service providers <b>192</b> can include service providers of a number of provider classes (e.g., automobile, autonomous vehicle, motorcycle, bicycle, on-foot, etc.) and the selection of a service provider can include a determination of an appropriate provider class based on the optimal route. For example, if the optimal route includes route segments on a freeway, highway, or expressway, the provider routing and selection engine <b>120</b> can determine the appropriate provider class as an automobile provider class. In contrast, if the route <b>121</b> includes route segments within a dense urban zone, the provider routing and selection engine <b>120</b> can determine the appropriate provider class as a bicycle or on-foot provider class. Subsequently, the provider routing and selection engine <b>120</b> can select a service provider from the plurality of service providers <b>192</b> based on the determined provider class. In this manner, the network system <b>100</b> can further optimize the fulfillment of the requested service by selecting an appropriate service provider based on the route <b>121</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In various aspects, the provider routing and selection engine <b>120</b> can determine a route <b>121</b>. The route <b>121</b> can be transmitted to the selected service provider to follow in fulfilling the requested service. The route <b>121</b> can include route segments to each of the locations of the sub-set of entities (e.g., a first route segment from the current location of the selected service provider to a first one of the sub-set of entities, a second route segment from the first one of the sub-set of entities to a second one of the sub-set of entities, etc.) and a route segment to the service location (e.g., a last route segment from a last one of the sub-set of entities to the service location). In response to certain requests, the route <b>121</b> can include two route segments (e.g., a first route segment from the current location of the selected service provider to an entity and a second route segment from the entity to the service location).</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In some implementations, the provider routing and selection engine <b>120</b> can optimize the route <b>121</b> based on preparation times associated with the one or more selected items of the request <b>199</b>. For example, the provider routing and selection engine <b>120</b> can optimize the route <b>121</b> to minimize wait times for the selected service provider as well as the requesting user. For example, based on the preparation times, the provider routing and selection engine <b>120</b> can determine the optimal route such that the selected service provider arrives at the location of an entity at or around the time that a selected item being prepared by the entity is estimated to be ready for pick-up. The provider routing and selection engine <b>120</b> can further optimize the route <b>121</b> by determining an order of entities on the route based on the preparation times of the one or more selected items. The network system can additionally optimize the route to reduce travel distance and/or time. In addition, the network system can receive real-time data from entities to update the optimal route. For example, based on real-time data indicating delays at one particular entity, the provider routing and selection engine <b>120</b> can update the route <b>121</b> to account for the delays (e.g., re-order the order of entities or delaying the route segment to the particular entity experiencing the delays). In this manner, the route <b>121</b> can remain optimal based on up-to-date information.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">According to embodiments, the provider routing and selection engine <b>120</b> can generate service provider information <b>122</b> that may be relevant to the selected service provider's fulfillment of the request service, such as expected wait times at each of the entities, confirmation or authentication codes for use at each of the entities, contact information of the requesting user, any additional information relevant to the service location (e.g., a gate code or an intercom number), etc.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">According to embodiments, the database <b>150</b> of the network system <b>100</b> can store information such as user profiles <b>156</b>, entity profiles <b>157</b>, and menu item profiles <b>158</b>. A user profile <b>156</b> can store information such as a corresponding user's preferences in items offered by entities (e.g., item preference, favorite entities, favorite item genre, preferred item pairings, disliked items, food allergies, etc.). The user profile <b>156</b> can also store the user's most frequently used or favorite service locations (e.g., work, home, etc.). In addition, the user profile <b>156</b> can store information regarding the user's past service requests submitted to the network system <b>100</b> (e.g., items requested, amount spent, etc.). Using information stored in the user profiles <b>156</b>, the network system <b>100</b> can optimize the corresponding users' <b>197</b> experiences.

The query can be transmitted by the user device in response to user interactions with a user application executing on the user device (e.g., opening or launching the user application, selecting or activating a user interface feature, etc.). The query received from the user device can include a service location <b>311</b>-<b>1</b> and/or a desired service time <b>311</b>-<b>2</b>. The service location <b>311</b>-<b>1</b> can correspond to a location associated with a service (e.g., a location at which a requested service is to be fulfilled).

The request can include data regarding the user's selection of one or more selected items from the available items for service to the service location <b>311</b>-<b>1</b>. The request can be generated by the user device in response to the requesting user's interaction with the user application (e.g., using a &#x201c;Submit&#x201d; or &#x201c;Place Order&#x201d; user interface feature).</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In various examples, in response to receiving the request at step <b>315</b>, the network system transmits request information to a sub-set of the plurality of entities (<b>316</b>). The sub-set of the plurality of entities can be entities that offer the one or more selected items. For instance, for a request for service that includes the user's selection of a first item and a second item, the sub-set of the plurality of entities can include a first entity offering the first item and a second entity offering the second item. The network system can transmit relevant request information to each of the sub-set of entities. For example, the first entity can receive request information (e.g., specific items selected, desired preparation completion time, etc.) regarding the first selected item and the second entity can receive request information regarding the second selected item. In some examples, the request information includes a desired preparation completion time. The desired preparation completion time can be a time for the entity to complete preparation of a corresponding item that is estimated by the network system to ensure that the request is fulfilled in a timely manner (e.g., at or around the desired service time <b>311</b>-<b>2</b>).</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">According to embodiments, the network system further determines an optimal route for a service provider in fulfilling the request for service (<b>317</b>). This step may be performed, for example, by service provider routing and selection engine <b>120</b> and <b>220</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, respectively. In particular, the optimal routes can be determined based on preparation times associated with the one or more selected items to, for example, minimize wait times for the selected service provider as well as the requesting user. For example, based on the preparation times, the network system can determine the optimal route such that the selected service provider arrives at the location of an entity at or around the time that a selected item being prepared by the entity is estimated to be ready for pick-up. The network system can further optimize the route by determining an order of entities on the route based on the preparation times of the selected items. The network system can additionally optimize the route to reduce travel distance and/or time. In addition, the network system can receive real-time data from entities to update the optimal route. For example, based on real-time data indicating delays at one particular entity, the network system can update the optimal route to account for the delays (e.g., re-order the order of entities or delaying the route segment to the particular entity experiencing the delays). In this manner, the route for the service provider can remain optimal based on up-to-date information.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In various aspects, the network system can select a service provider from a plurality of service providers to fulfill the request for service (<b>318</b>). For instance, the network system can select a service provider located proximately to an entity and/or the service location. Additionally, the network system can select a service provider based on the optimal route. For instance, the network system can select a bicycle service provider based on the optimal route being within a dense urban environment. In contrast, if the optimal route includes one or more segments over a freeway or highway, the network system can select an automobile service provider.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">According to embodiments, the network system can transmit data corresponding to the optimal route to the selected service provider (<b>319</b>). The data corresponding to the optimal route can include content data, such as map data to enable or cause a provider device of the selected provider to display route guidance or an interactive map that includes the optimal route. In addition, the network system can transmit service provider information (e.g., service provider information <b>122</b> and <b>222</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, respectively) to the provider device. The service provider information <b>122</b> can include information useful to the service provider in fulfilling the requested service such as anticipated wait times at each of the entities visited on the route, authentication codes to authenticate the service provider with each of the entities, contact information of the requesting user, etc.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a flow chart describing another example method of operating an exemplary network system, according to examples described herein. In the below discussion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, reference may be made to features and examples shown and described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>. Furthermore, the process described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> may be performed by an example network system such as the one shown and described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a network system (e.g., network system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> or network system <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) receives a query (e.g., query <b>198</b> and <b>298</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, respectively) in association with a first network service from a user device (e.g., user device <b>195</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> or user device <b>295</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) operated by a requesting user over a network (<b>411</b>).</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In certain implementations, the network system can determine whether a second service provider is scheduled to provide or in progress of providing a second network service to the requesting user to a service location (<b>412</b>). In some examples, the network system can make this determination based on the received query, which can indicate that the second service is in progress (or scheduled to be provided) for the requesting user. For instance, a first user application for the first service on the requesting user device may access data shared by or communicate locally (e.g., within the user device) with a second user application for the second service to receive data indicating that the second service is in progress or scheduled for the requesting user. In response, the first user application can generate the query that includes an indication regarding the second service. In other examples, one user application is used to request and interact with the first service and the second service. In addition to or as an alternative, the network system can communicate with one or more additional systems that manage the second service to determine whether the second service is in progress or scheduled for the requesting user. The network system can maintain communications with the one or more additional systems to leverage the second service in fulfilling the requested first service. In other implementations, a single network system can manage both the first and the second services.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">According to embodiments, the network system can make a number of additional determinations based on the received query and/or information related to the second service (if in progress or if scheduled). For example, the received query can include information regarding a service location. The service location can be related to the second service or may be selected or entered by the requesting user for the first service. Alternatively, the network system can communicate with the one or more additional systems to determine the service location of the second service. Based on the service location, the network system can identify a plurality of nearby entities and/or available items offered by the plurality of entities. Furthermore, the network system can dynamically determine a value for each of the available items based on a number of parameters. The network system can transmit data (e.g., content data) to the user device of the requesting user that corresponds to the available items, the plurality of entities, and/or the determined values for the available items. Based on the received data, the user device can display one or more menus or lists of available items for viewing and selection by the requesting user. The user device can transmit a request that includes the requesting user's selection of one or more selected items from the available items to the network system.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">According to embodiments, the network system can select a first service mode for the first service in response to determining that no second service is scheduled or is in progress (<b>414</b>). In the examples described herein, the network system can select a first service mode or a second service mode. In the first service mode, the network system determines a route, selects a first service provider from a plurality of service providers, and transmits the route and other information to the first service provider to enable the first service provider to fulfill the requested first service. In the second service mode, the network system can leverage the scheduled or in-progress second service to fulfill the requested first service. In the second service mode, the network system (or a second system for managing the second service) can update a route of the second service provider. The updated route includes segments to one or more entities and a segment to the service location. The network system (or the second system) can transmit the updated route and other information to the second service provider to fulfill the requested first service.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In certain implementations, the network system can estimate a first service duration based on respective preparation times associated with the one or more selected items (<b>415</b>). The first service duration can indicate an estimated amount of time to fulfill the first service in the first service mode. Thus, the first service duration can include the preparation times of the one or more selected items indicated in the request for the first service, travel times of the first service provider, etc. The first service duration can be further estimated based on current or predicted traffic conditions.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The network system can compare the first service duration with the second service duration (<b>416</b>). If the first service duration is longer than the first service duration (e.g., a selected first service provider is estimated to arrive at the service location after the second service provider and/or the requesting user), the network system can select the first service mode (<b>418</b>). In contrast, if the first service duration is shorter than the second service duration (e.g., a selected first service provider is estimated to arrive at the service location before the second service provider and/or the requesting user), the network system can transmit data corresponding to a prompt for a user confirmation to the user device of the requesting user (<b>417</b>). The user confirmation can be a confirmation regarding the selection of the second service mode (e.g., re-routing of the second service provider, etc.). If a confirmation is received, the network system can select the second service mode (<b>419</b>). If a confirmation is not received, the network system can default to the first service mode (<b>420</b>).</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In various aspects, if the network system selects the first service mode at step <b>420</b>, the network system can optimize the route and/or information for the selected first service provider to delay the first service provider's arrival at the service location (e.g., to approximately the same time or after the arrival of the second service provider and/or the requesting user at the service location).</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">User Device</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating an example user device executing and operating a designated user application for communicating with a network service, according to examples described herein.
