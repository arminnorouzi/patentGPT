Therefore, in order to meet personal working comfort and ergonomic design, the application of adjustable table height is becoming more and more popular. In the application of lifting tables, manual, pneumatic, or electric methods are usually used to adjust the height of the table body of the lifting table. In particular, since the control manner of adjusting the height of the table body in an electric manner is more precise and the adjustment effect is better, the application range of the electric lifting table is wider.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, when the load of the traditional electric lifting table increases, if the maximum output power of the converter is exceeded, the output power of the converter will always decrease, resulting in poor load capacity. Also, when the load is heavy (i.e., the lifting table operates in a heavy load condition), the electric lifting table cannot rise. Therefore, the solution of the prior art is usually to replace a converter with a larger output power to increase the output power of the converter, thereby being able to drive a heavier load. However, this solution will increase the cost of the electric lift table, and the circuit is bulky.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to solve the above-mentioned problems, the present disclosure provides a control circuit applied to a lifting platform controls a motor to adjust the height of a platform.

The conversion circuit includes an AC/DC conversion circuit and a DC/DC conversion circuit. The AC/DC conversion circuit converts the input voltage into a DC voltage. The DC/DC conversion circuit converts the DC voltage into the output voltage. The detection unit detects an output end of the AC/DC conversion circuit and provides a detection signal. The control unit provides a PWM signal according to the detection signal to control the DC/DC conversion circuit so that the DC/DC conversion circuit converts the DC voltage into the output voltage. The control unit sets a power supply threshold. When the control unit realizes that the DC voltage or a DC power provided by the AC/DC conversion circuit is less than the power supply threshold according to the detection signal, the control unit decreases a duty cycle of the PWM signal to decrease a rotation speed of the motor, and maintains the DC voltage or the DC power is greater than or equal to the power supply threshold.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to solve the above-mentioned problems, the present disclosure provides a method of controlling a lifting platform. The method includes steps of: setting a power supply threshold, and controlling a DC/DC conversion circuit to convert a DC voltage provided by an AC/DC conversion circuit into an output voltage to control a motor; detecting an output end of the AC/DC conversion circuit to provide a detection signal, and adjusting a PWM signal of controlling the DC/DC conversion circuit according to the detection signal; decreasing a duty cycle of the PWM signal to decrease a rotation speed of the motor when the DC voltage or a DC power provided by the AC/DC conversion circuit is less than the power supply threshold according to the detection signal, and maintaining the DC voltage or the DC power to be greater than or equal to the power supply threshold.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The main purpose and effect of the present disclosure is to use the control unit to detect the maximum output power of the AC/DC conversion circuit to maintain the load capacity of the conversion circuit, and to solve the poor load capacity and the platform cannot be raised of the prior art.

Specifically, the control unit <b>30</b> sets power supply threshold of the output end of the AC/DC conversion circuit <b>102</b>. When the control unit <b>30</b> realizes that the DC voltage Vdc or the DC power Pdc is less than the power supply threshold according to the detection signal Ss, the control unit <b>30</b> decreases the duty cycle of the PWM signal PWM to decrease the rotation speed of the motor <b>100</b>, and maintains the DC voltage Vdc or the DC power Pdc to be greater than or equal to the power supply threshold. When the control unit <b>30</b> realizes that the DC voltage Vdc or the DC power Pdc is greater than or equal to the power supply threshold according to the detection signal Ss, the control unit <b>30</b> increases the duty cycle of the PWM signal PWM to increase the rotation speed of the motor <b>100</b>, thereby increasing the adjustment speed of lifting the platform <b>200</b>A.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0021">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> again, the control unit <b>30</b> provides two control and setting manners. One of the manners is that the control unit <b>30</b> sets the power supply threshold according to the power load curve shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Specifically, the power load curve is a DC power Pdc curve formed by the product of the DC voltage Vdc and the DC current Idc. The control unit <b>30</b> previously sets the voltage value of the DC voltage Vdc corresponding to the DC power Pdc at the maximum output power point as the power supply threshold (the power supply threshold is the voltage threshold).

Since the output current Io is decreased, the DC voltage Vdc will no longer continuously decrease so as to maintain the DC power Pdc of the AC/DC conversion circuit <b>102</b> at the maximum output power. At this condition, although the speed of lifting the platform <b>200</b>A slows down, the phenomenon that the platform <b>200</b>A cannot be risen like the conventional technology does not occur.

At this condition, although the speed of lifting the platform <b>200</b>A slows down, the phenomenon that the platform <b>200</b>A cannot be risen like the conventional technology does not occur. Therefore, compared with the prior art, the lifting table of the present disclosure can increase the lifting speed of the platform <b>200</b>A under the heavy load condition.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0025">Furthermore, the relationship between the output voltage Vo and the PWM signal PWM may be, for example but not limited to, as shown in Table 2 below. As shown in Table 1 and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, when the output current Io is increased to large enough, The DC voltage Vdc is inevitably to drop. The control unit <b>30</b> controls the PWM signal PWM to decrease according to the decrease of the DC voltage Vdc so that the output voltage Vo decreases accordingly and the rotation speed of the motor <b>100</b> is decreased. As the rotation speed of the motor <b>100</b> decreases, the output current Io also decreases, thereby causing the DC voltage Vdc to increase. With this circuit characteristic and the setting of the power supply threshold, the load capacity of the conversion circuit <b>10</b> can be maintained, and the situation that the platform <b>200</b>A cannot rise when the load of the platform <b>200</b>A is under the heavy load condition can be solved. The main control method is to maintain the DC voltage Vdc outputted by the AC/DC conversion circuit <b>102</b> above a specific voltage, and the output voltage Vo changes within a specific interval as the PWM signal PWM is adjusted (for example but not limited to 0 to 33 volts).</p><p id="p-0028" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00002" num="00002"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 2</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>(the output voltage and the PWM signal)</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="28pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="70pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="119pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>PWM signal PWM</entry><entry>output voltage Vo</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>100%&#x2002;</entry><entry>32 V</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>70%</entry><entry>&#x2009;32 V* 0.7</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>30%</entry><entry>32 V * 0.3</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>10%</entry><entry>32 V * 0.1</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0029" num="0026">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> again, when the power supply threshold is the power threshold, two manners of operating maximum output parameter may be implemented, mainly for the user to operate the control circuit <b>1</b>, the control circuit <b>1</b> can directly lift the lifting platform <b>200</b> with the maximum power, and then the PWM signal PWM is adjusted according to the detection unit <b>20</b> to detect the actual operation condition of the conversion circuit <b>10</b> so as to save the time of lifting the platform <b>200</b>A.
