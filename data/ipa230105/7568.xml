The quantity of downlink subcarriers or RBs (in this example 6 to 100 RBs) may depend, at least in part, on the downlink transmission bandwidth <b>306</b> configured in the cell. The smallest radio resource unit may be called a resource element (e.g. <b>301</b>). Resource elements may be grouped into resource blocks (e.g. <b>302</b>).

The base station(s) may be interconnected with other base station(s) (e.g. employing an X2 interface). The base stations may also be connected employing, for example, an S1 interface to an EPC. For example, the base stations may be interconnected to the MME employing the S1-MME interface and to the S-G) employing the S1-U interface. The S1 interface may support a many-to-many relation between MMEs/Serving Gateways and base stations. A base station may include many sectors for example: 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 sectors. A base station may include many cells, for example, ranging from 1 to 50 cells or more. A cell may be categorized, for example, as a primary cell or secondary cell. At RRC connection establishment/re-establishment/handover , one serving cell may provide the NAS (non-access stratum) mobility information (e.g. TAI), and at RRC connection re-establishment/handover, one serving cell may provide the security input. This cell may be referred to as the Primary Cell (PCell). In the downlink, the carrier corresponding to the PCell may be the Downlink Primary Component Carrier (DL PCC), while in the uplink, it may be the Uplink Primary Component Carrier (UL PCC). Depending on wireless device capabilities, Secondary Cells (SCells) may be configured to form together with the PCell a set of serving cells. In the downlink, the carrier corresponding to an SCell may be a Downlink Secondary Component Carrier (DL SCC), while in the uplink, it may be an Uplink Secondary Component Carrier (UL SCC). An SCell may or may not have an uplink carrier.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0048">A cell, comprising a downlink carrier and optionally an uplink carrier, may be assigned a physical cell ID and a cell index. A carrier (downlink or uplink) may belong to only one cell. The cell ID or Cell index may also identify the downlink carrier or uplink carrier of the cell (depending on the context it is used). In the specification, cell ID may be equally referred to a carrier ID, and cell index may be referred to carrier index. In implementation, the physical cell ID or cell index may be assigned to a cell. A cell ID may be determined using a synchronization signal transmitted on a downlink carrier. A cell index may be determined using RRC messages. For example, when the specification refers to a first physical cell ID for a first downlink carrier, the specification may mean the first physical cell ID is for a cell comprising the first downlink carrier. The same concept may apply to, for example, carrier activation. When the specification indicates that a first carrier is activated, the specification may equally mean that the cell comprising the first carrier is activated.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0049">Embodiments may be configured to operate as needed.

For a SCG, one or more of the following may be applied: at least one cell in the SCG has a configured UL CC and one of them, named PSCell (or PCell of SCG, or sometimes called PCell), is configured with PUCCH resources; when the SCG is configured, there may be at least one SCG bearer or one Split bearer; upon detection of a physical layer problem or a random access problem on a PSCell, or the maximum number of RLC retransmissions has been reached associated with the SCG, or upon detection of an access problem on a PSCell during a SCG addition or a SCG change: a RRC connection re-establishment procedure may not be triggered, UL transmissions towards cells of the SCG are stopped, a MeNB may be informed by the UE of a SCG failure type, for split bearer, the DL data transfer over the MeNB is maintained; the RLC AM bearer may be configured for the split bearer; like PCell, PSCell may not be de-activated; PSCell may be changed with a SCG change (e.g. with security key change and a RACH procedure); and/or neither a direct bearer type change between a Split bearer and a SCG bearer nor simultaneous configuration of a SCG and a Split bearer are supported.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0054">With respect to the interaction between a MeNB and a SeNB, one or more of the following principles may be applied: the MeNB may maintain the RRM measurement configuration of the UE and may, (e.g, based on received measurement reports or traffic conditions or bearer types), decide to ask a SeNB to provide additional resources (serving cells) for a UE; upon receiving a request from the MeNB, a SeNB may create a container that may result in the configuration of additional serving cells for the UE (or decide that it has no resource available to do so); for UE capability coordination, the MeNB may provide (part of) the AS configuration and the UE capabilities to the SeNB; the MeNB and the SeNB may exchange information about a UE configuration by employing of RRC containers (inter-node messages) carried in X2 messages; the SeNB may initiate a reconfiguration of its existing serving cells (e.g., PUCCH towards the SeNB); the SeNB may decide which cell is the PSCell within the SCG; the MeNB may not change the content of the RRC configuration provided by the SeNB; in the case of a SCG addition and a SCG SCell addition, the MeNB may provide the latest measurement results for the SCG cell(s); both a MeNB and a SeNB may know the SFN and subframe offset of each other by OAM, (e.g., for the purpose of DRX alignment and identification of a measurement gap). In an example, when adding a new SCG SCell, dedicated RRC signalling may be used for sending required system information of the cell as for CA, except for the SFN acquired from a MIB of the PSCell of a SCG.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0055">According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, serving cells having an uplink to which the same time alignment (TA) applies may be grouped in a TA group (TAG). Serving cells in one TAG may use the same timing reference. For a given TAG, user equipment (UE) may use one downlink carrier as a timing reference at a given time. The UE may use a downlink carrier in a TAG as a timing reference for that TAG. For a given TAG, a UE may synchronize uplink subframe and frame transmission timing of uplink carriers belonging to the same TAG. According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, serving cells having an uplink to which the same TA applies may correspond to serving cells hosted by the same receiver. A TA group may comprise at least one serving cell with a configured uplink. A UE supporting multiple TAs may support two or more TA groups. One TA group may contain the PCell and may be called a primary TAG (pTAG). In a multiple TAG configuration, at least one TA group may not contain the PCell and may be called a secondary TAG (sTAG). Carriers within the same TA group may use the same TA value and the same timing reference. When DC is configured, cells belonging to a cell group (MCG or SCG) may be grouped into multiple TAGs including a pTAG and one or more sTAGs.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows example TAG configurations as per an aspect of an embodiment of the present invention. In Example 1, pTAG comprises PCell, and an sTAG comprises SCell<b>1</b>. In Example 2, a pTAG comprises a PCell and SCell<b>1</b>, and an sTAG comprises SCell<b>2</b> and SCell<b>3</b>. In Example 3, pTAG comprises PCell and SCell<b>1</b>, and an sTAG<b>1</b> includes SCell<b>2</b> and SCell<b>3</b>, and sTAG<b>2</b> comprises SCell<b>4</b>. Up to four TAGs may be supported in a cell group (MCG or SCG) and other example TAG configurations may also be provided. In various examples in this disclosure, example mechanisms are described for a pTAG and an sTAG. The operation with one example sTAG is described, and the same operation may be applicable to other sTAGs. The example mechanisms may be applied to configurations with multiple sTAGs.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0057">According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, TA maintenance, pathloss reference handling and a timing reference for a pTAG may follow LTE release 10 principles in the MCG and/or SCG. The UE may need to measure downlink pathloss to calculate uplink transmit power. A pathloss reference may be used for uplink power control and/or transmission of random access preamble(s). UE may measure downlink pathloss using signals received on a pathloss reference cell. For SCell(s) in a pTAG, the choice of a pathloss reference for cells may be selected from and/or be limited to the following two options: a) the downlink SCell linked to an uplink SCell using system information block 2 (SIB2), and b) the downlink pCell. The pathloss reference for SCells in a pTAG may be configurable using RRC message(s) as a part of an SCell initial configuration and/or reconfiguration. According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, a PhysicalConfigDedicatedSCell information element (IE) of an SCell configuration may include a pathloss reference SCell (downlink carrier) for an SCell in a pTAG. The downlink SCell linked to an uplink SCell using system information block 2 (SIB2) may be referred to as the SIB2 linked downlink of the SCell. Different TAGs may operate in different bands. For an uplink carrier in an sTAG, the pathloss reference may be only configurable to the downlink SCell linked to an uplink SCell using the system information block 2 (SIB2) of the SCell.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0058">To obtain initial uplink (UL) time alignment for an sTAG, an eNB may initiate an RA procedure. In an sTAG, a UE may use one of any activated SCells from this sTAG as a timing reference cell. In an example embodiment, the timing reference for SCells in an sTAG may be the SIB2 linked downlink of the SCell on which the preamble for the latest RA procedure was sent. There may be one timing reference and one time alignment timer (TAT) per TA group. A TAT for TAGs may be configured with different values. In a MAC entity, when a TAT associated with a pTAG expires: all TATs may be considered as expired, the UE may flush HARQ buffers of serving cells, the UE may clear any configured downlink assignment/uplink grants, and the RRC in the UE may release PUCCH/SRS for all configured serving cells. When the pTAG TAT is not running, an sTAG TAT may not be running. When the TAT associated with an sTAG expires: a) SRS transmissions may be stopped on the corresponding SCells, b) SRS RRC configuration may be released, c) CSI reporting configuration for corresponding SCells may be maintained, and/or d) the MAC in the UE may flush the uplink HARQ buffers of the corresponding SCells.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0059">An eNB may initiate an RA procedure via a PDCCH order for an activated SCell. This PDCCH order may be sent on a scheduling cell of this SCell. When cross carrier scheduling is configured for a cell, the scheduling cell may be different than the cell that is employed for preamble transmission, and the PDCCH order may include an SCell index. At least a non-contention based RA procedure may be supported for SCell(s) assigned to sTAG(s).</p><p id="p-0062" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is an example message flow in a random access process in a secondary TAG as per an aspect of an embodiment of the present invention. An eNB transmits an activation command <b>600</b> to activate an SCell. A preamble <b>602</b> (Msg<b>1</b>) may be sent by a UE in response to a PDCCH order <b>601</b> on an SCell belonging to an sTAG. In an example embodiment, preamble transmission for SCells may be controlled by the network using PDCCH format 1A. Msg<b>2</b> message <b>603</b> (RAR: random access response) in response to the preamble transmission on the SCell may be addressed to RA-RNTI in a PCell common search space (CSS). Uplink packets <b>604</b> may be transmitted on the SCell in which the preamble was transmitted.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0061">According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, initial timing alignment may be achieved through a random access procedure. This may involve a UE transmitting a random access preamble and an eNB responding with an initial TA command NTA (amount of timing advance) within a random access response window. The start of the random access preamble may be aligned with the start of a corresponding uplink subframe at the UE assuming NTA=0. The eNB may estimate the uplink timing from the random access preamble transmitted by the UE. The TA command may be derived by the eNB based on the estimation of the difference between the desired UL timing and the actual UL timing. The UE may determine the initial uplink transmission timing relative to the corresponding downlink of the sTAG on which the preamble is transmitted.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0062">The mapping of a serving cell to a TAG may be configured by a serving eNB with RRC signaling. The mechanism for TAG configuration and reconfiguration may be based on RRC signaling. According to some of the various aspects of embodiments, when an eNB performs an SCell addition configuration, the related TAG configuration may be configured for the SCell. In an example embodiment, an eNB may modify the TAG configuration of an SCell by removing (releasing) the SCell and adding(configuring) a new SCell (with the same physical cell ID and frequency) with an updated TAG ID. The new SCell with the updated TAG ID may initially be inactive subsequent to being assigned the updated TAG ID. The eNB may activate the updated new SCell and start scheduling packets on the activated SCell. In an example implementation, it may not be possible to change the TAG associated with an SCell, but rather, the SCell may need to be removed and a new SCell may need to be added with another TAG. For example, if there is a need to move an SCell from an sTAG to a pTAG, at least one RRC message, for example, at least one RRC reconfiguration message, may be send to the UE to reconfigure TAG configurations by releasing the SCell and then configuring the SCell as a part of the pTAG (when an SCell is added/configured without a TAG index, the SCell may be explicitly assigned to the pTAG). The PCell may not change its TA group and may always be a member of the pTAG.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0063">The purpose of an RRC connection reconfiguration procedure may be to modify an RRC connection, (e.g. to establish, modify and/or release RBs, to perform handover, to setup, modify, and/or release measurements, to add, modify, and/or release SCells). If the received RRC Connection Reconfiguration message includes the sCellToReleaseList, the UE may perform an SCell release. If the received RRC Connection Reconfiguration message includes the sCellToAddModList, the UE may perform SCell additions or modification.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0064">In LTE Release-10 and Release-11 CA, a PUCCH is only transmitted on the PCell (PSCell) to an eNB. In LTE-Release 12 and earlier, a UE may transmit PUCCH information on one cell (PCell or PSCell) to a given eNB.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0065">As the number of CA capable UEs and also the number of aggregated carriers increase, the number of PUCCHs and also the PUCCH payload size may increase. Accommodating the PUCCH transmissions on the PCell may lead to a high PUCCH load on the PCell. A PUCCH on an SCell may be introduced to offload the PUCCH resource from the PCell. More than one PUCCH may be configured for example, a PUCCH on a PCell and another PUCCH on an SCell. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is an example grouping of cells into PUCCH groups as per an aspect of an embodiment of the present invention. In the example embodiments, one, two or more cells may be configured with PUCCH resources for transmitting CSI/ACK/NACK to a base station. Cells may be grouped into multiple PUCCH groups, and one or more cell within a group may be configured with a PUCCH. In an example configuration, one SCell may belong to one PUCCH group. SCells with a configured PUCCH transmitted to a base station may be called a PUCCH SCell, and a cell group with a common PUCCH resource transmitted to the same base station may be called a PUCCH group.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0066">In Release-12, a PUCCH can be configured on a PCell and/or a PSCell, but cannot be configured on other SCells. In an example embodiment, a UE may transmit a message indicating that the UE supports PUCCH configuration on a PCell and SCell. Such an indication may be separate from an indication of of dual connectivity support by the UE. In an example embodiment, a UE may support both DC and PUCCH groups. In an example embodiment, either DC or PUCCH groups may be configured, but not both. In another example embodiment, more complicated configurations comprising both DC and PUCCH groups may be supported.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0067">When a UE is capable of configuring PUCCH groups, and if a UE indicates that it supports simultaneous PUCCH/PUSCH transmission capability, it may imply that the UE supports simultaneous PUCCH/PUSCH transmission on both PCell and SCell. When multiple PUCCH groups are configured, a PUCCH may be configured or not configured with simultaneous PUCCH/PUSCH transmission.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0068">In an example embodiment, PUCCH transmission to a base station on two serving cells may be realized as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>. A first group of cells may employ a PUCCH on the PCell and may be called PUCCH group <b>1</b> or a primary PUCCH group. A second group of cells may employ a PUCCH on an SCell and may be called PUCCH group <b>2</b> or a secondary PUCCH group. One, two or more PUCCH groups may be configured. In an example, cells may be grouped into two PUCCH groups, and each PUCCH group may include a cell with PUCCH resources. A PCell may provide PUCCH resources for the primary PUCCH group and an SCell in the secondary PUCCH group may provide PUCCH resources for the cells in the secondary PUCCH group. In an example embodiment, no cross-carrier scheduling between cells in different PUCCH groups may be configured. When cross-carrier scheduling between cells in different PUCCH groups is not configured, ACK/NACK on PHICH channel may be limited within a PUCCH group. Both downlink and uplink scheduling activity may be separate between cells belonging to different PUCCH groups.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0069">A PUCCH on an SCell may carry HARQ-ACK and CSI information. A PCell may be configured with PUCCH resources. In an example embodiment, RRC parameters for an SCell PUCCH Power Control for a PUCCH on an SCell may be different from those of a PCell PUCCH. A Transmit Power Control command for a PUCCH on an SCell may be transmitted in DCI(s) on the SCell carrying the PUCCH.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0070">UE procedures on a PUCCH transmission may be different and/or independent between PUCCH groups. For example, determination of DL HARQ-ACK timing, PUCCH resource determination for HARQ-ACK and/or CSI, Higher-layer configuration of simultaneous HARQ-ACK+CSI on a PUCCH, Higher-layer configuration of simultaneous HARQ-ACK+SRS in one subframe may be configured differently for a PUCCH PCell and a PUCCH SCell.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0071">A PUCCH group may be a group of serving cells configured by a RRC and use the same serving cell in the group for transmission of a PUCCH. A Primary PUCCH group may be a PUCCH group containing a PCell. A secondary PUCCH group may be a PUCCH cell group not containing the PCell. In an example embodiment, an SCell may belong to one PUCCH group. When one SCell belongs to a PUCCH group, ACK/NACK or CSI for that SCell may be transmitted over the PUCCH in that PUCCH group (over PUCCH SCell or PUCCH PCell). A PUCCH on an SCell may reduce the PUCCH load on the PCell. A PUCCH SCell may be employed for UCI transmission of SCells in the corresponding PUCCH group.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0072">In an example embodiment, a flexible PUCCH configuration in which control signalling is sent on one, two or more PUCCHs may be possible. Beside the PCell, it may be possible to configure a selected number of SCells for PUCCH transmission (herein called PUCCH SCells). Control signalling information conveyed in a certain PUCCH SCell may be related to a set of SCells in a corresponding PUCCH group that are configured by the network via RRC signalling.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0073">PUCCH control signalling carried by a PUCCH channel may be distributed between a PCell and SCells for off-loading or robustness purposes. By enabling a PUCCH in an SCell, it may be possible to distribute the overall CSI reports for a given UE between a PCell and a selected number of SCells (e.g. PUCCH SCells), thereby limiting PUCCH CSI resource consumption by a given UE on a certain cell. It may be possible to map CSI reports for a certain SCell to a selected PUCCH SCell. An SCell may be assigned a certain periodicity and time-offset for transmission of control information. Periodic CSI for a serving cell may be mapped on a PUCCH (on the PCell or on a PUCCH-SCell) via RRC signalling. The possibility of distributing CSI reports, HARQ feedbacks, and/or Scheduling Requests across PUCCH SCells may provide flexibility and capacity improvements. HARQ feedback for a serving cell may be mapped on a PUCCH (on the PCell or on a PUCCH SCell) via RRC signalling.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0074">In example embodiments, PUCCH transmission may be configured on a PCell, as well as one SCell in CA. An SCell PUCCH may be realized using the concept of PUCCH groups, where aggregated cells are grouped into two or more PUCCH groups. One cell from a PUCCH group may be configured to carry a PUCCH. More than 5 carriers may be configured. In the example embodiments, up to n carriers may be aggregated. For example, n may be 16, 32, or 64. Some CCs may have non-backward compatible configurations supporting only advanced UEs (e.g. support licensed assisted access SCells). In an example embodiment, one SCell PUCCH (e.g. two PUCCH groups) may be supported. In another example embodiment, a PUCCH group concept with multiple (more than one) SCells carrying PUCCH may be employed(e.g., there can be more than two PUCCH groups).</p><p id="p-0077" num="0075">In an example embodiment, a given PUCCH group may not comprise serving cells of both MCG and SCG. One of the PUCCHs may be configured on the PCell. In an example embodiment, PUCCH mapping of serving cells may be configured by RRC messages. In an example embodiment, a maximum value of an SCellIndex and a ServCellIndex may be 31 (ranging from 0 to 31). In an example, a maximum value of stag-Id may be 3. The CIF for a scheduled cell may be configured explicitly. A PUCCH SCell may be configured by giving a PUCCH configuration for an SCell. A HARQ feedback and CSI report of a PUCCH SCell may be sent on the PUCCH of that PUCCH SCell. The HARQ feedback and CSI report of a SCell may sent on a PUCCH of a PCell if no PUCCH SCell is signalled for that SCell. The HARQ feedback and CSI report of an SCell may be sent on the PUCCH of one PUCCH SCell; hence they may not be sent on the PUCCH of different PUCCH SCell. The UE may report a Type 2 PH for serving cells configured with a PUCCH. In an example embodiment, a MAC activation/deactivation may be supported for a PUCCH SCell. An eNB may manage the activation/deactivation status for SCells. A newly added PUCCH SCell may be initially deactivated.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0076">In an example embodiment, independent configuration of PUCCH groups and TAGs may be supported. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> show example configurations of TAGs and PUCCH groups. For example, one TAG may contain multiple serving cells with a PUCCH. For example, each TAG may only comprise cells of one PUCCH group. For example, a TAG may comprise the serving cells (without a PUCCH) which belong to different PUCCH groups.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0077">There may not be a one-to-one mapping between TAGs and PUCCH groups. For example, in a configuration, a PUCCH SCell may belong to primary TAG. In an example implementation, the serving cells of one PUCCH group may be in different TAGs and serving cells of one TAG may be in different PUCCH groups. Configuration of PUCCH groups and TAGs may be left to eNB implementation. In another example implementation, restriction(s) on the configuration of a PUCCH cell may be specified. For example, in an example embodiment, cells in a given PUCCH group may belong to the same TAG. In an example, an sTAG may only comprise cells of one PUCCH group. In an example, one-to-one mapping between TAGs and PUCCH groups may be implemented. In implementation, cell configurations may be limited to some of the examples. In other implementations, some or all the below configurations may be allowed.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0078">In an example embodiment, for an SCell in a pTAG, the timing reference may be a PCell. For an SCell in an sTAG, the timing reference may be any activated SCell in the sTAG. For an SCell (configured with PUCCH or not) in a pTAG, a pathloss reference may be configured to be a PCell or an SIB-2 linked SCell. For an SCell in a sTAG, the pathloss reference may be the SIB-2 linked SCell. When a TAT associated with a pTAG is expired, the TAT associated with sTAGs may be considered as expired. When a TAT of an sTAG containing PUCCH SCell expires, the MAC may indicate to an RRC to release PUCCH resource for the PUCCH group. When the TAT of an sTAG containing a PUCCH SCell is not running, the uplink transmission (PUSCH) for SCells in the secondary PUCCH group not belonging to the sTAG including the PUCCH SCell may not be impacted. The TAT expiry of an sTAG containing a PUCCH SCell may not trigger TAT expiry of other TAGs to which other SCells in the same PUCCH group belong. When the TAT associated with sTAG not containing a PUCCH SCell is not running, the wireless device may stop the uplink transmission for the SCell in the sTAG and may not impact other TAGs.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0079">In an example embodiment, a MAC entity may have a configurable timer timeAlignmentTimer per TAG. The timeAlignmentTimer may be used to control how long the MAC entity considers the Serving Cells belonging to the associated TAG to be uplink time aligned. The MAC entity may, when a Timing Advance Command MAC control element is received, apply the Timing Advance Command for the indicated TAG; start or restart the timeAlignmentTimer associated with the indicated TAG. The MAC entity may, when a Timing Advance Command is received in a Random Access Response message for a serving cell belonging to a TAG and/or if the Random Access Preamble was not selected by the MAC entity, apply the Timing Advance Command for this TAG and start or restart the timeAlignmentTimer associated with this TAG. Otherwise, if the timeAlignmentTimer associated with this TAG is not running, the Timing Advance Command for this TAG may be applied and the timeAlignmentTimer associated with this TAG started.

In addition to that, one or two additional LCID fields may be included in the MAC PDU when single-byte or two-byte padding is required but cannot be achieved by padding at the end of the MAC PDU. The LCID field size may be, e.g. 5 bits. L or the Length field may indicate the length of the corresponding MAC SDU or variable-sized MAC control element in bytes.

In Release-10 CA, the Primary Cell (PCell) is always activated. One or more Secondary Cells (SCells) can be in activated or deactivated state. The SCell activation/deactivation processes were introduced in Release-10 to achieve battery power savings. When an SCell is deactivated, the UE may stop receiving downlink signals and stop transmission on the SCell. In Release-10 CA, the default state of an SCell is deactivated when the SCell has been configured/added. Additional activation procedure employing MAC CE Activation Command may be needed to activate the SCell. SCells may be deactivated either by an activation/deactivation MAC CE or by the sCellDeactivationTimer. The UE and eNB maintain one sCellDeactivationTimer per SCell with a common value across SCells. eNB maintains the activation/deactivation status of an SCell for a wireless device.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0095">In LTE-Advanced Release-12, Dual Connectivity (DC) was introduced. In DC, UE maintains connectivity to a Master eNB (MeNB) and a Secondary eNB (SeNB). Serving cells may be grouped into cell groups (CGs) such as a master CG (MCG) and a secondary CG (SCG). The primary cell in MeNB is called PCell. A cell in SeNB is called PSCell. A PSCell may support similar functions supported by a PCell, such as PUCCH, RACH, RLM, etc. If PSCell is deactivated, many processes may be impacted in SCG, e.g. RACH and PUCCH delivery. Therefore, in Release-12 DC, PSCell in SCG and PCell in MCG are kept in the activated state. In DC, the activation/deactivation processes may be performed per CG and per eNB. Activation/deactivation related information may not be exchanged between MeNB and SeNB. With DC, the cells with PUCCH (e.g. PCell and PSCell) are always in an activated state after they are configured. This process may prevent the need for cross-eNB activation/deactivation.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0096">Cells of an eNB may be grouped in multiple PUCCH groups, each having its own PUCCH resources on a PUCCH SCell. An eNB configures PUCCH groups for a wireless device by transmitting RRC message(s) to the wireless device. Implementation of activation/deactivation processes for PUCCH SCell may present some issues, if Release-10 or 12 activation/deactivation processes are implemented. For example, it may be needed to implement methods and systems to handle PUCCH transmissions when PUCCH SCell is deactivated and one or more SCells in the corresponding PUCCH group are still active. Novel PUCCH SCell activation/deactivation procedures may be implemented when PUCCH SCell is configured. In addition, novel PUCCH SCell activation/deactivation procedures may be implemented to handle scenarios wherein PUCCH is deactivated.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0097">PUCCH SCell may include many of the functionalities of the PSCell. Some of the issues related to deactivation of PUCCH SCell may be resolved if PUCCH SCell is always kept active, like, PCell or PSCell in prior releases of LTE-Advanced. Such a solution may increase battery power consumption in the UE since the UE has to always keep PUCCH SCell activated after PUCCH SCell is configured.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0098">Implementation of the same activation and deactivation processes for PUCCH SCell and PSCell in DC may result in an inefficient implementation. To achieve battery power saving benefits similar to the existing CA technology, it may be beneficial to enable deactivation of the PUCCH SCell. PUCCH SCell delivers uplink control information for the serving cells in the corresponding PUCCH cell group using its configured PUCCH resources. When there is no need for PUCCH UCI delivery, e.g. when other serving cells in the same PUCCH cell group are deactivated, the PUCCH SCell may be deactivated. Support for activation/deactivation of PUCCH SCell may provide battery power saving benefits. There may be no need to keep PUCCH SCell activated all the time, for example when there is no data transmission on cells in the corresponding PUCCH group. A PUCCH SCell deactivation procedure may introduce new implications for SCells that are in the corresponding PUCCH group. It may be beneficial to avoid or reduce situations where an active SCell may not have access to an activated PUCCH SCell. It may be beneficial to develop systems and processes wherein the PUCCH SCell may be activated/deactivated to reduce battery power consumption in the UE. Implementations may consider that the PUCCH SCell carries control information related to other SCells within the corresponding PUCCH group.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0099">Solutions may be provided in which PUCCH control information such as HARQ/CQI/SR may be sent on the PUCCH SCell even when the PUCCH SCell is deactivated. Allowing transmission of the PUCCH control information on a deactivated PUCCH SCell may require that PUCCH SCell to be capable of transmitting uplink signals when it is deactivated, or may require activation of PUCCH SCell when such transmissions are needed. Such a solution may to be too complex to implement and may require many changes to existing physical and MAC layer procedures and/or hardware.

It is important to define the timing of these actions for both UE and eNB. For example, sCellDeactivationTimer is maintained in both eNB and UE and it is important that both UE and eNB stop, start and/or restart this timer in the same TTI. Otherwise, the sCellDeactivationTimer in the UE may not be in-sync with the corresponding sCellDeactivationTimer in the eNB. Also eNB starts monitoring and receiving CSI (CQI/PMI/RI/PTI) according to the predefined timing in the same TTI and/or after UE starts transmitting the CSI. If the CSI timings in UE and eNB are not coordinated based on a common standard or air interface signaling the network operation may result in inefficient operations and/or errors.

A PUCCH group may have its PUCCH resources on a PUCCH SCell. An eNB configures PUCCH groups for a wireless device by transmitting RRC messages to the wireless device. Implementation of activation/deactivation processes for a PUCCH SCell may present some issues, if Release-10 or 12 activation/deactivation processes are implemented. Novel SCell activation/deactivation procedures may be implemented when PUCCH SCell is activated and/or deactivated.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0137">In an example embodiment of the invention, when a UE receives a MAC activation command for an SCell in subframe n, the UE starts or restarts the sCellDeactivationTimer associated with the SCell at subframe n+8. The requirements for the start time to report CQI/PMI/RI/PTI for the SCell may not be restricted to subframe n+8.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0138">In the example embodiments, the fixed delay of 8 subframes, is used for restarting sCellDeactivationTimer and many other actions. One may implements other fixed delays instead of 8 subframes for restarting sCellDeactivationTimer and many other actions, without deviating from the invention. For example, fixed delays of 4, 6, 10, 12, etc subframes may be employed.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0139">In the example embodiments, it is considered that when a PUCCH SCell is activated in a TAG, the TAG is uplink synchronized. For example PUCCH SCell may be activated in a pTAG or an uplink synchronized sTAG. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> shows example diagrams illustrating timing of some events according to an example embodiment of the invention. In the example embodiment of the invention, when a UE receives a MAC activation command for a PUCCH SCell in subframe n, the UE starts or restarts the sCellDeactivationTimer associated with the PUCCH SCell at subframe n+8. The requirements for the start time to report CQI/PMI/RI/PTI for the SCell may not be restricted to subframe n+8. Depending on the state of the UE, air interface quality, and UE implementation, UE may acquire the PUCCH SCell any time after subframe n.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0140">In an example embodiment, transmission of uplink CSI may start at subframe n+8+k (e.g. k greater or equal to 0). The parameter k may depend, at least, on when a detection attempt, by the wireless device, for the PUCCH SCell is successful. The parameter k may depend on the activation delay of the PUCH SCell. When the UE successfully detected the PUCCH SCell and the UE is ready for uplink transmission on the PUCCH SCell, the UE may start transmission of PUCCH at subframe n+8+k and in the first available PUCCH resource. In an example scenario, the UE may first transmit a fixed CSI (e.g. invalid or out of range CSI) if no measurement is available or a measurement of a downlink signal is below a threshold. The UE detects the PUCCH SCell and may be able to transmit uplink signals including PUCCH CSI signals. After the PUCCH SCell is detected the UE starts measuring the CSI. The CSI measurement may take a couple of subframes. Then the UE may transmit a measured CSI (e.g. valid CSI) when air interface measurement information for the PUCCH SCell is available. In an example scenario, the UE may detect the PUCCH before subframe n+8 and measure the CSI before n+8, then the UE may start transmission of the measured CSI (e.g. valid CSI) at subframe n+8. This, for example, may happen when the UE is already synchronized with the UE and can quickly measure CSI of the PUCCH SCell.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0141">The activation of the PUCCH secondary cell is considered completed in subframe i, when the PUCCH secondary cell becomes capable of transmitting CSI in subframe i+1. When the PUCCH secondary cell is capable of transmitting CSI in subframe i+1 and starts transmitting CSI from subframe i+1, it implies that the UE transmits CSI in the first available CSI resources on PUCCH SCell on or after subframe i+1.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0142">Detection and/or CSI measurement period may be random and depends on many factors. The UE may make multiple detection attempts until it successfully detects the PUCCHS Cell. A UE implementation may detect the PUCCHS Cell and start measuring earlier than n+8, even before n+4. If measurements are started before n+4, the UE may have a valid CQI result at n+8, and may be ready to send CQI at n+8. For example, CRS for CQI measurement may be available every TTI for some transmission modes. For TM9 where CQI measurement is based on CSI RS with configurable periodicity e.g. 5&#x2dc;80 ms, it is possible that the period without valid CQI is much longer than 4 ms in case the UE miss the CSI RS occasion. The period may be as long as until the first subframe has CSI RS available +4 ms considering UE processing time for CQI measurement. The time point when the UE have valid CQI result may depend on transmission mode and CSI RS configuration.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0143">In an example embodiment, transmission of uplink CSI may start at subframe n+8+k depending, at least, on when a detection attempt, by the wireless device, for the PUCCH SCell is successful and CSI measurement is available. The CSI starting subframe may depend, at least in part, on when a UE successfully measured the air interface signal and is ready to transmit a CSI (e.g. valid CSI). The UE may start transmission of CSI at subframe n+k+8.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0144">The parameter k is variable and indicates the number of subframes after subframe n+8 when UE starts CSI transmission. The parameter k may depend on the state of the UE, air interface quality, UE implementation, and/or CSI measurement.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0145">In a different scenario, for example, when the PUCCH detection takes longer than certain period, for example, longer than 40, 50, 70 subframes (these are example ranges and are not limiting). This may happen when the air interface signal quality is low, the UE starts from a cold start, the UE makes multiple detection attempts, and/or any other UE or system implementation related causes. Such scenarios may be reduced by better UE and/or eNB implementations. In such a scenario, an eNB may start decoding the secondary PUCCH signals for the UE in subframe n+k and may not receive CSI until the UE is able to detect PUCCH SCell and is ready for CSI transmission. Depending on how long the CSI transmission delay is, an eNB may perform some actions to remedy the situation. In an example embodiment, the eNB may deactivate the PUCCH SCell when it does not receive the CSI after certain period.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0146">In an example embodiment, a wireless device (UE) may receive at least one message comprising configuration parameters of one or more secondary cells in a plurality of cells. The plurality of cells are grouped into a plurality of physical uplink control channel (PUCCH) groups. PUCCH groups comprise a primary PUCCH group and a secondary PUCCH group. The secondary PUCCH group comprises a PUCCH secondary cell in the one or more secondary cells. The wireless device receives an activation/deactivation media-access-control control element (MAC CE) in subframe n. The activation/deactivation MAC CE indicates activation of the PUCCH secondary cell. In an example embodiment, the wireless device may start or restart a deactivation timer associated with the PUCCH secondary cell in subframe n+8. The wireless device may start transmitting channel state information (CSI) fields on the PUCCH secondary cell in subframe n+8+k. The parameter k may be an integer number depending, at least in part, on when a detection attempt, by the wireless device, for the PUCCH secondary cell is successful. The parameter k may also depend, at least in part, on when a measured CSI for the PUCCH secondary cell is available.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0147">In an example embodiment of the invention, the wireless device may receive an activation/deactivation media-access-control control element (MAC CE) in subframe m. The activation/deactivation MAC CE may indicate activation of a secondary cell in the primary PUCCH group. The wireless device may start or restart a deactivation timer associated with the secondary cell in subframe m+8. The UE may start transmitting channel state information (CSI) fields on the PUCCH secondary cell in subframe m+8. The wireless device may initially transmit a fixed CSI (for example invalid and/or out of range) and then transmit the measured CSI for the secondary cell when it is available. If valid CSI is available in subframe m+8, the UE may start transmission of the valid CSI at subframe m+8. The wireless device may start transmission of CSI for SCell(s) in the primary PUCCH group at subframe m+8, when the MAC activation command for the SCell is received in subframe m. On the other hand, the wireless device may start transmission of CSI for the PUCCH SCell in subframe m+8+k as described in example embodiments of the specifications.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0148">In an example embodiment of the invention, the wireless device may receive an activation/deactivation media-access-control control element (MAC CE) in subframe p. The activation/deactivation MAC CE may indicate activation of a first secondary cell in the secondary PUCCH cell group. The first secondary cell is different from the PUCCH SCell. The wireless device may start or restart a deactivation timer associated with the secondary cell in subframe p+8. The UE may start transmitting channel state information (CSI) fields on the PUCCH secondary cell in subframe p+8, if the PUCCH SCell is activated and ready for PUCCH uplink transmissions. The UE may start transmitting channel state information (CSI) fields on the PUCCH secondary cell in subframe p+8+k, if the PUCCH SCell is activated and but not yet ready for PUCCH uplink transmissions. In an example embodiment, a MAC CE, received in a subframe, may indicate activation a plurality of SCells including the PUCCH SCell, at least one secondary cell in the secondary PUCCH group and/or at least one secondary cell in the primary cell group.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0149">In an example embodiment, an eNB may transmit an activation command to activate an SCell in a UE with release 10 to 12 secondary cell configuration. The eNB may receive CSI for the secondary cell starting subframe a+8, when the eNB transmitted an activation command in subframe a. In an example embodiment, an eNB may transmit an activation command to activate an SCell in a UE with release 13 or beyond, wherein the secondary cell is in a primary PUCCH cell group. The eNB may receive CSI for the secondary cell starting subframe b+8, when the eNB transmitted an activation command in subframe b. In an example embodiment, an eNB may transmit an activation command to activate an SCell in a UE with release 13 or beyond, wherein the secondary cell is a PUCCH SCell. The eNB may receive CSI for the PUCCH SCell starting subframe c+8+k, when the eNB transmitted an activation command in subframe c. The eNB may start decoding CSI fields in the corresponding PUCCH resources depending on the RRC configuration for the SCells in a UE.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0150">In an example embodiment, when a PUCCH SCell is deactivated the UE may not immediately stop PUCCH transmissions. The PUCCH resources of an activated PUCCH SCell is employed for uplink transmission of CSI of PUCCH SCell and other activated SCell(s) in the secondary PUCCH group. The PUCCH resources of the activated PUCCH SCell is also employed for uplink transmission of ACK/NACK for downlink packets received on the PUCCH SCell and any other activated SCell(s) in the secondary PUCCH group. In the example embodiments of the invention if a UE receives a deactivation MAC command for a PUCCH SCell in subframe n or deactivation conditions are met in subframe n (e.g. deactivation timer expires), UE may perform many of the following deactivation mechanisms in any one of the subframes from subframe n+1 to subframe n+8. The deactivation mechanisms performed in any one of the subframes from subframe n+1 to subframe n+8 may include not transmitting SRS on the PUCCH SCell; not transmitting on UL-SCH on the PUCCH SCell; not transmitting on RACH on the PUCCH SCell; not monitoring the PDCCH on the PUCCH SCell; and/or not monitoring the PDCCH for the PUCCH SCell.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0151">In the example embodiments of the invention some of the deactivation mechanisms may be performed only in subframe n+8. The UE may stop transmitting CSI on PUCCH on the PUCCH SCell in subframe n+8. This implies that the UE does not stop reporting CSI for activated SCell(s) in the PUCCH SCell before subframe n+8. The UE stops reporting CSI for activated SCell(s) in the PUCCH SCell on subframe n+8. The UE may stop transmission of CSI for the PUCCH SCell on subframe n+8. In an example embodiment, if there is another activated SCell in the PUCCH group, the UE may stop transmission of CSI for the another activated SCell in subframe n+8.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0152">The example embodiments of the invention may simplify the decoding process in the eNB receiving the PUCCH signals on the PUCCH SCell. When the PUCCH SCell is deactivated in a given UE, the same PUCCH SCell may remain in activated state in other UEs. Other UEs may continuously transmit signals on PUCCH resources of the PUCCH SCell, while the given UE needs to stop PUCCH signal transmissions due to deactivation. If the eNB does not know when the given UE stops PUCCH signal transmissions, then eNB has to guess when the UE stops such transmissions. This may complicate the decoding process in an eNB. Many UEs may share the same PUCCH OFDM resource blocks. In the example embodiments of the invention, both the given UE and the eNB know that PUCCH signal CSI transmission has to stop exactly in subframe n+8. UE stops CSI transmission for all activated SCell(s) in the secondary PUCCH group on PUCCH resources of the deactivated PUCCH SCell exactly in subframe n+8. The eNB also knows that it has to stop decoding for PUCCH signals transmitted by the UE on the PUCCH resources of the PUCCH SCell in subframe n+8. Other deactivation mechanisms such as not transmitting SRS on the PUCCH SCell; not transmitting on UL-SCH on the PUCCH SCell; not transmitting on RACH on the PUCCH SCell; not monitoring the PDCCH on the PUCCH SCell; and/or not monitoring the PDCCH for the S PUCCH Cell may be stopped in any one of the subframes from subframe n+1 to subframe n+8. The exact timing of these stopping mechanisms are not required by eNB, since these stopping mechanisms do not require complex decoding processes in the eNB.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0153"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> is an example flow diagram as per an aspect of an embodiment of the present invention.
