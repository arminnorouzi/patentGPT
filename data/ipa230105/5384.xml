The derivation relationship of Chinese characters is indicated by the character identifier of each Chinese character in the Literacy Code table and the corresponding character identifier of the upper-layer. The character identifier of the upper-layer of the Chinese character is derived from the Chinese character Basic Component or the character identifier of other Chinese character that the character is derived from. The Literacy Code table records the upper-layer character identifier of each Chinese character derived from other Chinese character.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">In one embodiment, the Literacy Code table is generated according to the derivation of Chinese characters in the main literacy path of Chinese characters, wherein the main literacy path of a target Chinese character is determined by the following method: the target Chinese character is gradually split according to the structure of the Chinese character, wherein, each main path character is selected from the split result of the step, and the main path character is used for the next split until the final split result is obtained, and the final main path character is selected from the split result of the last step; the target Chinese character and the main path characters selected in the splitting process at all levels are generated according to the reverse order of the splitting order to generate the main literacy path of the target Chinese character.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">In one embodiment, when selecting the main path character based on the splitting result of each step, the selection is made according to the following priority order: Chinese characters or character-forming components are selected first from the splitting result as the main path character; if there is more than one Chinese character or character-forming component in the result, the Chinese character or character-forming component in the split result that has the same or similar pronunciation as the Chinese character before the split is used as the main path character; if the pronunciation of the Chinese characters or the character-forming components is same or similar in the result, the multi-component character will be used as the main path character, and the multi-component character includes multiple (ie two or more) Basic Components. If there is more than one multi-component characters in the splitting result, the multi-component character located on the right, bottom or inside of the Chinese character before splitting in the splitting result will be used as the main path character.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">In one embodiment, the Literacy Code table also records the direction that each Chinese character is created by combining upper-level Basic Component with Chinese character or Basic Component, or by combining the upper-level Chinese character with Basic Component or Chinese character.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">In one embodiment, according to the direction of adding Chinese characters or adding Basic components recorded in the Literacy Code table, the sub-area of the literacy interface of the literacy interface corresponding to the Chinese character or the Chinese character component in the literacy prompt information is determined.

For example, if a Chinese character is added at the top, the sub-area where the Chinese character as the literacy prompt information is located above the central area.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">In one embodiment, the Literacy Code table also records Literacy Code corresponding to each Basic Component and Chinese character, and according to the Literacy Code, the Chinese character or Chinese character component is determined to be the literacy prompt information.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">In one embodiment, all Basic Components separate into character-forming components and non-character components first, and then classify them according to shape, and Basic Components are arranged according to the set arrangement rules, using different first type of alphabets to represent each Basic Component category, the Basic Components in each Basic Component category are represented by different second type of alphabets, the Literacy Code is the combining alphabets of the first type of alphabet in the category and the second type of alphabet of the Basic Component. Among them, the two types of alphabets may be English letters, for example, the first type of alphabets are uppercase letters, and the second type of alphabets are lowercase letters, or on the contrary, the present invention does not limit the alphabet form. For the combined alphabets composed of upper and lower case letters above are used to represent Basic Components, the combining alphabets can also be called Basic Component character-forming/non-character code.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">All Chinese character Basic Components specifically include Chinese character Basic Components used to generate simplified characters, traditional characters, Chinese characters in Japanese, and Chinese characters in Korean.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">In one embodiment, in the case that the target literacy interface includes the main Chinese character, when the target Chinese character in the target literacy interface has a phrase it owns, the target literacy interface also includes a prompt; the target literacy interface receives the user's response to the prompt after the instruction is selected, the phrase interface corresponding to the main Chinese character of the target literacy interface is displayed. The selection instruction for the prompt indicates that the user has selected the prompt. The main Chinese character included in the phrase interface is the same as the main Chinese character in the target literacy interface. The character interface also includes Chinese characters that can be grouped with the main Chinese character of the phrase interface; when one of the Chinese characters which are able to compose phrase with the main Chinese character is selected, the phrase interface for the phrase composed from the selected Chinese character and the main Chinese character is displayed in the phrase interface. The prompt can be a selected form of symbol, alphabet, etc.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">In one embodiment, the user can perform the above-mentioned &#x201c;selected&#x201d; operations by touching and clicking on the screen or by clicking with a mouse, and the click is usually a single click.

People first invented more than two hundred pictographs. These pictographs represent the most common people or things in people's daily life, such as women and the sun, Moon, fire, mountains, etc. Then, these pictographs gradually crossed and combined, then crossed and combined again, and repeated in multiple layers, forming thousands of Chinese characters. Following this trajectory, we can start with primitive pictographic characters and gradually develop a derivation process of Chinese characters from simple to complex. The embodiment of the present invention develops a set of linear literacy methods, namely the literacy method of the embodiment of the present invention, on the basis of the standard and the Basic Component character-forming/non-character code of the proposed in the embodiments of the present invention. Due to the rigor of the standard, the embodiments of the present invention can be strictly applied to four thousand commonly used characters and other characters.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">According to the standard &#x201c;GB13000.1 Character Set Chinese character component Specification for Information Processing&#x201d; and the attached &#x201c;Chinese Character Basic Components Table&#x201d;, 560 Chinese character Basic Components are defined as the basic structure of Chinese characters in a standard way. The 20,902 Chinese characters in the GB13000.1 character set are all composed of these components.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">According to the above Chinese character component specification of the embodiment of the present invention, a component is a character structure unit composed of strokes and having the function of assembling Chinese characters. The Basic Component (ie the Basic Component of Chinese characters) is the smallest component that is no longer split, divided into basic character-forming component (itself is a character, referred to as character-forming component) and basic non-character component (not a character itself, referred to as non-character component). Chinese characters can be composed of Basic Components. Analyzing and categorizing the 560 Basic Components will help to use them better.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">The Basic Components can be divided into character-forming components and non-character components. If a component is included in the 7,000 Chinese characters in the &#x201c;Modern Chinese Common Character List&#x201d;, it is called a character-forming component, otherwise it is called a non-character component. According to this standard, there are 225 character-forming components and 335 non-character components in the Basic Components. Among the non-character components, 215 are used for simplified characters, and extra 120 are used for traditional characters and Japanese and Korean Chinese characters. There are 440 character-forming components and non-character components for simplified characters.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">By analyzing the character-forming components and non-character components, it can be known that the character-forming components are generally stretched and full. Since they are all characters themselves, people are more familiar with them, it is very convenient to summarize them together as possible to use them. And among the 225 character-forming components, the following ten components represent the most important physical characteristics of all character-forming components. They are: <img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00003" he="2.79mm" wi="16.93mm" file="US20230005385A1-20230105-P00003.TIF" alt="custom-character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/> <img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00004" he="2.79mm" wi="14.82mm" file="US20230005385A1-20230105-P00004.TIF" alt="custom-character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>. The character-forming components are classified according to the ten characters, and the generated categories are quite characteristic and regular.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">In non-character components, these four (main strokes) components &#x201c;<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00005" he="2.79mm" wi="1.44mm" file="US20230005385A1-20230105-P00005.TIF" alt="custom-character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>&#x201d;, &#x201c;<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00006" he="2.79mm" wi="1.78mm" file="US20230005385A1-20230105-P00006.TIF" alt="custom-character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>&#x201d;, &#x201c;<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00007" he="3.22mm" wi="2.12mm" file="US20230005385A1-20230105-P00007.TIF" alt="custom-character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>&#x201d;, and &#x201c;<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00008" he="3.22mm" wi="2.46mm" file="US20230005385A1-20230105-P00008.TIF" alt="custom-character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>&#x201d; are very representative, and there are also a dozen non-character components that are very representative in shape. The embodiment of the present invention focuses on the shapes of these non-character components, and the generated categories are also quite different in features and regularity. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a schematic diagram of the Basic Component character-forming/non-character code generated by separating character-forming components from non-character components according to an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, there are a total of 560 Basic Components, including 225 character-forming components and 335 non-character components. Among the non-character components, 120 are only used for traditional characters and Japanese and Korean Chinese characters. All the Basic Components are divided into two components according to their shapes, providing 25 categories (ie, 25 Chinese character Basic Component categories), of which 10 categories are the character-forming component categories, except for a few of those non-character components that are particularly similar to the character-forming components, all others are character-forming components. The remaining 15 are non-character component categories. Except for a few character-forming components that are particularly similar to non-character components, all others are non-character components. Each category occupies a row in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, and the first Basic Component of each row along with capital letters is also used to call the Basic Component category. Each Basic Component has a corresponding two-letter string, where the first uppercase letter represents the component category, and the second lowercase letter represents the specific component within the category.

The scientific nature of the Basic Components of the standard ensures that Basic Components can be added every time instead of may or may not. For this, the existing literacy methods cannot do it. The second point is that basically only one component is added at a time, and it must be added from one of the top, bottom, left, or right directions. There is no other directions for addition. This feature is very clear, namely, the graduality of Chinese characters adding one Basic Component at a time and the linearization of the direction of each adding. The third point is that the process from &#x201c;<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00045" he="3.22mm" wi="2.46mm" file="US20230005385A1-20230105-P00045.TIF" alt="custom-character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>&#x201d; to &#x201c;<img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00046" he="3.22mm" wi="2.46mm" file="US20230005385A1-20230105-P00046.TIF" alt="custom-character" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/>&#x201d; is multi-levels, with intermediate generations, many Chinese characters are used.

The character literacy system of the embodiment of the present invention can gradually demonstrate such multi-layer Chinese character derivative graphs displaying only one layer at a time.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">The character literacy method of the embodiment of the present invention can achieve the effect of effectively and quickly learning Chinese characters. Based on the embodiments of the present invention, first of all, learn Chinese characters in a systematic and scientific manner instead of in isolation. It is easier to learn simple characters first, and then follow the derivative trajectory of Chinese characters to learn more difficult ones layer by layer. Students (that is, learners) know the ins and outs of glyphs and the origins of the meanings and sounds of the characters, and it will be easier for students to recognize and remember the Chinese characters they have learned. The Basic Components and complete Basic Component character-forming/non-character code ensures that this layer-by-layer structure is complete and scientific. However, the prior art literacy based on radicals and similar methods lack complete and systematic Chinese character splitting, therefore they cannot achieve the learning effect of the embodiment of the present invention. Secondly, as a two-dimensional flat text, Chinese characters should be allowed to establish a two-dimensional concept of up, down, left, and right. At the same time, the derivation of Chinese characters at each level must be limited to one direction. This method of being restricted to one direction at a time greatly reduces the difficulty of literacy, so that students only need to pay attention to one direction of a two-dimensional character at a time. The process of converting two-dimensional Chinese characters into one direction at a time is called the process of linearization of planar Chinese characters, and the corresponding system is called a linear system, that is, the literacy system of the embodiment of the present invention. In addition, the Basic Components added in multiple layers generate new Chinese characters layer by layer. This multi-layer process shows that the Chinese characters themselves are integrated, systemic, and interrelated, so that the embodiments of the present invention can be systematically changed from one character to another similar character to learn them. Finally, about half of the characters have roughly the same pronunciation as one of the characters they contain, and the embodiment of the present invention links them together to help literacy. Therefore, the embodiments of the present invention can achieve effects that cannot be achieved by the prior art in terms of reducing the difficulty of learning Chinese characters.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">The embodiment of the present invention grasps the Basic Components, the Basic Component character-forming/non-character codes and the linearization of Chinese characters, thereby grasping the core of Chinese character learning.

The same or similar pronunciation is preferred, and multi-component characters are preferred under the same conditions as above. Under the same conditions as above, if both are multi-component characters, first is located on the right, bottom or inside. Under the same conditions as above, if both of them are non-character components, priority is given to the one with more strokes and stroke order. The following is a specific introduction.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">Regarding character or character-forming components, they have higher priority than non-character components. Character-forming components are basically single-body characters. They have strong ability to form characters and are used more frequently. People are most familiar with them. Therefore, try to learn new characters on the basis of character-forming components as much as possible in order to make students feel cordial and relaxed. Similarly, characters are used in people's daily life. People are more familiar with characters than non-character components, which should be more suitable as a basis for learning new characters.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">Regarding the same or similar pronunciation, when learning a new character on the basis of a character, if the pronunciation of the basic character is the same or similar to the learned character, it will help to learn the new character. Therefore, among several paths leading to a complex character, if there is a path whose pronunciation is the same as or similar to that of the learned character, the embodiment of the present invention will use this path as the main literacy path to facilitate the user to learn the pronunciation of the character.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">Regarding the priority of multi-component characters, if there are two characters, one is a single-component character and the other is a multi-component character, then the multi-component character is selected as the character in the main path of literacy. Multi-component characters are composed of multiple components and often contain more information.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">Regarding the priority on the right, bottom or inside, under the same conditions as above, the characters or Basic Components on the right, bottom or inside tend to occupy more space and have a larger effect. Therefore, the characters are preferred as the main path of literacy.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">According to the above priority order, the priority order is determined in order when the Chinese characters are split, and a main path of literacy can be determined, thereby determining the learning order of the Chinese characters.
