The display module DM-<b>1</b> may define a display surface IS-<b>1</b>. The display surface IS-<b>1</b> may be parallel or substantially parallel to a plane defined by a first direction DR<b>1</b> and a second direction DR<b>2</b>. An image may be displayed on a portion of the display surface IS-<b>1</b>.

Because a head-mounted display device is configured such that the optical system OS magnifies the display surface IS-<b>1</b>, the user's recognition of non-display areas may be more prominent in the head-mounted display device than in the previous embodiments. In contrast, according to the present embodiment, because a micro-sized display is achieved due to high integration of pixels, it may be possible to alleviate the recognition of non-display areas NDA even when the optical system OS magnifies the display surface IS-<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, a display device DD-<b>2</b> according to some embodiments of the present disclosure may be a head-mounted type augmented reality display device that has an eyeglass shape and provides a generated virtual image to a user that wears the display device DD-<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0153">The display device DD-<b>2</b> according to some embodiments may include a first image display device DD-<b>21</b>, a second image display device DD-<b>22</b>, and a head-mounting frame BD-<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0154">The first image display device DD-<b>21</b> may be adjacent to a right eye of the user, providing a first virtual image to the right eye of the user.
