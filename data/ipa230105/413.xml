Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The disclosure relates to a wearable device, and more particularly, to a wearable device including a structure for preventing noise from deteriorating a measurement signal due to static electricity.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A wearable device may be attached to a user's body, such as the user's abdomen, back, shoulder, or arm, to measure biosignals such as electromyography, electrocardiogram, blood pressure, or brain waves. For example, a wearable device for measuring an electrocardiogram, whose electrodes are in contact with the user's skin, detects electrical activity in the user's heart, and measures the electrocardiogram. Due to such characteristics, the wearable device should operate while being attached to the user's body for a long time.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Meanwhile, on dry days like in winter, static electricity is easily generated due to friction between clothes and the user's body. In particular, when the user does activities while the wearable device is attached to his or her body, static electricity is inevitably generated due to friction between clothes and the wearable device or the user's body. The generated static electricity generates noise in a measurement signal of the wearable device and thus deteriorates the measurement precision.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The above background art is technical information possessed by the inventor to derive the disclosure or obtained during a process of deriving the disclosure, and is not necessarily considered to be known art open to the general public prior to the filing of the disclosure.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The disclosure has been devised to solve the above technical problem and provides a wearable device including a structure for preventing noise caused by static electricity.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, such a technical problem is an example, and the objective of disclosure to solve is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Additional aspects will be set forth in part in the description which follows and, in part, will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the presented embodiments of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to an embodiment of the disclosure, a wearable device, which is used by being attached to a user's skin, includes a main body unit including a housing and a substrate, the substrate being arranged inside the housing, an electrode unit including a sensing electrode connected to the main body unit, and a patch unit including one or more conductive members, the one or more conductive members being configured to electrically connect the electrode unit to the user's skin.
