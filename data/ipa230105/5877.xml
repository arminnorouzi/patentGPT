In the later use, when the display panel is in a certain water and oxygen condition, due to the strong metal activity of the bonding pads, welding points between the micro-LED chip and the bonding pads are easy to oxidize, and after oxidation, the resistance increases, the power consumption of the micro-LED chip increases, and the heat production increases until the micro-LED chip fails, so that the reliability of the micro-LED chip gets worse.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, how to slow down or avoid the oxidation phenomenon of the welding points is an urgent problem to be solved.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In view of the defects of the above related art, embodiments of the present disclosure provide a temporary chip assembly, a display panel and manufacturing methods of the temporary chip assembly and the display panel, which can solve the problem that welding points are easy to oxidize in related art.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The embodiments of the present disclosure provide a temporary chip assembly, which includes: a temporary substrate, a pyrolytic adhesive layer, and a plurality of micro light-emitting chips.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The pyrolytic adhesive layer formed by pyrolytic adhesive is arranged on a front surface of the temporary substrate.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The plurality of micro light-emitting chips are arranged on the pyrolytic adhesive layer.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The pyrolytic adhesive layer includes a plurality of mutually separated pyrolytic adhesive units which are in one-to-one correspondence with the plurality of micro light-emitting chip.

Of course, in some examples, the pyrolytic adhesive <b>121</b> between the electrodes of the micro light-emitting chip <b>13</b> may not be heated through the transfer head <b>2</b>, and the pyrolytic adhesive <b>121</b> may also be heated in other ways.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">It can be seen that, in the display panel provided in the embodiment, the welding points between the micro light-emitting chip and the corresponding bonding pads on the display backboard are covered with pyrolytic adhesive to block water and oxygen, thereby slowing down or avoiding the oxidation of the welding points, improving the reliability of micro light-emitting chip, and improving the yield and the reliability of the display panel.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">Yet another exemplary embodiment:</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">The embodiment also provides a display screen, which includes a frame and the display panel as shown above.
