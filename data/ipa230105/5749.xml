In addition, the mask layers defining both of the first vias and the second vias are the sidewall layers, therefore the etching rate of the mask layers can be kept consistent. In addition, the first vias and the second vias are located in the same layer, thereby avoiding the problem of different etching aspect ratios caused by the etching loading effect when a capacitor hole pattern is defined by the SADP process. In addition, the repair layers can further remove the chamfers of the initial first vias to form relatively smooth first vias, and then form smooth capacitor holes, which is beneficial to avoid the phenomenon of tip discharge or electric leakage. Therefore, the embodiments of the disclosure can improve the quality of the capacitor holes, and further improve the yield of the semiconductor structure.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In addition, the material of the repair layers is the same as that of the sidewall layers, so that when the base is etched with the sidewall layers and the repair layers as a mask, the sidewall layers and the repair layers have the same etching rate, thereby ensuring the same consumption degree, and further ensuring that the finally formed capacitor holes are consistent in size and height.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0024" num="0023">One or more embodiments are illustrated with reference to the figures in the corresponding drawings, which should not limit the embodiments.

With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a substrate <b>201</b> and mask layer <b>202</b> on the substrate <b>201</b> are provided. The mask layer <b>202</b> is configured to transfer a capacitor hole pattern, and further, the substrate <b>201</b> is etched with the patterned mask layer <b>202</b> after the pattern transfer as a mask to form a capacitor hole structure. When the traditional double patterning technology, such as self-aligned double patterning (SADP) is adopted to define a capacitor hole, due to the loading effect, the patterned mask layer <b>202</b> after the pattern transfer have disadvantages of different sizes (as shown by a<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), insufficient etching (as shown by b<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), different heights (as shown by c<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), etc. Therefore, capacitor holes formed after the capacitor pattern is transferred have corresponding disadvantages of different sizes, insufficient etching, different heights of the capacitors and absence of filling materials, such as GeSi material, in the capacitors in the subsequently stage, which leads to the reduced capacitor storage capacity or electrical failure, and further affects the wafer yield and seriously limits the possibility of further improving the storage capacity and stability of a capacitor memory. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the width w<b>1</b> is smaller than the width w<b>2</b> and the height h<b>2</b> is smaller than the height h<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Embodiments of the disclosure provide a method for manufacturing a semiconductor structure. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the method for manufacturing the semiconductor structure includes the following operations: S<b>1</b>: providing a base; S<b>2</b>: forming multiple discrete first mask layers on the substrate; S<b>3</b>: forming multiple sidewall layers, each sidewall layer being configured to encircle the corresponding first mask layer, each sidewall layer being connected to the corresponding closest sidewall layers, and the side walls, away from the first mask layers, of the multiple connected sidewall layers defining initial first vias, each of which is provided with chamfers; S<b>4</b>: removing the first mask layers, and each sidewall layer defining a second via; S<b>5</b>: forming repair layers, which are located on the side walls, away from the second vias, of the sidewall layers, and fill the chamfers of the initial first vias to form first vias; and S<b>6</b>: etching the substrate along the first vias and the second vias to form capacitor holes. In other words, the sidewall layers are configured to define the positions of both the first vias and the second vias, therefore the distances between the first vias and the corresponding second vias are approximate to the width of the sidewall layers, in this way, the distances between the first vias and the corresponding second vias can be relatively consistent. In addition, the mask layers defining both the first vias and the second vias are the sidewall layers, therefore the etching rate of the mask layers can be kept consistent. In addition, the first vias and the second vias are located in the same layer, i.e., it is not necessary to transfer a pattern between upper and lower mask layers, therefore the pattern accuracy of the finally formed capacitor holes is improved. In addition, the repair layers may further be configured to remove the chamfers of the initial first vias to form relatively smooth first vias, and then form smooth capacitor holes, which is beneficial to avoid the phenomenon of tip discharge or electric leakage. Therefore, the embodiments of the disclosure can improve the quality of the capacitor holes, and further improve the yield of the semiconductor structure.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">To make the objectives, technical solutions and advantages of the embodiments of the disclosure to be understood more clearly, the embodiments of the disclosure will be described in detail below with reference to the drawings.
