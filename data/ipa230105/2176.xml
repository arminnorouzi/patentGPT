Of course, other types of sheet treating machines are also addressed by the present invention.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0003">In general, sheet treating machines can be adapted to any kind of sheet material. Examples thereof are paper, cardboard, plastics, metal, composite materials, and leather.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0004">In known devices for changing a sheet pile in a sheet feeder, the movement of a main pile supporting unit usually is synchronized to sheets being taken from the main pile. This means that the main pile supporting unit is raised by a distance corresponding to a thickness of a sheet each time a sheet is taken from the sheet pile.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0005">In alternative solutions, the main pile supporting unit is raised by a distance corresponding to a cumulated thickness of a certain number of sheets after this number of sheets has been taken from the main pile.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0006">Additionally, a residual pile supporting unit is usually synchronized to the main pile supporting unit when residual pile bars are pushed into slots of a pallet being positioned on the main pile supporting unit. In a situation when the sheet pile is only supported by the residual pile bars, they are synchronized to the sheets being taken from the sheet pile in the same way the main pile supporting unit is synchronized thereto (cf. above).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0007">As a result, such a device for changing a sheet pile in a sheet feeder allows to change a sheet pile, more precisely a sheet pile being positioned on a corresponding pallet, without having to interrupt the flow of sheets being fed from the sheet feeder to a sheet treating machine. Consequently, the sheet treating machine can be operated non-stop.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0008">It has always been a challenge in the fields of sheet feeders to find a good compromise between high operational speeds and secure and gentle handling of sensitive sheets. In other words, high operational speeds are limited by the requirement of not causing any damage or detriment to the sheets of the sheet pile being processed in the sheet feeder.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0009">DE102010053587 uses a non-stop device at the sheet feeder using two bands on each bar that supports the residual pile. A roller holds the bands at the tip of the bar such that when the bars are inserted or removed, the band unrolls itself so that there are no relative motions between the band and the piles.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0010">It is therefore an object of the present invention to eliminate or at least reduce the conflict of objectives mentioned above. An improved and simpler device for changing a sheet pile in a sheet feeder shall be provided, which is able to feed sheets at high operational speeds without risking to damage these sheets.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0011">The object of the invention is solved by a device for changing a sheet pile in a sheet feeder for a sheet treating machine, comprising a main pile supporting unit with a main pile actuating unit for lifting and lowering the main pile supporting unit, wherein the main pile supporting unit comprises a supporting surface adapted to support a pallet carrying a sheet pile. The device further comprises a residual pile supporting unit with a residual pile actuating unit for lifting and lowering the residual pile supporting unit, wherein the residual pile supporting unit comprises a plurality of residual pile bars extending substantially parallel to each other and being substantially parallel to the supporting surface of the main pile supporting unit. The residual pile bars are coupled to a bar actuating unit adapted to move the residual pile bars on a line parallel to the direction of extension of the respective residual pile bar into a sheet pile region and retract the residual pile bars from the sheet pile region. The bar actuating unit is configured to retract the residual pile bars while introducing an oscillatory movement of the residual pile bars along the direction of extension of the residual bars.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0012">The invention is based on the idea that to prevent sheets from being moved when the residual pile bars are retracted, the friction forces between the residual pile bars and the sheets being in contact with the residual pile bars must be lower than the friction forces between the sheets of the respective sheet piles.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0013">This is achieved by introducing oscillatory movements voluntarily while retracting the residual pile bars from the sheet pile region. At this point, the residual pile bars are engaged between an upper end of a replacement sheet pile and the lower end of a residual pile currently being processed. Therefore, the residual pile bars need to be retracted in such a way that neither the sheets of the residual sheet pile nor the sheets of the replacement sheet pile experience any damage or detriment, which could lead to a full machine stop in the worst case.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0014">The movement for extending and extracting the residual pile bars into and from the sheet pile region, respectively, is generally a horizontal movement. Therefore, oscillatory movements of the residual pile bars along the direction of their extension correspond to horizontal movements, too.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0015">The inventors have found that with these oscillations sliding movements are encouraged over adhesion between the residual pile bars and the sheets of the residual pile and the main pile, respectively. As the sliding motion is determined by dynamic friction in contrast to static friction in the case of adhesion, the overall frictional forces between the residual pile bars and the sheets are strongly reduced.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0016">Most importantly, the dynamic friction between the residual pile bars and the sheets is lower than the static friction between the sheets of the respective sheet pile. Therefore, the sheets will stay in place while the residual pile bars can slide between the residual sheet pile and the replacement sheet pile. In this way, the risk to drag a sheet along with the residual pile bars during retraction is reduced. This also reduces the overall risk of damaging a sheet and the risk of a stop of the machine, thereby reducing machine downtime. Further, means for introducing oscillatory movements are easy to implement and do not increase the space requirements of the device.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0017">Generally, the amplitude of the oscillatory movement is small compared to the total length of the withdrawal movement. Therefore, a sufficiently high number of oscillations can be executed during withdrawal of the residual pile bars. However, the oscillations have to be large enough to ensure that dynamic friction determines the behavior between the residual pile bars and the sheets.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0018">The oscillation frequency has to be chosen, too, to ensure that dynamic friction determines the behavior between the residual pile bars and the sheets. Lower oscillation frequencies would not provide the desired frictional behavior while higher oscillation frequencies require more expensive equipment.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0019">According to an embodiment, the bar actuating unit comprises a supporting bar extending in an orthogonal direction with respect to the residual pile bars and being parallel to the supporting surface, wherein respective first end sections of each of the residual pile bars are coupled to the supporting bar. Further, the supporting bar is coupled to a transmission configured to move the supporting bar along the line parallel to the direction of extension of the residual pile bars. The transmission can be a chain transmission, a belts transmission, a transmission using a set of gears, a pneumatic cylinder based transmission or any other suitable transmission or combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0020">The supporting bar provides a secure mounting for the first end sections of the residual pile bars. At the same time, movement along the direction of extension of the residual pile bars can be easily achieved by moving the supporting bar to which all of the residual pile bars are attached.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0021">In other words, all the residual pile bars are moving synchronously at the same time along the direction of extension of the residual pile bars. This simplifies the overall design of the bar actuating unit and of the overall device.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0022">A chain transmission is especially suited as driving unit for the bar actuating unit, as the maximum range of the movement of the residual pile bars is known and the extension and retraction of the residual pile bars is done along the same axis, just in opposite directions. The maximum range of the movement of the residual pile bars can correspond to full extension of the residual pile bars into the sheet pile region.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0023">The transmission can be driven by an electric motor strong enough to cause a relative motions (i.e. a sliding) between the bars and the pile of sheets, for any type of sheet material, format and weight used in the machine.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0024">In another embodiment, the residual pile bars supporting unit further comprises an alignment unit, wherein the alignment unit comprises a sheet with openings, in which the residual pile bars are arranged. Further, the residual pile bars supporting unit comprises an alignment actuator, especially an electric drive, for moving the sheet along the direction perpendicular of the direction of extension of the residual pile bars.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0025">The alignment unit is used for ensuring that the residual pile bars have the correct position before being moved into the sheet pile region to interact with slots in the pallet, on which the main sheet pile is placed. In this way, misalignments between the residual pile bars and the pallet, which could lead to interruptions of the sheet feeder, are prevented.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0026">The object of the invention is further solved by a method for changing a sheet pile in a sheet feeder a sheet treating machine, comprising the following steps:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0027">a) detecting a limit height of a sheet pile processed in the sheet feeder, wherein the sheet pile is supported on a pallet being arranged on a main pile supporting unit,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0028">b) supporting the sheet pile by a residual pile supporting unit in that a plurality of residual pile bars are pushed into respective slots of the pallet,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0029">c) withdrawing the pallet being arranged on the main pile supporting unit from the sheet pile and placing a replacement pallet carrying a replacement sheet pile on the main pile supporting unit,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0030">d) bringing an upper end of the replacement sheet pile in contact with the residual pile bars such that the residual pile bars are engaged between the lower end of the sheet pile and an upper end of the replacement sheet pile, and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0031">e) retracting the residual pile bars from a sheet pile region such that the sheet pile is supported on the replacement sheet pile, wherein the residual pile bars oscillate along the direction of extension of the residual pile bars while being retracted.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0029" num="0032">The inventive method provides a way for non-stop operation of the sheet feeder in the sheet treating machine. The oscillatory movement during retraction of the residual pile bars ensures that sliding movements are encouraged over adhesion between the residual pile bars and the sheets of the sheet pile and between the residual pile bars and the replacement sheet pile. As the sliding motion is determined by dynamic friction in contrast to static friction in the case of adhesion, the overall frictional forces between the residual pile bars and the sheets are reduced, therefore reducing the risk of dragging sheets along with the residual pile bars.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0033">All residual pile bars can be retracted at the same time, with the same speed and/or with the same oscillations. With other words, all residual pile bars are moved synchronously. This reduces the complexity of the necessary retraction mechanism, therefore reducing the cost of the method and a sheet feeder used therein.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0034">The residual pile bars are especially residual pile bars of the device as described before. The same properties and advantages described in respect to the device therefore apply to the method for changing the sheet pile as well.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><p id="p-0032" num="0035">Further aspects and advantages of the invention will now be described with reference to the attached figures.

The main pile supporting unit <b>18</b> is lifted to a height such that always the uppermost sheet of the sheet pile <b>14</b> can be transferred to the loading table <b>36</b> for further processing.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0074">Therefore, the main pile supporting unit <b>18</b> is steadily moved upwards by the main pile actuating unit <b>20</b>. The upwards movement might be continuous or in steps, wherein each step can correspond to the height of a single or of multiple sheets.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0075">The height of the main pile supporting unit <b>18</b> and/or the sheet pile <b>14</b> can be monitored by a sensor, allowing to monitor the remaining height of the sheet pile <b>14</b>. The sensor might be a light barrier, a camera and/or a balance.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0076">This allows detecting a limit height of the sheet pile <b>14</b> processed by the sheet feeder <b>10</b> (step S1 in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0074" num="0077">Once a predefined limit height of the sheet pile <b>14</b> is detected, it is concluded that the replacement sheet pile needs to be provided in the sheet feeder <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0078">To this end, the residual pile supporting unit <b>24</b> has to be arranged by the residual pile actuating unit <b>26</b> at the same height as the main pile supporting unit <b>18</b>. In particular, the residual pile bars must be at the same height than the slots <b>23</b> of the pallet <b>16</b>. Additionally, the upwards movement, i.e. lifting, along the axis V of the main pile supporting unit <b>18</b> is to be synchronized with an upwards movement of the residual pile supporting unit <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0079">Further, the alignment unit <b>52</b> of the residual pile supporting unit is used to align the residual pile bars <b>38</b> with the slots <b>23</b> of the pallet <b>16</b>. For this, the sheet <b>54</b> is moved by the alignment actuator <b>58</b> along the axis D until the apertures <b>56</b> are arranged in front of the slots <b>23</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0080">As the residual pile bars <b>32</b> are arranged in the apertures <b>56</b> and the supporting bar <b>42</b> can be moved along the supporting rail <b>57</b>, the movement of the sheet <b>54</b> results in the alignment of the residual pile bars <b>32</b> in front of the slots <b>23</b> of the pallet <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0081">Then, the supporting bar <b>42</b> is moved by the chain transmission <b>48</b> along a direction parallel to axis H in the direction of the pallet <b>16</b> and the crossbar <b>28</b>, resulting in a horizontal movement of the residual pile bars <b>38</b> in the direction of their extension.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0082">Therefore, the residual pile bars <b>38</b> are pushed into the respective slots <b>23</b> of the pallet <b>16</b>, resulting in the sheet pile <b>14</b> currently being processed, which will also be referred to as residual sheet pile, being supported by the residual pile supporting unit <b>24</b> (step S2 in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0080" num="0083">Once the residual sheet pile is fully supported on the residual pile bars <b>38</b>, the pallet <b>16</b> can be withdrawn by lowering the main pile supporting unit <b>18</b> with the main pile actuating unit <b>20</b>. As the slots <b>23</b> of the pallet <b>16</b> are open in the direction of the upper surface of the pallet <b>16</b>, the residual pile bars <b>32</b> will no longer be within the slots <b>23</b> and will support the residual sheet pile at the current height.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0084">Of course, this means that the movement of the main pile supporting unit <b>18</b> and the residual pile supporting unit <b>24</b> is not synchronized anymore. While the main pile supporting unit <b>18</b> is lowered, the residual pile supporting unit <b>24</b> keeps lifting the residual sheet pile so that the transfer of sheets to the loading table <b>36</b> can be done without interruption, i.e. non-stop.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0085">After lowering the main part supporting unit <b>18</b>, the now empty pallet <b>16</b> can be withdrawn and a new replacement pallet carrying a replacement sheet pile can be put onto the main pile supporting unit <b>18</b> (step S3 in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0083" num="0086">Then, the main pile supporting unit <b>18</b> is lifted again until the upper end of the replacement sheet pile is brought in contact with the lower side of the residual pile bars <b>38</b>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0087">This results in the residual pile bars <b>38</b> being engaged between the lower end of the sheet pile <b>14</b>, i.e. the residual sheet pile, and the upper end of the replacement sheet pile (step S4 in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0085" num="0088">Finally, the residual pile bars <b>38</b> are retracted from the sheet pile region <b>30</b> such that the residual sheet pile is supported on the replacement sheet pile. During this movement, the residual pile bars <b>38</b> oscillate along the direction of extension of the residual pile bars, i.e. along a direction parallel to axis H (step S5 and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0086" num="0089">The oscillations ensure that the static friction between the sheets in the residual sheet pile and in the replacement sheet pile, respectively, is higher than the dynamic friction of the retracting residual pile bars <b>38</b> and each of the two sheet piles, i.e. the residual sheet pile and the replacement sheet pile. Therefore, no sheet is dragged along with the residual pile bars <b>38</b>, allowing for non-stop operation of the sheet feeder <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0090">This is further ensured by the blocking element <b>32</b>, which blocks unwanted movements of sheets into the direction of the residual pile supporting unit <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0091">The blocking bars <b>34</b> are spaced apart of each other in such a way that they do not block the movement of the residual pile bars <b>38</b>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0092">Due to the fixation of the residual pile bars <b>38</b> on the supporting bar <b>42</b>, all residual pile bars <b>38</b> are retracted at the same time, with the same speed and/or with the same oscillations, resulting in an overall easy design of the residual pile supporting unit <b>24</b> and therefore of the sheet feeder <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0093">After the residual pile bars <b>38</b> are retracted, steps S1 to S5 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) can be repeated, preferably without interruption for continuous operation of the sheet feeder <b>10</b>.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
