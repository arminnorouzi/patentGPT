No. 16/382,696 filed Apr. 12, 2019, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application 62/657,057 filed Apr. 13, 2018, the disclosures of which were hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosed subject matter relates generally to systems and methods for stripping surfaces and more particularly to a HEPA-qualified coating removal system, coating removal tool, and method.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In, for example, building restoration/renovation/maintenance projects, effort must be made to minimize workers' personal exposure to, for example, lead and/or asbestos in an abatement work area as well as to minimize the amount of debris/dust disbursed into the air and on the containment area. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requirement for all renovations is that repairs or painting projects that disturb more than 6 square feet per room of interior painted surface or 20 square feet of exterior painted surface in a pre-1978 dwelling which require High-Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) vacuums to clean up the work areas and comply with the lead-safe work practices required when performing the work.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">When stripping, for example, doorjambs, window sills, and thresholds to bare wood, debris/dust is generated and there can be great potential of worker exposure to this debris/dust. The current work practice method approved by HUD/EPA/VT Department of Health is a &#x201c;wetting&#x201d; or &#x201c;misting&#x201d; process, in which the surface to be stripped is wetted or misted as it is being worked on. However, a drawback of this practice is that the wetting or misting process often destroys the wood fabric, which is not allowed, particularly when performing historic restorations. However, while the wetting or misting process is a proven effective way to minimize exposure to airborne debris/dust, if the surface is not wetted or misted constantly, especially during the actual scraping process, the dry failing coatings underneath the failing paint become airborne and very toxic. Further, the wetting or misting process is a messy process and does not allow immediate sealing or priming of the surface, as the surface is left wet and needs time to dry. Wetting and misting also cause the grain of wood to be lifted, requiring sanding of the lifted grains.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Scrapers or other coating removal tools exist today for performing surface restoration, wherein these scrapers or other coating removal tools may be used in combination with a HEPA-vacuum. However, these tools may have certain shortcomings. For example, the intake portion of these scrapers or other coating removal tools are not optimally sized and/or shaped to prevent clogging. Further, the blades of these tools are not designed to handle different kinds, shapes, and contours of surfaces to be restored. Therefore, new approaches are needed with respect to performing surface restorations/renovations safely and effectively.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The invention provides generally systems, devices, and methods for removing coatings from surface. In one embodiment, the invention provides a coating removal system including a coating removal tool having a scraper handle, a scraper head, and a blade, the scraper handle and the scraper head being integral, the scraper handle having an outlet, and the scraper head has an intake. The coating removal system also includes a vacuum, the coating removal tool connected to the vacuum by a vacuum line.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one example, the vacuum of the coating removal system is a HEPA-vacuum. In another example, the scraper handle and the scraper head are a single piece of a material, including without limitation plastic, aluminum, or other lightweight, rigid material that is adapted for molding.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another example, the outlet is adapted to receive the vacuum line, and wherein the intake is a side-facing opening with respect to the center longitudinal axis of the scraper handle.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The scraper head can have non-converging sides that form an intake with a wide-shaped opening Also, the intake may have a leading edge, a trailing edge, and two side edges, the edges being of similar lengths to form the wide-shaped opening. In yet another example, the leading edge is adapted to hold the blade.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In still another example, the blade has an upper edge, a lower edge, a first leading corner, and a second leading corner, and can be of varying width. The blade may be a flat, straight blade that is secured to the leading edge, such as by a stabilizer member and/or a fastener. In one example, the blade may be between the stabilizer member and the leading edge.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In yet another example, the two side edges of the intake are arch-shaped. In another example, the two side edges are squared off toward the upper edge of the blade.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In still another example, the first leading corner and the second leading corner of the blade are squared. Alternatively, the first leading corner and the second leading corner are rounded. In another alternative, one of the first leading corner and the second leading corner is rounded, and the other of the first leading corner and the second leading corner is squared.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another embodiment, the coating removal tool described above includes a scraper affixed to the scraper handle, the scraper including the blade and a handle portion, the handle portion being fastened to the scraper head such that the blade is positioned at the intake. In one example, the scraper head has a top portion that is flattened and includes a V-cut portion that is adapted to be fitted with the scraper.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In another embodiment, the coating removal tool includes a flexible, stretchable overmolded sleeve surrounding the coating removal tool.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In still another embodiment, the coating removal tool includes a hammerhead integrated into the scraper handle.

end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The presently disclosed subject matter now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying Drawings, in which some, but not all embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter are shown. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout. The presently disclosed subject matter may be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements. Indeed, many modifications and other embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter set forth herein will come to mind to one skilled in the art to which the presently disclosed subject matter pertains having the benefit of the teachings presented in the foregoing descriptions and the associated Drawings. Therefore, it is to be understood that the presently disclosed subject matter is not to be limited to the specific embodiments disclosed and that modifications and other embodiments are intended to be included within the scope of the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some embodiments, the presently disclosed subject matter provides a HEPA-qualified coating removal system, coating removal tool, and method. Namely, the HEPA-qualified coating removal system includes a HEPA-vacuum coupled to a coating removal tool, wherein the coating removal tool is a scraper device that is optimized for removing coatings from surfaces effectively. Examples of coatings include, but are not limited to, asbestos, any types of paint including lead-based paint, crystalline silica (in latex paint), polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs), mastics (i.e., construction adhesives), varnishes, and the like. Further, by coupling the scraper device to the HEPA-vacuum, the amount of airborne debris/dust generated during the scraping process is minimized.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some embodiments, the presently disclosed HEPA-qualified coating removal system and method that includes the coating removal tool coupled to the HEPA-vacuum provides a mechanism wherein the amount of airborne debris/dust generated during the coating removal process is held to within safe levels that ensure respiratory protection of the user.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some embodiments, the presently disclosed HEPA-qualified coating removal system and method that includes the coating removal tool coupled to the HEPA-vacuum provides a &#x201c;dry&#x201d; and &#x201c;clean&#x201d; surface restoration/renovation process, thereby avoiding damage to surfaces that conventional wetting/misting processes can cause and thereby allowing surfaces to be sealed or primed immediately upon completion of the coating removal process.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some embodiments, the coating removal tool of the presently disclosed HEPA-qualified coating removal system provides a scraper head wherein the walls of the scraper head remain substantially spaced apart to form a large-area intake orifice. Accordingly, the presently disclosed coating removal tool is optimized to avoid clogging while at the same time providing suitable suction force to adequately remove debris/dust resulting from the coating disturbance, thereby minimizing airborne particulates.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments, the coating removal tool of the presently disclosed HEPA-qualified coating removal system provides a scraper head that may include a set of different types of blades that can be switched in and out according to need.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some embodiments, the coating removal tool of the presently disclosed HEPA-qualified coating removal system provides a scraper head that may include a built-in hammerhead for the convenience of the user. Accordingly, the presently disclosed coating removal tool can be both a coating removal tool and a hammer tool.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some embodiments, the presently disclosed HEPA-qualified coating removal system and method that includes the coating removal tool coupled to the HEPA-vacuum reduces or entirely eliminates the need for sanding and can be used to &#x201c;feather/smooth&#x201d; out the transition from paint to wood. This feature is beneficial because sanding, unless controlled, can be an extremely high exposure activity and cause widespread contamination.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some embodiments, the presently disclosed HEPA-qualified coating removal system and method that includes the coating removal tool coupled to the HEPA-vacuum includes a hammerhead may be integrated into the body of the coating removal tool. In yet other embodiments, gripping features and/or anti-slip features may be integrated into the body of the coating removal tool. In still other embodiments, reinforcing members may be integrated into the body of the coating removal tool.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram of an example of the presently disclosed HEPA-qualified coating removal system <b>100</b> for the safe and effective removal of coatings from surfaces in, for example, building restoration/renovation projects. Namely, the presently disclosed HEPA-qualified coating removal system <b>100</b> can be used in a number of restoration/renovation applications. HEPA-qualified coating removal system <b>100</b> is especially well-suited for use in lead/asbestos abatement scenarios. However, HEPA-qualified coating removal system <b>100</b> is also well-suited for everyday use for removing any types of coatings on surfaces, such as wood or metal surfaces. Examples of coatings/materials that can be removed using HEPA-qualified coating removal system <b>100</b> include, but are not limited to, asbestos, any types of paint including lead-based paint, crystalline silica (in latex paint), PCBs, mastics (i.e., construction adhesives), varnishes, and the like.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">HEPA-qualified coating removal system <b>100</b> includes a coating removal tool <b>105</b> and a HEPA-vacuum <b>150</b>. A vacuum line <b>152</b> is connected between removal tool <b>105</b> and HEPA-vacuum <b>150</b>. In this way, suction force is supplied to coating removal tool <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">HEPA means high-efficiency particulate air. HEPA is a type of air filter. A HEPA filter must satisfy certain standards of efficiency, such as those set by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). To qualify as HEPA by U.S. government standards, an air filter must remove (from the air that passes through) 99.97% of particles that have a size of 0.3 &#x3bc;m. Accordingly, HEPA-vacuum <b>150</b> includes a HEPA filter (not shown). HEPA-vacuum <b>150</b> can be, for example, any commercially available HEPA vacuum. Examples of which include, but are not limited to, HEPA wet/dry vacuums available from Dustless&#xae; Technologies (Price, Utah), HEPA wet/dry vacuums available from Vacmaster (Greenville, S.C.), HEPA wet/dry vacuums available from Nilfisk Industrial Vacuums (Morgantown, Pa.), the Super CoachVac&#xae; HEPA vacuums available from ProTeam, Inc. (Boise, Id.), and the like.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Vacuum line <b>152</b> is, for example, a flexible, lightweight, rugged hose that is designed for toxic cleanup and not easily punctured. The length of vacuum line <b>152</b> can range from about 6 feet (1.83 m) to about 20 feet (6.1 m). In one example, the length of vacuum line <b>152</b> is about 8 feet (2.44 m). The inside diameter of vacuum line <b>152</b> can range from about 1.25 inches (3.17 cm) to about 2 inches (5.08 cm). In one example, the inside diameter of vacuum line <b>152</b> is about 1.5 inches (3.81 cm).</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Coating removal tool <b>105</b> is a scraper device that is optimized for removing coatings from surfaces effectively. Suction force is applied to coating removal tool <b>105</b> via HEPA-vacuum <b>150</b> so that as the coating is scraped and the suction force removes any debris/dust (e.g., debris/dust <b>154</b>) resulting from the coating disturbance, thereby ensuring that the amount of airborne particulates is at or below safe levels for respiratory protection. More details of examples of coating removal tool <b>105</b> are shown and described hereinbelow with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Examples of users of HEPA-qualified coating removal system <b>100</b> may include, but are not limited to, anyone who wishes to perform coating removal (particularly lead paint) in a safe manner for the person operating HEPA-qualified coating removal system <b>100</b> and for occupants of a building, and also anyone not wishing to disturb the integrity of a wood surface by wetting and misting, as HEPA-qualified coating removal system <b>100</b> provides a completely dry coating removal process. Other users of HEPA-qualified coating removal system <b>100</b> may include, but is not limited to, maintenance staffs of any entities, renovation/restoration contractors, painters, and homeowners.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective view of a coating removal tool <b>110</b>, which is one example of a coating removal tool for use in the HEPA-qualified coating removal system <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Namely, coating removal tool <b>110</b> is one example of the coating removal tool <b>105</b> of HEPA-qualified coating removal system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Also referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>, which is a side view, an outlet-end view, and a scraper-end view, respectively, of the coating removal tool <b>110</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>; and also referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, which is a top down view and bottom up view, respectively, of the coating removal tool <b>110</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The body of coating removal tool <b>110</b> is comprised of two main elements: a scraper handle <b>112</b> and a scraper head <b>114</b>, wherein scraper head <b>114</b> is arranged as shown with respect to one end of scraper handle <b>112</b>. Namely, scraper handle <b>112</b> and scraper head <b>114</b> are hollow members that are integral or integrated together in one piece. In one embodiment, the scraper handle <b>112</b> and the scraper head <b>114</b> are a single, monolithic piece. The body of coating removal tool <b>110</b> (i.e., scraper handle <b>112</b> and scraper head <b>114</b>) can be, for example, a single component formed of any lightweight, rigid, strong material, such as molded plastic or aluminum.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">An outlet <b>116</b> is provided at the end of scraper handle <b>112</b> opposite scraper head <b>114</b>. Outlet <b>116</b> of scraper handle <b>112</b> is sized and shaped to receive the end of vacuum line <b>152</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>). Scraper head <b>114</b> flares out from scraper handle <b>112</b> to an intake <b>118</b>, which is a side-facing opening in scraper head <b>114</b>. Namely, intake <b>118</b> is side-facing with respect to the center longitudinal axis (not shown) of scraper handle <b>112</b>. Accordingly, a flow path <b>130</b> exists within coating removal tool <b>110</b> running from intake <b>118</b> of scraper head <b>114</b> to outlet <b>116</b> of scraper handle <b>112</b>. Due to the suction force from HEPA-vacuum <b>150</b>, the direction of flow is from intake <b>118</b> of scraper head <b>114</b> to outlet <b>116</b> of scraper handle <b>112</b> (again see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In conventional vacuum-assisted scrapers, the walls of the scraper head converge to form a narrow small-area intake. By contrast, the presently disclosed coating removal tool <b>110</b> provides benefit over conventional vacuum-assisted scrapers because the walls of scraper head <b>114</b> do not converge. Rather, the walls remain substantially spaced apart to form a large-area intake <b>118</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Intake <b>118</b> of scraper head <b>114</b> has a leading edge <b>120</b> and two side edges <b>119</b>. Leading edge <b>120</b> is straight across and is designed to hold a blade <b>121</b>. Alignment features (not shown) may be built into leading edge <b>120</b> of intake <b>118</b> for positioning blade <b>121</b>. Blade <b>121</b> is, for example, a flat, straight, metal blade (e.g., stainless steel or carbide blade) having an upper and lower leading edge, in which both upper and lower leading edges are sharp. Blade <b>121</b> is a substantially flat blade. Blade <b>121</b> is a consumable component of coating removal tool <b>110</b> that can be reversed to use the second edge, and replaced when no longer sharp or when damaged. In one example, a stabilizer member <b>126</b> and a fastener <b>128</b> are used to secure blade <b>121</b> at leading edge <b>120</b> of intake <b>118</b>. Stabilizer member <b>126</b> can be a flat, straight, metal member, while fastener <b>128</b> can be a screw that is threaded into a screw receptacle in the wall of intake <b>118</b> or passes through the wall of intake <b>118</b> and is fastened with a nut (not shown). In one example, the blade <b>121</b> is between the stabilizer member <b>126</b> and the wall of the intake <b>118</b> when secured by a single fastener to the leading edge <b>120</b>. Different types of blades <b>121</b> can be provided with coating removal tool <b>110</b>. Examples of which are shown and described hereinbelow with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The two side edges <b>119</b> of intake <b>118</b> may be arch-shaped or have any other shape to further enlarge the opening of intake <b>118</b>. More examples of side edge <b>119</b> are shown and described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In some embodiments, a hammerhead <b>122</b> is integrated into scraper handle <b>112</b> of coating removal tool <b>110</b>. Hammerhead <b>122</b> can be used for hammering nail heads that may be protruding from the surface being prepared. Hammerhead <b>122</b> can be a metal plate that is shaped to correspond to the contour of scraper handle <b>112</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>). Hammerhead <b>122</b> can press-fitted into a cavity in the wall of scraper handle <b>112</b> or held in the cavity by any type of fastener or adhesive. In one embodiment, the hammerhead <b>122</b> is flush with the wall of scraper handle <b>112</b>. The plan view shape of hammerhead <b>122</b> can be, for example, circular, ovular, square, rectangular, and the like. Coating removal tool <b>110</b> with hammerhead <b>122</b> is one example in which the presently disclosed coating removal tool can be both a coating removal tool and a hammer tool for the convenience of the user.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In other embodiments, one or more gripping features <b>124</b>, such as ergonometric grooves, are integrated into scraper handle <b>112</b> of coating removal tool <b>110</b>. Gripping features <b>124</b> can be angled or straight across scraper handle <b>112</b>. Further, gripping features <b>124</b> can be tailored for right handed users vs. left handed users.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> is a cross-sectional view of coating removal tool <b>110</b> taken along line A-A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>. The walls of coating removal tool <b>110</b> have a thickness T. The thickness T can be uniform throughout the entirety of coating removal tool <b>110</b> or the thickness T can vary throughout coating removal tool <b>110</b>. The thickness T should be suitably large to withstand pressure that is applied to coating removal tool <b>110</b> when in use. Accordingly, the thickness T can range from about 0.125 inches (0.32 cm) to about 0.25 inches (0.64 cm). In one example, the thickness T is about 0.125 inches (0.32 cm) at intake <b>118</b> and tapers out to about 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) where hammerhead <b>122</b> is installed. Coating removal tool <b>110</b> has an overall length L. The length L can range from about 6 inches (15.24 cm) to about 8 inches (20.32 cm). In one example, the overall length L of coating removal tool <b>110</b> is about 8 inches (20.32 cm). Further, after slipping vacuum line <b>152</b> over the outlet <b>116</b> of coating removal tool <b>110</b>, the remaining visible portion of coating removal tool <b>110</b> can be, for example, about 6.5 inches (16.51 cm) long.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Outlet <b>116</b> of scraper handle <b>112</b> may be defined by a step in the cross-sectional profile of the walls of coating removal tool <b>110</b>. Outlet <b>116</b> has an outside diameter D and an inside diameter d. The outside diameter D of outlet <b>116</b> corresponds to the inside diameter of vacuum line <b>152</b>. Accordingly, the outside diameter D of outlet <b>116</b> can range from about 1.25 inches (3.17 cm) to about 2 inches (5.08 cm). In one example, the outside diameter D of outlet <b>116</b> is about 1.5 inches (3.81 cm) and the inside diameter d of outlet <b>116</b> is about 1.25 inches (3.17 cm).</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> is a cross-sectional view of coating removal tool <b>110</b> taken along line B-B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>.
