The fastening elements are formed as nails. In non-shown embodiments, the fastening elements are formed as e.g. bolts, pins, clips, cranks or screws. The working tool <b>1</b> comprises a driver (hidden in the Figs.) which is formed as e.g. a setting piston or screwdriver bit. Further, the working tool <b>1</b> comprises a housing <b>5</b> and, received in the housing <b>5</b>, a driving device (hidden in the Figs.) for driving the driver onto a fastening element to drive the fastening element into the workpiece <b>3</b>. The driving device comprises e.g. a gas- or powder-actuated combustion drive, an air-pressure drive, or a spring-, flywheel or electrodynamic driven electric drive having, in particular, an electric motor, a coil, and/or an electric battery <b>11</b>. The working tool <b>1</b> further comprises a grip <b>12</b> with a trigger (hidden in the Figs.) for manually triggering a setting, a scaffold hook <b>13</b> and a two- or three-leg support <b>14</b> provided for easier determination of an orientation of the axis <b>2</b> perpendicular to a surface of the workpiece <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Further, the fastening tool <b>1</b> comprises a tool nose <b>6</b> provided for contacting the workpiece <b>3</b> at the working point <b>4</b>. The tool nose <b>6</b> has a press-on element which is displaceable, with respect to the housing <b>5</b>, along the axis <b>2</b> away from the workpiece <b>3</b>. When the press-on element is pressed against the workpiece <b>3</b> along the axis <b>2</b>, the press-on element is displaceable up to a pressed-on position. If the press-on element is in the pressed-on position, it releases a driving-in operation of the working tool <b>1</b>. If the press-on element is out of the pressed-on position, the press-on element prevents a driving-in operation of the working tool <b>1</b>. The tool nose <b>6</b> comprises a guide channel <b>7</b> in which a fastening element is guided when driven into the workpiece <b>3</b>. In non-shown embodiments, the tool nose comprises a separate guide channel extending along the press-on element along the axis.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The workpiece <b>4</b> may be made of a metal, an alloy, concrete, wood, or the like, according to a specific application. The fastening elements are made of a metal, such as iron, or an alloy, such as steel. The fastening elements are fed collated to the guide channel <b>7</b>. To this end, the fastening tool comprises a magazine <b>8</b> opening out into the guide channel <b>7</b>. In non-shown embodiments, the fastening elements are automatically or manually fed one-by-one to the guide channel.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The working tool further comprises an indicator <b>8</b> fastened to the housing <b>5</b>. The indicator <b>8</b> indicates a reference line <b>9</b> on a surface of the workpiece <b>3</b> at a predetermined distance d to the working point <b>4</b> when the tool nose <b>6</b> contacts the workpiece <b>3</b> at the working point <b>4</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>. The reference line <b>9</b> is a circular arc having its center point at the working point <b>4</b>. Since the indicator <b>8</b> is slightly off-set with respect to the axis <b>2</b>, an optical axis of the indicator may be slightly inclined with respect to the axis <b>2</b>. In non-shown embodiments, the indicator indicates one or several single reference points on the surface of the workpiece, wherein each single reference point is located at the predetermined distance to the working point.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The indicator <b>8</b> comprises an adjusting element <b>10</b> provided for adjusting the predetermined distance d by a user of the tool. In the shown embodiment, the adjusting element <b>10</b> comprises an adjustment wheel which the user can turn manually. Any electrical energy used by the indicator <b>8</b> is provided by the battery <b>11</b>. In a non-shown embodiment, such electrical energy is provided by a separate battery arranged in the indicator or within the housing. A user of the working tool <b>1</b> may determine a working point by adjusting the predetermined distance to a desired distance of the working point to an object and placing the tool nose <b>6</b> on the workpiece <b>3</b> so as to coincide the reference point or line <b>9</b> with the object. Thus, a correct distance of the working point <b>4</b> to the object is ensured within a short time.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows an embodiment of an indicator <b>30</b> which may be used in the working tool shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>. The indicator <b>30</b> comprises a light source <b>31</b> and a projector <b>32</b> projecting a light beam <b>33</b> emitted by the light source <b>31</b> in form of a second ring-shaped light beam <b>481</b>, <b>482</b>, <b>483</b>, <b>484</b>, <b>485</b> onto a workpiece <b>34</b>, as described below. The light source <b>31</b> comprises a light emitting diode <b>35</b>. In a non-shown embodiment, the light source comprises a laser diode.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The projector <b>32</b> is arranged symmetrically about an axis <b>36</b> extending through a working point <b>40</b> on the workpiece <b>34</b>, and comprises a first axicon <b>37</b> having a first optical axis which coincides with the axis <b>36</b>. The first axicon <b>37</b> is laterally movable (at <b>42</b>) along the axis <b>36</b> and shown in five different axial positions <b>371</b>, <b>372</b>, <b>373</b>, <b>374</b>, <b>375</b>. The first axicon <b>37</b> is transparent, concave and turns the light beam <b>33</b> emitted by the light source <b>31</b> into a first ring-shaped light beam <b>381</b>, <b>382</b>, <b>383</b>, <b>384</b>, <b>385</b> having a propagation direction at a first ring angle <b>391</b> with respect to the first optical axis, i.e. axis <b>36</b> (shown only for light beam <b>381</b>). The first axicon <b>37</b> may be made of glass or plastic. In non-shown embodiments, a diffractive optical element may be used instead of the first axicon. In this respect, any diffractive optical element turning a light beam into a ring-shaped light beam may be used. Further, the projector <b>32</b> comprises a collimator <b>39</b> arranged between the light source <b>31</b> and the first axicon <b>37</b>. The collimator <b>39</b> collimates the light beam <b>33</b> emitted by the light source <b>31</b> onto the first axicon <b>37</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The projector <b>32</b> also comprises a second axicon <b>47</b> having a second optical axis which coincides with the axis <b>36</b>, and thus with the first optical axis of the first axicon <b>37</b>. The second axicon has five concave, ring-shaped, or frustoconical optical entry faces <b>480</b> which correspond to the five different axial positions <b>371</b>, <b>372</b>, <b>373</b>, <b>374</b>, <b>375</b> of the first axicon <b>37</b>, respectively (shown only for the axial position <b>371</b>). Further, the second axicon <b>47</b> has a concave, ring-shaped, or frustoconical optical exit face <b>49</b>. The second axicon <b>47</b> is thus concave and transparent, and turns the first ring-shaped light beam <b>381</b>, <b>382</b>, <b>383</b>, <b>384</b>, <b>385</b> emitted by the first axicon <b>37</b> into a second ring-shaped light beam <b>481</b>, <b>482</b>, <b>483</b>, <b>484</b>, <b>485</b>, respectively, having a propagation direction at a second ring angle <b>491</b> with respect to the second optical axis, i.e. axis <b>36</b> (shown only for light beam <b>481</b>).</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Since the second axicon <b>47</b> is concave, the second ring angle <b>491</b> is greater than the first ring angle <b>391</b>. Altogether, the projector <b>32</b> turns the light beam <b>33</b> emitted by the light source <b>31</b> into a circular-arc shaped reference line <b>404</b>, <b>405</b> (shown only for light beams <b>484</b>, <b>485</b>) on the workpiece <b>34</b>, having its center at the working point <b>40</b> and a radius <b>415</b> (shown only for reference line <b>405</b>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, such reference line may be shadowed by a working tool carrying the indicator <b>30</b>. In non-shown embodiments, the first optical axis and the second optical axis are slightly inclined with respect to a direction perpendicular to a surface of the workpiece. The first optical axis and the second optical axis may then be slightly off-set with respect to the working point.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Since the second axicon <b>47</b> is concave, a distance from the second optical axis at which the first ring-shaped light beam <b>381</b>, <b>382</b>, <b>383</b>, <b>384</b>, <b>385</b> enters the second axicon <b>47</b> determines the second ring angle <b>491</b> and thus a radius <b>415</b> of the circular reference line projected onto the workpiece <b>34</b>. Therefore, the radius of the circular reference line may be adjusted by controlling a distance between the first axicon <b>37</b> and the second axicon <b>47</b> along the second optical axis, i.e. axis <b>36</b>. To this end, the indicator <b>30</b> comprises an adjusting element (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) controlling a position of the first axicon <b>37</b> along the first optical axis, i.e. axis <b>36</b>.

Altogether, the projector <b>52</b> turns the light beam <b>53</b> emitted by the light source into a circular-arc shaped reference line <b>604</b>, <b>605</b> (shown only for light beams <b>684</b>, <b>685</b>) on the workpiece <b>54</b>, having its center at the working point <b>60</b> and a radius <b>615</b> (shown only for reference line <b>605</b>).

The indicator <b>70</b> comprises a light source <b>71</b> and a projector <b>72</b> projecting a light beam <b>73</b> emitted by the light source <b>71</b> in form of a second ring-shaped light beam <b>881</b> onto a non-shown workpiece, as described below. The projector <b>72</b> is arranged symmetrically about an axis <b>76</b> extending through a working point on the workpiece, and comprises a first axicon <b>77</b> having a first optical axis which coincides with the axis <b>76</b>. The first axicon <b>77</b> is convex, e.g. conical, and turns the light beam <b>73</b> by reflection into a first ring-shaped light beam <b>781</b> having a propagation direction at a first ring angle <b>791</b> with respect to the first optical axis, i.e. axis <b>56</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The projector <b>72</b> also comprises a second axicon <b>87</b> having a second optical axis which coincides with the axis <b>76</b>, and thus with the first optical axis of the first axicon <b>77</b>.

The second axicon <b>67</b> turns the first ring-shaped light beam <b>781</b> emitted by the first axicon <b>77</b> into a second ring-shaped light beam <b>881</b> having a propagation direction at a second ring angle <b>891</b> with respect to the second optical axis, i.e. axis <b>76</b>. The second ring angle <b>891</b> is smaller than the first ring angle <b>791</b>.

Therefore, the radius of the circular reference line may be adjusted by controlling a distance between the first axicon <b>77</b> and the second axicon <b>87</b> along the second optical axis, i.e. axis <b>76</b>.
