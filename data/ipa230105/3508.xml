The disclosure also relates to a method and a device for producing a film. The methods find particular application in the production of microfibrillated cellulose films.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Microfibrillated cellulose (&#x201c;MFC&#x201d;), or &#x201c;nanocellulose&#x201d; is a material that consists of cellulose microfibrils that can be separated from cellulose fiber walls.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Nanocellulose comprises partly or totally fibrillated cellulose or lignocellulose fibers. The liberated fibrils have a diameter less than 1000 nm, whereas the actual fibril diameter or particle size distribution and/or aspect ratio (length/width) depends on the source and the manufacturing methods. The smallest fibril is called elementary fibril and may have a diameter of approximately 2-4 nm, while it is common that the aggregated form of the elementary fibrils, also defined as microfibril, is the main product that is obtained when making MFC e.g. by using an extended refining process or pressure-drop disintegration process. Depending on the source and the manufacturing process, the length of the fibrils can vary from around 1 to more than 10 micrometers. A coarse nanocellulose grade might contain a substantial fraction of fibrillated fibers, i.e. protruding fibrils from the tracheid (cellulose fiber), and with a certain amount of fibrils liberated from the tracheid (cellulose fiber).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Nanocellulose can also be characterized by various physical or physical-chemical properties such as its large surface area or its ability to form a gel-like material at low solids (1-5 wt %) when dispersed in water. The cellulose fiber is preferably fibrillated to such an extent that the final specific surface area of the formed nanocellulose is from about 1 to about 500 m<sup>2</sup>/g, such as from about 1 to about 200 m<sup>2</sup>/g, or more preferably 50-200 m<sup>2</sup>/g when determined for a solvent exchanged and freeze-dried material with the BET method.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Various methods exist to make nanocellulose, such as single or multiple pass refining, pre-hydrolysis or enzymatic treatment followed by refining or high shear disintegration or liberation of fibrils. Nanocellulose can be produced from wood cellulose fibers, both from hardwood and softwood fibers. It can also be made from microbial sources, agricultural fibers such as wheat straw pulp, bamboo, bagasse, or other non-wood fiber sources. It is preferably made from pulp including pulp from virgin fiber, e.g. mechanical, chemical and/or thermomechanical pulps. It can also be made from broke or recycled paper. The term nanocellulose includes parenchymal nanocellulose and BNC (bacterial nanocellulose). Nanocellulose can also be obtained from vegetable fibers, e.g. sugar beet or potato based nanocellulose.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The above described definition of nanocellulose includes, but is not limited to, the definition of nanocellulose in the ISO/TS 20477:2017 standard.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">There are further synonyms for nanocellulose/MFC such as cellulose microfibrils, fibrillated cellulose, nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC), fibril aggregates, nanoscale cellulose fibrils, cellulose nanofibers, cellulose nanofibrils, nanocrystalline cellulose, cellulose microfibers, cellulose fibrils, cellulose nanofilaments, microfibrillar cellulose, microfibril aggregrates and cellulose microfibril aggregates.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Current research indicates that MFC may be a suitable material for packaging and coating of packaging, due to its strength and barrier properties. Hence, MFC has the potential of replacing or supplementing currently used barrier films, including polymer and metal films.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Forming of MFC films can be achieved by solvent casting of a viscous or gel-like fluid material on a continuous conveyor belt, followed by dewatering/drying (e.g. evaporation) of the solvent.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The term &#x201c;solvent casting&#x201d; is a known term designating methods wherein a film is produced by applying a wet film comprising a film forming component which is distributed in a medium that is to be essentially removed, for example by dewatering and/or evaporation. The film forming component may be dispersed in a dispersing medium or dissolved in a solvent, hence the term &#x201c;solvent casting&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, in order to achieve uniform properties of the film, and to achieve a film with appealing visual properties, it is important to control the film thickness with high accuracy, and to be able to quickly adjust the film thickness, should a deviation appear.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Prior art methods of determining MFC film thickness are limited in that they require the film to be separated from the substrate, or in that they require the substrate, onto which the film is being cast, to be transparent, which is not the case when casting the film onto a solid steel belt.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">For example, one method that is used to measure thickness of continuous cast or extruded films, papers and coatings relies on absorption of radiation in the web that passes between the traversing measurement gauges. The problem with such a system is that it cannot be used for MFC film on a solid steel belt. Hence, such systems are used on films and webs after detachment from the casting or forming substrate, which would be problematic with an MFC film as an MFC film cannot be separated from the substrate until it is essentially dry. Moreover, open draws of unsupported film can be detrimental for product quality.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Another disadvantage of the method described above relates to process control: when the thickness measurement is used for control of the casting process, the delay time between casting point and state of film is a disadvantage. Furthermore, traversing measurement only gives periodical information from each position in cross-machine direction, in which case it does not capture all process variations.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Hence, there is a need for an improved method of determining and controlling film thickness.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">It is a general object of the present disclosure to provide an improved method and device for determining thickness of a wet film, which may be of nanocellulose, or of other cellulose film. In particular, it is an object to provide a method and a device which enable more accurate monitoring of film thickness and optionally of film damage.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The invention is defined by the appended independent claims, with embodiments being set forth in the dependent claims, in the following description an in the attached drawings.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to a first aspect, there is provided a method of determining thickness of a wet film. The method comprises conveying said film in a wet state on a conveyor having a conveyor width, the wet film having a wet film width which is less than the conveyor width, providing a laser projection across the conveyor, the laser projection extending across a wet film edge, acquiring a series of images, each depicting an area of the conveyor, wherein the laser projection, a portion of the wet film and a portion of an exposed conveyor surface are visible, and using at least some of said images to determine at least one of a wet film thickness and a wet film thickness distribution across the wet film width.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The method allows to follow and adjust film thickness and casting profile in real time. Optionally, a film section may be delivered together with thickness and/or profile data.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The method is useful for a wet film having a thickness of 10-10000 micron, preferably 10-5000 micron, 10-1000 micron, 50-10000 micron, 50-5000 micron, 50-1500 micron, 50-1000 micron or 50-500 micron.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The method is useful for a wet film having a light transmission in the wavelength of the laser of less than 80%, preferably less than 70*%.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The method is particularly suitable for determining continuous thickness variations, i.e. thickness variations that extend continuously along the direction of travel of the conveyor.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the context of the present application, a wet film is a film having a solids content of less than 50% by weight, preferably of 1-50% by weight, 3-50% by weight, 3-20% by weight, 3-15% by weight or 3-6% by weight.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The wet film is applied as a continuous layer across a substantial part of a width of the conveyor and along the direction of movement of the conveyor.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">It is possible to apply one or more pre-drying steps or dewatering steps upstream of an area where the images are captured.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">For example, a pre-drying step may comprise forced evaporation, which may be achieved by e.g. radiation in the form of IR and/or microwaves to reach certain a desired solids content.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As another example, a dewatering step may be applied, e.g press dewatering or dewatering by capillary effect through a porous substrate, driven by gravity or assisted by vacuum.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Dewatering and/or the subsequent drying may also be assisted by impingement of radiation (IR, microwave), steam or hot air.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The laser projection may be a line or any predetermined pattern.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">For example, the laser projection may extend over a width which is greater than the wet film width.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The wet film comprises a film forming component, which is distributed in a medium that is to be essentially removed by a separation method, such as dewatering and/or evaporation, to arrive at a dry film. In the context of the present application, a dry film is a film having a medium content of 0.1-15% by weight.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The film forming component may be dispersed in a dispersing medium, whereby the dispersing medium is to be essentially removed. Alternatively, the film forming component may be dissolved in a solvent, whereby the solvent is to be essentially removed. In any event, the medium is in a liquid stage when the casting takes place.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The film forming component may comprise MFC and one or more property-modifying additives and/or fillers. Preferably, the film forming component comprises at least 50% by weight of MFC, preferably at least 60%, at least 70% or at least 80% MFC. For example, the film forming component may also comprise other natural fibre material in addition to the MFC.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The film forming component optionally also comprises a water soluble polymer that can form a film and/or improve bonding between cellulose fibrils. Typical example of such polymers are e.g. natural gums or polysaccharides or derivatives thereof such as e.g. CMC, starch.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The film may comprise a film forming component, which is distributed in a medium that is to be essentially removed, wherein a content of the medium of the wet film, at the point of image capture, is at least 75% by weight, preferably more than 80% by weight, more than 85% by weight, more than 90% by weight, or more than 95% by weight.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The film may be a cellulose based film, in particular a microfibrillated cellulose (&#x201c;MFC&#x201d;) film.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The MFC may be unmodified MFC or chemically modified MFC, or a mixture thereof. Unmodified MFC refers to MFC made of unmodified or native cellulose fibers.
