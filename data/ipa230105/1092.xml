Such devices include, for example, traditional hypodermic needle syringes that contain a stock of medicament therein. Upon insertion of the needle under the patient's skin at an injection location, the medicament is forced out of the syringe and through the needle by depression of a plunger mechanism.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Injection devices also include needle-free injectors, some of which are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,599,302 5,062,830; and 4,790,824; and needle-assisted. injectors, such as those described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2005/0033234. These jet injectors administer medicaments as a fine, high velocity jet delivered under sufficient pressure to enable the jet to pass through the skin, or for improved dispersion of the injected medicament. Self-injectors car autoinjectors like the ones disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,553,962 and 4,378,015, and PCT Publications WO 95/29720 and WO 97/14455 are constructed to inject medicament at a rate and in a manner similar to hand-operated hypodermic syringes.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">These injectors often are made for a single use, or alternatively to be refilled after each injection. Some refillable injectors can be refilled with a desired dosage to be injected. Upon injection, the entire loaded dosage is injected.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An injector is needed that can deliver a medicament into a patient in an adjustable dose that is equal to or less than the full amount contained in the injector.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The invention is related to an injector. A preferred embodiment of the injector includes a container comprising a fluid chamber containing a first volume of a medicament, and an injection conduit associated with the fluid chamber for defining a fluid pathway therefrom to inject the medicament from the fluid chamber through the injection conduit to an injection location, The injector also includes a firing mechanism associated with the fluid chamber for expelling the medicament from the fluid chamber through the injection conduit, and a volume-control mechanism operable to control a fraction of the first volume of medicament that is injected when the firing mechanism is actuated to inject the medicament,</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Preferably, the volume-control mechanism is used to select a second volume, which is a portion or fraction of the first volume. The volume-control mechanism preferably includes a threaded ram that is biased by an energy source against a plunger and configured for rotating about a longitudinal axis of the injector. The volume-control mechanism also preferably includes a stopping member in threaded association with the ram and including at least one lateral member disposed within a track that extends longitudinally along a portion of the housing of the injector and is slidable therein. Preferably, the stopping member includes a pair of opposing lateral members, each disposed in separate opposing tracks, The lateral member prevents rotation of the stopping member about the longitudinal axis with the ram when the rani is rotated thereabout. The stopping member is configured for limiting movement of the ram along the longitudinal axis, the position of the stopping member being adjustable along the longitudinal axis with respect to the ram. The volume-control mechanism also includes a cap associated, and preferably removeably engageable, with the rain and configured for rotating the ram about the longitudinal axis to select an injection volume such that when the ram is rotated, the position of the stopping member is adjusted along the longitudinal axis with respect to the ram. Upon actuation of the energy source, which is preferably a spring, biasing of the ram against the plunger is preferably limited when the lateral member abuts the distal end of the track.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one embodiment, the housing includes a transparent window adjacent the length of the track such that the longitudinal position of the stopping member within the injector is visible through the window. Preferably, the transparent window includes indicia corresponding to the position of the stopping member and the selected injection volume.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Preferably, the injector also includes a bearing member, such as an annular bushing or other bearing, disposed between the energy source and the ram, and configured for preventing or substantially reducing friction therebetween when the ram is rotated. The injector is preferably configured for single-use injection of medicament therefrom. Alternatively, the injector is configured for multiple injections of medicament therefrom.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the preferred embodiment, the container is a prefilled syringe, and further includes an injection-assisting needle disposed in fluid communication with the fluid chamber, the needle having an injecting tip configured for piercing the patient's skin at the injection location. The housing houses the prefilled syringe and is configured for allowing insertion of the needle at the injection location to an insertion point that is at a penetration depth below the patient's skin. The injector preferably includes a syringe support supportively mounting the prefilled syringe to the housing. In other embodiments, the container is a needle-free cartridge, or a cartridge comprising an injection-assisting needle associated therewith.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the preferred embodiment, the housing includes a retractable guard that is movable between a protecting position, in which the injection conduit is disposed within the guard, and an injecting position, in which the tip of the injection conduit is exposed for injection of the medicament at the injection location. A trigger mechanism is preferably operably associated with the energy source for actuation of the energy source to inject the medicament. Preferably, the trigger mechanism is configured for actuation of the energy source after the retractable guard is retracted from the protecting position. The retractable guard is preferably operably associated with the trigger mechanism to cause the trigger mechanism to activate the energy source when the guard is retracted to the injecting position.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention thus provides an injector that enables a user to control or adjust the dose of medicament that is intended to be delivered to the patient.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of a preferred embodiment of an injector constructed according to the present invention, showing the injector prior to injection;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view thereof, taken from a viewing perspective that is rotated 90&#xb0; about the longitudinal axis of the injector from the perspective of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>; and</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a perspective view of another embodiment of an injector.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a preferred embodiment of an injector <b>10</b> has an outer housing <b>12</b> defined between a proximal end <b>6</b> and a distal end <b>8</b>, and configured for allowing a user, typically the patient him or herself, to handle the injector <b>10</b> and position the injector near or adjacent an injection location. The outer housing <b>12</b> preferably houses most of the components of the injector <b>10</b>. The injector <b>10</b> also includes a cover member <b>14</b> configured to associate with the outer housing <b>12</b> and cover the distal end of the injector <b>10</b> prior to use. A container support member <b>16</b> is housed within and mounted with the housing <b>12</b>. The container support member <b>16</b> is configured to hold and position a container <b>18</b> within the injector <b>10</b>. The container <b>18</b> can be, for example, a cartridge, syringe, or any other suitable container for holding medicament therein. In the preferred embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the container is a prefilled syringe <b>18</b>. Alternatively, instead of a prefilled syringe attached to a needle, the syringe can have a separate needle that is associated and brought into fluid communication with the medicament container prior to or upon firing of the injector. In the preferred embodiment, the container support member <b>16</b> is substantially fixed to the outer housing <b>12</b>, such as by snaps, an adhesive, a weld, or another known attachment. The container <b>18</b> has a container portion <b>20</b> that defines in its interior a fluid chamber <b>22</b>, which is preferably prefilled with medicament to be injected. In another embodiment, however, this chamber can initially be provided empty.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">At the distal end of the container <b>18</b> is an injection-assisting needle <b>24</b>, which is in fluid communication with an injection port <b>25</b> of the fluid chamber <b>22</b>. Needle <b>24</b> has an injecting tip <b>26</b> configured as known in the art to penetrate the tissue of a patient, preferably the skin, at the injection location. A needle bore extends through the needle <b>24</b>, as known in the art. The bore is in fluid communication with the injection port <b>25</b> and the medicament in the fluid chamber <b>22</b>, and is open at the needle tip <b>26</b> to inject the medicament.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In needle-free injector embodiments, the container does not include a needle and the injection port, of the fluid chamber preferably defines a fluid pathway in fluid communication with the fluid chamber for injecting medicament as a jet from the chamber through the port to the injection location. An example of a suitable needle-free jet nozzle arrangement is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,309,371.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">At a proximal side of the fluid chamber <b>22</b>, opposite from the needle <b>24</b>, is a plunger <b>28</b> that preferably seals the medicament in the fluid chamber <b>22</b>. A container wall <b>30</b> preferably comprises a tubular portion, preferably closed at a distal end and open at a proximal end, to define the fluid chamber <b>22</b>. Plunger <b>28</b> is slideably received in the tubular portion. The container <b>18</b> is configured such that when the plunger <b>28</b> is displaced in a distal direction, the volume of the fluid chamber <b>22</b> is decreased, forcing the medicament out therefrom and through the injection port <b>25</b> and the bore of needle <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">At the distal end of the fluid chamber <b>22</b> is a needle hub portion <b>32</b> to which the needle is mounted. A container flange <b>34</b> extends radially, preferably from the proximal end of the container wall <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the preferred embodiment, the container <b>18</b> has a container body <b>36</b> that includes the flange <b>34</b>, wall <b>30</b>, and hub portion <b>32</b> of unitary construction. A preferred material for the container body <b>36</b> is glass, but other materials can be used in other embodiments, For example, a suitable prefilled syringe is the BD Hypak&#x2122;, which is available in various sizes and volumes and is sold prefilled with medicament. The glass of the syringe body is adhered to the needle. Typical medicaments and medicament categories include epinephrine, atropine, sumatriptan, antibiotics, antidepressants, and anticoagulants.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some embodiments, the injector includes a container cushion configured for providing additional support to the container within the housing, such as disclosed in International Application No. PCT/US2006/0002429, now WO 2006/079064, The container cushion <b>38</b> is preferably made of an elastomeric material or other resilient material. A flange of the container cushion <b>38</b> extends radially and is disposed and serves as an interface between the distal side of the container support member <b>16</b> and the container flange <b>34</b>. Elevated portions, such as nubs, preferably extend proximately from the cushion flange and are configured and dimensioned to abut the container flange <b>34</b>. A sleeve portion of the container cushion <b>38</b> extends axially around the interior of the container support <b>16</b>. The container cushion <b>38</b> is preferably received in the interior of the container support <b>16</b> and receives the container body <b>36</b>, preferably fitting snugly therein.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, trigger mechanism <b>52</b> is preferably also housed within outer housing <b>12</b>. The trigger mechanism <b>52</b> includes an inner member, such as an inner housing <b>54</b>, that can be attached to the outer housing <b>12</b>, such as by snaps, an adhesive, a weld, or other known attachment. Trigger protrusions <b>56</b> extend inwardly from the proximal end of the inner housing <b>54</b> and are normally resiliently biased outwardly. Trigger protrusions <b>56</b> are received in a recess <b>58</b> of firing ram <b>60</b> in blocking association therewith. The trigger protrusions <b>56</b> prevent distal movement of the ram <b>60</b> prior to the firing of the injector <b>10</b> upon actuation of the trigger mechanism <b>52</b>. The ram <b>60</b> is urged towards the distal end of the injector <b>10</b> by an energy source, which preferably is a compression spring <b>62</b>, although other suitable energy sources can alternative be used such as elastomer or compressed-gas springs, or gas generators. A preferred type of compression spring is a coil spring.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">A trigger member of the trigger mechanism <b>52</b>, such as a latch housing <b>64</b>, is provided exterior to the inner housing <b>54</b> to retain the trigger protrusions <b>56</b> in the blocking association in the recess <b>58</b> to prevent premature firing of the injector <b>10</b>. The latch housing <b>64</b> is slideable inside the outer housing <b>12</b> with respect to the inner housing <b>54</b>. preferably in an axial direction, and the latch housing <b>64</b> preferably surrounds the inner housing <b>54</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The distal end of the outer housing <b>12</b> preferably includes a needle guard <b>66</b> that is moveable with respect to the outer housing <b>12</b>. The needle guard <b>66</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> in a protecting position, in which the needle <b>24</b> is disposed within the guard <b>66</b>. The needle guard <b>66</b> is retractable, preferably into the outer housing <b>12</b>, in a proximal direction to an injecting position, in which the needle tip <b>26</b> and an end portion of the needle <b>24</b> is exposed for insertion into a patient. In the preferred embodiment, the proximal movement of the guard is substantially prevented at the injecting position. In embodiments where the container does not include a needle, the injection port and the distal end of the fluid chamber can he exposed upon retraction of the needle guard to the injecting position.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The needle guard <b>66</b> is associated with the latch housing <b>64</b> such that when the guard <b>66</b> is displaced distally it slides the latch housing <b>64</b> also in a distal direction to release the trigger protrusions <b>56</b> from the recess <b>58</b>. Preferably, the latch housing <b>64</b> has a latching portion that abuts the inner housing <b>54</b> in an association to bias and maintain the trigger protrusions <b>56</b> positioned in the blocking association with the ram <b>60</b> prior to the firing of the injector <b>10</b>, When the latch housing <b>64</b> is slid proximately by the retracting of the guard <b>66</b> to the injecting position, the latching portion slides beyond the portion of inner housing <b>54</b> that it contacts, allowing the trigger protrusions <b>56</b> to move radially outwardly from the recess <b>58</b> and therefore from the blocking association. When this happens, i.e., when the trigger mechanism <b>52</b> is actuated, the spring <b>62</b> biases the ram <b>60</b> against plunger <b>28</b> to fire the injector <b>10</b>. Latch housing <b>64</b> preferably defines trigger openings <b>70</b> adjacent to the latching portions, which are configured to receive a portion of the inner housing <b>54</b>, such as the surface disposed radially outwardly from the trigger protrusions <b>56</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The guard <b>66</b> is preferably resiliently biased distally towards the protecting position by compression coil spring <b>72</b>. or other biasing member. Also, the needle guard <b>66</b> has an axial opening <b>74</b> to allow the needle <b>24</b> pass therethrough, and which may be sized according to the type of injector desired. In embodiments of the injector that do not include a needle, the axial opening can be sized to allow the distal end of the fluid chamber and injection port to pass therethrough. The construction of the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> allows a user to push the distal end of the injector <b>10</b> against the patient's skin, pushing the needle <b>24</b> into the skin at an injection location, substantially at the same speed as the injector is pushed. Once the needle <b>24</b> is fully inserted to an insertion point at a penetration depth, the trigger mechanism <b>52</b> fires the injection of medicament into an injection location.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Other embodiments can incorporate alternative trigger mechanisms for actuating firing of the injector. For example, the injector can include a button or other suitable depressible member on the outer housing that, upon depression thereof actuates firing of the injector.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Preferably, the injecting position of the guard <b>66</b> is such that a predetermined length of the end of needle <b>24</b> is exposed from the guard <b>66</b>, In some embodiments, such as where the opening <b>74</b> is of a sufficiently large diameter, the skin of the patient maybe allowed to extend into the opening <b>74</b> when the device <b>10</b> is pressed there against, and a needle or injection port that does not protrude beyond the distal end of the guard <b>66</b> can he used. Some embodiments have a guard with a distal, skin-contacting surface that is discontinuous. In most embodiments where the injector includes a needle, the distance by which the needle tip extends past the distal end of the guard will be fairly close to the depth of the insertion of the needle.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the preferred embodiment, such as for subcutaneous injection, the guard <b>66</b> is configured to allow insertion of the needle to a penetration depth in the skin that is up to about 5 mm below the skin surface, More preferably, the penetration depth is less than about 4 mm, and in one embodiment is less than about 3 mm. Preferably, the insertion depth is at least about 0.5 mm and more preferably at least about 1 mm. In another embodiment, the distance by which the needle. extends past the guard <b>66</b> or the distal surface. of the guard <b>66</b> that contacts the skin is up to about 5 mm, more preferably up to about 4 mm, and in one embodiment up to about 3 mm. Preferably, extension distance is at least about 0.5 mm, more preferably at least about 1 mm, and most preferably at least about 2 mm. In a preferred embodiment, tip <b>26</b> extends by a distance of around 2.5 mm beyond the portion of the guard <b>66</b> that contacts the skin in the injecting position.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In another embodiment, such as for intramuscular injection, the injector is configured to allow the needle to be inserted into the patient to a penetration depth in the skin, or alternatively beyond the distal surface of the guard, by a distance of up to about 15 mm. In one embodiment, this distance is about between 10 mm and 14 mm. In an embodiment for jet injection of epinephrine for instance, a preferred penetration depth or distance beyond the guard is between about 12 mm and 13.5 mm, and most preferably around 12.7 mm. Jet injection with this length needle improves the distribution of the medicament in the patient tissue compared to non-jet injection. Other exposed needle lengths can be selected for jet injection to different depths below the skin, with a preferred overall penetration length of between about 0.5 nun and about 20 mm. In these embodiments, the needle guard is preferably configured for retracting from a protecting position, preferably covering the entire needle, to an injecting position, in which the desired length of the end of the needle is exposed. In alternative embodiments, the needle tip stops behind or proximal to the guard, and penetrates the skin that is pushed into the guard.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments, the energy source, which is preferably spring <b>62</b>, and the container, which is preferably prefilled syringe <b>18</b>, are configured to jet inject the medicament into the patient to an injection site. The spring <b>62</b> applies a force on the plunger <b>28</b> that is preferably sufficient to elevate the pressure within the fluid chamber <b>22</b> to a level high enough to eject the medicament from the needle <b>24</b> as a jet. Jet injection is to be understood as an injection with sufficient velocity and force to drive the medicament to locations remote from the needle tip <b>26</b> or injection port <b>25</b>. The jet injector embodiments deliver a jet injection, the medicament is jet injected distally or in other directions, such as generally radially by the elevated pressure jet, which beneficially improves the distribution of the medicament after the injection and keeps a large bolus from forming that can detrimentally force the medicament to leak back out of the patient around the needle or through the hole left behind by the needle after it is removed. In alternative autoinjector embodiments that use needles, the injection pressures are relatively very low, and the medicament exits the needle tip inside the patient and is typically deposited locally around the needle in a bolus.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Preferably, in embodiments where needles are used, the needles are between <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> gage, and are most preferably around <b>27</b> gage, but alternatively other needle gages can be used where the other components are cooperatively configured to produce the desired injection. Preferably, the components of the injector <b>10</b> are configured to jet inject the medicament to a subterraneous injection site.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Preferred injection rates are below about 0.75 mL/sec., more preferably below about 0.6 mL/sec., and preferably at least about 0.2 mL/sec., more preferably at least about 0.3 mL/sec, and most preferably at least about 0.4 mL/sec. Preferably, the injection of the entire amount of medicament is completed in less than about 4 seconds, more preferably in less than about 3 seconds, and most preferably in less than about 2.5 seconds. Preferably, the medicament injection takes at least about 1 second, and more preferably at least 1.5 seconds, and most preferably at least about 1.75 seconds. A preferred embodiment injects the medicament at about 0.5 mL/sec., completing the injection of 1 mL, in about 2 seconds. Other alternative injection rates, injection volumes, and injections times can also be used.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The entire amount of medicament contained and injected from fluid chamber of the container is preferably between about 0.02 mL and 4 mL, and preferably less than about 3 mL, and in the preferred embodiment is around 1 mL. Larger volumes may also be selected depending on the particular medicament and dosage required. Preferably, the container <b>18</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is assembled into the remaining parts of the injector <b>10</b> already containing the desired amount of medicament, In a preferred embodiment, the container <b>18</b> contains about <b>1</b> mL of medicament.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in the preferred embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the injector <b>10</b> includes a volume-control mechanism <b>90</b> configured to select the fraction of medicament in the fluid chamber <b>22</b> that is to be injected, or correspondingly the dosage volume to be injected. The volume-control mechanism of this embodiment includes the rani <b>60</b>, a cap <b>82</b>, and a stopping member <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The ram <b>60</b>, as previously described, preferably has a threaded portion <b>61</b> and is configured for rotating about its longitudinal axis <b>110</b> to permit the option of injecting less than all of the medicament. Stopping member <b>100</b> preferably includes a body portion <b>102</b>, which can he configured as an internally threaded nut, and at least one lateral wing, and preferably two lateral wings <b>104</b> extending laterally, and preferably on opposing sides of the body portion <b>102</b>. The body portion <b>102</b> is preferably in threaded association with the ram <b>60</b> and is longitudinally moveable there along. Each of the lateral wings <b>104</b> is preferably disposed and slideable within respective tracks <b>106</b> that extend longitudinally. Tracks <b>106</b> are preferably associated with or are defined in the outer housing <b>12</b>, and are positioned in the embodiment shown on opposite lateral sides of the outer housing <b>12</b>. Each of the tracks <b>106</b> preferably has a proximal end <b>107</b> and a distal end <b>108</b>, which define a track length therebetween. Upon rotation of the ram <b>60</b>. tracks <b>106</b> prevent rotation of the lateral wings <b>104</b> about the longitudinal axis <b>110</b>. Consequently, the position of the body portion <b>102</b> moves or is adjusted proximally or distally longitudinally along the threaded portion <b>61</b> of the ram <b>60</b>, the lateral wings <b>104</b> sliding in the tracks <b>106</b> therewith, In the preferred embodiment, the distal end <b>108</b> of the track <b>106</b> acts as a blocking member and prevents distal movement of the stopping member <b>100</b>, and enlarged portion <b>101</b> of the ram <b>60</b> prevents proximal movement thereof, but other structures can alternatively be used for this purpose.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">By rotating the ram <b>60</b>, the stopping member <b>100</b> is positioned to limit the throw of the ram <b>60</b> when the injector <b>10</b> is fired, allowing the selection of volume of medicament to be injected from the fluid chamber <b>22</b>. Upon actuation of the spring <b>62</b> by the trigger mechanism <b>52</b>., the ram <b>60</b> is biased distally against the plunger <b>28</b>, thus displacing plunger <b>28</b> in a distal direction to force medicament out of the fluid chamber <b>22</b>. Movement of the rain <b>60</b> distally against the plunger <b>28</b>, and thus the volume of medicament that is injected from the fluid chamber <b>22</b> (i.e., the injection volume), is limited by the lateral wings <b>104</b> of the stopping member <b>100</b>. For example, the ram <b>60</b> can only move distally upon actuation of the spring <b>62</b> until the lateral wings <b>104</b> are stopped by the distal ends <b>108</b> of the tracks <b>106</b>. At that point, further movement of the ram <b>60</b> in the distal direction is prevented. The position of the stopping member <b>100</b> along the ram <b>60</b> thus effectively controls the injection volume of medicament injected from the fluid chamber <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The operable member for rotating the ram <b>60</b> about the longitudinal axis <b>110</b> to adjust the longitudinal position of the stopping member <b>100</b> is preferably cap <b>82</b> that is preferably removeably engageable with the ram <b>60</b>. The cap <b>82</b> preferably includes an engagement portion <b>83</b> configured for mating receipt within a receiving portion <b>84</b> of the ram <b>60</b>. In this configuration, twisting or rotation of the cap <b>82</b> while the engagement portion <b>83</b> is received in the receiving portion <b>84</b> results in rotation of the ram <b>60</b> about the longitudinal axis <b>110</b>. By manipulating the cap <b>82</b>, the position of the stopping member <b>100</b> can be adjusted proximately or distally along the ram <b>60</b> to select the fraction of medicament that is desired to be injected from the fluid chamber <b>22</b>. The engagement and receiving portions <b>83</b>,<b>84</b> are preferably non-circular to prevent or restrict axial rotation therebetween.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the preferred embodiment, for example, the length of the tracks <b>106</b> is substantially equal to the length between the distal end <b>109</b> of the fluid chamber <b>22</b> and the distal end of the plunger <b>28</b>. Thus, when cap <b>82</b> is twisted to position the stopping member <b>100</b> in its most proximal position along the ram <b>60</b> with the lateral wings <b>104</b> disposed against the proximal ends <b>107</b> of the tracks <b>106</b>), actuation of the spring <b>62</b> causes the ram <b>60</b> to move distally against the plunger <b>28</b> as the lateral wings <b>104</b> slide along the entire length of the track <b>106</b> before abutting the distal ends <b>108</b> of the tracks, and the plunger <b>28</b> correspondingly is moved distally through the fluid chamber <b>22</b> to the distal end <b>109</b> thereof, injecting the entire volume of medicament therefrom.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">If the cap <b>82</b> is twisted to position the stopping member <b>100</b> more distally along the cava <b>60</b>, then the injection volume will only be a fraction of the entire volume of medicament in the fluid chamber <b>22</b> because upon actuation, the lateral wings <b>104</b> will slide along the tracks <b>106</b> and abut the distal ends <b>108</b> thereof to prevent the ram <b>60</b> from biasing the plunger <b>28</b> completely to the distal end <b>109</b> of the fluid chamber <b>22</b>. As such, the entire volume of the medicament in the fluid chamber <b>22</b> is not injected. One of ordinary skill in the art would understand that the cap <b>82</b> can be twisted to adjust the position of the stopping member <b>100</b> relative to the ram <b>60</b> to select the appropriate injection volume of medicament that is desired to he injected.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Alternative embodiments can he provided with different throw and adjustment ranges to limit the range of adjustability to less than from 100% to 0% of the total volume of contained medicament. In one embodiment, the upper limit of volume fraction is less than 100%, about 90% or about 80%, and the lower limit is more than 0%, e.g., about 10%, 30%, or 50%. Additionally, other embodiments of the injector can include alternative mechanisms that are configured to limit the throw/adjustment ranges or the volume of medicament ejected from the injector.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Preferably, the outer housing <b>12</b> includes a window portion <b>110</b> adjacent the tracks <b>106</b> and along the length thereof, as shown in the preferred embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. The window portion <b>110</b> is preferably made of a hard and durable, yet substantially transparent, material to allow the position of the lateral wings <b>104</b> of stopping member <b>100</b> to be visible therethrough. More preferably, the window portion <b>110</b> includes indicia <b>112</b> along and adjacent the length of the tracks that corresponds to the injection volume to be injected from the fluid chamber <b>22</b>. For example, the indicia can include marking intervals between 0% to 100% (the 0% marking disposed adjacent the distal end <b>108</b> of the track and the 100% marking disposed adjacent the proximal end <b>107</b> of the track) such that adjusting the position of the stopping member <b>100</b> so that the lateral wings <b>104</b> are substantially aligned with a 75% marking indicates that the injection volume will be 75% of the entire volume of medicament contained in the fluid chamber <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">One of ordinary skill in the art would understand that other such indicia or marking schemes can he used as desired. For example, indicia can be included on the housing adjacent the window rather than directly on the window, or the indicia can correspond to absolute values of injection volumes rather than percentages of the entire volume of medicament in the fluid chamber.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The preferred embodiment of the injector <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> also includes a bearing disposed between the spring <b>62</b> and the rain <b>60</b>. The bearing is preferably an annular bushing <b>68</b>, such as a nylon washer. The bushing <b>68</b> is configured for preventing or substantially reducing friction between the spring <b>62</b> and the ram <b>60</b> as the ram is rotated about the longitudinal axis <b>110</b>, while still transferring biasing energy from the spring <b>62</b> to the ram <b>60</b> upon actuation of the spring.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">While the preferred embodiments disclosed herein have been described in terms of a single-use injector (i.e., where a single injection volume of medicament is injected from a container prior to replacing the used container with a new container), one of ordinary skill in the art would understand that in other embodiments of the present invention, multiple injection volumes can be injected from the same container. For example, a first injection volume of 80% of the entire volume of medicament in the fluid chamber may be injected, followed by a subsequent injection of a second injection volume of the same or different fraction of the remaining volume of medicament in the fluid chamber.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The preferred embodiment is a single-use injector, being configured to prevent a user from reloading and reusing the injector. As such, the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> does not have a way of resetting the injector to fire again, and preferably cannot be reloaded to with another medicament container without substantial disassembly or breaking of the injector.
