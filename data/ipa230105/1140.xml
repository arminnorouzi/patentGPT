id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">An occlusion catheter system includes a proximal hub having an inflation connection port and an inflation pathway. An inflation catheter member is connected to the proximal hub and has an inflation lumen. A stiffener member defines a longitudinal axis. The proximal end of the stiffener member is connected to the proximal hub. The stiffener member extends through a portion of the inflation lumen. An occlusion balloon has a proximal balloon end and a distal balloon end. A distal catheter member is positioned substantially on the longitudinal axis and is connected to the distal end of the stiffener member. An atraumatic tip is positioned on a distal end of the distal catheter member. The atraumatic tip has a substantially circular profile in a relaxed configuration. A pressure sensor is connected to the occlusion catheter system distally relative to the occlusion balloon and is connected to a processor by electrical wiring.</p></abstract><drawings

Pre-conditioning is employed to mitigate ischemia before, during and/or after a vascular occlusion procedure, as well as used to reduce or ameliorate the onset of hypertension during or reduce or ameliorate the onset of hypotension after a vascular occlusion procedure. Vascular occlusions may be indicated in either the venous system and/or the arterial system. Endoarterial occlusion is a procedure in which a blood vessel is at least partially occluded in order to restrict blood flow upstream or downstream the occlusion site for purposes of a vascular procedure or repair. It is known that transient hypertension is a risk factor in arterial occlusion, particularly aortic occlusion. Transient hypertension occurs when the blood pressure upstream the occlusion site rises to a potentially unsafe level during the time duration of the occlusion. Upon completion of a procedure requiring arterial occlusion, particularly aortic occlusion, care must be taken during the process of reestablishing blood flow to reduce or ameliorate the onset of hypotension. Thus, arterial occlusion carries with it two twin risks, hypertension during the occlusion and hypotension as the occlusion is withdrawn and blood flow restored, that must be managed.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Temporary aortic occlusion as an operative method to increase proximal or central perfusion to the heart and brain in the setting of shock due to major trauma is generally known. Despite potential advantages over thoracotomy with aortic clamping, resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (&#x201c;REBOA&#x201d;) for trauma has not been widely adopted.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Many attempts have been made at developing technologies to control non-compressible abdominal hemorrhage. For example, non-occlusive, abdominal tamponade procedures have been developed to address the problem of non-compressible hemorrhage, such as providing introducing an expandable biocompatible foam into the abdominal cavity to apply pressure to the abdominal organs and vasculature. Pharmacological efforts have also been developed to address the problem of non-compressible hemorrhage. Conventional REBOA procedures are typically performed in an operating room and with the aid of fluoroscopy of other imaging.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Devices that automate inflation and deflation of a balloon are known. Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation catheters for blood pressure augmentation coordinated with electrocardiography signals are also known. Over inflation safety devices are also known, such as a pressure-relief valve coupled to an inflation lumen that opens when pressure within the inflation lumen exceeds a threshold pressure, but is still that relative pressure within the balloon necessary to maintain occlusion of the blood vessel.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It would be desirable to design, develop and implement a system that intermittently and automatically releases an occlusion by releasing apposition of an occlusive member against the vascular wall and allowing perfusion past the occlusion member in response to a physiological parameter, then re-establishing occlusion in response to potential changes in the physiological parameter, either during a vascular repair procedure to control hypertension or post-repair procedure to control hypotension.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, there is provided an arterial occlusion catheter system including an occluding member carried at a distal aspect of a catheter, an atraumatic guiding tip forming a distal end of the catheter and a pressure accumulator communicating with the occluding member. The atraumatic guiding tip alleviates the need for a guide wire, and, therefore for initial guide wire placement, allowing the preferred arterial occlusion catheter to be used in field operations and without the necessity of fluoroscopy or other imaging modality.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with another preferred embodiment of the present invention, there is provided an arterial occlusion catheter system including an occluding member carried at a distal aspect of a catheter, an atraumatic guiding tip forming a distal end of the catheter, a pressure valve communicating with the occluding member that release expansive force applied to the occluding member to allow perfusion past the occluding member when hypertension is present, and a means for re-applying the expansive force to re-establish occlusion when the arterial pressure is normalized.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In accordance with still another preferred embodiment of the present invention, there is provided an arterial occlusion catheter system having a computer hardware and software control over the physiological parameter set points at which automatic computer controlled occlusion or release of occlusion occur, including, without limitation, set points for systolic and/or diastolic arterial blood pressure, heart rate, heart rhythm (including, without limitation, the P, Q, R, S, T and U peaks, their size, timing and duration), blood oxygenation, tissue oxygenation or the presence or absence of metabolic blood products.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In accordance with yet still another preferred embodiment of the present invention, there is provided an arterial occlusion catheter system having computer hardware and software control monitoring physiological parameter set points for systolic and/or diastolic arterial blood pressure, heart rate, heart rhythm (including, without limitation, the P, Q, R, S, T and U peaks, their size, timing and duration), blood oxygenation, tissue oxygenation or the presence or absence of metabolic blood products and which provides visual, auditory or tactile feedback to a medical practitioner as signals for the medical practitioner to take certain recommended actions based upon the monitored physiological parameter set points.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In accordance with still yet another preferred embodiment of the present invention, there is provided an arterial occlusion system and method in which fluids, such as blood, plasma, saline, blood products or blood substitutes, are infused proximal and/or distal the occlusion site.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In accordance with another preferred embodiment of the present invention, there is provided an arterial occlusion system and method in which the occlusion member has a geometric conformation such that at different degrees of deployment it assumes different transverse geometric profiles that yield different degrees of arterial occlusion and permit perfusion past the occlusion member. The occlusion member may have a torroidal shape when fully deployed and a fluted or corrugated shape with longitudinally oriented flutes or corrugations and valleys between adjacent flutes or corrugations when in its partially deployed state. Alternatively, the occlusion member may have a helical shape when either fully or partially deployed, such that fluid flow around the occlusion member is maintained while at least partially occluding the artery. Further, the occlusion member may have a torroidal shape with vanes, the vanes being either longitudinally oriented or helically oriented, the vanes being sufficiently pliant so that they deflect and fold against the occlusion member when the occlusion member is in full apposition with the vascular luminal wall surface, but pliantly recover to project from the occlusion member and define fluid flow pathways between adjacent vanes and past the occlusion member.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In accordance with yet another preferred embodiment of the present invention, there is provided an arterial occlusion system and method having a catheter with at least one occlusion member at a distal end thereof, a plurality of fluid flow ports communicating with a common fluid flow lumen within the catheter and an luminal occluding member that is movable within the common fluid flow lumen to open or close one or more of the plurality of fluid flow ports, thereby controlling the volume and rate of perfusion fluid flow past the at least one occlusion member.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">While in all preferred embodiments of the present invention, the occluding member is preferably a balloon, the occluding member may also consist of a woven or non-woven shape memory metal membrane, a superelastic metal membrane, an elastic metal membrane, a woven or non-woven polymer material or a shape memory polymer and that the occluding member may or may not be supported by an expansive or reinforcing frame.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">As noted above, arterial hypertension is a frequent result of arterial occlusion for any clinically significant period of time, particularly, in aortic occlusion situations. A need has been recognized to provide a catheter system in which clinically significant hypertension is alleviated automatically and without medical practitioner intervention or control, concurrently with the arterial pressure exceeding a pre-determined level upstream in the blood flow from the occlusion member.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The preferred present invention generally relates to endovascular arterial occlusion catheters that are particularly well suited to emergency or trauma use for REBOA procedures to occlude non-compressible hemorrhage either in the field, on the battlefield or in emergency room environments where guidance imaging is typically not available. More particularly, the preferred present invention pertains to an arterial occlusion catheter that has an atraumatic guiding tip made of a generally flexible material, elastic material, shape memory material or superelastic material. The atraumatic guiding tip may be formed at least in part of elastomeric polymer that permits guide wire and fluoroscopy free guidance of the arterial occlusion catheter to the site requiring occlusion. Still more particular, the present invention relates to a low profile aortic occlusion catheter having an atraumatic guiding tip formed of polymer, metal or polymer reinforced with an elastic, shape memory or superelastic material and having a lumen for introducing or withdrawing fluids from a body into which the catheter is placed and/or for introducing sensors, adjunctive medical devices or other diagnostic or therapeutic modalities, to determine and evaluate a condition within the body, such as arterial pressure or flow rate, to diagnose a condition in the body and/or to treat a condition in the body.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Balloon catheters generally comprise an elongated catheter shaft with a deflated balloon on the distal end of the shaft, and are used in a number of different medical procedures, including, for example, angioplasty, stent placement, occlusion, drug delivery, etc. The catheter is introduced through a percutaneous sheath and maneuvered into the patient's blood vessels until the balloon is properly positioned across the stenotic area to be dilated. Once properly in position, the balloon is inflated with liquid one or more times to a predetermined size and pressure to widen the coronary passageway and increase blood flow.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">It is desirable for balloon catheters to attain very low profiles in order to facilitate passage of the balloon across severe and remote vascular obstructions. High strength materials are commonly required in the design of balloon catheter components to prevent shaft buckling when the balloon is inflated. Additionally, high strength materials are required so that torque applied to the proximal end of the catheter results in rotation of the distal tip of the catheter. High flexibility materials are also commonly required in the design of balloon catheter components to maintain a low-profile and avoid trauma or perforation of the blood vessels while the catheter is maneuvered through the patient's tortuous vasculature.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">However, conventional balloon catheters, particularly those designed for aortic occlusion, generally do not properly balance the need for proximal segment stiffness with the need for a low profile, flexible distal segment and trackability through the tortious vascular pathway without entry into collateral vessels. A low profile balloon catheter with a high strength and relatively stiff proximal segment and a flexible distal segment with an atraumatic tip having a design that restricts tracking and entry into collateral vessels, which is employed by preferred embodiments of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In one preferred embodiment, the devices comprise an elongate catheter having a proximal and a distal region. The catheter may also have a lumen extending between the proximal and distal regions. An expandable occlusion member, e.g., a balloon, a membrane with or without an expandable frame or an expandable section of the catheter itself, is carried at the distal region of the catheter. The catheter in certain preferred embodiments may include plural expandable occlusion members, i.e., second, third, fourth, etc. expandable occlusion members, at the distal region of the catheter, proximal and/or distal the first expandable occlusion member.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In certain preferred embodiments, the catheter will also include means for measuring physiological parameters distal and/or proximal one or more of the expandable occlusion members, including, for example blood pressure sensors, heart rate sensors, flow sensors, chemical sensors, temperature sensors, oxygenation sensors, ischemia sensors, biological sensors, imaging sensors or the like.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In use, the catheter having one expandable device is located in the descending aorta so that the expandable device is suprarenal or infrarenal. The expandable device is then expanded to partially or completely obstruct the descending aorta. Cerebral blood flow and cerebral blood pressure rises and is maintained at an increased level, as desired. Cephalic blood pressure and/or cerebral blood flow may be monitored, and the expandable device adjusted as needed. Therapeutic instruments may be deployed through the lumen (when present) of the occlusion catheter systems.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In another preferred embodiment, the occlusion member, when expanded, has a maximum periphery that conforms to the inner wall of the vessel, thereby providing a sealed contact between it and the vessel wall. The occlusion catheter system may have a blood flow or other fluid flow conduit allowing blood flow from a location upstream to a location downstream. The preferred devices further include a variable flow mechanism in operative association with the blood conduit, thereby allowing blood flow through the conduit to be adjusted and controlled. The preferred devices can optionally include a manometer and/or pressure limiter to provide feedback to the variable flow mechanism for precise control of the upstream and downstream blood pressure.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In certain preferred embodiments of the invention, the arterial occlusion catheter system includes an additional access lumen that allows access and passage of other medical devices or adjunctive therapies. Devices, such as flow wires, imaging catheters or devices, infusion, atherectomy, angioplasty, hypothermia catheters or devices, or electrophysiologic study (EPS) catheters, can be introduced through the additional access lumen to access a position in the blood vessel to provide diagnostic or therapeutic interventions. Hypothermia is one example of an adjunctive therapy that may be delivered using the additional access lumen of the preferred arterial occlusion catheter. Where cerebral cooling is desired the additional access lumen may be used to introduce cooled blood or other cooled fluids, a cooling wire, or other type of heat exchanger, such as a cooling catheter.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In still another preferred embodiment, the occlusion member comprises a first balloon mounted to a distal end of the catheter, and a second balloon mounted on the distal end of the catheter and proximal the first balloon, with a region of the catheter being intermediate the first and the second balloons. The first balloon has a first balloon inflation chamber and the second balloon has a second balloon inflation chamber, the first balloon inflation chamber and the second balloon inflation chamber may communicate with a common inflation lumen or, alternatively, may communicate with separate inflation lumens, termed herein, first inflation lumen and second inflation lumen, such that the first and second balloons are either concurrently or separately inflatable. A perfusion lumen may also be provided in the catheter and communicates with perfusion openings passing through the wall of the catheter to permit fluids, including blood and blood products to be introduced through the catheter. The perfusion openings are preferably located distal the first balloon (first perfusion openings), proximal the first balloon and intermediate the first balloon and the second balloon (second perfusion openings), and/or proximal the second balloon (third perfusion openings), or in any combination thereof, such that fluid flow may be established either concurrently or selectively through all of or only some of the perfusion openings. Selective fluid flow through the perfusion openings may be accomplished in a number of alternative manners. For example, a plurality of perfusion lumens may be provided in the catheter. A first perfusion lumen communicating with the perfusion openings distal the first balloon, a second perfusion lumen communicating with the perfusion openings proximal the first balloon and intermediate the second balloon and the first balloon, and a third perfusion lumen communicating with the perfusion openings proximal the proximal balloon. Alternatively, a single common perfusion lumen may communicate with all of the perfusion openings, and a selector member is disposed within the perfusion lumen and movable within the perfusion lumen to selectively expose only those perfusion lumens in the catheter regions through which perfusion is desired. A non-limiting example of a selector member comprises a tubular hypotube having non-fenestrated wall surfaces that is longitudinally movable within the perfusion lumen to select either the first perfusion openings, the second perfusion openings or the third perfusion openings, or portions thereof. The hypotube may, itself, have fenestrations or openings passing through its wall surfaces, wherein rotational movement of the fenestrated hypotube within the perfusion lumen will align the hypotube fenestrations with one or more of the perfusion openings to permit fluid flow from the lumen of the hypotube and through the aligned fenestrations and perfusion openings and into the vascular structure.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">It will be understood that there are many advantages in using the partial aortic occlusion devices and methods disclosed herein. For example, the devices can be used (1) to provide variable partial occlusion of a vessel; (2) to augment and maintain cerebral perfusion in patients suffering from global or focal ischemia; (3) to condition the brain or spinal cord to secrete neuroprotective agents prior to a major surgery which will necessitate reduced cerebral or spinal perfusion; (4) to prolong the therapeutic window in global or focal ischemia; (5) to accommodate other medical devices, such as an atherectomy catheter; (6) prophylactically by an interventional radiologist, neuroradiologist, or cardiologist in an angiogram or fluoroscopy suite; (7) for prevention of cerebral ischemia in patients undergoing procedures, such as coronary catheterization or surgery, where cardiac output might fall as a result of arrhythmia, myocardial infarction or failure; (8) to treat shock, thereby eliminating or reducing the use of systemic vasoconstrictors; (9) to prevent hypotensive neurologic damage during carotid stenting, and (10) to rescue vasospasm induced by hemorrhage or interventional procedures.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Provided herein are systems, methods and compositions for an occlusion balloon catheter system comprising: a first catheter member having a first lumen extending longitudinally through the first catheter member and open at a distal end of the first catheter member; a second catheter member having a second lumen extending longitudinally through the second catheter member and open at a distal end of the second catheter member, the second catheter member is positioned over and in spaced apart relationship relative to a proximal section of the first catheter member forming an annular space between the second catheter member and the first catheter member, the proximal section of the first catheter member resides within the second lumen of the second catheter member and the first catheter member extends beyond the distal end of the second catheter member, a third catheter member that may comprised a proximal shaft of an atraumatic tip having a third lumen extending longitudinally and partially through the third catheter member; the third catheter member is positioned over a distal section of the first catheter member, the third catheter member having a distal section that extends distally from a distal end of the first catheter member such that the first lumen and the third lumen are in fluid flow communication, whereby the second and third catheter are spaced apart from each other along a longitudinal axis of the first catheter member with the first catheter member extending therebetween; an atraumatic tip member having a proximal section co-axially coupled to a distal end of the third catheter member; and a balloon coupled at its proximal end to the second catheter member and at its distal end to the third catheter member and in fluid flow communication with the second catheter member; the balloon being positioned such that the space between the second catheter member and the third catheter member is within the balloon.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">REBOA is preferably performed, as follows:</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Step 1: Arterial Access and Positioning of Initial Sheath</heading><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Access to the arterial circulation for REBOA for trauma is obtained through the femoral artery. After femoral artery access is obtained, a ten to fifteen centimeter (10-15 cm) long sheath is positioned in the femoral and external iliac artery. Access to the femoral artery can be obtained using several techniques, including: percutaneous, open exposure (i.e., cut down), or exchange over a guide wire from an existing femoral arterial line. Percutaneous access is commonly accomplished under ultrasound guidance. Ultrasound or direct surgical identification of the femoral artery lateral to the vein is preferred in the hypotensive patient without a palpable pulse. Once identified, the artery should be entered at a forty-five degree (45&#xb0;) angle with a hollow eighteen gauge (18-gauge) needle through which a thirty-five thousandths inch (0.035&#x2033;) wire or similarly sized wire can be passed. After the wire has been passed into the artery, the needle is removed and a small incision made at the interface of the wire and the skin. Next the sheath is placed over the wire into the artery. Any time a sheath is passed over a wire into the arterial system, the sheath's internal dilator is preferably firmly in place to allow a smooth reverse taper from the wire to the diameter of the sheath. Once the dilator and sheath have been advanced over the wire through the skin into the artery, the dilator is removed leaving the sheath as a working port through which other maneuvers can be accomplished.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Step 2: Selection and Positioning of the Balloon</heading><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Selection of a Balloon: A balloon inflated inside the aorta to occlude flow should be compliant and of large diameter. Stiff or noncompliant balloons pose a risk of arterial damage.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Positioning of the Balloon (Zones of the Aorta): Balloon selection should be made in view of the aortic zone to be occluded. Aortic zones can be considered I, II, and III spanning from cranial or proximal to caudal or distal. Zone I is preferably considered the descending thoracic aorta between the origin of the left subclavian and celiac arteries. Zone II preferably represents the para-visceral aorta between the celiac and the lowest renal artery and zone III preferably represents the infrarenal abdominal aorta between the lowest renal artery and the aortic bifurcation, depending on patient anatomy. In most instances of shock and pending cardiovascular collapse, the aim is to position the occlusive balloon to occlude zone I. In this case, a larger diameter balloon and a longer sheath are advanced into the thoracic aorta. REBOA in zone I typically requires a longer sheath, such as a sheath having a forty-five to sixty centimeter (45-60 cm) length, to be positioned in the descending thoracic aorta to support or hold the balloon against aortic pulsation once it is inflated. Inflation of a compliant balloon in aortic zone III may provide specific utility in cases of pelvic or junctional femoral hemorrhage. In this instance, a relatively smaller diameter balloon may be sufficient. Because the aortic bifurcation will support or hold the inflated balloon against pulsation, this maneuver can potentially be accomplished using a large diameter but shorter sheath, such as ten to fifteen centimeters (10-15 cm).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Wire Control and Positioning of the Large Sheath and Balloon: Positioning of the balloon in the aorta preferably takes place over a thirty-five thousands inch (0.035&#x2033;) wire, but is not so limited, and through an appropriately sized sheath that takes the place of the initial sheath previously described. Re-sheathing may be accomplished by inserting a two hundred sixty centimeter (260 cm) long, thirty-five thousands inch (0.035&#x2033;) stiff wire (e.g., Amplatz Stiff Wire Guide; Cook Medical) through the initial sheath in the femoral artery. The stiff wire is preferably advanced under fluoroscopic guidance or visualization such that the floppy tip is in the distal aortic arch. The extent of the wire outside of the sheath at this point should be noted and marked so that the wire is not advanced or withdrawn significantly, such as by more than five centimeters (&#x3e;5 cm). Failure to maintain control of the wire's insertion depth during this and subsequent maneuvers may result in inadvertent injury to coronary or cerebral vessels if it is advanced too far or an inability to advance the balloon to the occlusion zone if it is withdrawn.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The initial sheath may be removed and backed off of the wire with pressure held proximally over the femoral artery for hemostasis. The larger sheath is then advanced over the wire, preferably lead by its internal dilator, through the skin opening and into the femoral and iliac artery. In this manner, the wire acts as a rail over which the large sheath or balloon catheter can be advanced or withdrawn as the operator focuses on the fluoroscopic image.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">To occlude zone I, the larger, longer sheath is preferably advanced over the stiff wire under fluoroscopic guidance into the thoracic aorta to the desired location of occlusion. Fluoroscopically, zone I can be estimated to exist above the twelfth (12<sup>th</sup>) rib and below the medial head of the clavicle. Next, the internal dilator is preferably removed from the sheath and the back end of the extended wire. The balloon is next preferably loaded on and advanced over the stationary wire into and through the sheath. Under fluoroscopic visualization, after the balloon advances from the end of the sheath, it is ready to be inflated. To occlude zone III typically requires a large diameter but shorter sheath, such as ten to twenty-five centimeters (10-25 cm), to allow passage of the balloon into the terminal aorta under fluoroscopic visualization. The concept in this scenario is that once the balloon is inflated, any aortic pulsation will push the balloon to the terminal aorta and its bifurcation.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Step 3: Inflation of the Balloon and Securing of the Apparatus</heading><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Balloon Inflation: Similar to step 2, inflation of the balloon is preferably accomplished under fluoroscopic guidance. A large-volume syringe, usually thirty to sixty milliliters (30-60 mL) is filled with a half and half solution of sterile saline and iodinated contrast. This mixture allows visualization of the balloon inflation as well as more rapid inflation and deflation times by reducing viscosity. Preferably with fluoroscopy, the balloon is inflated until the outer edges of the balloon change from convex to parallel as the balloon takes on the contour of the aortic wall. One may notice that during systole, the balloon changes shape and creates a &#x201c;mushroom cap&#x201d; as it is pulsed inferiorly. In zone I occlusion, the previously positioned long sheath can then support the balloon and maintain its position within the aorta. When inflation appears adequate to gain aortic wall apposition and augment central blood pressure, the three-way stopcock on shaft of the balloon should be turned off toward the balloon to maintain inflation and occlusion while other maneuvers are undertaken.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Securing the Inflated Balloon, Sheath, and Wire Apparatus: It is next preferred to hold the balloon, sheath, and wire securely so that none generally change position as the central aortic pressure returns pushing the balloon caudal. Although the balloon, sheath, and wire can be secured with sutures or an occlusive dressing that pin the apparatus to the patient, these are preferably observed continuously to limit downward or caudal migration.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Step 4: Deflation of the Balloon</heading><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Once a decision to attempt deflation is made, care is preferably taken to deflate the balloon slowly as this step can be anticipated to result in a decrease in afterload and hypotension. After prolonged balloon inflation or in situations where incomplete resuscitation has occurred, deflation of the balloon can potentially result in reperfusion, washout of metabolic byproducts, and acidosis. As such, intermittent balloon inflation and deflation is preferred until some hemodynamic stability is restored.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Step 5: Removal of the Balloon and Sheath</heading><p id="p-0040" num="0039">After REBOA is no longer required, the deflated balloon and wire are preferably removed from the large sheath which is preferably flushed with heparinized saline, such as one hundred milliliters (100 mL) of saline or one thousand (1,000) units of heparin. The relatively large diameter sheaths used to deploy currently available compliant balloons are best removed with open surgical exposure of the femoral artery. This can be accomplished using a longitudinal or transverse groin incision with dissection through the soft tissues overlying the femoral sheath. The femoral artery proximal and distal to the sheath entry site should be exposed to allow control. Proximally, this often requires dissection for two to three centimeters (2-3 cm) underneath the inguinal ligament as an assistant uses a narrow handheld retractor (e.g., short Wylie renal vein retractor) to lift the inguinal ligament off of the femoral sheath. During this maneuver, the surgeon preferably considers the circumflex iliac veins, which course over the top of the distal external iliac and proximal common femoral artery. Exposure distal to the sheath entry site preferably includes identification and control of both the superficial and profunda femoris arteries.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Once proximal and distal exposure and control have been accomplished, the sheath may be removed. The resulting arteriotomy should be closely examined and closed. Restoration of flow through the arterial segment is preferably confirmed using manual palpation for pulses and use of continuous wave Doppler of both the artery and more distal extremity. Closure of the femoral artery exposure is preferably accomplished in layers using absorbable suture in the soft tissues and skin.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">REBOA can be considered in the following five steps, each with specific procedural considerations: 1. Arterial access, 2. Balloon selection and positioning, 3. Balloon inflation, 4. Balloon deflation, and 5. Sheath removal. REBOA procedures may be conducted under fluoroscopy or other suitable imaging modality.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">There is a need for a device that permits medical practitioners to conduct REBOA procedures without the conventional necessity of using fluoroscopy or other imaging modality together with the suitability of using the device and techniques for field applications outside the hospital or in hospital emergency room settings. In trauma situations where a patient is undergoing severe central torso hemorrhaging, particularly when not in a hospital setting, such as on a battlefield or on a public street or highway, imaging capability is simply not available to emergency responders or field medical practitioners. In such situations, it is preferred to temporarily occlude a central torso hemorrhage so that the patient may be stabilized in the field and transported to a hospital or other facility in which repair of the traumatic injury may be conducted.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Injuries in modern warfare are often caused by explosion and related high-velocity penetrating shrapnel leading to non-compressible bleeding. Non-compressible bleeding accounts for approximately eighty-five percent (85%) of preventable deaths on the battlefield, eighty percent (80%) of which include acute hemorrhage within the abdomen/torso. Abdominal hemorrhage involves injury to the spleen, liver, or retroperitoneal vasculature, and is typically non-compressible, meaning that it cannot be treated by external compression or the application of tourniquets or topical dressings.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Emergency surgical intervention is currently the only available method for treating non-compressible abdominal hemorrhage. Battlefield or other major trauma generally occurs in an austere, resource constrained environment, often with extended evacuation time due to persisting tactical threats or environmental constraints. Transport time to reach a hospital where surgery can take place varies, but is estimated to average one hour (1 hr). The majority of preventable deaths due to abdominal hemorrhage is nearly fifty percent (50%) and can be attributed to delays in hemorrhage control during transportation, highlighting the need for rapid, far-forward hemorrhage treatments.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Systems, methods and compositions for an occlusion balloon catheter system comprising: a first catheter member having a first and second lumens extending along a longitudinal axis thereof that forms a proximal section of the catheter system, a second catheter member having a third lumen forming a distal section of the catheter system and coupled to a distal end of the first catheter member, an inflatable balloon coupled at its proximal end to a distal end of the first catheter member and at its distal end to a proximal end of the second catheter member, a first lumen of the first catheter member terminating within the inflatable balloon to communicate an inflation fluid to an area within the inflatable balloon and a second lumen of the first catheter member being in fluid flow communication with the third lumen of the second catheter member; an atraumatic guiding tip coupled to a distal end of the third lumen of the second catheter member; and a third catheter member having at least one lumen passing longitudinally therethrough, the third catheter member being disposed within each of the second lumen of the first catheter member and the third lumen of the second catheter member and passing therethrough.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Preferred embodiments of the present invention have been actively conceptualized, modeled, iterated and working prototypes produced of multiple REBOA related devices.

ECMO is preferably used in cases where the patient's lungs have been damaged or temporarily compromised, by bypassing the patient's lungs through the use of catheters to shunt the blood away from the damaged organs and through an ECMO device instead. Recent advances have reduced the size, weight and cost of ECMO, while improving its efficacy. Combining the REBOA technology with various ECMO catheters to provide a &#x201c;one stop&#x201d; solution for patients with lung or other major organ compromise in the setting of hemorrhage may become a clinically preferred method. Similar combinations with existing and proposed cryogenic devices and Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) systems also are contemplated.</p><heading id="h-0018" level="1">REBOA with Anti-Hypertension Feature (A-HYPER REBOA)</heading><p id="p-0057" num="0056">A-HYPER REBOA is a REBOA accessory that uses the patient's own supra-occlusion blood pressure to control the inflation/deflation of the REBOA balloon is contemplated.

If the patient's blood pressure should drop dangerously low during the deflation of the REBOA balloon, the system may automatically re-inflate the balloon to restore adequate pressure to the vital organs.

In accordance with an exemplary and preferred embodiment, the preferred balloon catheter system is well suited for use as an arterial occlusion balloon catheter, and in particular an aortic occlusion balloon catheter. Applications making advantageous use of embodiments of the invention may use any suitable access site for vascular intervention. For example, applications of the catheter system may involve access at the femoral artery, the brachial artery, the subclavian artery, or any other blood vessel suitable for use as an access site for catheterization, including venous vessels.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">Moreover, it will be understood that while a balloon is referred to herein as an example of occlusion member, other types of occlusion members are contemplated as being expressly within the scope of the present invention. In addition to balloons, the occlusion members may include stents, coils, grafts, sheaths, cages, plugs, supported or unsupported membranes, or the like. The occlusion member, including the occlusion balloons, may be fabricated of biocompatible polymer or biocompatible metal, or combinations thereof, and may be woven or non-woven in structure. Biocompatible metals include, but are not limited to, stainless steel, titanium, nitinol, cobalt, vanadium, aluminum, nickel, tantalum, zirconium, chromium, silver, gold, silicon, magnesium, niobium, scandium, platinum, cobalt, palladium, manganese, molybdenum and alloys thereof, such as cobalt-chromium-molybdenum or zirconium-titanium-tantalum alloys. The metals and/or the polymers may be elastic, shape memory or superelastic. More recent advanced materials may also be used, including carbon fibers, carbon nanotubes or carbon composites, such as carbon/polyetheretherketone (PEEK). In the present application, when the term &#x201c;balloon&#x201d; is used it is intended to mean a fluid Tillable member capable of expanding from a first smaller diameter to a second larger diameter under the influence of fluid introduced into the balloon. Unless otherwise stated, a balloon is not limited in size, shape, geometry, material or construction. When used in this application, the term &#x201c;occlusion member&#x201d; is intended to be inclusive of balloons and other structures, including stents, coils, grafts, sheaths, cages, plugs or supported or unsupported membranes.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">In one aspect of the invention, a pressure relief apparatus for a balloon catheter is provided. The balloon catheter includes a shaft having a balloon attached to the distal end of the shaft, an inflation/deflation lumen for inflating and deflating the balloon and a pressure relief port. The pressure relief port may alternatively be formed through the wall of the inflation/deflation lumen, through the wall of the proximal hub, or may be part of the fluid pathway that couples to the proximal hub. A pressure relief member is secured either across or within the pressure relief port to form a fluid tight seal. The fluid tight seal is configured to open or fail (e.g. open, burst, rupture, tear or leak) at a predetermined pressure to release pressure from the inflation/deflation lumen through the pressure relief port. The predetermined pressure may be less than or equal to the rated burst pressure of the balloon.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">In one variation, the pressure relief port comprises a first outwardly opening passage and a second passage in fluid communication with the first passage. The second passage extends inwardly from the first passage and opens into the inflation/deflation lumen. In this variation, the cross-sectional area of the first passage may be larger than the cross-sectional area of the second passage.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">In one embodiment, a wall extends radially between an inside end of the first passage of the pressure relief port and an outside end of the second passage of the pressure relief port. The pressure relief member maybe disposed adjacent the wall and across the outside end of the second passage of the pressure relief port to block the pressure relief port and form a fluid tight seal. The pressure relief member may be a plastic film, a thin metallic film, a pop-off valve or other similar biased valve. The bias of the pressure relief member is less than or equal to a predetermined pressure known to protect the device from overpressure and burst and to protect the patent from injury.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">In another aspect, a pressure relief apparatus for a balloon catheter having a balloon with a rated burst pressure includes a proximal hub adapted for connection to a proximal end portion of a balloon catheter shaft wherein a pressure relief port is formed in the proximal hub. In one embodiment, the proximal hub may comprise a plastic body that defines an inflation/deflation lumen and a may or may not include guide wire lumen or a working lumen.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152">The proximal hub may be formed from a substantially rigid material and includes a wall defining the inflation/deflation lumen for directing a fluid into and from an inflation/deflation lumen of the catheter shaft. In this alternative embodiment, the proximal hub includes a pressure relief port formed through the wall of the hub and a pressure relief member disposed across or in the pressure relief port, forming a fluid tight seal across the pressure relief port. The pressure relief member is configured to open or fail, (e.g. open, rupture, tear, burst or leak), at a predetermined pressure to release pressure from the inflation/deflation lumen through the pressure relief port.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0153">In the case of an occlusion balloon, it is preferable that the balloon be of a compliant or partially compliant balloon material and typically formed relatively distensible plastic or polymer material. The balloons may also be constructed of substantially compliant or partially compliant polymeric, biocompatible materials, such as PBAX or other related polymers. The balloon may alternatively be constructed of a non-compliant material, which will typically expand less than about ten percent (10%), and more typically less than about five percent (5%), when pressurized from their rated operating pressure to the balloon's rated burst pressure.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0154">Where an occlusion balloon is the occlusion member, the proximal and distal ends of the balloon may be attached to the catheter shaft using techniques known in the art, for example, with an adhesive such as a medical grade epoxy adhesive or may be reflowed to become an integral part of the catheter shaft wall.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0155">In the following description, when reference is made to the terms &#x201c;proximal&#x201d; or &#x201c;proximally&#x201d; it is intended to mean a portion or component of the preferred vascular occlusion catheter system that is oriented away from the body into which the system is or is intended to be placed. Conversely, when reference is made to the terms &#x201c;distal&#x201d; or &#x201c;distally&#x201d; it is intended to mean a portion or component of the preferred balloon catheter system that is oriented toward the body into which the system is or is intended to be placed. Thus, for example, the guiding atraumatic tip described hereinafter is located at a distal end of the balloon catheter system, while the proximal hub is located at a proximal end of the balloon catheter system.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0156">As shown in the accompanying figures, the vascular occlusion catheter system <b>100</b> generally includes a catheter assembly having a first catheter member <b>130</b> having a first lumen <b>230</b>, a second catheter member <b>110</b> having a second lumen <b>210</b>, a third catheter member <b>120</b> having a third lumen <b>220</b>, an occlusion member <b>140</b>, a proximal hub <b>190</b> and a guiding atraumatic tip <b>150</b>.

The second lumen <b>210</b> of the second catheter member <b>110</b> also extends longitudinally through the second catheter member <b>110</b>, and terminates in a first port <b>160</b> distal to a proximal end of and within a space <b>142</b> at least partially bounded by the occlusion member <b>140</b>, best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>9</b>A</figref>. Where the occlusion member <b>140</b> is a balloon, the second lumen <b>210</b> is in communication with the space <b>142</b> bounded by the balloon <b>140</b> and conveys inflation fluid to and from the balloon <b>140</b> from a source external to the balloon catheter system <b>100</b>. The third catheter member <b>120</b> is coupled at a proximal end thereof to a distal end of the first catheter member <b>130</b> such that the third lumen <b>220</b> of the third catheter member <b>120</b> is in communication with the first lumen <b>230</b> of the first catheter member <b>130</b>. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the second catheter member <b>110</b> and the third catheter member <b>120</b> are positioned in longitudinal co-axial spaced apart relationship from one and other along a longitudinal axis <b>131</b> of the first catheter member <b>130</b> thereby defining an intermediate region <b>115</b> of the first catheter member <b>130</b> within the space <b>142</b> that is not covered by either the second catheter member <b>110</b> or the third catheter member <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0157">When a balloon is the occlusion member <b>140</b>, balloon <b>140</b> is attached, at its proximal end <b>144</b> to a distal end of the second catheter member <b>110</b> and at its distal end <b>146</b> to a proximal end of the third catheter member <b>120</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>5</b></figref>, a proximal radio opaque marker <b>158</b> may be affixed to the first catheter member <b>130</b> at or near the first port <b>160</b>, which is near the attachment position of the inflatable balloon at the proximal end <b>144</b> of the balloon <b>140</b>. A distal radio opaque marker <b>159</b> may be affixed to the first catheter member <b>130</b> near the attachment position on the distal end <b>146</b> of the balloon <b>140</b>. The proximal and distal radio opaque markers <b>158</b>, <b>159</b> may be implemented as bands made of a radio opaque material. In one example, the radio opaque material is a metal that is radio opaque such as stainless steel, or an alloy, such as a platinum iridium alloy.

As is known in the art, the inflation fluid is introduced until the balloon <b>140</b> is inflated to a desired diameter or a desired fluid pressure of the inflation fluid is achieved, or both. Deflation of the balloon <b>140</b> is simply the reverse process of withdrawing the inflation fluid from the space <b>142</b> of the inflation balloon <b>140</b>. In its deflated or collapsed state, the inflation balloon <b>140</b> will be positioned either within or adjacent to the intermediate region <b>115</b> of the first catheter member <b>130</b>, thereby providing a lower profile to the entire balloon catheter system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0159">When a fluid is used as the pressure source to activate the occlusion member, such as to fill an occlusion balloon, that fluid may be a liquid, including water, saline, contrast medium or any combination thereof, or may be a gas, including carbon dioxide, helium, air or oxygen. Catheter balloons may be inflated with gas, rather than liquid, because the balloon can be inflated and deflated more quickly than a comparable volume of saline or other liquid inflation media. Although air is relatively easy to load into an inflation device, air is not an ideal inflation medium, because air does not rapidly dissolve in blood. In the event that the balloon bursts or leaks, bubbles could be formed in the arterial blood, impeding blood flow. In addition, as nitrogen is a chief component of air, nitrogen has thrombogenic properties that may present clinical risks in the event the balloon bursts. Accordingly, it is desirable to use a gas other than air and to prevent air contamination of the gas used. A preferable gas used for balloon inflation is either carbon dioxide or helium.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0160">As will be described in more detail hereinafter, with exemplary reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>19</b>-<b>22</b></figref>, the present invention also includes alternative embodiments of occlusion control systems that regulate the position of the occlusion member <b>140</b> and the apposition of the occlusion member <b>140</b> against a vascular wall surface.

Aortic occlusion may result in arterial hypertension upstream of an occlusion site as pressure builds against the occlusion member. If the arterial pressure reaches a deleterious hypertensive state, vascular rupture, stroke or other undesirable events may occur that could potentially injure the patient. Conversely, after the vascular occlusion is complete and blood flow is restored, there is a potential for concomitant drop in arterial blood pressure potentially leading to a hypotensive event that could result in a dangerously low blood pressure and, in extreme cases, cardiac arrest.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0204">The preferred control systems are not limited to their utility with the preferred vascular occlusion catheter systems <b>100</b>, <b>300</b>, <b>500</b> of the present invention, but may be used virtually with any type of vascular occlusion system.

The pressure source may be a syringe or syringe-like inflation device, an endoflator device, a pump or other similar means of applying a pressure to the occlusion member in the vascular occlusion catheter <b>710</b>. As noted above, when a fluid is used as the pressure medium to activate the occlusion member, such as to fill an occlusion balloon, that fluid may be a liquid, including water, saline, contrast medium or any combination thereof, or may be a gas, including carbon dioxide, helium, air or oxygen. The fluid source may, in the instance of a liquid, be a liquid reservoir, a pre-measured volume of liquid in a vessel that is removably engageable with the pressure source or other similar container for holding and dispensing liquid from the fluid source to the pressure source. In the instance of a gas, the fluid source may be a gas reservoir or a pre-measured volume of pressurized gas in a canister that is removably engagement with the pressure source to deliver the pre-measured volume of gas to the pressure source. A canister with a pre-measured gas volume at a known pressure is also contemplated, for example, a carbon dioxide cartridges that are commercially available in a wide variety of mass of pressurized gas, including without limitation eight, twelve, sixteen, twenty-five or thirty-three grams (8 g, 12 g, 16 g, 25 g, 33 g). Converting mass to volume of a gas at standard temperature and pressure (STP) typically entails resolving the gas constant equation, as follows: V=nRT/P wherein V is volume, n is mass, R is the molar volume of the gas, T is temperature (Kelvin) and P is pressure (atm). The volume of gas needed to inflate a specific occlusion member to a given inflation volume and inflation pressure may be calculated utilizing this preferred formula.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0206">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, a first embodiment of the occlusion control system <b>700</b> includes a vascular occlusion catheter <b>711</b> has a proximal hub <b>790</b> that includes at least one pressure line port <b>794</b>. The pressure line port <b>794</b> communicates with a pressure conduit or lumen <b>712</b> in the vascular occlusion catheter <b>711</b>. The pressure conduit <b>712</b> may be a lumen within the vascular occlusion catheter <b>711</b> or may be a tubular conduit placed within a lumen in the vascular occlusion catheter <b>711</b>. A pressure accumulator or reservoir <b>730</b> communicates with the pressure line port <b>794</b> via pressure line <b>732</b> that is, in turn, coupled to a connecting conduit <b>720</b> associated with pressure line port <b>794</b>. An actuator <b>744</b>, such as a fluid pump, is coupled to the pressure accumulator <b>730</b> and to a fluid source (&#x201c;FS&#x201d;) <b>742</b>. The actuator <b>744</b> is also operably coupled to a controller or central processing unit (&#x201c;CPU&#x201d;) <b>750</b>. The controller <b>750</b> operates as a computer control and may have an interface, not shown, that permits programming of computer control software that monitors and controls activation of the actuator <b>744</b> to regulate pressure in the occlusion member <b>740</b> and to collect data from sensors associated with the occlusion control system <b>700</b>.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0207">In accordance the preferred embodiment of occlusion control system <b>700</b>, the occlusion member <b>740</b> has a first pressure Pmax, which is below the failure pressure of the occlusion member <b>740</b>. The pressure accumulator <b>730</b> is preferably pressurized, such as with a fluid, to an accumulator pressure Pa, where the accumulator pressure Pa&#x3c;Pmax, and where the accumulator pressure Pa is less than a predetermined maximum safe blood pressure Pbp within the vascular system being occluded, such that Pa&#x3c;Pbp&#x3c;Pmax. When the occlusion member <b>740</b> is in apposition with the vascular wall and the vessel is substantially occluded, the pressure exerted at the occlusion member <b>740</b> may be considered the apposition pressure Papp, wherein the apposition pressure Papp is substantially equal to the pressure in the accumulator <b>730</b> or the accumulator pressure Pa. In this preferred embodiment, when during occlusion the blood pressure Pbp against the occlusion member <b>740</b> exceeds the apposition pressure Papp, the accumulator pressure Pa in the accumulator <b>730</b> and in the occlusion member <b>740</b> is exceeded and the occlusion member <b>740</b> may yield to the blood pressure Pbp and release apposition against the vascular wall surface and allow fluid flow past the occlusion site. Since the apposition pressure Papp within the occlusion member <b>740</b> and the accumulator pressure Pa within the accumulator <b>730</b> is preferably a closed system, the pressure in the accumulator <b>730</b>, such as the accumulator pressure Pa, will rise and when blood pressure reduces to be less than the accumulator pressure Pa in the accumulator <b>730</b> and the apposition pressure Papp within the occlusion member <b>740</b>, the occlusion member <b>740</b> will preferably reestablish occlusion.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0208">This effect of automatically adjusting apposition pressure Papp in response to an elevation in blood pressure Pbp, causing a release of apposition against the vascular wall and, therefore, releasing the occlusion and permitting fluid flow past the occlusion site, in turn lowers the blood pressure head against the occlusion member <b>740</b>. When the blood pressure Pbp upstream of the occlusion member <b>740</b> has downwardly adjusted to below the accumulator pressure Pa and the apposition pressure Papp, the occlusion member <b>740</b>, under the influence of the elevated pressure in the accumulator <b>740</b>, reestablishes apposition and, therefore, occlusion is reestablished.

In the first preferred embodiment, the inflation control system <b>1500</b> is preferably connected in-line between an inflation device (i.e. pressure source) and the balloon catheter, such as the first preferred occlusion catheter system <b>100</b>. The inflation control system <b>1500</b> preferably helps to prevent the user from overinflating the balloon, such as the occlusion member <b>140</b> and damaging the blood vessel into which the occlusion member or balloon <b>140</b> is inserted. The inflation control system <b>1500</b> preferably includes a pressure source <b>1502</b>, such as a syringe, which may be manually actuated or may be coupled to any of a large number of known automated injectors or pressure systems. The pressure source <b>1502</b> has a fluid source contained within the syringe, and is coupled to a bifurcated pressure conduit <b>1506</b>, that in turn communicates with a free line and a regulated line. A one-way check valve <b>1508</b> is interposed in the regulated line to prevent both backpressure and backflow to the syringe <b>1502</b>. A selectable flow valve <b>1504</b> is interposed in the free line and communicates with the regulated line. The selectable flow valve <b>1504</b> is operable to select the free line, the regulated line or both the free line and the regulated line. A fluid conduit leads from the selectable flow valve <b>1504</b> to a pressure sensor <b>1510</b>. A coupling <b>1512</b>, preferably a luer lock fitting, is provided to couple the occlusion catheter (not shown) to the pressure sensor <b>1510</b>. While an analog pressure gauge is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>55</b></figref>, the analog pressure gauge is not limiting and a wide variety of analog or digital pressure sensors <b>1510</b> are capable of being used to provide the medical practitioner with information concerning the pressure in the inflation control system <b>1500</b>.</p><p id="p-0269" num="0268">In use, the inflation control system <b>1500</b> allows the practitioner to apply fluid pressure to the occlusion catheter, e.g., by advancing the syringe plunger, to inflate the occlusion balloon, while simultaneously preventing both backpressure and backflow. When the selector valve <b>1504</b> is positioned to open the regulated line and close the free line, fluid is free to flow through the check valve <b>1506</b> to the occlusion catheter and ultimately to the balloon. Pausing during inflation will not result in deflation of the balloon because when force is no longer applied to the syringe plunger, the fluid no longer advances through the check valve <b>1508</b> and the backpressure from the elastic balloon causes the fluid to try to exit the balloon/catheter, thereby causing the check valve <b>1508</b> to close.</p><p id="p-0270" num="0269">The pressure sensor <b>1510</b> preferably senses the applied pressure at the pressure source <b>1502</b>, but not necessarily at the occlusion balloon. Namely, because of the length of the occlusion catheter and the high resistance of the fluid passing through the narrow annular space of the catheter shaft, the pressure at the pressure gauge <b>1510</b> may be higher than the actual pressure in the balloon, but allowances and compensation may be calculated to predict or measure the pressure within the balloon with the gauge <b>1510</b>. A dwell time typically exists between the time pressure is applied at the pressure source <b>1502</b> and when the pressure equilibrates at the occlusion balloon, but the pressure in the system between the check valve <b>1508</b> and the balloon quickly equalizes and the pressure sensor <b>1510</b> accurately reads the true pressure in the balloon. Excluding backpressure and backflow via the check valve <b>1508</b> creates a closed system in which the pressure can be allowed to equilibrate, as represented by a constant pressure readout on the pressure sensor <b>1510</b>, which will then represent the pressure at the occlusion balloon. Additional fluid pressure may then be applied at the pressure source <b>1502</b>.</p><p id="p-0271" num="0270">As should be understood, the pressure sensor <b>1510</b> may have a &#x201c;target occlusion pressure&#x201d; identified thereon (i.e. such as a blue zone of the gauge <b>1510</b>) that the practitioner knows to keep inflating until the needle comes a rest in the blue zone. This would indicate occlusion but not over inflation. Therefore, since this system is based on pressure and not volume, it is not necessary to know the vessel diameter before inflating the balloon. Rather, the practitioner need only fill the balloon until the needle of the pressure gauge <b>1510</b> comes to a rest in the &#x201c;blue zone&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0272" num="0271">Pressure may be withdrawn from the occlusion balloon by means of the selector flow valve <b>1504</b> being switched to open the free line, by-passing the check valve <b>1508</b>, and releasing pressure back to the pressure source <b>1502</b> from the occlusion balloon. The syringe plunger is preferably retracted and the fluid is drained from the balloon back into the syringe <b>1502</b>.</p><p id="p-0273" num="0272">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>41</b></figref>, a preferred second embodiment of an inflation control system <b>1550</b> is useful in the preferred inflation method of the present invention. A conventional balloon inflation device <b>1562</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>41</b></figref> (such as a QL Inflation Device, Atrion Medical, Arab, Ala.). The inflation device <b>1562</b> has a fluid chamber and a plunger <b>1564</b>. The plunger <b>1564</b> is preferably threaded to allow for rotation of the plunger <b>1564</b> relative to the fluid chamber and controlled depression of the plunger <b>1564</b> within the fluid chamber. A fluid conduit <b>1563</b> communicates with an outlet <b>1561</b> in the inflation device <b>1562</b> to communicate the inflation fluid to the occlusion catheter (not shown), such as the occlusion catheter system <b>100</b> of the first preferred embodiment or any of the other preferred occlusion systems described herein, that is coupled to the inflation device <b>1550</b> via a coupling <b>1561</b>. A pressure sensor <b>1560</b> is preferably provided in the outlet line of the inflation device <b>1550</b>. A lock <b>1566</b> is preferably provided that engages the threaded plunger <b>1564</b> during pressurization and disengages from the threaded plunger <b>1564</b> during depressurization. The lock <b>1566</b> acts, essentially, to isolate the pressure within the occlusion balloon, catheter and fluid conduit <b>1563</b> and resists transmitting backpressure or fluid backflow to the plunger <b>1564</b>. Essentially, the lock <b>1566</b> functions in a manner similar to the check valve <b>1508</b> in the preceding first preferred embodiment of the inflation control system <b>1500</b>.</p><p id="p-0274" num="0273">The method of inflating the occlusion balloon (not shown) using the inflation device <b>1562</b> entails the practitioner filling the fluid chamber with an inflation fluid by withdrawing the plunger <b>1564</b> to fill the fluid conduit <b>1563</b> and the fluid chamber. Expelling any air present in the fluid chamber and fluid conduit and connecting the inflation device <b>1550</b> to the occlusion catheter (not shown). To inflate the occlusion balloon, the plunger <b>1564</b> is actuated either by linear force or by rotating the plunger <b>1564</b> to engage the threads for a controlled pressurization. The lock <b>1566</b> should be engaged with the plunger <b>1564</b> to resist backpressure as the balloon occlusion member inflates. The pressure sensor <b>1560</b> will sense the applied pressure at the inflation device <b>1550</b>, but not necessarily at the occlusion balloon. Because of the length of the occlusion catheter, a dwell time exists between the time pressure is applied at the inflation device <b>1550</b> and when the pressure equilibrates at the occlusion balloon. By excluding backpressure and backflow, the lock <b>1566</b> serves to creates a closed system in which the pressure can be allowed to equilibrate, as represented by a constant pressure readout on the pressure sensor <b>1560</b>. When the pressure indicated on the pressure sensor <b>1560</b> is stable, this will then represent the pressure at the occlusion balloon. Additional fluid pressure may then be applied or pressure may be withdrawn from the occlusion balloon by either reversing the rotation of the plunger, essentially unthreading the plunger <b>1564</b>, and depressurizing the balloon, or by means of releasing the lock <b>1566</b> and withdrawing the plunger <b>1564</b>.</p><p id="p-0275" num="0274">The second preferred inflation device <b>1550</b> is not limited to the specific arrangement described and shown herein and further mechanisms may be employed to prevent the user/practitioner from overinflating the balloon and damaging the blood vessel or the balloon.

Therefore, prior to overinflating the balloon and damaging the vessel, the pressure within the catheter overcomes the spring <b>1501</b><i>b </i>bias and pushes the plunger <b>1501</b><i>a </i>distally to expose the port <b>1503</b> and permit pressure release therethrough.

Accordingly, contrast medium pumped into the catheter <b>1800</b> from the proximal hub is dispensed from the plurality of side ports <b>1809</b> and into the surrounding vasculature.</p><p id="p-0289" num="0288">The catheter <b>1800</b> is preferably configured in a similar manner to the occlusion catheter system <b>100</b> with the first catheter member <b>130</b> having the first lumen <b>230</b>, the second catheter member <b>110</b> having the second lumen <b>210</b> and the atraumatic tip <b>150</b> with a proximal portion comprised of the third catheter member <b>120</b> with the third lumen <b>220</b>. The multiple side ports <b>1809</b> are preferably formed in the proximal portion of the atraumatic tip <b>150</b>, the third catheter member <b>120</b> or the first catheter member <b>130</b> and may also be formed in each of these components of the catheter <b>1800</b>. The plurality of side ports <b>1809</b> are in fluid communication with the first lumen <b>230</b> through the first catheter member <b>130</b>, which is preferably in fluid communication with a power injection mechanism (not shown) through the first fluid pathway <b>192</b> in the proximal hub <b>190</b>. The space within the occlusion member <b>1808</b> is preferably in fluid communication with an injection mechanism, such as the inflation control system <b>1500</b> through the second fluid pathway <b>194</b> and the second lumen <b>210</b>, which introduces pressurized fluid or gas into the occlusion member <b>1808</b> through the distal port opening <b>160</b>.</p><p id="p-0290" num="0289">In the illustrated embodiment, the side ports <b>1809</b> are located distally from the occlusion member <b>1808</b>. The side ports <b>1809</b>, however, may be located proximally and/or distally of the occlusion member <b>1808</b> and the number of side ports <b>1809</b> may be determined according to the desired dispensing rate. The plurality of side ports <b>1809</b> may also be located in a single plane or in a circumferential manner around the catheter shaft. The plurality of side ports <b>1809</b> may also be utilized to withdraw fluids from the patient's vasculature, such as, for example, for blood sampling.</p><p id="p-0291" num="0290">The lumen in fluid communication with the side ports <b>1809</b> may be a hypotube constructed of a metal (e.g., nitinol), a polymer, a reinforced polymer (e.g., braided), or a composite material in order to withstand power injection pressures. The catheter hub, extension lines, and connectors are also constructed of the appropriate polymer/composite material in order to withstand power injection pressures. For example, extension lines may be braid reinforced or otherwise reinforced to withstand the power injection pressures. The catheter <b>1800</b> is, therefore, capable of being used safely with a power injector for contrast injections. The catheter <b>1800</b> may also be used for visualization of hemorrhage using fluoroscopy by injecting visualization agent into the patient and visualizing flow and, particularly hemorrhage.</p><heading id="h-0038" level="1">Infusion Catheter</heading><p id="p-0292" num="0291">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>45</b></figref>, an infusion catheter or occlusion catheter system <b>1900</b> in accordance with a tenth preferred embodiment (not including an occlusion member) can be utilized to infuse and withdraw fluids from a patient's vascular system. Similarly to the occlusion catheter <b>100</b>, <b>300</b>, <b>500</b>, the infusion catheter <b>1900</b> includes a distal, curled/spiral, polymeric atraumatic tip <b>1906</b> to assist the catheter <b>1900</b> to track up a blood vessel and remain in the central lumen of the vasculature. The catheter shaft <b>1910</b> is configured to have an appropriate stiffness to be pushable without kinking, while also being sufficiently flexible to not damage blood vessels. The catheter shaft <b>1910</b> may be constructed of a polymeric material, a metallic material, or a combination of plastic, metal, and composite materials (e.g., fiberglass, carbon fiber, nylon, etc.) to achieve the appropriate stiffness. The catheter shaft <b>1910</b> may be approximately five French (5 Fr) or five and twenty-four hundredths millimeters (5.24 mm), but may alternatively be constructed in other sizes as necessary. Similarly, the diameter of the generally circular profile of the atraumatic tip <b>1906</b> (discussed below) may also be sized appropriately according to the destination vessel size. The atraumatic tip <b>1906</b> is preferably designed and configured similar to the atraumatic tips <b>450</b>, <b>550</b> of the second and third preferred embodiments of the occlusion catheter system <b>300</b>, <b>500</b>, as is described above.</p><p id="p-0293" num="0292">Similarly to the occlusion catheter systems <b>100</b>, <b>300</b>, <b>500</b> of the first, second and third preferred embodiments, the infusion catheter <b>1900</b> of the tenth preferred embodiments is intended to be used without a guide wire for rapid insertion. The combination of the atraumatic tip <b>1906</b> and catheter shaft <b>1910</b> substantially negates the need for a separate guide wire, as is typically utilized in procedures introducing catheters, stents, screws or other devices into the patient. The infusion catheter <b>1900</b> preferably has a single lumen <b>1912</b> connected to a hub (not shown), e.g., with a standard luer lock fitting (not shown) at the proximal end of the occlusion catheter system <b>1900</b>. The occlusion catheter system <b>1900</b> may alternatively be connected with a hub via any of numerous different connectors/fittings, that are currently known or that later become known.</p><p id="p-0294" num="0293">The catheter shaft <b>1910</b> of the tenth preferred embodiment includes a plurality of side ports <b>1909</b> (a plurality of ports <b>1909</b> in the illustrated embodiment) proximal relative to the atraumatic tip <b>1906</b>. The plurality of side ports <b>1909</b> is in fluid communication with the lumen <b>1912</b>. A fluid may be injected at the catheter hub and exit into the vasculature at the plurality of side ports <b>1909</b>. The plurality of side ports <b>1909</b> preferably assist in distributing the fluid evenly to prevent the fluid stream from causing damage to the blood vessel. The plurality of side ports <b>1909</b> maybe be positioned in a single plane or spiral around the catheter shaft <b>1910</b> or may otherwise be arranged and configured to facilitate injection in a manner desired by the medical professional or designer.</p><p id="p-0295" num="0294">As explained above, the catheter shaft <b>1910</b> is preferably constructed of a material capable of withstanding the pressures and flow rates of power injection for contrast visualization. The catheter shaft <b>1910</b> could be braided or non-braided. The catheter <b>1900</b> may also be used for blood pressure monitoring via an external pressure sensor or to withdraw fluids (i.e. blood sampling, blood filtration/oxygenation (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (&#x201c;ECMO&#x201d;), etc.).</p><p id="p-0296" num="0295">The infusion catheter <b>1900</b> may be used in combination with an occlusion catheter system, but is not so limited. For example, an occlusion catheter system could be placed in the right femoral artery and advanced to the aorta and the occlusion member inflated to occlude the vessel. The infusion catheter <b>1900</b> could be inserted via the left femoral artery and used to infuse fluids (i.e. blood products, hyperoxygenated perfusate, crystalloids, etc.). The infusion catheter <b>1900</b> could also be used with a power/hand injector to inject radiopaque contrast (CO2, Isovue, etc.) to visualize the hemorrhage.</p><p id="p-0297" num="0296">The infusion catheter <b>1900</b> may be packaged with a pre-installed &#x201c;peel-away sheath&#x201d; that is used to straighten the atraumatic tip <b>1906</b> for insertion into the valve of the introducer sheath or directly into the blood vessel. The peel-away sheath is advanced distally to capture and straighten the atraumatic tip <b>1906</b> and then can be retracted proximally toward the catheter hub and peeled off the catheter shaft <b>1910</b> if necessary.</p><heading id="h-0039" level="1">Decision Support Systems</heading><p id="p-0298" num="0297">Intelligent systems are becoming widely accepted and are finding their way into acceptance in medical diagnostics and in the performance and predictive analysis of medical device clinical trials. Articles and presentations have been given related to this subject matter.</p><p id="p-0299" num="0298">An approach based on Bayesian statistics is an approach for learning from evidence as it accumulates. In clinical trials, traditional statistical methods may use information from previous studies only at the design stage. Then, at the data analysis stage, the information from these studies is considered as a complement to, but not part of, the formal analysis. In contrast, the Bayesian approach uses Bayes' Theorem to formally combine prior information with current information on a quantity of interest. The Bayesian idea is to consider the prior information and the trial results as part of a continual data stream, in which inferences are being updated each time new data become available.</p><p id="p-0300" num="0299">The Bayes theorem may be used to calculate the probability of coronary artery disease based upon clinical data and non-invasive test results. Pre-test probabilities of disease are assigned based on clinical data and the equation is used to calculate post-test probabilities after multiple sequential tests. When good prior information on clinical use of a device exists, the Bayesian approach enables this information to be incorporated into the statistical analysis of a given decisional matrix.</p><p id="p-0301" num="0300">Good prior information is often available for medical devices because of their mechanism of action and evolutionary development. The mechanism of action of medical devices is typically physical. As a result, device effects are typically local, not systemic. Local effects can sometimes be predictable from prior information on the previous generations of a device when modifications to the device are minor. Good prior information can also be available from studies of the device overseas.</p><p id="p-0302" num="0301">Bayesian methods are usually less controversial when the prior information is based on empirical evidence such as data from clinical trials. Bayesian methods can, however, be controversial when the prior information is based mainly on personal opinion.</p><p id="p-0303" num="0302">Bayesian analyses are often computationally intense. Recent breakthroughs in computational algorithms and computing speed have, however, made it possible to carry out calculations for very complex and realistic Bayesian models. These advances have resulted in an increase in the popularity of Bayesian methods. A basic computational tool is a method called Markov Chain Monte Carlo (&#x201c;MCMC&#x201d;) sampling, which is a method for simulating from the distributions of random quantities.</p><p id="p-0304" num="0303">As the Bayesian predictive modeling scheme has become well known, it is useful in conjunction with the various control systems of the present invention, as described above, as predictive analysis profiling during a vascular occlusion procedure.</p><p id="p-0305" num="0304">In connection with the present invention, the various preferred embodiments of the occlusion catheter systems and related components and devices described herein, and the occlusion or the occlusion/perfusion control over the vascular occlusion devices, is well suited to oversight and control using intelligent systems, such as those in which Bayesian probability analysis is applied.
