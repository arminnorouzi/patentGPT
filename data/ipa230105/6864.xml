In new energy vehicles or other new energy high-voltage energy storage systems, since a battery voltage is as high as 400V or above, communication between electronic control units (ECUs) or communication between partial circuits of different voltage levels in ECUs all require isolation measure to be applied, so as to satisfy requirements on high-voltage safety and communication quality.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">There are various devices in the market that can realize isolated communication, such as a magnetic coupling isolation chip or capacitive coupling isolation chip. Such chips, to some extent, are capable of suppressing electromagnetic interference and can achieve single-level signal isolation, but cannot be applied to CAN and daisy chain for differential signal isolation. Low-voltage differential signaling (LVDS) is a high-speed interface commonly used in higher-performance converters and high-bandwidth field-programmable gate array (FPGA) or ASICI/O. Differential signaling has a strong ability to suppress external electromagnetic interference (EMI). However, input differential amplitudes for such isolation chips are low, generally less than 0.5V, and input voltage range is less than 2.5V. In order to realize high-speed communication, differential amplifiers designed for such chips are implemented with low-swing low-current circuits, which still cannot adapt to the input voltage range of 4.5V to 5V for the CAN and daisy chain. Another common solution for differential signal isolation is to adopt a passive component such as a communication transformer or a high-voltage capacitor. Since a capacitor operates as a short circuit during a hot-plugging process, devices such as a cell management chip are subjected to high electrical stress. In addition, due to an energy limitation and a limited communication distance, such solution is recommended only for in-board communication applications. The communication transformer commonly used for communication isolation between boards cannot be mass-produced automatically due to limited technological level at present, and has a much higher failure rate than other electronic components and affects system functions.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In view of the above, a circuit and a method for bidirectional isolated communication of differential signals are provided in the present disclosure, in order to overcome defects in conventional techniques.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, a circuit for bidirectional isolated communication of differential signals is provided, the circuit including a first detection circuit, a second detection circuit, an isolation adjustment circuit, and a watchdog circuit.
