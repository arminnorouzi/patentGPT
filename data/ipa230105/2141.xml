No. 63/218,176 filed Jul. 2, 2021, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present subject matter relates generally to a tablet dispensing product and, more particularly, to a dissolvable toilet tablet dispensing product.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Ideally, toilet cleaning products, or any cleaning product, are stored close to where they will be used. For toilet cleaners, cleaning products should be stored close to or inside the bathroom. Bathrooms are often small spaces with little storage space. Cleaning products and their storage containers should be small enough to fit in a bathroom. In addition, they should be visually appealing if they are stored in view of people who enter the bathroom.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Some cleaning products are dissolvable tablets. Dissolvable tablets, as their name suggests, dissolve when exposed to water. This can be problematic in a bathroom because bathrooms are often moist environments and prone to splashes of water, both of which may cause the dissolvable tablets to dissolve. Dissolvable cleaning tablets should be protected from a moist and wet environment.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Many people would prefer to not have to touch a toilet cleaning tablet or even a toilet cleaning tablet storage product. Toilet cleaning tablets should be stored such that a user need not touch the toilet cleaning tablet or its storage product to use the toilet cleaning tablet.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Cleaning products and their storage containers can be expensive. In addition, one-time-use products can be wasteful. When one-time-use products are necessary, it is often desirable that the product is recyclable. A storage container for dissolvable toilet tablets should be refillable and recyclable when possible.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Some embodiments provide a dispensing product for storing dissolvable tablets and individually dispensing them on demand.

In this embodiment, the product has a base <b>100</b> with side walls <b>110</b> and a lid <b>200</b>. Inside the base <b>100</b> and underneath the lid <b>200</b> is a carousel assembly <b>300</b>. The carousel assembly <b>300</b> has a plurality of depressions <b>310</b>, each of which can hold a tablet <b>400</b>. The lid <b>200</b> has an aperture <b>210</b> that reveals the carousel assembly <b>300</b> underneath. In this configuration, all but one of the depressions <b>310</b><i>a </i>is covered by the lid <b>200</b>; the remaining depression <b>310</b><i>a </i>is left uncovered by the aperture <b>210</b> in the lid <b>200</b>, and its tablet <b>400</b><i>a </i>is available to be selectively removed from or inserted into the carousel assembly <b>300</b> through the aperture <b>210</b>. Inside the base <b>100</b>, not shown, is an advancement mechanism <b>600</b>. The advancement mechanism <b>600</b> causes the carousel assembly <b>300</b> to rotate about an axle. As the carousel assembly <b>300</b> rotates, the uncovered depression <b>310</b><i>a </i>will travel underneath the lid <b>200</b> while a covered depression <b>310</b><i>b </i>will move to the uncovered position under the aperture <b>210</b> of the lid <b>200</b>. The product <b>1000</b> also has a tablet wand holder <b>500</b> that can hold a tablet wand <b>2100</b> that attaches to the tablets <b>400</b> for removal.
