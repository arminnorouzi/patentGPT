The storage silo is filled through an opening near the top of the silo with a grain auger or conveyor. The sidewall of conventional storage silos are typically comprised of a plurality of panels made of corrugated sheet metal that are bolted together in series with one another to form a plurality of rings, wherein each of the rings of panels are attached to one another to form the sidewall. Typically the lower edge of the upper ring overlaps and is on the outside of the upper edge of the lower ring so that water doesn't enter into the storage silo through the joint and spoil the contents of the silo. Conventional storage silos range from 12 feet in diameter to over 150 feet in diameter with capacities up to about two million bushels or more.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As storage silos become larger in diameter and/or height, the forces applied to the sidewall and particularly the joints between adjacent panels increase because of the increase of particulate material (e.g. grain) stored within that applies an outward force to the sidewall. One of the limitation is that only two panels of the sidewall are connected together creating a single shear point for the bolts requiring stronger bolts to be used to avoid grain bin failure. However, when stronger bolts are used, conventional storage bins still are prone to failure by the tearing of the sheet metal used for the sidewalls because of the significant forces being applied to the distal edges of the sheet metal panels.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">With larger storage silos, it has become necessary to provide sidewall panels in laminates of double, triple or possibly even more layers to obtain the necessary strength. However, using multiple layers leads to other problems, particularly with the alignment of bolt holes between the multiple layers. The circular ring formed of the inner panels is going to have a smaller diameter than the ring formed by the outer panels. Additionally, Because the lower edge of the panels is placed on the outside of the panels of the ring below and the upper edge of the panels are placed on the inside of the panels of the ring above, the sidewall panels are not arranged completely vertical, but are forced to have a slight outward slope from top to bottom. Thus, when assembling the sidewall, the bolt holes may be off in both the vertical and the horizontal directions, making fit up of the panels difficult.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Because of the inherent problems with the related art, there is a need for a new and improved sidewall panels for storage silos to enable better fit between the multiple layers.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">OVERVIEW OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one embodiment, the invention is directed to a storage silo having a cylindrical wall formed with a plurality of ring structures stacked one upon another. Each ring structure is formed with a plurality of sidewall panels connected end to end with a vertical joint between horizontally adjacent sidewall panels. The plurality of ring structures have at least one upper ring structure and at least one lower ring structure positioned below the upper ring structure, with a portion of the upper ring structure overlapping the lower ring structure to form a horizontal joint. The upper lower ring structure are formed with sidewall panels in a layered arrangement. Each sidewall panel has a middle portion, an offset upper portion and an offset lower portion. The offset upper portion and the offset lower portion of the sidewall panel are offset from the middle portion.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">These and other features and advantages of this invention are described in, or are apparent from, the following detailed description of various exemplary embodiments of the systems and methods according to this invention.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The above mentioned and other features of this invention will become more apparent and the invention itself will be better understood by reference to the following description of embodiments of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein:</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of a storage silo having a cylindrical sidewall;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective view of a portion of the sidewall made of a plurality of sidewall panels arranged in a plurality of rings;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is an enlarged cutaway perspective view the seam between an upper ring and a lower ring in the sidewall showing the multiple layers of sidewall panels;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> is an end view of a sidewall panel;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> is an end view of an upper portion of the sidewall panel of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>; and</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref> is an end view of a lower portion of the sidewall panel of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Corresponding reference characters indicate corresponding parts throughout the views of the drawings.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The invention will now be described in the following detailed description with reference to the drawings, wherein preferred embodiments are described in detail to enable practice of the invention. Although the invention is described with reference to these specific preferred embodiments, it will be understood that the invention is not limited to these preferred embodiments. But to the contrary, the invention includes numerous alternatives, modifications and equivalents as will become apparent from consideration of the following detailed description.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a material storage silo <b>10</b> configured to stockpile and store material such as grain and the like. One will understand that the storage silo <b>10</b> may be any tank, bin or other structure, either freestanding or relying on common architecture, used to store a material such as grain. The following disclosure will describe the invention referring to the material as grain, but it is to be understood that the system may be used with materials other than grain without departing from the scope of the invention. As shown, the storage silo <b>10</b> has a cylindrical wall <b>12</b> and a conical roof <b>14</b> configured to prevent moisture and rain from entering the interior of the storage silo <b>10</b>. The cylindrical wall <b>12</b> is formed with a plurality of ring structures <b>16</b>, with each ring structure <b>16</b> formed from individual sidewall panels <b>20</b> connected end to end to form the ring structure <b>16</b>. A plurality of the ring structures <b>16</b> are stacked upon one another and attached together with fasteners to form the cylindrical wall <b>12</b> of the storage silo <b>10</b> and the roof <b>14</b> is attached to the uppermost ring structure <b>16</b>. The sidewall panels <b>20</b> are comprised of sheet metal. The sidewall panels <b>20</b> of the storage silo <b>10</b> are desirably connected to suitable channel stiffeners (not shown) as would be understood by one skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a portion of the cylindrical wall <b>12</b> is shown. The sidewall panels <b>20</b> may be comprised of any material or structure commonly utilized for the construction of storage silos <b>10</b>. Desirably, the sidewall panels <b>20</b> are made of 5 gage to 9 gage sheet metal, however other thicknesses may be used. Each sidewall panel <b>20</b> preferably comprises of an elongated rectangular structure such as, for example, 10 feet long by 4 feet high. However, one skilled in the art will understand that other sizes for the sidewall panels <b>20</b> may be used. The portion of the wall <b>12</b> shown includes a portion of a lower ring structure <b>16</b>A with sidewall panels <b>20</b> positioned end to end to form a vertical joint <b>22</b> and connected with a plurality or rows of fasteners <b>24</b>. A portion of an upper ring structure <b>16</b>B is positioned above the lower ring structure <b>16</b> to form a horizontal joint <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Turning also now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, in the illustrated embodiment the upper ring structure <b>16</b> is formed with three layered sidewall panels <b>20</b> and the lower ring structure <b>16</b> is formed with three layered sidewall panels <b>20</b>. However, one skilled in the art will understand that more or fewer layered sidewall panels <b>20</b> may be used. For example, the cylindrical wall <b>12</b> may have two layered sidewall panels <b>20</b> or may have four layered sidewall panels <b>20</b>. The three sidewall panels <b>20</b> in the lower ring structure <b>16</b>A include an inner sidewall panel <b>20</b>A, a middle sidewall panel <b>20</b>B, and an outer sidewall panel <b>20</b>C. The three sidewall panels <b>20</b> in the upper ring structure <b>16</b>B include an inner sidewall panel <b>20</b>A, a middle sidewall panel <b>20</b>B, and an outer sidewall panel <b>20</b>C. A bottom portion of the sidewall panels <b>20</b> in the upper ring structure <b>16</b>B overlays an upper portion of the sidewall panels <b>20</b> in the lower ring structure <b>16</b>A, with the upper ring structure <b>16</b>B on the outside of the lower ring structure <b>16</b>A. Each of the sidewall panels <b>20</b> has fastener holes <b>28</b> that align when the sidewall panels <b>20</b> are brought together so that a suitable fastener (e.g., bolt) <b>24</b> can pass through the aligned holes <b>28</b> of the layered sidewall panels <b>20</b> of the upper and lower ring structures <b>16</b> to form the horizontal joint <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A, <b>4</b>B and <b>4</b>C</figref>, each sidewall panel <b>20</b> has a middle portion <b>30</b>, an offset upper portion <b>32</b> and an offset lower portion <b>34</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the middle portion <b>30</b> is formed with a corrugation pattern. The corrugation pattern has a repeating shape comprising a plurality of ridges <b>40</b> alternating with a plurality of troughs <b>42</b>. In one embodiment, the corrugation pattern of the middle portion <b>30</b> is a sine wave pattern. However, other patterns may be used in the middle portion <b>30</b> such as other corrugated designs such a trapezoidal or other repeating pattern, or patterns having combination of both sine wave and trapezoidal-type patterns. Additionally, it is contemplated that the middle portion may have a flat profile without departing from the scope of the invention. As best seen in the detail of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, in one exemplary embodiment, the sidewall panel <b>20</b> has a corrugation length <b>44</b> between adjacent troughs <b>42</b> of 4.000 inches (10.160 cm) with a length <b>46</b> between adjacent ridges <b>40</b> and troughs <b>42</b> of 2.000 (5.180 cm) inches and a corrugation depth <b>48</b> of 0.500 (1.270 cm) inches. However, these dimensions are for example purposes only and other corrugation dimensions may be used.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The offset upper portion <b>32</b> and the offset lower portion <b>34</b> of the sidewall panel <b>20</b> are offset from the middle portion <b>30</b>. In one embodiment, the offset upper portion <b>32</b> and the offset lower portion <b>34</b> are formed with a shape other than the shape of the corrugation pattern of the middle portion <b>30</b>. Desirably, the offset upper portion <b>32</b> has a length <b>50</b> of between about 1.00 inches (2.54 cm) and about 3.00 inches (7.62 cm), and in one preferred embodiment has a length of 2.310 inches (5.867 cm). The offset upper portion <b>32</b> has a flat section <b>52</b> and a transition section <b>54</b> that transitions into the corrugated middle section <b>30</b> in a trough <b>42</b> of the middle section. In one embodiment, the offset upper portion <b>32</b> is offset from the deepest portion of the trough <b>42</b> by an offset distance <b>56</b> such that the offset upper portion <b>32</b> lies in a plane that extends downward through the troughs <b>42</b> of the middle portion <b>30</b>. Desirably the upper offset distance <b>56</b> is between about 0.040 inches (1.016 mm) and about 0.225 inches (5.715 mm) and in one preferred embodiment is about 0.050 inches (1.270 mm).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">As best seen in the detail of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>, the offset lower portion <b>34</b> has a flat section <b>62</b> and a transition section <b>64</b> that transitions into the middle portion <b>30</b> in a ridge <b>40</b> of the middle portion <b>30</b>. Desirably, the offset lower portion <b>34</b> has a length <b>60</b> of between about 1.00 inches (2.54 cm) and about 3.00 inches and in one preferred embodiment has a length of 1.713 inches (4.351 cm). The length <b>60</b> dimension of the offset lower portion <b>34</b> is shown as being smaller than the length <b>50</b> dimension of the offset upper portion <b>32</b>. In one embodiment, the offset lower portion <b>34</b> is offset from the peak point of the ridge <b>40</b> by an offset distance <b>66</b> such that the offset lower portion <b>34</b> lies in a plane that extends upward through the ridges <b>40</b> of the middle portion <b>30</b>. Desirably the lower offset distance <b>66</b> is between about 0.400 inches (1.016 cm) and about 0.800 inches (2.032 cm) and in one preferred embodiment is about 0.500 inches (1.270 cm).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, it is seen that the offset lower portion <b>34</b> from the upper ring section <b>16</b>B mates with the offset upper portion <b>32</b> from the lower ring section <b>16</b>A. However, one skilled in the art will understand that the offset upper portion <b>32</b> need not be completely flat, but may have some curvature as long as the offset upper portion <b>32</b> mates flushly with the offset lower portion <b>34</b> of the upwardly adjacent sidewall panel <b>20</b> to which it mates with. Additionally, where the offset upper and lower portions <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> transition into the middle portion <b>30</b> and how the offset upper and lower portions mate with each other enable the sidewall panels <b>20</b> of the cylindrical wall <b>12</b> to be substantially vertical when a plurality of ring structures <b>16</b> are formed on top of each other with the horizontal joints <b>26</b> causing little to no inward slope even if the middle portion <b>30</b> has a flat profile. This enables the position of the bolt holes <b>28</b> to be positioned in the sidewall panels <b>20</b> so that the holes <b>28</b> will align when the different layers of sidewall panels <b>20</b> are brought together. It is believed that the bolt holes <b>28</b> on the inner panel <b>20</b>A will need to be in slightly different positions than the bolt holes <b>28</b> on the outer panel <b>20</b>C such that during manufacture of the panels <b>20</b>, panels will need to be specified as an inner sidewall panel <b>20</b>A or an outer sidewall panel <b>20</b>C, using the offset upper and lower portions <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> enable a more consistent and repeatable production process.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The foregoing has broadly outlined some of the more pertinent aspects and features of the present invention.
