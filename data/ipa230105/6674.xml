Therefore, the signal receiving module <b>20</b> further includes a glitch elimination circuit <b>22</b>. The glitch elimination circuit <b>22</b> is connected between the receiving circuit <b>21</b> and the signal output terminal.

Certainly, if no signal glitch is generated by adopting the reset circuit <b>11</b> of the other structure, the glitch elimination circuit <b>22</b> can also enable the output signal RX_DATA to be smoother.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0047">In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the oscillator <b>12</b> may be used to generate the clock signal CLK.

As the high level 1 previously outputted by the NAND gate NA at the output terminal is connected to the first input terminal of the NAND gate NA through the feedback branch, the NAND gate NA outputs the low level 0, and the fourth NOT gate N<b>4</b> outputs the high level 1. Thus, the level of the clock signal CLK becomes 1.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0055">Afterwards, the reset signal RESET continues to be kept at the low level 0. As the low level 0 outputted again by the NAND gate NA at the output terminal in the previous step is connected to the first input terminal of the NAND gate NA through the feedback branch, the NAND gate NA outputs the high level 1 again and the fourth NAND gate N<b>4</b> outputs the low level 0. Thus, the level of the clock signal CLK becomes 0.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0056">Therefore, the oscillator <b>12</b> can oscillate, furthermore, starts oscillating when the reset signal RESET enters the falling edge and is kept at the low level, and is kept at the low level when the reset signal RESET is at the high level. Hence, as described above, the jitter of the duration of Td<b>2</b> is formed on the reset signal RESET by setting the reset circuit <b>11</b>, which is mainly a high level of duration of Td<b>3</b> and a low level of duration of Td<b>4</b>. Thus, when the reset signal RESET is at the high level of the duration of Td<b>3</b>, the clock signal CLK of the oscillator <b>12</b> is kept at the low level and no oscillation is generated. The oscillator <b>12</b> does not start oscillating until the reset signal RESET returns to the low level again. Once the duration of Td<b>4</b> elapses, the oscillator <b>12</b> quickly stops oscillating again.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0057">Certainly, only the preferred circuit structure of the oscillator <b>12</b> in the present invention is described above. If other oscillators <b>12</b> are used, they can also fall within the scope of protection of the present invention as long as they can achieve the object of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0058">In addition, the feedback branch further includes a fifth NOT gate N<b>5</b> and a sixth NOT gate N<b>6</b> which are sequentially connected in series. An input terminal of the fifth NOT gate N<b>5</b> is connected to the output terminal of the NAND gate NA, and an output terminal of the sixth NOT gate N<b>6</b> is connected to the first input terminal of the NAND gate NA. Therefore, the circuit of the oscillator <b>12</b> can work smoother, and the series connection of two NOT gates does not affect the implementation of the function of the oscillator <b>12</b> in the present invention.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0059">In addition, one isolation channel <b>30</b> is disposed and the isolation channel includes a first path and a second path. The first path is provided with a first capacitor C<b>1</b> and a second capacitor C<b>2</b>, and the second path is provided with a third capacitor C<b>3</b> and a fourth capacitor C<b>4</b>. The clock signal CLK of the oscillator <b>12</b> may be converted to a smooth preliminary output signal RX_DATA_<b>1</b> by charging and discharging the capacitors in the first path and the second path. Specifically, for example, when the first capacitor C<b>1</b> is charged, the third capacitor C<b>3</b> discharges to the fourth capacitor C<b>4</b>. When the first capacitor C<b>1</b> charges the second capacitor C<b>2</b>, the fourth capacitor C<b>4</b> is fully charged and discharges to the signal receiving module <b>20</b>. When the second capacitor C<b>2</b> is fully charged and discharges to the signal receiving module <b>20</b>, the third capacitor C<b>3</b> starts to charge again. Therefore, the clock signal CLK may be converted to the preliminary output signal RX_DATA_<b>1</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> by this circulation.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0060">Therefore, through the isolation channel <b>30</b>, the clock signal CLK may be converted to the preliminary output signal RX_DATA_<b>1</b>. In addition, as non-oscillation of the duration of Td<b>5</b> is formed in the clock signal CLK, the signal glitch of the duration of Td<b>6</b> is formed in the preliminary output signal RX_DATA_<b>1</b>. As mentioned above, in the present invention, the glitch elimination circuit <b>22</b> is also disposed to eliminate the signal glitch. Moreover, although the glitch elimination circuit <b>22</b> generates certain delay when eliminating the signal glitch, the phase synchronization between the preliminary output signal RX_DATA_<b>1</b> and the output signal RX_DATA is still maintained, so that the output signal RX_DATA and the input signal TX_DATA are also phase-synchronized.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0061">The present invention also relates to a digital isolator.

The digital isolator circuit <b>100</b> according to the present invention adopts the reset circuit <b>11</b> and the oscillator <b>12</b> and thus adopts the OOK modulation method with the reset function, and can achieve phase synchronization between the input signal TX_DATA and the clock signal CLK of the oscillator <b>12</b> through the reset circuit <b>11</b> while transmitting a direct current signal and an alternating current signal, thereby reducing the signal jitter generated in a signal transmission process. In addition, the area and cost of the digital isolator circuit <b>100</b> are reduced as only one digital isolation channel <b>30</b> is used.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0063">In addition, in the present invention, the reset circuit <b>11</b> includes the first delayer D<b>1</b> and the second delayer D<b>2</b> which can form the fixed delay, so that there may be a fixed phase difference between the clock signal CLK of the oscillator <b>12</b> and the input signal TX_DATA without phase accumulation, thereby achieving phase synchronization between the input signal TX_DATA and the clock signal CLK and reducing the signal jitter caused by a discrepancy of phase difference between the input signal TX_DATA and the clock signal CLK in a transmission process.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0064">Further, in the present invention, the glitch elimination circuit <b>22</b> is also adopted, can eliminate the signal glitch caused by the reset signal RESET in the preliminary output signal RX_DATA_<b>1</b>, and can also suppress the signal glitch generated by other interference sources, so that the output signal RX_DATA is smoother.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0065">In addition, it should be understood that although the description is described according to the embodiments, not every embodiment includes only one independent technical solution.
