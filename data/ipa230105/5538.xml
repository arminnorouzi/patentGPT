id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">In a memory array with a cross-point structure, at each cross-point junction a programmable resistive memory element, such as an MRAM memory cell, is connected in series with a threshold switching selector, such as an ovonic threshold switch. The threshold switching selector switches to a conducting state when a voltage above a threshold voltage is applied. When powered down for extended periods, the threshold voltage can drift upward. If the drift is excessive, this can make the memory cell difficult to access and can disturb stored data values when accessed. Techniques are presented to determine whether excessive voltage threshold drift may have occurred, including a read based test and a time based test.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure

Memory may comprise non-volatile memory or volatile memory. A non-volatile memory allows information to be stored and retained even when the non-volatile memory is not connected to a source of power (e.g., a battery).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">One example of a non-volatile memory is magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM), which uses magnetization to represent stored data, in contrast to some other memory technologies that use electronic charges to store data. Generally, MRAM includes a large number of magnetic memory cells formed on a semiconductor substrate, where each memory cell represents (at least) one bit of data. A bit of data is written to a memory cell by changing the direction of magnetization of a magnetic element within the memory cell, and a bit is read by measuring the resistance of the memory cell (low resistance typically represents a &#x201c;0&#x201d; bit and high resistance typically represents a &#x201c;1&#x201d; bit). As used herein, direction of magnetization is the direction that the magnetic moment is oriented.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Although MRAM is a promising technology, it is challenging to achieve high bit density and high endurance for fast write operations with previous MRAM memory cell designs.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Like-numbered elements refer to common components in the different figures.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram of one embodiment of a memory system connected to a host.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a block diagram of one embodiment of a Front End Processor Circuit.

The memory cells are located at the cross-point junctions of the two sets of conductive lines. Embodiments for the memory cells can include a programmable resistance element, such as an MRAM memory cell, connected in series with a selector switch. One type of selector switch is threshold switching selector, such as ovonic threshold switch, that can be implemented in a small amount of area, and without need of an additional control line, relative to other switching elements, such as a transistor. If a voltage above a certain level, the threshold voltage, is applied across a threshold switching selector, it will switch to a conducting state.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Threshold switching selectors exhibit a property of threshold voltage drift where, if not turned on for an extended period, the threshold voltage drifts to a higher value. This can make it difficult or even impossible to access the data stored on the array as the threshold voltage may exceed the maximum voltage level available on the memory device. Even if the threshold switching selector can be turned on, the resultant voltage applied across the memory when the device turns on may disturb the data stored in the memory cell or even damage the memory cell. This problem is particularly acute when a memory device is powered down for an extended period. Accordingly, the following presents techniques for inferring whether the threshold voltages of the threshold switching selectors on a memory array that has been powered down may have drifted to excessively high values. This process can be performed as part of a test in the power up process and can include a read-based test or a time-based test.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram of one embodiment of a memory system <b>100</b> connected to a host <b>120</b>. Memory system <b>100</b> can implement the technology presented herein for determining whether the threshold voltage of the threshold switching selectors used in a cross-point memory array have drifted excessively. Many different types of memory systems can be used with the technology proposed herein. Example memory systems include solid state drives (&#x201c;SSDs&#x201d;), memory cards including dual in-line memory modules (DIMMs) for DRAM replacement, and embedded memory devices; however, other types of memory systems can also be used.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Memory system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> comprises a controller <b>102</b>, non-volatile memory <b>104</b> for storing data, and local memory (e.g., DRAM/ReRAM/MRAM) <b>106</b>. Controller <b>102</b> comprises a Front End Processor (FEP) circuit <b>110</b> and one or more Back End Processor (BEP) circuits <b>112</b>. In one embodiment FEP circuit <b>110</b> is implemented on an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC). In one embodiment, each BEP circuit <b>112</b> is implemented on a separate ASIC. In other embodiments, a unified controller ASIC can combine both the front end and back end functions. The ASICs for each of the BEP circuits <b>112</b> and the FEP circuit <b>110</b> are implemented on the same semiconductor such that the controller <b>102</b> is manufactured as a System on a Chip (&#x201c;SoC&#x201d;). FEP circuit <b>110</b> and BEP circuit <b>112</b> both include their own processors. In one embodiment, FEP circuit <b>110</b> and BEP circuit <b>112</b> work as a master slave configuration where the FEP circuit <b>110</b> is the master and each BEP circuit <b>112</b> is a slave. For example, FEP circuit <b>110</b> implements a Flash Translation Layer (FTL) or Media Management Layer (MML) that performs memory management (e.g., garbage collection, wear leveling, etc.), logical to physical address translation, communication with the host, management of DRAM (local volatile memory) and management of the overall operation of the SSD (or other non-volatile storage system). The BEP circuit <b>112</b> manages memory operations in the memory packages/die at the request of FEP circuit <b>110</b>. For example, the BEP circuit <b>112</b> can carry out the read, erase, and programming processes. Additionally, the BEP circuit <b>112</b> can perform buffer management, set specific voltage levels required by the FEP circuit <b>110</b>, perform error correction (ECC), control the Toggle Mode interfaces to the memory packages, etc. In one embodiment, each BEP circuit <b>112</b> is responsible for its own set of memory packages.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In one embodiment, non-volatile memory <b>104</b> comprises a plurality of memory packages. Each memory package includes one or more memory die. Therefore, controller <b>102</b> is connected to one or more non-volatile memory die. In one embodiment, each memory die in the memory packages <b>104</b> utilize NAND flash memory (including two dimensional NAND flash memory and/or three dimensional NAND flash memory).

The host processor <b>152</b> can be any type of processor known in the art that is suitable for the implementation. Host processor <b>152</b> is in communication with a network-on-chip (NOC) <b>154</b>. A NOC is a communication subsystem on an integrated circuit, typically between cores in a SoC. NOCs can span synchronous and asynchronous clock domains or use unclocked asynchronous logic. NOC technology applies networking theory and methods to on-chip communications and brings notable improvements over conventional bus and crossbar interconnections. NOC improves the scalability of SoCs and the power efficiency of complex SoCs compared to other designs. The wires and the links of the NOC are shared by many signals. A high level of parallelism is achieved because all links in the NOC can operate simultaneously on different data packets. Therefore, as the complexity of integrated subsystems keep growing, a NOC provides enhanced performance (such as throughput) and scalability in comparison with previous communication architectures (e.g., dedicated point-to-point signal wires, shared buses, or segmented buses with bridges). Connected to and in communication with NOC <b>154</b> is the memory processor <b>156</b>, SRAM <b>160</b> and a DRAM controller <b>162</b>. The DRAM controller <b>162</b> is used to operate and communicate with the DRAM (e.g., DRAM <b>106</b>). SRAM <b>160</b> is local RAM memory used by memory processor <b>156</b>. Memory processor <b>156</b> is used to run the FEP circuit and perform the various memory operations. Also, in communication with the NOC are two PCIe Interfaces <b>164</b> and <b>166</b>. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the SSD controller will include two BEP circuits <b>112</b>; therefore, there are two PCIe Interfaces <b>164</b>/<b>166</b>. Each PCIe Interface communicates with one of the BEP circuits <b>112</b>.

The media management layer MML <b>158</b> may be integrated as part of the memory management that may handle memory errors and interfacing with the host. In particular, MML may be a module in the FEP circuit <b>110</b> and may be responsible for the internals of memory management. In particular, the MML <b>158</b> may include an algorithm in the memory device firmware which translates writes from the host into writes to the memory structure (e.g., <b>502</b>/<b>602</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref> below) of a die. The MML <b>158</b> may be needed because: 1) the memory may have limited endurance; 2) the memory structure may only be written in multiples of pages; and/or 3) the memory structure may not be written unless it is erased as a block. The MML <b>158</b> understands these potential limitations of the memory structure which may not be visible to the host.

In some embodiments, the system control logic <b>560</b> can include a state machine that provides die-level control of memory operations. In one embodiment, the state machine is programmable by software. In other embodiments, the state machine does not use software and is completely implemented in hardware (e.g., electrical circuits). In another embodiment, the state machine is replaced by a micro-controller, with the micro-controller either on or off the memory chip. The system control logic <b>560</b> can also include a power control module controls the power and voltages supplied to the rows and columns of the memory <b>502</b> during memory operations and may include charge pumps and regulator circuit for creating regulating voltages.

The memory structure may comprise any type of non-volatile memory that are monolithically formed in one or more physical levels of memory cells having an active area disposed above a silicon (or other type of) substrate.

Many different types of memory array architectures or memory technologies can be used to form memory structure <b>326</b>. No particular non-volatile memory technology is required for purposes of the new claimed embodiments proposed herein. Other examples of suitable technologies for memory cells of the memory structure <b>502</b> include ReRAM memories (resistive random access memories), magnetoresistive memory (e.g., MRAM, Spin Transfer Torque MRAM, Spin Orbit Torque MRAM), FeRAM, phase change memory (e.g., PCM), and the like. Examples of suitable technologies for memory cell architectures of the memory structure <b>502</b> include two dimensional arrays, three dimensional arrays, cross-point arrays, stacked two dimensional arrays, vertical bit line arrays, and the like.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">One example of a ReRAM cross-point memory includes reversible resistance-switching elements arranged in cross-point arrays accessed by X lines and Y lines (e.g., word lines and bit lines). In another embodiment, the memory cells may include conductive bridge memory elements. A conductive bridge memory element may also be referred to as a programmable metallization cell. A conductive bridge memory element may be used as a state change element based on the physical relocation of ions within a solid electrolyte. In some cases, a conductive bridge memory element may include two solid metal electrodes, one relatively inert (e.g., tungsten) and the other electrochemically active (e.g., silver or copper), with a thin film of the solid electrolyte between the two electrodes. As temperature increases, the mobility of the ions also increases causing the programming threshold for the conductive bridge memory cell to decrease. Thus, the conductive bridge memory element may have a wide range of programming thresholds over temperature.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Another example is magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM) that stores data using magnetic storage elements. The elements are formed from two ferromagnetic layers, each of which can hold a magnetization, separated by a thin insulating layer. One of the two layers is a permanent magnet set to a particular polarity; the other layer's magnetization can be changed to match that of an external field to store memory. A memory device is built from a grid of such memory cells. In one embodiment for programming, each memory cell lies between a pair of write lines arranged at right angles to each other, parallel to the cell, one above and one below the cell. When current is passed through them, an induced magnetic field is created. MRAM based memory embodiments will be discussed in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Phase change memory (PCM) exploits the unique behavior of chalcogenide glass.

Note that the use of &#x201c;pulse&#x201d; in this document does not require a square pulse but includes a (continuous or non-continuous) vibration or burst of sound, current, voltage light, or other wave. Said memory elements within the individual selectable memory cells, or bits, may include a further series element that is a selector, such as an ovonic threshold switch or metal insulator substrate.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">A person of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the technology described herein is not limited to a single specific memory structure, memory construction or material composition, but covers many relevant memory structures within the spirit and scope of the technology as described herein and as understood by one of ordinary skill in the art.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The elements of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> can be grouped into two parts, the structure of memory structure <b>502</b> of the memory cells and the peripheral circuitry, including all of the other elements. An important characteristic of a memory circuit is its capacity, which can be increased by increasing the area of the memory die of memory system <b>500</b> that is given over to the memory structure <b>502</b>; however, this reduces the area of the memory die available for the peripheral circuitry. This can place quite severe restrictions on these peripheral elements. For example, the need to fit sense amplifier circuits within the available area can be a significant restriction on sense amplifier design architectures. With respect to the system control logic <b>560</b>, reduced availability of area can limit the available functionalities that can be implemented on-chip. Consequently, a basic trade-off in the design of a memory die for the memory system <b>500</b> is the amount of area to devote to the memory structure <b>502</b> and the amount of area to devote to the peripheral circuitry.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Another area in which the memory structure <b>502</b> and the peripheral circuitry are often at odds is in the processing involved in forming these regions, since these regions often involve differing processing technologies and the trade-off in having differing technologies on a single die. For example, when the memory structure <b>502</b> is NAND flash, this is an NMOS structure, while the peripheral circuitry is often CMOS based. For example, elements such sense amplifier circuits, charge pumps, logic elements in a state machine, and other peripheral circuitry in system control logic <b>560</b> often employ PMOS devices. Processing operations for manufacturing a CMOS die will differ in many aspects from the processing operations optimized for an NMOS flash NAND memory or other memory cell technologies.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">To improve upon these limitations, embodiments described below can separate the elements of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> onto separately formed dies that are then bonded together. More specifically, the memory structure <b>502</b> can be formed on one die and some or all of the peripheral circuitry elements, including one or more control circuits, can be formed on a separate die. For example, a memory die can be formed of just the memory elements, such as the array of memory cells of flash NAND memory, MRAM memory, PCM memory, ReRAM memory, or other memory type. Some or all of the peripheral circuitry, even including elements such as decoders and sense amplifiers, can then be moved on to a separate die. This allows each of the memory die to be optimized individually according to its technology. For example, a NAND memory die can be optimized for an NMOS based memory array structure, without worrying about the CMOS elements that have now been moved onto a separate peripheral circuitry die that can be optimized for CMOS processing. This allows more space for the peripheral elements, which can now incorporate additional capabilities that could not be readily incorporated were they restricted to the margins of the same die holding the memory cell array. The two die can then be bonded together in a bonded multi-die memory circuit, with the array on the one die connected to the periphery elements on the other memory circuit. Although the following will focus on a bonded memory circuit of one memory die and one peripheral circuitry die, other embodiments can use more die, such as two memory die and one peripheral circuitry die, for example.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A and <b>6</b>B</figref> shows an alternative arrangement to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, which may be implemented using wafer-to-wafer bonding to provide a bonded die pair for memory system <b>600</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> shows an example of the peripheral circuitry, including control circuits, formed in a peripheral circuit or control die <b>611</b> coupled to memory structure <b>602</b> formed in memory die <b>601</b>.

It can be seen that system control logic <b>660</b>, row control circuitry <b>620</b>, and column control circuitry <b>610</b> (which may be formed by a CMOS process) are located in control die <b>608</b>. Additional elements, such as functionalities from controller <b>102</b>, can also be moved into the control die <b>608</b>. System control logic <b>660</b>, row control circuitry <b>620</b>, and column control circuitry <b>610</b> may be formed by a common process (e.g., CMOS process), so that adding elements and functionalities more typically found on a memory controller <b>102</b> may require few or no additional process steps (i.e., the same process steps used to fabricate controller <b>102</b> may also be used to fabricate system control logic <b>660</b>, row control circuitry <b>620</b>, and column control circuitry <b>610</b>). Thus, while moving such circuits from a die such as memory die of memory system <b>500</b> may reduce the number of steps needed to fabricate such a die, adding such circuits to a die such as control die <b>611</b> may not require any additional process steps.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> shows column control circuitry <b>610</b> on the control die <b>611</b> coupled to memory structure <b>602</b> on the memory die <b>601</b> through electrical paths <b>606</b>.

For reading an MRAM memory cell, the voltage differential V<sub>app </sub>can be applied in either direction; however, MRAM memory cells have a directionality and, because of this, in some circumstances there is a preference for reading in one direction over the other. For example, the optimum current amplitude to write a bit into the AP (high resistance state, HRS) may be greater than that to write to the P (low resistance state) by 50% or more, so bit error rate (read disturb) is less probable if reading to AP (2AP). Some of these circumstances and the resultant directionality of a read are discussed below. The directionality of the biasing particularly enters into some embodiments for the programming of MRAM memory cells, as is discussed further with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A and <b>10</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The following discussion will mainly be discussed with respect to a perpendicular spin transfer torque MRAM memory cell, where the free layer <b>807</b>/<b>907</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref> comprises a switchable direction of magnetization that is perpendicular to the plane of the free layer. Spin transfer torque (&#x201c;STT&#x201d;) is an effect in which the orientation of a magnetic layer in a magnetic tunnel junction can be modified using a spin-polarized current. Charge carriers (such as electrons) have a property known as spin which is a small quantity of angular momentum intrinsic to the carrier. An electric current is generally unpolarized (e.g., consisting of 50% spin-up and 50% spin-down electrons). A spin polarized current is one with more electrons of either spin (e.g., a majority of spin-up electrons or a majority of spin-down electrons). By passing a current through a thick magnetic layer (the reference layer), a spin-polarized current can be produced. If this spin-polarized current is directed into a second magnetic layer (the free layer), angular momentum can be transferred to this second magnetic layer, changing the direction of magnetization of the second magnetic layer. This is referred to as spin transfer torque. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A and <b>10</b>B</figref> illustrate the used of spin transfer torque to program or write to MRAM memory. Spin transfer torque magnetic random access memory (STT MRAM) has the advantages of lower power consumption and better scalability over MRAM variations such as toggle MRAM. Compared to other MRAM implementations, the STT switching technique requires relatively low power, virtually eliminates the problem of adjacent bit disturbs, and has more favorable scaling for higher memory cell densities (reduced MRAM cell size). The latter issue also favors STT MRAM where the free and reference layer magnetizations are orientated perpendicular to the film plane, rather than in-plane.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">As the STT phenomenon is more easily described in terms of electron behavior, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A and <b>10</b>B</figref> and their discussion are given in terms of electron current, where the direction of the write current is defined as the direction of the electron flow. Therefore, the term write current in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A and <b>10</b>B</figref> refers to an electron current. As electrons are negatively charged, the electron current will be in the opposite direction from the conventionally defined current, so that an electron current will flow from a lower voltage level towards a higher voltage level instead the conventional current flow of from a higher voltage level to a lower voltage level.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A and <b>10</b>B</figref> illustrate the writing of an MRAM memory cell by use a the STT mechanism, depicting a simplified schematic representation of an example of an STT-switching MRAM memory cell <b>1000</b> in which both the reference and free layer magnetization are in the perpendicular direction. Memory cell <b>1000</b> includes a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) <b>1002</b> comprising an upper ferromagnetic layer <b>1010</b>, a lower ferromagnetic layer <b>1012</b>, and a tunnel barrier (TB) <b>1014</b> as an insulating layer between the two ferromagnetic layers.

When the magnetization in free layer <b>1010</b> is parallel to the magnetization in reference layer RL <b>1012</b>, the resistance across the memory cell <b>1000</b> is relatively low.

To generate the electron write current <b>1050</b>, the top conductor <b>1006</b> is place at a higher voltage level than bottom conductor <b>1008</b>, due the negative charge of the electron. The electrons in the electron write current <b>1050</b> become spin-polarized as they pass through reference layer <b>1012</b> because reference layer <b>1012</b> is a ferromagnetic metal. When the spin-polarized electrons tunnel across the tunnel barrier <b>1014</b>, conservation of angular momentum can result in the imparting of a spin transfer torque on both free layer <b>1010</b> and reference layer <b>1012</b>, but this torque is inadequate (by design) to affect the magnetization direction of the reference layer <b>1012</b>. Contrastingly, this spin transfer torque is (by design) sufficient to switch the magnetization orientation in the free layer <b>1010</b> to become parallel (P) to that of the reference layer <b>1012</b> if the initial magnetization orientation of the free layer <b>1010</b> was anti-parallel (AP) to the reference layer <b>1012</b>, referred to as an anti-parallel-to-parallel (AP2P) write.

For example, electron write current <b>1052</b> is applied from conductor <b>1006</b> to conductor <b>1008</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref>, by placing the higher voltage level on the lower conductor <b>1008</b>. This will write a free layer <b>1010</b> in a P state to an AP state, referred to as a parallel-to-anti-parallel (P2AP) write. Thus, by way of the same STT physics, the direction of the magnetization of free layer <b>1010</b> can be deterministically set into either of two stable orientations by judicious choice of the electron write current direction (polarity).</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The data (&#x201c;0&#x201d; or &#x201c;1&#x201d;) in memory cell <b>1000</b> can be read by measuring the resistance of the memory cell <b>1000</b>. Low resistance typically represents a &#x201c;0&#x201d; bit and high resistance typically represents a &#x201c;1&#x201d; bit, although sometimes the alternate convention occurs. A read current can being applied across the memory cell (e.g., across the magnetic tunnel junction <b>1002</b>) by applying an electron read current from conductor <b>1008</b> to conductor <b>1006</b>, flowing as shown for <b>1050</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref> (the &#x201c;AP2P direction&#x201d;); alternatively, the electron read current can be applied from conductor <b>1006</b> to conductor <b>1008</b>, flowing as shown for <b>1052</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref> (the &#x201c;P2AP direction&#x201d;). In a read operation, if the electron write current is too high, this can disturb data stored in a memory cell and change its state. For example, if electron read current uses the P2AP direction of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref>, too high of a current or voltage level can switch any memory cells in the low resistance P state into the high resistance AP state. Consequently, although the MRAM memory cell can be read in either direction, the directional nature of the write operation may make one read direction preferable over the other in various embodiments as the P2AP direction since more current is required to write the bit in that direction.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Although the discussion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A and <b>10</b>B</figref> was in the context of electron current for the read and write currents, the subsequent discussion will be in the context of conventional current unless otherwise specified.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Whether to read or write selected memory cells in the array structures of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>D</figref>, the bit line and word line corresponding a selected is biased to place a voltage across the selected memory cell and induce the flow of electrons as illustrated with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A or <b>10</b>B</figref>. This will also apply a voltage across non-selected memory cells of the array, which can induce currents in non-selected memory cells. Although this wasted power consumption can be mitigated to some degree by designing the memory cells to have relatively high resistance levels for both high and low resistance states, this will still result in increased current and power consumption as well as placing additional design constraints on the design of the memory cells and the array.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">One approach to address this unwanted current leakage is to place a selector element in series with each MRAM or other resistive (e.g., ReRAM, PCM, and FeRAM) memory cell. For example, a select transistor can be placed in series with each resistive memory cell element in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>D</figref> so that the elements <b>701</b> are now a composite of a selector and a programmable resistance. Use of a transistor, however, requires the introduction of additional control lines to be able to turn on the corresponding transistor of a selected memory cell. Additionally, transistors will often not scale in the same manner as the resistive memory element, so that as memory arrays move to smaller sizes the use of transistor based selectors can be a limiting factor.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">An alternate approach to selector elements is the use of a threshold switching selector device in series with the programmable resistive element. A threshold switching selector has a high resistance (in an off or non-conductive state) when it is biased to a voltage lower than its threshold voltage, and a low resistance (in an on or conductive state) when it is biased to a voltage higher than its threshold voltage. The threshold switching selector remains on until its current is lowered below a holding current, or the voltage is lowered below a holding voltage. When this occurs, the threshold switching selector returns to the off state. Accordingly, to program a memory cell at a cross-point, a voltage or current is applied which is sufficient to turn on the associated threshold switching selector and set or reset the memory cell; and to read a memory cell, the threshold switching selector similarly must be activated by being turned on before the resistance state of the memory cell can be determined. One set of examples for a threshold switching selector is an ovonic threshold switching material of an Ovonic Threshold Switch (OTS).</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A and <b>11</b>B</figref> illustrate embodiments for the incorporation of threshold switching selectors into an MRAM memory array having a cross-point architecture.

(In terms of electron current, as opposed to conventional current, the electron flow will be as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref>.)</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b> and <b>13</b></figref>, a forced current approach is used, with the memory driven from the reference layer side with a read current, I<sub>read </sub>from a current source in the driver circuitry for the line. As shown <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> by the solid line <b>1201</b>, the current is raised to the I<sub>read </sub>value and held there for the duration of the current read operation.

As shown at <b>1251</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, the current across the parallel combination of the threshold switching selector and the resistive MRAM element ramps up as the threshold switching selector is in an off state. Once the voltage across threshold switching selector reaches the threshold voltage V<sub>th </sub>of the threshold switching selector at <b>1253</b>, it will turn on and switch to a low resistance state.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">Once the threshold switching selector is in the on state, the I<sub>read </sub>current will flow through the selected memory cell.

As the current level is held fixed at I<sub>read</sub>, the voltage across the memory cell will drop to a level dependent upon the series resistance of the MRAM device and the on-state resistance of the threshold switching selector. For a binary embodiment, the memory cell will have a high resistance anti-parallel state and a low resistance parallel state. The resultant voltage across the series connected MRAM device and threshold switching selector and series decode transistors directing the current into 1 of N word lines and 1 of N bit lines in response to the I<sub>read </sub>current for the high resistance state (HRS) and low resistance state (LRS) are respectively shown as <b>1255</b> and <b>1253</b>. The resultant voltage difference can then be measured by a sense amplifier to determine the data state stored in the memory cell. Although the discussion here is in the context of an MRAM based memory cell being placed in series with the threshold switching selector, this read technique can similarly be applied to other programmable resistance memory cells, such as PCM, FeRAM, or ReRAM devices.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> shows the voltage applied to the ramping up at <b>1251</b> until it reaches V<sub>th </sub>at <b>1253</b>, then dropping down to either the high resistance state level at <b>1255</b> or the low resistance state at <b>1253</b>.

Initially, before the threshold switching selector turns on, the voltage across the MRAM device will be zero as the applied voltage ramps up to the V<sub>th </sub>voltage. Once the threshold switching selector turns on, current begins to flow through the MRAM device and the voltage across the MRAM device will spike to the V<sub>th </sub>level, less the voltage V<sub>hold </sub>dropped across the threshold switching selector. Consequently, V<sub>MRAM </sub>will jump from 0V to &#x394;V=(V<sub>th</sub>&#x2212;V<sub>hold</sub>), after which it will decay down the voltage drop across the MRAM device in the low resistance state in response to the applied I<sub>read</sub>, V<sub>MRAM</sub>(LRS).</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">The rate at which the V<sub>MRAM </sub>voltage drops down to near the asymptotic V<sub>MRAM</sub>(LRS) level depends on size of the spike from the &#x201c;snapback voltage&#x201d; &#x394;V, which is the difference between (V<sub>th</sub>&#x2212;V<sub>hold</sub>) and V<sub>MRAM</sub>(LRS), and the rate at which charge can flow out of the device, which depends upon the internal resistance of the MRAM and selector when selector is turned on, the R-C characteristics of the memory cell and the lines between which it is connected between. Dissipation is faster for lower capacitance and lower resistance. This behavior has some practical consequences for the operation of the memory cell.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">A first consequence is that both the low resistance state and the high resistance state will decay as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, where <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> shows the low resistances state. The high resistance state will show similar behavior, but with a higher asymptotic state Vfinal determined by the path resistance&#xd7;the Iread. In order to distinguish between these two states, they need to be separated by a sufficient margin, so that a sensing operation cannot be performed until after enough time has passed in order for the two states to have well-defined and differentiable voltage levels.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Another consequence is that spike can disturb the data stored in the memory cell. As discussed with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A and <b>10</b>B</figref>, the state of an MRAM memory can be changed by passing a current through the memory cell, so that if the voltage across and/or current through a memory cell is high enough for long enough, it will, depending on the current's direction, change a parallel state to an anti-parallel state (a P2AP write), as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref>, or change an anti-parallel state to a parallel state (an AP2P write), as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref>. For example, the read process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b> and <b>13</b></figref> is described as performed in the P2AP direction, so that a disturb by the waveform of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> could switch a low resistance state memory cell to the high resistance state before the data state can be stored.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">As noted above, the threshold switching selector controls access to the memory cells. In particular, to apply a voltage or current to a memory cell to change its resistance state, the corresponding selector must first be switched to a conductive state by applying a sufficiently high voltage, e.g., a voltage which is higher in magnitude than the operating threshold voltage V<sub>th</sub>. When the selector is in a non-conductive state, e.g., when a voltage across the selector is lower in magnitude than the operating threshold voltage, the memory cell is isolated and retains its existing resistance state.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">The threshold voltage V<sub>th </sub>and holding voltage V<sub>hold </sub>of a threshold switching selector depends on both intrinsic and extrinsic properties of the selector, including selector material composition, thickness, electrode composition, selector liner materials, heat sinking, and cycling history. Chalcogenide selectors comprised of binary, tertiary, or quarternary alloys of Ge, Se, Te, and As, and doped with B, C, Si, N, O, Zn, and/or In can have threshold voltages ranging from 0.5 to 6V and holding voltages of 0.5-3V. The exact voltages will depend on thickness with thicker selectors generally having higher threshold voltages and possibly slightly higher offset voltages. The higher the V<sub>th </sub>value of a threshold switching selector, the more effective its off state, but larger the spike as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. Consequently, the choice of the selector design is a decision based on the particular memory application to which it will be applied.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">One characteristic of materials for threshold switching selectors, such as ovonic threshold switches, is that the threshold value voltage, V<sub>th</sub>, of the material can drift over time, becoming higher as the devices ages or, more particularly, based on the time since the threshold switching selector has last been turned on. This can cause problems such as increased error rate (bit disturbs) and reduced endurance since it requires a higher voltage be applied to turn on the threshold switching selector, so that, if the V<sub>th </sub>becomes too high, the memory cell may no longer be accessible unless the ability to generate the higher voltage level is available; and even if the memory device is able to turn on the threshold switching selector, this results in the voltage spike of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> being larger, which can increase the likelihood of a data disturb or damage to the resistive memory cell.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">The following discussion presents techniques for power off recovery for memory devices that use a threshold switching selector in series with a resistive memory element. Although presented in the context of an MRAM based cross-point memory structure, since it is the properties of threshold switching selectors that are of concern, the techniques can be more generally applied to other memory cells in which a non-volatile element, such as resistive PCM or ReRAM, is in series with a threshold switching selector. Thus, the disclosed techniques are suitable for use in any form of cross-point array where the memory cells are connected between orthogonal layer of conducting lines (e.g., Tungsten or Copper wires).</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">As discussed above, a series connected threshold switching selector, such as an ovonic threshold switch, has a voltage V<sub>th </sub>that, when applied across the selector, switches it to a lower V<sub>hold </sub>voltage for a selected memory cell. In practice, when used in an actual memory device, the values can vary with the processing involved in forming the device, so that on a given device V<sub>th </sub>range varies with processing from, for example, 1.6V to 2.35V. The V<sub>th </sub>value may increase over time due to &#x201c;drift&#x201d;, such as 10 to 50 mV per decade of time. Consequently, drift of the V<sub>th </sub>values could further increase V<sub>th </sub>variation by 500 mV across 10 decades of time, perhaps raising the higher V<sub>th </sub>values to 2.85V, for example. Although the V<sub>th </sub>may in some cases drift due to general aging or wear, the amount of drift is mainly based on the time since the memory cell was last activated and the threshold switching selector turned on. When the device is in use and powered on, techniques such as &#x201c;wear leveling&#x201d; algorithms can access each memory cell within a period of time, such as 10 hours. Through such mechanisms, V<sub>th </sub>drift can be limited during operation, but such active management of drift is not possible during power off, which can be as long as several years.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">The maximum value of V<sub>th </sub>that can be handled is limited by the available power supply on the memory device. If there is excessive V<sub>th </sub>drift during a device's power-off, the V<sub>th </sub>can exceed the voltage that the device can apply to the memory cell, which would be the power supply level minus any loss in the path to the memory cell (i.e., any leakage current times the path resistance). To overcome this, the available power supply level could be increased temporarily during power up to assure the memory cell selects and V<sub>th </sub>resets. However, this can require the introduction of circuitry, such as charge pumps and additional regulation circuitry, that would otherwise not be available on the memory device, using up area and increasing complexity and power consumption.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">Even if the needed voltage is available, any increase in V<sub>th </sub>of the threshold switching selector increases the &#x201c;snapback&#x201d; voltage, &#x394;V=(V<sub>th</sub>&#x2212;V<sub>hold</sub>), upon turn-on, and this spike (as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>) is imposed across the series connected MRAM device (or, more generally, other memory device connected in series with the threshold switching selector). The increase in &#x394;V due to a higher maximum V<sub>th </sub>can increase the probability that the bit stored in the MRAM memory cell switches before the level is stored upon selection for read. For example, reading the series connected MRAM and threshold switching selector in the write to AP direction (P2AP) risks a bit switching from P to AP, whereas a bit already in the AP state is &#x201c;safe&#x201d;. As either bit state is possible at the start of read, if the &#x394;V is too large, the data content of the MRAM device could be lost by the induced transient, producing an unrecoverable corruption of stored user data. The mechanism may be different, but other forms of memory technology (ReRAM, PCM, and so on) used with a threshold switching selector can similarly experience a data disturb or damage from such large transients.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">If data is stored in the device and then power is turned off, the device time before power-on and access of all bits can exceed the &#x201c;power on&#x201d; time of, for example, 10 hours between bit accesses in normal operations. Such time be accesses of all bits during power on may be assured, for example, by wear leveling where each bit accessed with a certain time and/or relocated. Expectations of embedded non-volatile memory (eNVM) for shelf life data retention without power-on can range out to 10 years. If the V<sub>th </sub>drifts excessively because the device is specified at 3 months, but the customer stores the device for longer without power, the device's data may need to be reloaded from storage instead of used directly from memory (e.g. &#x201c;instant on&#x201d;). Therefore, the challenge is to decide whether the V<sub>th </sub>drift has exceeded an allowed maximum value for V<sub>th </sub>and to decide whether to rely on the data stored in memory or reload.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is a high level flowchart of one embodiment for determining whether the V<sub>th </sub>of the threshold switching selector may have drifted to too high a value and that the data should be reloaded into the memory device. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b>-<b>18</b></figref> provide more detailed presentations of embodiments. In the flow of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, the process is for the operation of the memory device that has previously been programmed and in operation, and is then powered down.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">At step <b>1501</b>, the memory device is powered down. This can be part of a proper shutdown, which can be in response to a command from the control circuity of the system such as from the system control logic <b>560</b>/<b>660</b>, from controller <b>102</b>, or host <b>120</b>, or be an improper shutdown due to power loss. If the power down is a proper shutdown, in some embodiments a time value for the power down can be saved in register, such as register <b>561</b>/<b>661</b> or a register in controller <b>102</b>. For some embodiments system control logic <b>560</b>/<b>660</b> can maintain and regularly update a time stamp, which can be referred to in case of either a proper or improper shutdown.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">At some subsequent time, the device is powered up at step <b>1503</b>, where the power up command can come from the system control logic <b>560</b>/<b>660</b>, from controller <b>102</b>, or host <b>120</b>, such as part of an access request. As part of the power up procedure, step <b>1505</b> determines whether V<sub>th </sub>values of the threshold switching selectors is likely to have drifted to too high a value. Depending on the embodiment, the V<sub>th </sub>can be inferred through a test process, by tracking the time off for the device, or a combination of these, where these are respectively illustrated further by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>, and <b>18</b></figref>. If step <b>1505</b> determines that the V<sub>th </sub>values do not look to have drifted too far, if the device was powered up in order to perform a read or other operation, this operation can be performed at step <b>1507</b>.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">If step determines that the V<sub>th </sub>values have excessive drift, remedial action, such as reloading the data stored in the device, is taken at step <b>1509</b> before the operation of <b>1507</b> can be executed. The path from step <b>1509</b> is shown as a broken line as, in some embodiments, the operation may be cancelled due to the time needed for a data reload. The device can also send the controller <b>102</b> or host <b>120</b> a notification that the data should be reloaded. In some embodiments, the data can be reloaded from outside of the device, such as from other non-volatile location on the memory system or from a host serving as backup, for example from HDD or SSD. For example, if the MRAM cross-point memory is used as the local memory <b>106</b> used by the controller <b>102</b>, the data may also be stored in mass storage memory, such as the memory packages <b>104</b>, of the memory system, from where it can be reloaded. In other cases, where data is stored redundantly (as in a RAID arrangement), data on one device within the memory packages <b>104</b> can be replaced from other locations within the memory packages <b>104</b>. In other cases, the data stored on the memory device may be able to be recovered and scrubbed, so that if data can be read, even with a high number of disturbs, the data content may be recoverable through the controller's ECC capability and rewritten to the memory device.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">In one set of embodiments the threshold voltages of the threshold switching selectors is inferred as a test process during power up to determine if the drift is excessive. In the test process, a subset of the memory cells is read (or attempted to be read). The feasibility of this test depends on whether the memory interface allows a power on delay upon re-start that is long enough to conduct the test. One test is a simple turn-on detection test using the same selection circuitry of row control circuitry <b>520</b>/<b>620</b> and column control circuitry <b>510</b>/<b>610</b> that selects a memory cell in the memory array or arrays (&#x201c;tiles&#x201d;) of <b>502</b>/<b>602</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>6</b>B</figref>. Due to resistance in the wire connecting the memory cells to the array drivers <b>524</b>/<b>624</b> of the row control circuitry <b>520</b>/<b>620</b> to drive word lines and the driver circuitry <b>514</b>/<b>614</b> of the column control circuitry <b>510</b>/<b>610</b> to drive the bit lines, the voltage seen at the memory cell will differ from the voltage provided by the drivers by an amount that depends on the memory cells location. To account for this, in some embodiments the turn-on detection test can replicating this effect by accessing the &#x201c;far far&#x201d; memory cells that are furthest along the wire resistances (for example, the upper left corner of array <b>602</b> as represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>) to maximize any I-R voltage drop that might be seen on an array. If the memory cell turns on, the decision can be that V<sub>th </sub>is not excessive.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">In an alternate read test process during power up, a dedicated programmed code words (256 bit or longer) that is maintained to have a known set of values during operation can be stored in a memory array. During power up, the known, dedicated code word can be read out and the values, as read, can be compared to the known values as stored to determine the number of bit errors. If the number of bit errors exceeds a given target (e.g., 1%), the drift is determined to be excessive. For either power-up read test, to better assure worst-case is tested, both tests can be run at an adequately lower power supply voltage to assure detection of excessive drift. If the array fails the V<sub>th </sub>read test at the lower level, one possible remedial action can be to then read the memory with a higher voltage to see whether the data content can be extracted and scrubbed.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> is flowchart of one embodiment for determining excessive V<sub>th </sub>drift by use of a read test as part of the power up process. At step <b>1601</b> a power on command is received by the memory device, such as the memory device <b>500</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> or the memory die <b>601</b> or memory system <b>600</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A and <b>6</b>B</figref>. The power up command can come from the system control logic <b>560</b>/<b>660</b>, from controller <b>102</b>, or host <b>120</b>, depending on the level at which the preceding power-down occurred.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">At step <b>1603</b> the power up sequence begins. In addition to the usual operations involved, a read test on a selected subset of the memory cells is performed to determine whether there has been substantial V<sub>th </sub>drift while the device was powered down. The read test can be performed as in the examples described above, such as reading a word line or bit line from one or more arrays on the device, such by accessing the &#x201c;far far&#x201d; memory cells that are furthest from the drivers <b>524</b>/<b>624</b> and <b>514</b>/<b>614</b> along the conducting lines connecting the memory cells to the access circuitry, or such as by reading out a set of memory cells that store a known pattern of data for this purpose. To ensure sufficient operating margins, for any of these read tests, the test can be performed using read voltage and/or current levels from the array drivers <b>524</b>/<b>624</b> and driver circuitry <b>514</b>/<b>614</b> that are reduced relative to the levels used in a standard data access read operation. In some embodiments, if the reduced voltage and/or current is insufficient to turn on some or all of the threshold switching selectors, that standard read levels or even an elevated read level may be applied by the array drivers <b>524</b>/<b>624</b> and driver circuitry <b>514</b>/<b>614</b> to see whether this is sufficient to turn on the threshold switching selectors.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">As discussed with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, it is possible for the threshold voltage of drifted threshold switching selectors to exceed the maximum voltage that is applied during the selection process. In this case a threshold switching selector will not turn during the data reloading process and the user data on the chip will be corrupted. To ensure that the drifted threshold switching selectors turn on, in some embodiments the maximum available voltage can be temporary increased. The maximum available voltage can be increased by increasing the voltage available to the row control circuitry <b>520</b>/<b>620</b>, column control circuitry <b>510</b>/<b>610</b>, or both during the turn-on ramp by the control circuits. If the available voltage is already limited by the supply voltage, the supply voltage can be temporarily increased through circuitry (e.g., regulators or charge pumps in power generation circuits in the system control logic <b>560</b>/<b>660</b>). The higher available voltage is picked to ensure a sufficiently low failure rate of threshold switching selectors not turning on. For example, the increase in available voltage can range between 0.1-1.0 V. Once all of the threshold switching selectors on the memory die have been cycled with the higher voltage, the available voltage is returned back to the normal value used in a data read, and the data can be reloaded from storage. The need to cycle all selectors prior to data reload can be avoided if the data reload process cycles all of the selectors on the chip. The higher available supply voltage can allow higher gate voltages to be applied to transistors in row control circuitry <b>520</b>/<b>620</b> and column control circuitry <b>510</b>/<b>610</b>, as well as higher source and drain voltages. Both have the affect of increasing the available voltage and current that can be supplied by the control circuitry to the crosspoint array. If the selection process is performed by circuitry that is capable of sourcing a requested current rather than a requested voltage, the higher available voltage enables a higher current to be sourced, which in turn allows a higher voltage to be applied to the selected cell.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">Step <b>1605</b> determines whether the device passes the test. The test can be performed by the system control logic <b>560</b>/<b>660</b>, for example, while in other embodiments it can be performed at a higher level in the system. For example, if test involved decoding of ECC codewords, the test can be performed at the controller <b>102</b> in order to use the ECC engines <b>226</b>/<b>256</b>. For a simple read operation, the test can just be to see if the subset of memory cells, or some threshold number of the subset, fail to turn on by detecting if current flows through the memory cell at either the low or high resistance level.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">If the read test is for an embodiment that reads a set of memory cells storing a predetermined pattern, the test can be a comparison in the system control logic <b>560</b>/<b>660</b> to just compare the data as read with the data of the known pattern as stored. For example, the system control logic <b>560</b>/<b>660</b> could maintain a copy of the data pattern in the registers <b>561</b>/<b>661</b>. The determination of step <b>1605</b> can then be based on whether the data as read matches the pattern, or matches within a threshold bit error rate.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">If the memory array or arrays pass the V<sub>th </sub>read test at step <b>1605</b>, the power up process can complete and the read, program, or other operation for which the array was powered up, can be executed at step <b>1611</b>. If instead the test is not passed at step <b>1605</b>, at step <b>1607</b> the system control logic <b>560</b>/<b>660</b> can notify the controller <b>102</b> and/or host <b>120</b> that there has likely been excessive V<sub>th </sub>drift. At step <b>1611</b> the data is then reloaded at step <b>1609</b>, which can be performed as described above with respect to step <b>1509</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>. Depending on embodiment, a number of variations are available at steps <b>1607</b> and <b>1609</b>. For example, in response to the notification at step <b>1607</b>, the controller <b>102</b> or the host <b>120</b> may instruct the memory <b>500</b>/<b>600</b> to go ahead and try to read or otherwise access the memory before, or instead of, reloading the data at step <b>1609</b>. For example, if the test was performed using reduced read voltages and/or current levels, an access can be attempted at the standard or even raised level for the voltage and/or current levels. As the reload can take a large amount of time, the host <b>120</b> or controller <b>102</b> may decide to wait and continue with the access at step <b>1611</b> once the data is reloaded, or may decide to cancel the operation or access that data from a redundant storage location, if available. In some embodiments, the reload could be performed in a prioritized manner, where the data that was to be accessed is reloaded and provided to the host first, before reloading data at other addresses in what could be a background operation.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">In another set of embodiments, a power off tracking approach can be used. In this approach, the controller <b>102</b>, system, or (if not also powered down) control logic <b>560</b>/<b>660</b> can keep track of the time &#x201c;off&#x201d; or disabled by the device using its serial ID on-chip, such as by maintaining and regularly updating a time stamp, and thereby track the duration of the time-off to determine if the unpowered time is excessive. In other embodiments, the time at power off can be logged, such in the registers <b>561</b>/<b>661</b> on the system control logic <b>560</b>/<b>660</b> of memory device or at the level of the system or controller <b>102</b>, and read as a mode register upon power up to determine if power-off time was excessive. If the time since the preceding power down exceeds some threshold value, such as 3 months for example, the controller <b>102</b>, host <b>120</b>, or system control logic <b>560</b>/<b>660</b> can determine whether the V<sub>th </sub>could have increased excessively, and decide to re-load the data instead of relying the data as stored, since the data's bit error rate BER may increase excessively and not be recoverable unless re-loaded.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> is flowchart of one embodiment for determining whether there may be excessive V<sub>th </sub>drift by a power off tracking approach based upon the amount of time that memory device was powered down.

The step <b>1703</b> will differ from step <b>1603</b> in how the memory determines whether the V<sub>th </sub>values are likely to have drifted too much.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">More specifically, in step <b>1703</b> a power off tracking approach is used. As discussed two paragraphs above, the controller <b>102</b>, system, or (if not also powered down) control logic <b>560</b>/<b>660</b> can keep track of the time &#x201c;off&#x201d;, by maintaining and regularly updating a time stamp or by logging, the time at power, such as by using the registers <b>561</b>/<b>661</b> or at the level of the system or controller <b>102</b>, and read as a mode register upon power up to determine if power-off time was excessive. Step <b>1705</b> determines whether the device passes the test, where the test can be performed by the system control logic <b>560</b>/<b>660</b>, for example, while in other embodiments it can be performed at a higher level in the system. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, the test is based on the time since the preceding power down and determining whether it exceeds some threshold value, such as 3 months for example.
