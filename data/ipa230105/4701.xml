id="p-0028" num="0027">The following disclosure provides many different embodiments, or examples, for implementing different features of the provided subject matter. Specific examples of components, values, operations, materials, arrangements, or the like, are described below to simplify the present disclosure. These are, of course, merely examples and are not intended to be limiting. Other components, values, operations, materials, arrangements, or the like, are contemplated. For example, the formation of a first feature over or on a second feature in the description that follows may include embodiments in which the first and second features are formed in direct contact, and may also include embodiments in which additional features may be formed between the first and second features, such that the first and second features may not be in direct contact. In addition, the present disclosure may repeat reference numerals and/or letters in the various examples. This repetition is for the purpose of simplicity and clarity and does not in itself dictate a relationship between the various embodiments and/or configurations discussed.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Further, spatially relative terms, such as &#x201c;beneath,&#x201d; &#x201c;below,&#x201d; &#x201c;lower,&#x201d; &#x201c;above,&#x201d; &#x201c;upper&#x201d; and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. The spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. The apparatus may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein may likewise be interpreted accordingly.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, a combined circuit cell includes a main circuit between a group-one circuit and a group-two circuit. A group-one isolation structure separates a group-one active-region structure into a first part in the group-one circuit and a second part in a first adjacent circuit. A group-two isolation structure separates a group-two active-region structure into a first part in the group-two circuit and a second part in a second adjacent circuit. In some embodiments, each of the active-region structures includes channel regions, source regions, and drain regions of transistors. Even though the combined circuit cell in a layout design generated by an auto placement and routing (APR) program is still subject to layout environment changes, the main circuit's dependency on the layout environment is reduced. Because the group-one circuit and the group-two circuit separate the main circuit from the adjacent circuits, the variations/uncertainties of the time delays of the main circuit due to the layout environment changes are reduced, as compared with some alternative implementations in which the main circuit is used directly placed in the layout design by the APR program.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>C</figref> are schematic layout diagrams of integrated circuits <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B, and <b>100</b>C, in accordance with some embodiments.
