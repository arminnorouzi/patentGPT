Technical Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a tank holding device.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">For example, there is known a tank holding device described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2016-070467 (JP 2016-070467 A). In this tank holding device, a tank is placed in a support member having a recess for storing the tank, and is held by tightening the tank with bands from a side opposite to the support member for the tank. In this tank holding device, one end of the band is fixed to the support member with a bolt. The other end of the band is fixed to the support member while being urged by a coil spring. The band receives an urging force of the coil spring and is pressed against the outer peripheral surface of the tank.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Recently, studies have been conducted to hold a tank by using a band having a leaf spring structure instead of the coil spring in order to reduce the size of the tank holding device. When a large stress is applied to the band having the leaf spring structure, however, the leaf spring may be stroked excessively and deformed irreversibly.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present disclosure provides a tank holding device capable of preventing irreversible deformation of a band.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A tank holding device according to one aspect of the present disclosure includes a band configured to tighten a tank. The band includes a band-shaped base portion extending along an outer circumference of the tank, a plurality of pressing portions projecting from both sides of the base portion in a width direction orthogonal to a longitudinal direction of the base portion and configured to apply a pressing force to an outer peripheral surface of the tank by elastically deforming in abutment against the outer peripheral surface of the tank, and a deformation limiting portion configured to limit deformation of the pressing portions to a specified amount.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the tank holding device according to the one aspect of the present disclosure, the band includes the deformation limiting portion configured to limit the deformation of the pressing portions to the specified amount. Even if a large stress is applied to the band due to vibration, impact, or the like, the deformation limiting portion limits the deformation of the pressing portions to the specified amount. Thus, it is possible to prevent irreversible deformation of the band.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the tank holding device according to the one aspect of the present disclosure, the deformation limiting portion may be provided on the base portion, and a length of the deformation limiting portion in a direction from the base portion toward the outer peripheral surface of the tank may be set to limit the deformation of the pressing portions to the specified amount by abutment of the deformation limiting portion against the outer peripheral surface of the tank.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the tank holding device according to the one aspect of the present disclosure, the specified amount may be set to use the pressing portions in an elastic region. Thus, it is possible to reliably prevent the irreversible deformation of the band.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the tank holding device according to the one aspect of the present disclosure, the pressing portion may include a tip portion at a distal end in a direction in which the pressing portion projects from the base portion, and a part of the tip portion may include a tab parallel to the outer peripheral surface of the tank.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the tank holding device according to the one aspect of the present disclosure, the deformation limiting portion may be a part of the band that projects toward the tank. Thus, the deformation limiting portion can be formed by using a part of the band without increasing the number of components. As a result, it is possible to suppress an increase in cost along with the formation of the deformation limiting portion.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the tank holding device according to the one aspect of the present disclosure, the deformation limiting portion may include a cut-up piece that is a part of the base portion bent toward the tank.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the tank holding device according to the one aspect of the present disclosure, the deformation limiting portion may include a projecting piece projecting toward the tank from an end of the base portion in the width direction, and the projecting piece may be arranged between the pressing portions adjacent to each other in the longitudinal direction of the base portion.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In the tank holding device according to the one aspect of the present disclosure, the deformation limiting portion may include a dome-shaped raised portion in which a surface of the base portion facing the tank projects toward the tank.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the tank holding device according to the one aspect of the present disclosure, the deformation limiting portion may be a stopper member attached to the base portion. Thus, the deformation limiting portion can easily be formed without processing the band.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the tank holding device according to the one aspect of the present disclosure, the stopper member may have a block shape and may be fixed to a surface of the base portion facing the tank.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the tank holding device according to the one aspect of the present disclosure, the stopper member may be elongated to extend along the longitudinal direction of the base portion and may be fixed to a surface of the base portion facing the tank.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to the tank holding device of the one aspect of the present disclosure, the irreversible deformation of the band can be prevented.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Features, advantages, and technical and industrial significance of exemplary embodiments of the disclosure will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which like signs denote like elements, and wherein:</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a plan showing a tank holding device according to an embodiment;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a sectional view taken along a line II-II in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a sectional view taken along a line III-III in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an enlarged view showing a portion C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a partial perspective view showing a band;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a sectional view taken along a line VI-VI in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a sectional view for explaining a function of a deformation limiting portion;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a partial perspective view showing a modification of the band;</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a partial perspective view showing Modification 1 of the deformation limiting portion;</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a sectional view taken along a line X-X in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a partial perspective view showing Modification 2 of the deformation limiting portion;</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a sectional view taken along a line XII-XII in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a partial perspective view showing Modification 3 of the deformation limiting portion; and</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is a partial perspective view showing Modification 4 of the deformation limiting portion.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Hereinafter, a tank holding device according to an embodiment of the present disclosure will be described with reference to the drawings.

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>3</b></figref>, a tank held by the tank holding device is also shown to facilitate understanding of the structure of the tank holding device. A tank holding device <b>10</b> of the present embodiment is a device for holding, for example, a hydrogen tank <b>1</b> mounted on a fuel cell electric vehicle (not shown) and fixing the hydrogen tank <b>1</b> to the body of the fuel cell electric vehicle. Prior to description of the tank holding device <b>10</b>, the structure of the hydrogen tank <b>1</b> will briefly be described.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Hydrogen Tank</heading><p id="p-0037" num="0036">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the hydrogen tank <b>1</b> is a substantially cylindrical container with both ends rounded in a dome shape. The hydrogen tank <b>1</b> includes a liner <b>2</b> having a storage space for storing high-pressure hydrogen, and a reinforcing layer <b>4</b> provided in close contact with the outer peripheral surface of the liner <b>2</b>. The liner <b>2</b> includes a cylindrical body <b>2</b><i>a </i>and substantially hemispherical domes <b>2</b><i>b </i>provided at both right and left ends of the body <b>2</b><i>a</i>. Openings are formed at the top of the two domes <b>2</b><i>b</i>, and metal caps <b>3</b> are internally inserted into these openings.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The liner <b>2</b> is made of, for example, a resin material having a gas barrier property against hydrogen gas. Examples of the resin material include thermoplastic resins such as polyamide, polyethylene, ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer resin (EVOH), and polyester, and thermosetting resins such as epoxy. The cap <b>3</b> is made of a metal material such as aluminum. A member such as a valve is attached to the cap <b>3</b>. The reinforcing layer <b>4</b> is formed, for example, such that fibers impregnated with a thermosetting resin are wound around the outer peripheral surface of the liner <b>2</b> by a plurality of turns. The fiber is made of a composite material in which, for example, carbon fiber, glass fiber, or aramid fiber is put in plastic to improve the strength.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The hydrogen tank <b>1</b> having such a structure is held by the tank holding device <b>10</b> at two points in a direction of an axis L of the hydrogen tank <b>1</b>. The number of points where the hydrogen tank <b>1</b> is held by the tank holding device <b>10</b> is not limited to two, and may be, for example, three or more. When the tank holding device <b>10</b> and a neck mount member for fixing each cap <b>3</b> are used in combination, the hydrogen tank <b>1</b> may be held by the tank holding device <b>10</b> only at one point.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">Tank Holding Device</heading><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The tank holding device <b>10</b> includes a pair of upper and lower holding members (first holding member <b>11</b><i>a </i>and second holding member <b>11</b><i>b</i>), and holds the hydrogen tank <b>1</b> by using these holding members. Specifically, the first holding member <b>11</b><i>a </i>is arranged on the upper half circumference of the hydrogen tank <b>1</b>, and the second holding member <b>11</b><i>b </i>is arranged on the lower half circumference of the hydrogen tank <b>1</b>. In this state, the ends of the first holding member <b>11</b><i>a </i>and the second holding member <b>11</b><i>b </i>are fastened to each other by fastening members <b>30</b>. By tightening the hydrogen tank <b>1</b> between the first holding member <b>11</b><i>a </i>and the second holding member <b>11</b><i>b </i>in this way, the tank holding device <b>10</b> holds the hydrogen tank <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The first holding member <b>11</b><i>a </i>and the second holding member <b>11</b><i>b </i>have the same structure.

The width of the reinforcing plate <b>12</b> is substantially equal to the width of the band <b>13</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, the reinforcing plate <b>12</b> overlaps the end of the band <b>13</b> to press the end of the band <b>13</b> from an outer side of the band <b>13</b> (upper or lower side of the band <b>13</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>). An end <b>12</b><i>c </i>of the reinforcing plate <b>12</b> closer to the hydrogen tank <b>1</b> has an arc shape to warp outward in conformity with the curved shape of the band <b>13</b>. Thus, it is possible to attain an effect of suppressing interference of the end <b>12</b><i>c </i>of the reinforcing plate <b>12</b> with the band <b>13</b> to prevent the end <b>12</b><i>c </i>from damaging the band <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the reinforcing plate <b>12</b> has a relatively small through hole <b>12</b><i>a </i>and a relatively large through hole <b>12</b><i>b</i>.
