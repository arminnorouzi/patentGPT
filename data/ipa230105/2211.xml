The first cushioning element includes a central cushioning area and a peripheral engagement area, which is located outside of and adjacent to at least a portion of the outer periphery of the first cushioning element.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The first cushioning element, which is defined from a first cushioning material, may include walls that define an outer periphery of the first cushioning structure, as well as columnar cushioning cells. The columnar cushioning cells may be arranged in an array. The first cushioning material, as well as the thicknesses of the walls, may enable the columnar cushioning cells to buckle. A first surface of the central cushioning area may be defined by first ends of the walls and coincide with first ends of the columnar cushioning cells. A second surface of the central cushioning area, which is opposite from the first surface, may be defined by second ends of the walls and coincide with second ends of the columnar cushioning cells, which second ends are opposite from the first ends of the columnar cushioning cells. A distance (or distances) between the first surface and the second surface of the central cushioning area define a thickness (or thicknesses, or an average thickness) of the first cushioning element. The thickness of the central cushioning area may be referred to as a &#x201c;cushioning thickness&#x201d; of the first cushioning element.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Without limiting the scope of this disclosure, the central cushioning area of the first cushioning element may be configured and/or made in the same manners as the cushions described by any of U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,749,111, 6,026,527, 6,413,458, 7,666,341, 8,424,137, 8,434,748, 8,628,067, 8,919,750, and 8,932,692, the entire disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The peripheral engagement area of the first cushioning element may be formed integrally with the central cushioning area of the first cushioning element and, thus, from the same material as that used to form the central cushioning area (e.g., the first cushioning material, etc.). The peripheral engagement area may be located outside of and adjacent to at least a portion of an outer periphery of the central cushioning area. In some embodiments, the peripheral engagement area may include engagement features that are spaced apart from one another at various locations outside of the central cushioning area. In other embodiments, the peripheral engagement area may surround at least a portion of central cushioning area; e.g., it may comprise at least one continuous structure that is positioned adjacent to at least portions of two or more sides of the central cushioning area (e.g., at least portions of two sides, one side and at least portions of two connecting sides, two sides and at least portions of two connecting sides, etc.). In still other embodiments, the peripheral engagement area may completely surround the central cushioning area.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The engagement features of the peripheral engagement area of the first cushioning element may comprise any feature that can be mechanically engaged by corresponding, even complementary, features of the second cushioning element. The engagement features may comprise engagement cells, which may be defined by one or more walls. Engagement cells may comprise full cells, the entire peripheries of which are defined by one or more walls that may be longitude when the first cushioning element is oriented horizontally, or partial cells, in which one or more of the walls that define the engagement cell that lacks at least a portion of at least one wall (e.g., includes an opening (e.g., a gap along the height of the engagement cell, etc.)) or that is capable of being opened (e.g., comprise a gap or a cut that defines a flap, etc.). The walls of the cells, whether full or partial, may be solid (i.e., they may lack openings, or &#x201c;windows&#x201d;) or they may include openings. The first cushioning material of the peripheral engagement area may define flanges and other structures that may be configured to be securely engaged by corresponding, even complementary, features of the second cushioning element. In any event, portions of the second cushioning element that engage the peripheral engagement area of the first cushioning element may overlie (i.e., cover an upper surface of) the peripheral engagement area, underlie (i.e., cover a lower surface of) the peripheral engagement area, or overlie and underlie (i.e., cover upper and lower surfaces of) the peripheral engagement area.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A thickness (or thicknesses or an average thickness) of the peripheral engagement area, which may be referred to as an &#x201c;engagement thickness&#x201d; of the first cushioning element, may be defined by a distance (or distances) between a first surface of the peripheral engagement area and an opposite, second surface of the peripheral engagement area. The first and second surfaces of the peripheral engagement area may correspond to (e.g., face in the same general directions as, be continuous with, etc.) the first and second surfaces of the cushioning area.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, including those where the second cushioning element is thicker than the first cushioning element or increases a thickness of the composite cushion, the engagement thickness of the peripheral engagement area of the first cushioning element may be less than, substantially the same as, or the same as the cushioning thickness of the central cushioning area of the first cushioning element. In embodiments where the second cushioning element has a thickness that is the same as or about the same as the thickness of the first cushioning element or the thickness of the second cushioning element will not contribute to the thickness of the composite cushion or will not significantly increase the thickness of the composite cushion, the engagement thickness may be less than the cushioning thickness.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The first cushioning material of the first cushioning element may comprise any suitable cushioning material. Without limitation, the first cushioning material may comprise a suitable elastic, resilient material or a suitable viscoelastic material. The first cushioning material may define walls that are solid, open-celled, close-celled (e.g., cells that are defined only by the first cushioning material; cells that are defined by microspheres, microcapsules, etc.; etc.), or walls that have other configurations. Some nonlimiting examples of gel materials that may be used as the first cushioning material are disclosed by U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,994,450 and 7,964,664, the entire disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein. These types of materials are relatively heavy.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The second cushioning element of a composite cushion according to this disclosure, which is positioned adjacent to the first cushioning element and may partially or completely laterally surround the first cushioning element, may mechanically engage engagement features of the first cushioning element. In this regard, the second cushioning element may be formed complementarily to, and even formed on, the peripheral cushioning area of the first cushioning element. In specific embodiments, a second cushioning material of the second cushioning element may extend into and even through engagement cells of the peripheral engagement area of the first cushioning element, interlocking the second cushioning element and the first cushioning element.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The second cushioning material of the second cushioning element of a composite cushion according to this disclosure may be the same as the first cushioning material of the first cushioning element or different from the first cushioning material of the first cushioning element. In some embodiments, the second cushioning material may comprise a lightweight cushioning material. The use of materials that are relatively light in conjunction with a relatively heavy first cushioning element to form a composite cushion may provide for a relatively lightweight cushion when compared with the weight of a cushion that is made primarily from or completely from the relatively heavy first cushioning material, while providing for a composite cushion that provides the benefits of a cushion made from the first cushioning material and having the configuration of the first cushioning element. The second cushioning material may also provide the composite cushion with a desired shape, which the first cushioning material may or may not be able to provide. A wide variety of materials may be used to form the second cushioning element of a composite cushion according to this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments, the second cushioning element of a composite cushion may be located adjacent to or at least partially surround the first cushioning element of the composite cushion, with both major surfaces (i.e., the first and second surfaces) of the first cushioning element remaining exposed. In some of those embodiments, where the second cushioning element completely surrounds an outer periphery of the first cushioning element, the second cushioning element may serve as a &#x201c;racetrack&#x201d; around the first cushioning element.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In embodiments where one or both major surfaces of the first cushioning element remain exposed, edges of corresponding surfaces of the first and second cushioning elements may be flush or substantially flush, imparting the composite cushion with a continuous surface. Such a continuous surface may be flat, or it may have a contour.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In other embodiments, a composite cushion may include a second cushioning element that extends over at least a portion, or even an entirety of, at least one major surface of a central cushioning area of a first cushioning element. In such an embodiment, a relief layer may be positioned between superimposed portions of the central cushioning area of the first cushioning element and the second cushioning element. The relief layer may comprise any suitable flexible sheet, such as a cloth (e.g., a non-stretch cloth, a two-way stretchable cloth, a four-way stretchable cloth, etc.), a sheet of another material (e.g., polymer, quasi-woven polymer, woven polymer, etc.), etc. The relief layer may be positioned against, but not adhered or otherwise secured to the surface of the central cushioning area of the first cushioning element, which may enable the superimposed portions of the central cushioning area and the second cushioning element to move somewhat independently of one another. Such an arrangement may enable each of the first cushioning element and the second cushioning element to function in a desired manner (e.g., substantially constant cushioning and resistance across the second cushioning element; buckling of the first cushioning element under focused forces, while providing support to distributed forces; etc.) without significant interference from one another (e.g., the ability of the first cushioning element to buckle at locations where forces are focused will not be significantly diminished by a scrim that has been adhered or otherwise secured to the first cushioning element to prevent the second cushioning material from entering into the columnar cushioning cells of the first cushioning element when the second cushioning element is formed or secured to the first cushioning element, etc.).</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Alternatively, portions of a second cushioning element that overlie all or part of the central cushioning area of a first cushioning element may directly contact the central cushioning area of the first cushioning element. For example, ends (e.g., top ends, etc.) of at least some cells of the central cushioning area of the first cushioning element may be at least partially closed (e.g., by a membrane, etc.). In a specific embodiment, some of the cells of the central cushioning area may be completely closed, while other cells may be partially closed (e.g., with openings through a membrane, etc.) to impart the central cushioning area with breathability through its thickness. The closed ends of such a central cushioning area may provide a surface that is capable of supporting portions of the second cushioning element that are disposed thereover.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The first and second cushioning elements of a composite cushion according to this disclosure may provide the essential elements of a cushion, or they may serve as a base for an even larger composite cushion. In a specific embodiment, a cushion comprising a bladder filled with a deformable material that includes acrylic microspheres dispersed throughout or held together by a viscous material may be positioned over a base that comprises a composite cushion with first and second cushioning elements, as disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In another aspect, methods for fabricating, or making, composite cushions are disclosed. Such a method includes forming a first cushioning element from a first cushioning material. The first cushioning element is formed to include walls. The walls define columnar cushioning cells in a central cushioning area and engagement features in a peripheral engagement area, with the peripheral engagement area being located adjacent to at least a portion of an outer periphery of the central cushioning area. The engagement features may include engagement cells, flanges, or other structures that protrude from the outer periphery of the central cushioning area.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">A second cushioning element of the composite cushion is formed with a second cushioning material. As the second cushioning element is formed, portions of the second cushioning element may be defined that include shapes that complement the shapes of the engagement features of the peripheral engagement area of the first cushioning element. In embodiments where the engagement features comprise engagement cells, the second cushioning material may be introduced into and through the engagement cells to lock the second cushioning element onto the first cushioning element. In embodiments where the engagement features comprise flanges or other structures, the second cushioning element may form around and extend into recesses of the flanges, locking the second cushioning element onto the flanges.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The first cushioning element may be formed by a variety of suitable processes, including by the use of molds (e.g., by injecting the first cushioning material (e.g., a gel, etc.) into a mold, etc.). Once a first cushioning element has been formed, it may be placed into another mold. In some embodiments, a relief layer may be applied to at least a portion of the first cushioning element. The relief layer may be placed on the first cushioning element without adhering to or otherwise being secured to the first cushioning element. With the first cushioning element and any relief layer(s) in the mold, the second cushioning material (e.g., a rise in place foam, etc.) may be introduced into (e.g., injected, etc.) the mold to form the second cushioning element, including any engagement features thereof, laterally adjacent to at least a portion of the first cushioning element. In embodiments where the second cushioning material is applied directly to the central cushioning area of the first cushioning element and the second cushioning material enters into cells of the central cushioning area, the second cushioning material may be removed from those cells after the second cushioning element has been formed.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Other aspects, as well as features and advantages of various aspects of the disclosed subject matter will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art through consideration of the ensuing description, the accompanying drawings, and the appended claims.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the drawings:</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a cross-sectional representation of an embodiment of a composite cushion according to this disclosure, showing embodiments of a first cushioning element that of the composite cushion and a second cushioning element that at least partially surrounds a periphery of the first cushioning element and that at least partially covers a top surface of the first cushioning element;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a partial perspective view of the first cushioning element of the composition cushion shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in which a peripheral engagement area of the first cushioning element has a stepped configuration relative to an outer periphery of a central cushioning area of the first cushioning element;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a cross-sectional representation of another embodiment of composite cushion that includes the first cushioning element of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, with a second cushioning element that at least partially surrounds a periphery of the first cushioning element;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a top view of the composite cushion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a partial perspective view of another embodiment of first cushioning element, in which a peripheral engagement area of the first cushioning element tapers downward from an outer periphery of a central cushioning area of the first cushioning element;</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a cross-sectional representation of the embodiment of the first cushioning element shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a cross-sectional representation of yet another embodiment of composite cushion, including yet another embodiment of first cushioning element, in which a peripheral engagement area of the first cushioning element comprises flanges that protrude from an outer periphery of a central cushioning area of the first cushioning element;</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a cross-sectional representation of a cushioning system that includes still another embodiment of a composite cushion according to this disclosure, as well as a third cushioning element that has been assembled with the composite cushion;</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a partial perspective view of another embodiment of first cushioning element, in which ends of cells of a central cushioning area are at least partially closed; and</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a cross-sectional representation of an embodiment of composite cushion that includes an embodiment of first cushioning element that includes a central cushioning area with cells that have ends that are at least partially closed.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0035" num="0034">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an embodiment of a composite cushion <b>1</b> according to this disclosure is depicted.
