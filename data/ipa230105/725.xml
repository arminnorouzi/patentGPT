In particular, the disclosure relates to dental adhesives, dental composites, dental pit and fissure sealants, dental sealants, and the like.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Demineralization of dental structures is well known to lead to caries, decayed dentin, cementum, and/or enamel, conditions that typically require treatment with a dental restorative, for example. The restoration of destroyed or decayed tooth structures can be achieved through the use of various materials including dental amalgams, glass ionomer cements, composite resins, porcelain, or gold.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The use of amalgam became popular in the west in the 19th century. Amalgam restorations have the following advantages: proven clinical longevity, established and simple-to-use, good mechanical properties, and inexpensiveness. However, amalgam restorations have the following disadvantages: mercury content (relating to biocompatibility and environmental burden), unaesthetic, retention preparation requirements, and dentin discoloration. A gradual phasing out of amalgam however is largely supported and inevitable, thus alternative basic filling products are long overdue.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Glass ionomer cements were invented in the late 1960's and introduced to the market soon after. They are water-based, self-adhesive restorative materials in which the filler is a reactive glass called fluoroaluminosilicate glass and the matrix is a polymer or copolymer of carboxylic acids. Glass ionomers combine silicate and zinc polycarboxylate materials so as to incorporate the desirable characteristics of both. The fluoroaluminosilicate glass filler is ion-leachable (only fluoride) but avoids the susceptibility to dissolution (a disadvantage in silicates) by substituting phosphoric acid with the polymeric carboxylic acids of zinc polycarboxylate materials. Glass ionomer cements are supplied as two-part powder/liquid systems (often as capsules) that are mixed (using an amalgamator) at the time of use, which is not user friendly. The setting reaction of the powder/liquid mix into a conventional glass ionomer cement is an acid-base reaction. The dissolved poly(acrylic) acid (in the liquid) reacts with the alkaline surface of the glass (in the powder) in a &#x201c;neutralization reaction&#x201d; producing water and a salt, and are typically exothermic (i.e. generating heat). The advantages of glass ionomer cements include: fluoride ion release, self-setting (i.e. no requirement for a light curing unit), and low cost. The disadvantages of glass ionomer cements include: poor mechanical properties, limited indications for use, unsuitable for stress bearing restorations, and poor aesthetics.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Over the past couple of decades, photopolymerizable dental composites have become the overwhelming preferred method for restoring tooth structure. A typical method for treating a tooth involves the sequential application of a dental adhesive followed by a dental restorative material (e.g. dental composite) to the affected tooth structure. Often the affected tooth structure is pretreated to improve the bonding of the adhesive to the dentin or the enamel of the affected tooth structure. For example, the bonding process may include three steps: (1) etching with an inorganic or organic acid to remove surface contaminants and to partially demineralize the dentin matrix; (2) priming with a monomer that can penetrate the collagen-rich network that remains after the etching step; and (3) application of an adhesive resin. The adhesive resin is typically light cured to bond to a dental resin composite.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Although demineralized dental structures can usually be adequately treated using the aforementioned dental restorative materials and methods, restored dental structures oftentimes can be susceptible to further decay around the margins of the restoration. This can be mitigated through the release of ions (e.g., calcium, phosphate, and fluoride ions) that are known to enhance the natural remineralizing capability of dental structures and hardening by ion substitution (i.e. hydroxyapatite vs fluorapatite). It is believed that enhanced remineralization may be a useful supplement to, or even an alternative to, traditional dental restorative methods. Existing compositions that release calcium and phosphorus into the oral environment (e.g., calcium phosphate containing compositions), however, lack desirable properties such as maintaining a sustained release of ions, being able to physically interact with the body, and the integrity of the dental material over extended periods of time.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Bioactive glass materials may be able to overcome these challenges as they have been proven to support bone growth and hydroxyapatite formation in fields outside of dentistry. Inorganic amorphous calcium sodium phosphosilicate belongs to the class of materials, which are known as &#x201c;bioactive glasses&#x201d;. Bioactive glass materials were originally developed as bone regenerative materials in the early 1970's. Prior to the invention of bioactive glass, all biomaterials were designed to be as inert as possible in the human body. The discovery that a synthetic biomaterial could actually form a chemical bond with bone demonstrated that biomaterials could be engineered to interact with the body. This meant that it was not necessary nor advantageous to minimize interactions.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Bioactive glasses facilitate hydroxyapatite deposition when exposed to fluids containing calcium and phosphate. In the presence of water or saliva, calcium sodium phosphosilicate rapidly releases sodium ions. This increases the local pH and initiates the release of calcium and phosphate. Studies have shown that calcium sodium phosphosilicate particles act as reservoirs and continuously release calcium and phosphate ions into the local environment. This can continue over many days. The calcium-phosphate complexes crystallize into hydroxycarbonate apatite, which is chemically and structurally similar to biological apatite and consequently can positively interact with the body. Thus, there is a continuing need for new dental material compositions capable of releasing biologically-active ions (e.g., calcium, phosphate, fluoride and other ions) into the oral environment and/or directly at the interface between the dental material and tooth. Such materials, capable of releasing biologically active ions, are typically referred to as &#x201c;bioactive&#x201d; materials.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The disclosure provides methods and compositions relating to a bioactive dental material.

In some embodiments, dental compositions as disclosed herein have antimicrobial behavior, which can act against bacteria that cause decay.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0117">The dental bonding composition can facilitate the inhibition of leakage of particulate materials and/or fluid from dentin or the oral environment treated with the dental bonding composition (and, where a dental composite is adhered, between a dental composite adhered to the dental bonding composition-treated surface). This feature can be due not only to the coverage provided at a previously exposed dentin surface (and the seal with the dental composite), but also by formation of hybrid layer between the outermost dental bonding composition-covered surface and the dentin. Inhibition of leakage can include inhibition of both microleakage and nanoleakage. Microleakage is the seepage of fluids, debris, and/or microorganisms (e.g. bacteria) into micrometer-sized gaps (approximately 10-60 um) between a dental restoration and a tooth. Nanoleakage is the seepage of fluids, debris, and/or microorganisms (e.g. bacteria) into nanometer-sized gaps (i.e., approximately 10-100 nm) between a dental restoration and a tooth. Without being held to theory, the ability of bioactive glasses to promote the formation of apatite in aqueous environments that contain calcium and phosphate (e.g. saliva) can facilitate inhibition of leakage at the bonded interface through a mechanism of self-sealing due to the formation of apatite.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0118">Bioactive glass, or other sources of biologically active ions, can be incorporated into the dental bonding composition so that the presence of the bioactive glass does not decrease the shear bond strength of the adhesive bond as compared to the shear bond strength of an adhesive bond that contains no bioactive glass.

Filtek Supreme Ultra composite (3M, Maplewood, Minn.) was applied to the prepared tooth structure surface using a mold fixture to create a post approximately 3-5 mm in height. The dental composite was then cured using the same dental curing light. Samples were then allowed to fully cure to completion by storing at 37&#xb0; C. in distilled water.
