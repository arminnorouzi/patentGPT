NEDs and HUDs have been used to realize virtual reality (&#x201c;VR&#x201d;), augmented reality (&#x201c;AR&#x201d;), or mixed reality (&#x201c;MR&#x201d;). NEDs and HUDs for AR and/or MR applications display a virtual image superimposed on real-world images or see-through images. Pupil-expansion waveguide display systems with diffractive coupling structures are promising designs for NEDs and HUDs, which can potentially offer sun/eye-glasses form factors, a moderately large field of view (&#x201c;FOV&#x201d;), a high transmittance, and a large eye-box. A waveguide display system includes a light source assembly that generates an image light representing a virtual image, and a waveguide coupled with diffractive coupling structures to guide the image light to an eye-box of the waveguide display system. The diffractive coupling structures functioning as an out-coupling element replicate the virtual image at the output side of the waveguide to expand an effective pupil.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Consistent with a disclosed embodiment of the present disclosure, a device is provided.

An &#x201c;optical coupling&#x201d; between two optical elements refers to a configuration in which the two optical elements are arranged in an optical series, and a light output from one optical element may be directly or indirectly received by the other optical element. An optical series refers to optical positioning of a plurality of optical elements in a light path, such that a light output from one optical element may be transmitted, reflected, diffracted, converted, modified, or otherwise processed or manipulated by one or more of other optical elements. In some embodiments, the sequence in which the plurality of optical elements are arranged may or may not affect an overall output of the optical elements. A coupling may be a direct coupling or an indirect coupling (e.g., coupling through an intermediate element).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The phrase &#x201c;at least one of A or B&#x201d; may encompass all combinations of A and B, such as A only, B only, or A and B.

It is understood that the term &#x201c;on&#x201d; may not necessarily imply that the first element is over the second element in the vertical, gravitational direction. The first element may be disposed or arranged at any suitable orientation relative to the second element (e.g., over or above the second element, below or under the second element, left to the second element, right to the second element, behind the second element, in front of the second element, etc.).

Other processors not listed above may also be used. A processor may be implemented as software, hardware, firmware, or any combination thereof. The term &#x201c;controller&#x201d; may encompass any suitable electrical circuit, software, or processor configured to generate a control signal for controlling a device, a circuit, an optical element, etc. A &#x201c;controller&#x201d; may be implemented as software, hardware, firmware, or any combination thereof. For example, a controller may include a processor, or may be included as a part of a processor. The term &#x201c;non-transitory computer-readable medium&#x201d; may encompass any suitable medium for storing, transferring, communicating, broadcasting, or transmitting data, signal, or information. For example, the non-transitory computer-readable medium may include a memory, a hard disk, a magnetic disk, an optical disk, a tape, etc. The memory may include a read-only memory (&#x201c;ROM&#x201d;), a random-access memory (&#x201c;RAM&#x201d;), a flash memory, etc. The term &#x201c;communicatively coupled&#x201d; or &#x201c;communicatively connected&#x201d; indicates that related items are coupled or connected through a communication channel, such as a wired or wireless communication channel.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">A linear polarizer may be configured to selectively transmit a linearly polarized light having a first linear polarization and selectively block a linearly polarized light having a second linear polarization orthogonal to the first linear polarization. A linear polarizer may be, for example, a reflective polarizer (e.g., a dual brightness enhancement film, a lyotropic liquid crystal layer, a wire grid polarizer, a prism polarizer, etc.), or an absorptive polarizer (e.g., a dichroic polarizer). The linear polarizer may have a light transmission axis and a light absorption axis that is orthogonal to the light transmission axis in a plane direction. In some embodiment, the polarization efficiency of the linear polarizer may be smaller than 50%. In some embodiment, the polarization efficiency of the linear polarizer greater than about 50%, e.g., 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or 95%, etc.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The term &#x201c;orthogonal&#x201d; as used in &#x201c;orthogonal polarizations&#x201d; or the term &#x201c;orthogonally&#x201d; as used in &#x201c;orthogonally polarized&#x201d; means that an inner product of two vectors representing the two polarizations is substantially zero. For example, two lights with orthogonal polarizations or two orthogonally polarized lights may be two linearly polarized lights with polarizations in two orthogonal directions (e.g., an x-axis direction and a y-axis direction in a Cartesian coordinate system) or two circularly polarized lights with opposite handednesses (e.g., a left-handed circularly polarized light and a right-handed circularly polarized light).</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">An output angle of a ray diffracted out of an out-coupling element may be defined as an angle between the ray and a normal of a surface of the out-coupling element or a normal of a surface of the waveguide with which the out-coupling element is coupled. The output angle may be defined as positive or negative depending on the angular relationship between the ray and the normal of the surface of the out-coupling element or the normal of the surface of the waveguide. For discussion purposes, the output angle may be defined as positive when the ray is clockwise from the normal, and as negative when the ray is counter-clockwise from the normal. A slant angle of a grating having slanted microstructures (also referred to as a slant grating) may be defined as positive or negative depending on the angular relationship between a tilting direction of the microstructures and the normal of the surface (also referred to as surface normal) of the grating. For discussion purposes, the slant angle may be defined as positive when the tilting direction of the microstructures is clockwise from the surface normal, and as negative when the tilting direction of the microstructures is counter-clockwise from the surface normal.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">A grating vector of (or associated with) a grating represents a quantitative description of the properties of the grating. The grating vector may be defined as a vector having a direction orthogonal to the lines of the grating (or the planes of constant refractive indices in the grating) and a magnitude of 2&#x3c0;/&#x39b;, where &#x39b; is the grating period (or pitch). An &#x201c;in-plane projection&#x201d; of a grating vector refers to a projection of the grating vector in a plane of the grating (e.g., a surface plane of the grating, or a plane parallel to the surface plane of the grating) or a plane corresponding to a surface of a waveguide to which the grating is attached. In some embodiments, the in-plane projection may have a direction parallel or anti-parallel with a pupil expansion direction. In some embodiments, the in-plane projection may have a direction that is not parallel or anti-parallel with the pupil expansion direction. A pupil expansion direction refers to a direction in which the pupil is replicated or expanded.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> illustrates a schematic diagram of a conventional waveguide display system <b>100</b>.

The light source assembly <b>105</b> may output an input image light <b>130</b> having an input field of view (&#x201c;FOV&#x201d;) <b>133</b> toward the waveguide <b>110</b>. The light source assembly <b>105</b> may include a display element <b>120</b> and a collimating lens <b>125</b>.

The virtual image <b>150</b> may be an extended image and the predetermined image size is not negligible when compared to the size of the collimating lens <b>125</b>. The collimating lens <b>125</b> may condition the image light <b>129</b> and output the input image light <b>130</b> having the input FOV <b>133</b> toward the waveguide <b>110</b>. The collimating lens <b>125</b> may transform or convert a linear distribution of pixels of the display panel into an angular distribution of pixels.

A direction of the grating vector {right arrow over (K<sub>O</sub>)} may be the same as a direction of periodicity of the out-coupling grating <b>145</b>. A grating vector (e.g., {right arrow over (K<sub>I</sub>)}, {right arrow over (K<sub>O</sub>)}) may indicate the diffraction effect of the grating on an input image light. A vector sum of projections of the grating vector {right arrow over (K<sub>I</sub>)} and the grating vector {right arrow over (K<sub>O</sub>)} onto a pupil expansion direction (e.g., an x-axis direction) may be a null vector.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">A projection of a grating vector (e.g., {right arrow over (K<sub>I</sub>)}, {right arrow over (K<sub>O</sub>)}) on the pupil expansion direction (e.g., an x-axis direction) may be referred to as an in-plane projection of the grating vector. That is, the grating vector may be projected onto a plane including the pupil expansion direction. The plane may be parallel to the surface of the grating. The directions of the in-plane projections of the grating vector {right arrow over (K<sub>I</sub>)} and the grating vector {right arrow over (K<sub>O</sub>)} may be substantially anti-parallel, and the magnitudes of the in-plane projections of the grating vector {right arrow over (K<sub>I</sub>)} and the grating vector {right arrow over (K<sub>O</sub>)} may be substantially the same. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the in-coupling grating <b>135</b> and the out-coupling grating <b>145</b> may be gratings having non-slanted grating microstructures (e.g., non-slant gratings) extending in a y-axis direction. Thus, the in-plane projections of the grating vector {right arrow over (K<sub>I</sub>)} and the grating vector {right arrow over (K<sub>O</sub>)} may be equal to the grating vector {right arrow over (K<sub>I</sub>)} and the grating vector {right arrow over (K<sub>O</sub>)}, respectively. In other words, the directions of the grating vectors {right arrow over (K<sub>I</sub>)} and {right arrow over (K<sub>O</sub>)} may be substantially anti-parallel and the magnitudes of the grating vector {right arrow over (K<sub>I</sub>)} and the grating vector {right arrow over (K<sub>O</sub>)} may be substantially the same.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In such a configuration, due to a symmetric configuration of the grating vectors {right arrow over (K<sub>I</sub>)} and {right arrow over (K<sub>O</sub>)}, the output image light <b>132</b> with the output FOV <b>134</b> may not be rotated with respect to the input image light <b>130</b> with the input FOV <b>133</b>. Each of the input FOV <b>133</b> and the output FOV <b>134</b> may have a symmetry axis parallel to a surface normal of the waveguide <b>110</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, and an angular size of the output FOV <b>134</b> may be substantially equal to an angular size of the input FOV <b>133</b>. A symmetry axis of an FOV of an image light refers to a symmetry axis of a view cone, in which the rays of the image light are confined. The FOV of the image light may refer to an angular size of the view cone. Both of the input FOV <b>133</b> and the output FOV <b>134</b> may have an angular size represented by the angle &#x3b1;. Accordingly, an image <b>155</b> perceived by an eye <b>160</b> that receives the output image light <b>132</b> may be substantially the same as (or may have the same image content as) the virtual image <b>150</b>. Increasing the size of the display element <b>120</b> (or, increasing a scanning range or area of a scanner, e.g., a laser scanner, when the display element <b>120</b> is a laser scanning display panel) may increase the angular size of the output FOV <b>134</b> of the conventional waveguide display system <b>100</b>. However, the size of the collimating lens <b>125</b> may need to be increased. The increase in the size of the display element <b>120</b> (or, of the scanning range or area of the scanner, e.g., a laser scanner, when the display element <b>120</b> is a laser scanning display panel) and the increase in the size of the collimating lens <b>125</b> may result in a larger form factor, a heavier weight, and a higher cost.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The present disclosure provides an optical system (e.g., a waveguide display system) configured to provide an increased or expanded overall output FOV as compared to an input FOV, without increasing the form factor of the optical system, the size of a light-generating display screen (or panel) of the display element (or without increasing the scanning range or area of the laser scanner when the display element includes a laser scanning display panel), and without increasing the size of the collimating lens.

In some embodiments, the polarization of the in-coupled image light may change while propagating inside the one or more waveguides. A retardation film (e.g., a polarization correction film) may be disposed adjacent or on the respective waveguide to counter the change in the polarization, thereby preserving the polarization of the in-coupled image light while the in-coupled image light propagates inside the one or more waveguides. Thus, for discussion purposes, the polarization of an in-coupled image light (or a TIR propagating light) is presumed to be unaffected while propagating inside the one or more waveguides. For illustrative purposes, various waveguide display systems for one-dimensional (&#x201c;1D&#x201d;) pupil expansion and FOV expansion (e.g., in an x-axis direction) are used as examples to explain the principle of the FOV expansion (or providing an expanded FOV), such as those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>13</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">In some embodiments, two-dimensional (&#x201c;2D&#x201d;) pupil expansion and FOV expansion (e.g., in both x-axis direction and y-axis direction) may be achieved by introducing an additional diffractive optical element (e.g., a folding or redirecting element) that folds the in-coupled image light by 90&#xb0; toward the out-coupling element.

In some embodiments, the display element may generate a first image light representing a first image portion of the virtual image based on a full light-generating area of the display element, and the lens may convert the first image light into a first input image light having the input FOV. The in-coupling grating may couple the first input image light into the waveguide, and a first out-coupling grating of the at least two out-coupling gratings may couple the first input image light out of the waveguide as a first output image light. During a second sub-frame of the display frame of the virtual image, the display element may generate a second image light representing a second image portion of the virtual image based on a full light-generating area of the display element, and the lens may convert the second image light into a second input image light having the input FOV. The in-coupling grating may couple the second input image light into the waveguide, and a second out-coupling grating of the at least two out-coupling gratings may couple the second input image light out of the waveguide as a second output image light. The first output image light and the second output image light may be spatially arranged side by side, and may be slightly overlapped. The output image lights may provide a combined output FOV having an angular size that is substantially two times of an angular size of the input FOV of each of the first input image light and the second input image light.</p><p id="p-0284" num="0283">In some embodiments, the virtual image may be divided into three or more image portions. The display frame of the virtual image may be divided into three or more sub-frames. The light source assembly may generate a plurality of input image lights (e.g., a first, a second, and a third input image light) each representing an image portion of the virtual image and having a substantially same input FOV. Each input image light may be generated based on an image light generated by a full light-generating area of the display element. For example, the display element may generate the image light based on the full light-generating area of the display element, and the lens (e.g., collimating lens) may convert the image light into the input image light.</p><p id="p-0285" num="0284">The in-coupling grating may couple each of the input image lights (e.g., the first, the second, or the third input image light) into the waveguide during respective sub-frame. The system may include three or more out-coupling gratings, each configured to couple the input image light out of the waveguide during the respective sub-frame. Three or more output lights may be sequentially output from the waveguide during the display frame, with each output light having an output FOV with a size that is substantially equal to the size of the input FOV of the input image light. The three or more output image lights may be arranged at the output side of the waveguide side by side. The output FOVs may have a substantially narrow overlapping area (or overlapping FOV portion). An angular size of the overlapping FOV portion may be smaller than a predetermined percentage of the output FOV. For example, the predetermined percentage of the output FOV may be 0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, 2%, 2.5%, 3%, 3.5%, 4%, 4.5%, 5%, 5.5%, 6%, 6.5%, 7%, 7.5%, 8%, 8.5%, 9%, 9.5%, or 10%. An angular size of the combined or overall output FOV of the overall output image light (formed by the three or more output image lights) may be three or more times of an angular size of the input FOV of each input image light.</p><p id="p-0286" num="0285">In some embodiments, when the virtual image is divided into a predetermined number of image portions, the light source assembly may generate the predetermined number of input image lights corresponding to the predetermined number of image portions. Each input image light may be generated based on an image light generated by a full light-generating area of the display element. The display frame of the virtual image may be divided into the predetermined number of sub-frames. In each sub-frame, an input image light corresponding to an image portion of the virtual image may be coupled into the waveguide by an in-coupling element, and coupled out of the waveguide by an out-coupling element as an output image light. Thus, during the number of sub-frames, the predetermined number of output image lights may be output from the waveguide sequentially. The predetermined number of output image lights may be spatially arranged side by side. A combined, overall output FOV of the combination of the output image lights may have an angular size that is the predetermined number of times of an angular size of the input FOV of each of the input image light.</p><p id="p-0287" num="0286">The disclosed optical systems (e.g., waveguide display systems) and method for providing increased overall output FOV may be implemented in various systems, e.g., a near-eye display (&#x201c;NED&#x201d;), a head-up display (&#x201c;HUD&#x201d;), a head-mounted display (&#x201c;HMD&#x201d;), smart phones, laptops, or televisions, etc. In addition, the waveguide display systems shown in the figures are for illustrative purposes to explain the mechanism for providing an increased overall output FOV that may be two times, three times, or four times, etc., of an input FOV.

The gratings shown and disclosed herein are for illustrative purposes. Any suitable light deflecting elements (e.g., non-switchable light deflecting elements, indirectly switchable light deflecting elements, and/or directly switchable light deflecting elements) may be used and configured to provide the increased overall output FOV, following the same or similar design principles described herein with respect to the gratings.</p><p id="p-0288" num="0287">For example, the light deflecting element may include a polarization selective grating or a holographic element that includes sub-wavelength structures, liquid crystals, a photo-refractive holographic material, or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, the light deflecting element that is a polarization non-selective element may also be implemented and configured to provide an increased overall output FOV. In some embodiments, the light deflecting elements may include diffraction gratings, cascaded reflectors, prismatic surface elements, and/or an array of holographic reflectors, or a combination thereof. The controller may be configured to configure a light deflecting element to operate at a light deflection state to deflect an input light (e.g., changing a propagating direction of the input light), or operate at a light non-deflection state in which the light deflecting element may not change the propagating direction of the input light.</p><p id="p-0289" num="0288"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>A</figref> illustrates a schematic diagram of a near-eye display (&#x201c;NED&#x201d;) <b>1500</b> according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.
