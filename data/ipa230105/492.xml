way of example only, with reference to the accompanying schematic drawings according to embodiments of the present disclosure, to make the objective, technical proposal and advantages clearer. It should understand that the embodiment described are only a part of embodiments of the present disclosure, and are not intended to be a limitation to the protection scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">To solve the technical problem of the existing technology, the present disclosure provides a rotating mechanism used for a surgical stapler and a surgical stapler including the rotating mechanism. The stapler includes an instrument body and a head assembly. The head assembly includes a longitudinal shaft and a stapler head. The instrument body includes a rotating mechanism to rotate the stapler head relative to the longitudinal shaft. The rotating mechanism includes a housing, a rotating component, and a rotating rod. The housing is provided with an accommodating cavity for receiving the rotating component, the rotating component cooperates with the rotating rod, so that when the stapler head is needed to rotate, the operator can rotate the rotating component to move the rotating rod along an axial direction of the stapler, to rotate the stapler head.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">To facilitate the operator to rotate the stapler head at different rotating angles and prevent uncontrolled rotation, an outer surface of the rotating component is provided with at least one first cooperating member. An inner side of the accommodating cavity is provided with at least one second cooperating member cooperated with the first cooperating member. The first cooperating member or the second cooperating member is elastic. When the rotating component rotates relative to the housing until the first cooperating member faces the second cooperating member, the first cooperating member and the second cooperating member form inserted cooperation.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Therefore, when the operator rotates the rotating portion to rotate the stapler head, after the first cooperating member and the second cooperating member form inserted cooperation, a resistance and a lagging happen under the effect of the inserted cooperation. Therefore, the rotating component stops at a position when the first cooperating member faces the second cooperating member, so that the rotating component is kept still. When the operator further rotates the rotating component, the rotating force will overcome the elastic deformation force of the first cooperating member or the second cooperating member to separate the first cooperating member from the second cooperating member. Therefore, the rotating component can go on rotating until the next first cooperating member faces the second cooperating member. As the position of the second cooperation component corresponds to the rotating angle of the stapler head, the rotating angle of the rotating component can be set by setting the position of the second cooperating member. Then different rotating angles of the stapler head can be achieved. During operation, the elastic inserted cooperation is relatively stable, so that the stapler head can be kept in a relatively stable state without manually external force, to prevent an uncontrollable rotation of the stapler head.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In the following, the structure of the rotating mechanism according to a plurality of specific embodiments is described. It should be noted that the specific embodiments are not used for a limitation to the protection scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In the first embodiment, the second embodiment and the third embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>24</b></figref>, the first cooperating member includes an elastic convex portion, the second cooperating member includes a recess. When the rotating component rotates relative to the housing until the convex portion faces the recess, the convex portion at least partially enters the recess, to form elastic inserted cooperation between the convex portion and the recess. The elastic inserted cooperation in the embodiment means that when the convex portion at least partially enters the recess, and no external force is applied, the convex portion and the recess form relatively stable cooperation, to keep the rotating component at its current position. When an external force is applied to rotate the rotating component, the elastic deformation force of the convex portion is overcome, so as to separate the convex portion from the recess, then the rotating component can rotate relative to the housing.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>16</b></figref> show the structure of the rotating mechanism according to the first embodiment of the present disclosure. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>6</b></figref>, in the embodiment, the rotating mechanism includes a rotating component, a rotating rod <b>93</b> and a housing. The rotating component cooperates with the rotating rod <b>93</b>, so that when the rotating component rotates, the rotating rod <b>93</b> is moved along an axial direction of the stapler. For example, when the rotating component rotates along a first direction, the rotating rod <b>93</b> is moved toward a distal side of the stapler, when the rotating component rotates along a second direction, the rotating rod <b>93</b> is moved toward a proximal side of the stapler.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In the embodiment, the first cooperating member includes an elastic convex portion <b>513</b>, the second cooperating member includes a recess <b>711</b>. The rotating mechanism further includes at least one elastic sheet <b>51</b>. At least a part of the elastic sheet <b>51</b> protrudes from the outer surface of the rotating component. The elastic sheet <b>51</b> includes at least one convex portion <b>513</b>. The convex portion <b>513</b> protrudes toward a direction away from a rotating shaft of the rotating component. The housing includes an upper housing <b>7</b> and a bottom housing. An inner peripheral portion of the upper housing <b>7</b> is provided with an accommodating cavity <b>71</b> for receiving the rotating component, and an inner wall of the accommodating cavity <b>71</b> is provided with the at least one recess <b>711</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, when the rotating component rotates relative to the housing, until the convex portion <b>513</b> faces the recess <b>711</b>, the convex portion <b>513</b> at least partially enters the recess <b>711</b>, so that the convex portion <b>513</b> and the recess <b>711</b> form elastic inserted cooperation. The elastic inserted cooperation here means that when the convex portion <b>513</b> at least partially enters the recess <b>711</b>, and no external force is applied, the convex portion <b>513</b> and the recess <b>711</b> form relatively stable cooperation, to keep the rotating component at its current position. When an external force is applied to rotate the rotating component, the elastic deformation force of the convex portion <b>513</b> is overcome, to separate the convex portion <b>513</b> from the recess <b>711</b>, then the rotating component can rotate relative to the upper housing <b>7</b>.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Therefore, when the operator rotates the rotating component, a resistance and a lagging will happen after the convex portion <b>513</b> at least partially enters the recess <b>711</b>, so the convex portion <b>513</b> is kept in the recess <b>711</b>. When the operator further rotates the rotating component, the rotating force will overcome the elastic deformation force of the convex portion <b>513</b> to separate the convex portion <b>513</b> from the recess <b>711</b>. Then the rotating component can further rotates until the convex portion <b>513</b> enters the next recess <b>711</b>, and is kept in the next recess <b>711</b>. As the position of the recess <b>711</b> corresponds to the rotating angle of the stapler, the rotating angle of the rotating component can be set by setting the position of the recess <b>711</b>, and different rotating angles of the stapler head can be achieved. Therefore, a plurality of recesses <b>711</b> can be provided in turn on the inner peripheral portion of the upper housing <b>7</b>, to achieve different rotating angles of the stapler head. During operation, the elastic convex portion <b>513</b> and the recess <b>711</b> can form relatively stable cooperation, so that the stapler head can be kept in a relatively stable state without manually external force, to prevent uncontrollable rotation of the stapler head.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In the present disclosure, the terms &#x201c;distal side&#x201d; and &#x201c;proximal side&#x201d; are used herein with reference to an operator manipulating the stapler.

The elastic component <b>56</b> can be an elastic metal ring, sleeved outside the fixed component <b>72</b>. With the cooperation between the convex portion <b>561</b> and the opening <b>721</b> of the fixed component <b>72</b>, the elastic sheet <b>56</b> cannot be rotated relative to the upper housing <b>7</b>. In other alternative embodiments, the number of the convex portions <b>561</b> on the elastic sheet <b>56</b> can be other numbers, and are not limited to the number shown in the figures.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">The rotating mechanism and the surgical stapler of the present disclosure have the following advantages.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">The present disclosure provides a rotating mechanism used for a surgical stapler, wherein, with the elastic inserted cooperation between the rotating component and the housing, the operator can set different rotating angles of the stapler head. The rotating angle of the stapler head can be precisely controlled by precisely controlling the axial moving distance of the rotating rod cooperating with the rotating component. Besides, when no external force is applied, the elastic inserted cooperation between the rotating component and the housing is relatively stable. Therefore, an uncontrollable rotation of the stapler head is prevented.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">The above is a detailed description of the present disclosure in connection with the specific preferred embodiments, and the specific embodiments of the present disclosure are not limited to the description.
