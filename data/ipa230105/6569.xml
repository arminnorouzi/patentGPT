These functional entities may be implemented in that form of software, in one or more hardware modules, integrated circuits, or in at least one of different networks, processor devices and microcontroller devices.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the disclosure, unless otherwise expressly defined and limited, terms &#x201c;coupled&#x201d;, &#x201c;connected&#x201d;, and other terms should be construed in a broad sense, for example, they can be mechanically connected, electrically connected, or mutual communication; it can be directly connected, or indirectly connected through an intermediate medium, or it can be internal connection of two components or interaction relationship between two components. For those skilled in the art, the specific meaning of the above terms in the disclosure can be understood according to the specific circumstances.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a schematic circuit diagram of an alternating current to direct current (AC-DC) power supply device in the related art according to an example. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an AC is input through an AC terminal. Taking the city power (also referred to as city electric supply, or commercial power) with AC of 220 voltages per 50 Hertz (220V/50Hz) as an example, an input AC waveform is 220 V sine wave. Through a full bridge rectifier U<b>1</b> composed of four diodes, the input AC is rectified and a steamed bread wave (also referred to as a full-wave rectified wave) is output. A primary winding of a transformer T<b>1</b> is connected to switching pins SW of a switching power supply chip U<b>2</b>. The switch pins SW output a high-frequency pulse width modulation (PWM) square wave, which is used to modulate the steamed bread wave output by the full bridge rectifier U<b>1</b>. The feedback is obtained by a separate winding and input to a feedback pin FB of the switching power supply chip U<b>2</b>, so that an output voltage on a secondary side is stable.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the primary side of the transformer T<b>1</b> includes a capacitor C<b>1</b> for energy storage. Since a voltage at the primary side of the transformer T<b>1</b> is very high, a liquid electrolytic capacitor with a high-voltage resistance is usually selected as an energy storage capacitor. A capacitance value and a size of the liquid electrolytic capacitor are relatively large, resulting in low power density of the power supply device; and the larger the output power is, the larger the capacitance value and the size is, affecting the size of the power supply conversion device, which is not convenient to carry around, and the user experience is poor. In addition, the liquid electrolytic capacitor has a short service life and is prone to bursting, making a service life of the power supply conversion device is short and safety is poor.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Moreover, as people's demand for charging increases, the industry has successively proposed high-current fast charging schemes and high-voltage fast charging schemes on the basis of ordinary charging. Among them, the high-current charging scheme may charge a battery in an electronic device through a pulsating DC voltage output by a power supply adapter, while the high-voltage charging scheme, such as the power delivery (PD) protocol published by the Universal Serial Bus Implementers Forum, Inc. (USB-IF), increases a charging power by increasing a charging voltage, so as to speed up a charging rate. According to requirements of PD protocol, an output voltage of the adapter must be a constant DC voltage, if the output voltage of the adapter drops below a preset threshold, the electronic device considers the charging abnormal and terminates the charging of the battery.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Therefore, as mentioned above, how to improve the power density of the power supply adapter and be compatible with different types of fast charging protocols at the same time, so as to improve the compatibility and adaptability of the power supply adapter, has become a technical problem that needs to be solved.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">A power supply conversion device provided by an embodiment of the disclosure adopts a two-stage structure, only an AC-DC conversion is performed on a primary side of a transformer, and a circuit including DC-DC DC output adjustment part is disposed on a secondary side of the transformer, so that a large-size electrolytic capacitor is not required to be disposed on the primary side of the transformer. In addition, a control unit negotiates a charging mode by communicating with a connected device to be charged, and adjusts an input current of an AC-DC rectifier according to the negotiated charging mode, so that a DC-DC converter can output a constant DC voltage or a pulsating DC voltage accordingly, which is compatible with different charging modes.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Hereinafter, a power supply conversion device and a charging control method in the illustrative embodiments of the disclosure will be described in more detail with reference to the accompanying drawings and embodiments.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a schematic diagram of a charging system according to an illustrative embodiment.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the charging system <b>1</b> includes a power supply conversion device <b>11</b> and a device to be charged <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The power supply conversion device <b>11</b> is, for example, a power supply adapter, a power bank, and other devices.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The power supply conversion device <b>11</b> is connected to the device to be charged <b>12</b> through cables to provide electric energy for the device to be charged <b>12</b> to thereby charge a battery <b>122</b> in the device to be charged <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The device to be charged <b>12</b> may be, for example, a terminal or an electronic device, which may be a mobile phone, a game console, a tablet computer, an e-book reader, an intelligent wearable device, a moving picture experts group audio layer IV (MP<b>4</b>) player, a smart home device, an augmented reality (AR) device, a virtual reality (VR) device, and other mobile terminals, may also be rechargeable electronic devices with a charging function, such as mobile power supplies (such as power bank, travel charger), electronic cigarettes, wireless mice, wireless keyboards, wireless headsets, Bluetooth speakers, or personal computers (PCs), such as laptop computers and desktop computers.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The device to be charged <b>12</b> is connected to a charging interface <b>116</b> of the power supply conversion device <b>11</b> through a charging interface <b>121</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The charging interface <b>121</b> may be, for example, a female connector of a USB 2.0 interface, a Micro USB interface, or a USB TYPE-C interface.

The USB OTG detects the adapter according to the normal BCSV1.2 specification, and starts the USB PD device policy manager. The policy manager monitors whether the frequency shift keying (FSK) signal is coupled to the DC level of VBUS, decodes the message to obtain the CapabilitiesSource message, and then obtain a list of all voltage and current pairs supported by the USB PD power supply conversion device by analyzing the message according to the USB PD protocol. The device to be charged selects a voltage and current pair from the CapabilitiesSource message according to the user's configuration, adds the voltage and current pair to the payload of the Request message, and then the policy manager couples the FSK signal to the VBUS DC level. The power supply conversion device decodes the FSK signal and sends an Accept message to the device to be charged, while adjusting the DC voltage and current output of power supply.
