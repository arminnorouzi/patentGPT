An IGBT combines concepts from bipolar transistors and MOSFETs to achieve an improved power device. The emitter and the gate are disposed on one side of the device, while the collector is disposed on the opposite second side of the device. The emitter is in communication with a heavily p-doped region disposed directly below the emitter. On either side of the heavily p-doped region are heavily n-doped regions, each in communication with the gate. Beneath the heavily p-doped region is a lightly p-doped region. On the opposite side of the device is a second heavily p-doped region, in communication with the collector. Finally, between the second heavily p-doped region and the lightly p-doped region is a lightly n-doped drift layer.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In conventional IGBT devices, the thickness of the lightly n-doped drift layer is determined based on the need to sustain the electrical field. As the power ratings for these devices increases, the overall thickness of the device also increases.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">One technique to reduce the thickness of these IGBT transistors is to incorporate a heavily n-doped field stop layer between the lightly n-doped drift layer and the second heavily p-doped region. The electrical field decreases rapidly within this field stop layer, allowing thinner devices to be created. In certain embodiments, the field stop layer has a rectangular or box profile.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In certain embodiments, this field stop layer is created by implanting ions, such as hydrogen ions, into the lightly n-doped drift layer. This field stop layer may be disposed adjacent to the second heavily p-doped region.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Additionally, the field stop layer may have a thickness that is 1 or more &#x3bc;m. Creating an implanted region of this thickness typically involves a plurality of implants, each done at a different implant energy.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Other types of devices also make use of specially implanted regions. For example, photodiodes typically have a deep trench for isolation and logic devices typically implement P-wells and N-wells. In each of these devices, the implanted region is traditionally formed using a plurality of implants, each at a different implant energy.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In certain embodiments, the desired dopant concentration profile of the implanted region may resemble a box or rectangle, where the concentration remains roughly constant over a range of depths. In other embodiments, the desired dopant concentration profile of the implanted region may be a gradient profile, where the desired concentration profile varies with depth.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, changing the implant energy of a semiconductor implantation system is time consuming. Specifically, the voltages applied to various electrodes, accelerators, acceleration/deceleration stages, magnets, and focusing elements is changed for each of these implant energies. Modifying these voltages may take many minutes. Thus, throughput and utilization are greatly affected by the modification of the implant energy.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Therefore, it would be beneficial if there was a method of processing a semiconductor workpiece that could create implanted regions having these desired dopant concentration profiles in a more efficient manner. Further, it would be advantageous if this method was applicable to a variety of different types of semiconductor processing equipment.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">A system and method for creating various dopant concentration profiles using a single implant energy is disclosed.

This technique is applicable to various types of semiconductor process apparatus. Several of these apparatuses are described below.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, a semiconductor processing apparatus comprises an ion source <b>100</b>, which is used to generate an ion beam. In one embodiment, a positive ion beam <b>101</b> may be created in the traditional manner, such as using a Bernas or indirectly heated cathode (IHC) ion source. Of course, other types of ion sources may also be employed. A feedgas is supplied to the ion source <b>100</b>, which is then energized to generate ions. In certain embodiments, the feedgas may be hydrogen, boron, phosphorus, arsenic, helium, or other suitable species. Extraction optics are then used to extract these ions from the ion source <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The positive ion beam <b>101</b> exiting the ion source <b>100</b> may be coupled to a Mg charge exchange cell <b>110</b>, which transforms the positive ion beam <b>101</b> into a negative ion beam <b>111</b>. Of course, other mechanisms for the generation of a negative ion beam are known in the art. The mechanism used to create the negative ion beam is not limited by this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The negative ion beam <b>111</b> may be directed toward a mass analyzer <b>120</b>, which only allows the passage of certain species of ions. The negative ions that exit the mass analyzer <b>120</b> are directed toward a tandem accelerator <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The tandem accelerator <b>130</b> has two pathways, which are separated by a stripper tube <b>133</b>. The input pathway <b>131</b> comprises a plurality of input electrodes. These input electrodes may be any suitable electrically conductive material, such as titanium or other metals. The outermost input electrode may be grounded. Each of the subsequent input electrodes may be biased at an increasingly more positive voltage moving closer to the stripper tube <b>133</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The input pathway <b>131</b> leads to the stripper tube <b>133</b>. The stripper tube <b>133</b> is biased positively relative to the outermost input electrode. The stripper tube <b>133</b> includes an injection conduit where a stripper gas is injected. The stripper gas may comprise neutral molecules. These neutral molecules may be any suitable species such as, but not limited to argon and nitrogen. The stripper tube <b>133</b> has an inlet disposed on the same side as the input pathway <b>131</b>. The outlet of the stripper tube <b>133</b> is in communication with the output pathway <b>132</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In other words, the stripper tube <b>133</b> is positively biased so as to attract the negative ion beam <b>111</b> through the input pathway <b>131</b>. The stripper tube <b>133</b> removes electrons from the incoming ions, transforming them from negative ions into positive ions.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The stripper tube <b>133</b> is more positive than the electrodes in the output pathway <b>132</b>. Each subsequent output electrode may be less positively biased moving away from the stripper tube <b>133</b>. For example, the outermost output electrode may be grounded. Thus, the positive ions in the stripper tube <b>133</b> are accelerated through the output pathway <b>132</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In this way, the ions are accelerated two times. First, negative ions are accelerated through the input pathway <b>131</b> to the stripper tube <b>133</b>. This acceleration is based on the difference between the voltage of the outermost input electrode and the voltage of the stripper tube <b>133</b>. Next, positive ions are accelerated through the output pathway <b>132</b>. This acceleration is based on the difference between the voltage of the stripper tube <b>133</b> and the voltage of the outermost output electrode in the output pathway <b>132</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">An accelerator power supply <b>134</b> may be used to supply the voltages to the stripper tube <b>133</b>, as well as the electrodes in the input pathway <b>131</b> and the output pathway <b>132</b>. The accelerator power supply <b>134</b> may be capable of supply a voltage up to 2.5 MV, although other voltages, either higher or lower, are also possible. Thus, to modify the implant energy, the voltage applied by the accelerator power supply <b>134</b> is changed.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">After exiting the tandem accelerator <b>130</b>, the positive ion beam <b>135</b> may enter a filter magnet <b>140</b>, which allows passage of ions of only a certain charge. In other embodiments, the filter magnet <b>140</b> may not be employed. The output of the filter magnet <b>140</b> may pass through a scanner <b>150</b>, which serve to create the final ion beam <b>155</b> containing the desired species of ions. The scanner <b>150</b> causes the incoming ion beam to be fanned in the width direction so as to form a scanned ribbon ion beam. The output of the scanner <b>150</b> is then directed toward a platen <b>160</b>. A workpiece <b>10</b> may be disposed on the platen <b>160</b>. In certain embodiments, a corrector magnet may be disposed between the scanner <b>150</b> and the platen <b>160</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The platen <b>160</b> may be in communication with a platen orientation motor <b>170</b>. The platen orientation motor <b>170</b> may be configured to move the platen <b>160</b> in any of a plurality of different directions. For example, the platen orientation motor <b>170</b> may have the capability to rotate the platen <b>160</b>. Rotation occurs about an axis that is normal to the surface of the platen <b>160</b> and passes through the center of the workpiece (or platen). The angle of rotation may be referred to as the twist angle.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Additionally, the platen orientation motor <b>170</b> is configured to tilt the platen <b>160</b>. Tilt is defined as a rotation about an axis <b>161</b> that is parallel to the wider dimension of the ion beam and passing through the center of the platen <b>160</b>. This tilt is sometimes referred to as X-tilt. The angle of X-tilt may be referred to as the tilt angle.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Additionally, the semiconductor processing apparatus includes a controller <b>180</b>. The controller <b>180</b> may include a processing unit, such as a microcontroller, a personal computer, a special purpose controller, or another suitable processing unit. The controller <b>180</b> may also include a non-transitory computer readable storage element, such as a semiconductor memory, a magnetic memory, or another suitable memory. This non-transitory storage element may contain instructions and other data that allows the controller <b>180</b> to perform the functions described herein.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The controller <b>180</b> may be in communication with the accelerator power supply <b>134</b>, so as to control the implant energy. In addition, the controller <b>180</b> may be in communication with the platen orientation motor <b>170</b>, so as to adjust the tilt angle and twist angle of the platen <b>160</b>. The controller <b>180</b> may also be in communication with other components.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">A second embodiment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>. Components that are common with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> are given identical reference designators.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As described above, a semiconductor processing apparatus comprises an ion source <b>100</b>, which is used to generate an ion beam. The ion source <b>100</b> has an aperture through which ions may be extracted from the ion source <b>100</b>.

In other words, the width of the dopant concentration profile for a particular implant typically becomes larger as the tilt angle of that implant increases. Thus, the distance between the Rp of the higher tilt angle implants may be greater than the distance between the Rp of the lower tilt angle implants. More specifically, the distance between the Rp of the fourth implant <b>330</b> and the third implant <b>320</b> is about 1.6 &#x3bc;m. In contrast, the distance between the Rp of the second implant <b>310</b> and the first implant <b>300</b> is only about 0.9 &#x3bc;m. However, because of the increased straggle at higher tilt angles, the combination of these implants results in a broader profile where the concentration is at or above about 1E18.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Thus, in certain embodiments, the tilt angles are selected based on the minimum desired concentration and the straggle associated with each implant. In this embodiment, each implant creates a concentration profile that resembles a bell curve. The width of the bell curve increases with increasing tilt angle, while the height of the bell curve decreases with increasing tilt angle.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In other words, the tilt angles may be selected such that the minimum concentration between any two adjacent Rp is above a predetermined minimum. For example, the predetermined minimum for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> may be 1E18 atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>. As shown in the figure, the minimum between the Rp of first implant <b>300</b> and the Rp of second implant <b>310</b> is about 1.2E18. The minimum between the Rp of second implant <b>310</b> and the Rp of third implant <b>320</b> is about 1.1E18.

The next tilt angle may be selected such that the lower depth at which that implant provides a concentration equal to about 50% of the predetermined minimum is the same as the upper depth at which the first implant provides a concentration equal to or slightly greater than 50% of the predetermined minimum. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the first implant <b>300</b> provides a concentration of about 5E17 atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>(which is 50% of 1E18) at an upper depth of 7.3 &#x3bc;m. Similarly, the second implant <b>310</b> provides a concentration of about 5E17 atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>at a lower depth of 7.3 &#x3bc;m, and an upper depth of 6.2 &#x3bc;m. The second implant <b>310</b> may be performed at a tilt angle greater than the first tilt angle, such as between 10&#xb0; and 40&#xb0;. The third implant <b>320</b> provides a concentration of about 5E17 atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>at a lower depth of 6.2 &#x3bc;m, and an upper depth of 4.8 &#x3bc;m. The third implant <b>320</b> may be performed at a tilt angle greater than the second tilt angle, such as between 30&#xb0; and 60&#xb0;. Lastly, the fourth implant <b>330</b> provides a concentration of about 5E17 atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>at a lower depth of 3.2 &#x3bc;m. The fourth implant <b>330</b> may be performed at a tilt angle greater than the third tilt angle, such as between 40&#xb0; and 70&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Thus, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a field stop layer having a hydrogen concentration of greater than 1E18 ions/cm<sup>3 </sup>and thickness of about 4.5 &#x3bc;m may be created using a single implant energy. Further, the ratio of the maximum concentration to the minimum concentration is less than 5. As stated above, by varying the dose of each implant, the ratio may be reduced. Further, by adding additional implants, using the same implant energy and other tilt angles, the ratio can be reduced. Thus, the ratio may be less than 4, less than 3 or less than 2.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">This technique is also useful for other semiconductor applications.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">For example, this technique is not limited to hydrogen ions.

For example, the implanted region may be created by performing implants at a first implant energy, with two or three different tilt angles and implants at a second implant energy, with two or three different tilt angles. In this case, a delay is incurred when changing the implant energy from the first implant energy to the second implant energy. However, this delay is far less than the delays associated with 6 different implant energies.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Further, the present technique may be used to create gradient profiles. A gradient profile is one where the log of the dopant concentration profile varies roughly linearly as a function of depth. For example, a well may be N-doped where the maximum concentration occurs at a depth of about 0.1 &#x3bc;m and decreases exponentially to a depth of about 1.0 &#x3bc;m. For example, the concentration may decrease by a factor of about 35 over 0.9 &#x3bc;m. In certain embodiments, the decrease in concentration may appear roughly linear when plotted in log-linear, also referred to as semi-log, format. Using a single implant energy, with several different tilt angles, a similar concentration profile may be created.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">This gradient profile may be used to create wells for logic devices. In those logic devices, a well is typically created beneath the gate in a transistor.

In this figure, the dopant concentration decreases roughly linearly from about 0.2 &#x3bc;m to about 1.1 &#x3bc;m, when viewed on a semi-log graph. Specifically, in this gradient profile, the concentration decreases from 4E18 atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>to about 2E16 atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>over this range of depths. If the gradient profile decreased exactly linearly on the semi-log graph, the equation of the line <b>401</b> over the desired range of depths may be expressed as:</p><p id="p-0099" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>log(<i>y</i>)=<i>mx+b, </i><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0100" num="0000">where y is the concentration, m is the slope; and b is the y intercept.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0098">The graph shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows that the resultant gradient dopant concentration profile <b>400</b>, as-implanted, deviates from this straight line <b>401</b> by less than a factor of 2 throughout the desired range of depths. In this disclosure, the phrase &#x201c;roughly linearly&#x201d; means that the actual dopant concentration deviates from a straight line <b>401</b> by a factor of 2 or less when plotted on a semi-log graph. In certain embodiments, the deviation may be less than a factor of 1.5. In other embodiments, the deviation may be less than a factor of 1.25.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0099"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows the simulation of the three implants, as-implanted, that were used to create the dopant profile shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. Again, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> and the associated data reflect the concentrations as-implanted, prior to any thermal treatment. Note that the first implant <b>500</b> does not show the bell shape that was evident in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. This is because the tilt angle of this first implant <b>500</b> was selected to allow channeling of atoms in the workpiece. This channeling effect produces a more constant dopant profile of about 1E17 atoms/cm3 across the range of depths from about 0.2 &#x3bc;m to about 0.95 &#x3bc;m. In one embodiment, this first implant <b>500</b> may be performed at a dose of 1E13, a tilt angle of 0&#xb0; and a twist angle of 0&#xb0;. The second implant <b>510</b> occurs at an angle greater than that of the first implant <b>500</b> and shows a peak concentration at about 0.3 &#x3bc;m and the maximum concentration of about 2E18. The dose of the second implant <b>510</b> may be greater than that of the first implant <b>500</b>, such as but not limited to 5E13. The first implant <b>500</b> and second implant <b>510</b> provide the desired gradient profile for depths greater than about 0.4 &#x3bc;m. The third implant <b>520</b> is used to provide the greater concentration that is found at depths less than 0.4 &#x3bc;m. The dose of the third implant <b>520</b> may be the same as the dose of the second implant <b>510</b>. Thus, to implant at these shallow depths, the tilt angle of the third implant <b>520</b> may be increased, such as to a value of 30&#xb0; or greater. The doses of these three implants may be the same or may be different. For example, as described above, the first implant <b>500</b> may be performed at a lower dose to provide the constant dopant profile shown in the figure. In certain embodiments, the first implant <b>500</b> may not be performed, as the second implant <b>510</b> and third implant <b>520</b> may also produce a gradient profile.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0100">Further, as described above, the shape of the concentration profile may be further improved by varying the dose of each implant. Additionally, additional implants at tilt angles between the minimum and maximum angle may be used to further improve the shape of the concentration profile. The implant energy was determined based on the maximum depth of the desired concentration profile. Like the box profile, the first implant may be performed at an angle that is at or near 0&#xb0;. The second tilt angle may be greater than the first tilt angle, such as between 1&#xb0; and 30&#xb0;. The third tilt angle may be greater than the second tilt angle, such as between 30&#xb0; and 65&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0101">The values noted above are intended to create a profile having a gradient similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. If a more steep or more gradual gradient is desired, the tilt angles and doses may be adjusted accordingly. Similarly, if the desired concentrations are different than those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the tilt angles and doses may be adjusted.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0102">Thus, in addition to rectangular or box profiles, the present technique also allows the creation of gradient concentration profiles, using a single implant energy with multiple tilt angles.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0103">This disclosure is not limited to the creation of box and gradient profiles. Rather, the use of a single implant energy and multiple tilt angles may also be used to create other shaped dopant concentration profiles.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0104">The system and method described herein have many advantages. In one test, it was determined that field stop layer having a thickness of 4.5 &#x3bc;m can be formed using a single implant energy of 600 keV. This field stop layer was performed using four different tilt angles. In contrast, this field stop layer is traditionally fabricated using three or more different implant energies. It was noted that the time to change the implant energy and then recalibrate all of the components of the semiconductor processing apparatus to each new implant energy can be as long as 5 to 6 minutes. Thus, the ability to achieve implanted regions having a thickness in excess of 1 &#x3bc;m without changing the implant energy may substantially reduce the time to form the implanted region.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0105">Similarly, typically a graded P-well or N-well is fabricated using three or more different implant energies. The ability to fabricate these structures with a single implant energy may substantially increase throughput. For example, a gradient profile, similar to that created using three different implant energies, was created using a single implant energy and three different tilt angles. This results in a significant improvement in throughput and efficiency.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0106">Likewise, an isolation trench for a photodiode may have a thickness of about 2 &#x3bc;m and a concentration of 2E16 boron atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>. In certain prior art applications, this isolation trench is fabricated using 6 or more different implant energies. By using a single implant energy and a variety of tilt angles, the time to fabricate this isolation trench can be reduced significantly. In fact, even if two different implant energies are used to create this isolation trench, the throughput is still much improved as compared to the current process.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0107">Thus, the present system and method reduces the time to create an implanted region with the desired dopant concentration profile. As noted above, when the implant energy is varied, the voltages applied to various electrodes, accelerators, acceleration/deceleration stages, magnets, and focusing elements are changed. Modifying these voltages may take many minutes. However, only the platen orientation motor <b>170</b> is adjusted to change the tilt angle, which needs no additional tuning after being moved.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0108">The present disclosure is not to be limited in scope by the specific embodiments described herein.
