Information is stored by programing memory cells within a memory device to various states. For example, binary memory cells may be programmed to one of two supported states, often denoted by a logic 1 or a logic 0. In some examples, a single memory cell may support more than two states, any one of which may be stored. To access the stored information, a component may read, or sense, at least one stored state in the memory device. To store information, a component may write, or program, the state in the memory device.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Various types of memory devices and memory cells exist, including magnetic hard disks, random-access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), dynamic RAM (DRAM), synchronous DRAM (SDRAM), ferroelectric RAM (FeRAM), magnetic RAM (MRAM), resistive RAM (RRAM), flash memory, phase change memory (PCM), self-selecting memory, chalcogenide memory technologies, and others. Memory cells may be volatile or non-volatile. Non-volatile memory, e.g., FeRAM, may maintain their stored logic state for extended periods of time even in the absence of an external power source. Volatile memory devices, e.g., DRAM, may lose their stored state when disconnected from an external power source.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example of a system that supports power regulation for memory systems in accordance with examples as disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an example of a memory system that supports power regulation for memory systems in accordance with examples as disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>D</figref> illustrate example of memory devices that support power regulation for memory systems in accordance with examples as disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a block diagram of a memory device that supports power regulation for memory systems in accordance with examples as disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a flowchart illustrating a method or methods that support power regulation for memory systems in accordance with examples as disclosed herein.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A memory system may include one or more memory devices coupled with a power management component, for example a power management integrated circuit (PMIC), to supply different voltages to the one or more memory devices. The power management component may provide supply voltages that the one or more memory device use to access memory cells of the one or more memory devices. For example, a power management component may regulate voltage to each memory device on a dual in-line memory module (DIMM). In some cases, a DIMM may include a power management component, and one or more packages, where each package may contain at least one memory device. The power management component may be connected to each package via channels.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">When providing supply voltages centrally on the memory module and distributing the supply voltages to each memory device using channels, the voltage from the power management component experienced at each memory device may be different than expected (e.g., because of the varying distances from the power management component amongst other reasons). In some cases, a memory device may operate at low voltages (e.g., 1.1 to 0.9V) and high frequencies. As such, it may be beneficial to mitigate noise and loss of power, voltages, or current, or a combination thereof between the power management component and the memory devices of a package.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">To reduce noise and power loss associated with the supply voltages used by the one or more memory devices of a memory system, more than one power management component may be incorporated on the memory system. In some cases, there may be at least one power management component incorporated into each memory device. For example, in a dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) DIMM, each DRAM may have a PMIC packaged with the memory dies or otherwise incorporated into the DRAM so that the DIMM includes a one to one ratio of DRAM chips and PMICs. Because at least one management component is part of each memory device, the supply voltage seen by each memory device may have reduced noise and power loss. In some cases, a feedback component may be implemented in each memory device with the power management component to allow for tighter tolerances of the supply voltages seen by the memory devices.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Features of the disclosure are initially described in the context of memory systems and memory dies as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>.

Components are considered in electronic communication with (or in conductive contact with or connected with or coupled with) one another if there is any conductive path between the components that can, at any time, support the flow of signals between the components. At any given time, the conductive path between components that are in electronic communication with each other (or in conductive contact with or connected with or coupled with) may be an open circuit or a closed circuit based on the operation of the device that includes the connected components. The conductive path between connected components may be a direct conductive path between the components or the conductive path between connected components may be an indirect conductive path that may include intermediate components, such as switches, transistors, or other components. In some examples, the flow of signals between the connected components may be interrupted for a time, for example, using one or more intermediate components such as switches or transistors.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">The term &#x201c;coupling&#x201d; refers to condition of moving from an open-circuit relationship between components in which signals are not presently capable of being communicated between the components over a conductive path to a closed-circuit relationship between components in which signals are capable of being communicated between components over the conductive path. When a component, such as a controller, couples other components together, the component initiates a change that allows signals to flow between the other components over a conductive path that previously did not permit signals to flow.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">The term &#x201c;isolated&#x201d; refers to a relationship between components in which signals are not presently capable of flowing between the components. Components are isolated from each other if there is an open circuit between them. For example, two components separated by a switch that is positioned between the components are isolated from each other when the switch is open. When a controller isolates two components, the controller affects a change that prevents signals from flowing between the components using a conductive path that previously permitted signals to flow.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">The devices discussed herein, including a memory array, may be formed on a semiconductor substrate, such as silicon, germanium, silicon-germanium alloy, gallium arsenide, gallium nitride, etc. In some examples, the substrate is a semiconductor wafer. In other examples, the substrate may be a SOI substrate, such as SOG or SOP, or epitaxial layers of semiconductor materials on another substrate. The conductivity of the substrate, or sub-regions of the substrate, may be controlled through doping using various chemical species including, but not limited to, phosphorous, boron, or arsenic. Doping may be performed during the initial formation or growth of the substrate, by ion-implantation, or by any other doping means.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">A switching component or a transistor discussed herein may represent a field-effect transistor (FET) and comprise a three terminal device including a source, drain, and gate. The terminals may be connected to other electronic elements through conductive materials, e.g., metals. The source and drain may be conductive and may comprise a heavily-doped, e.g., degenerate, semiconductor region. The source and drain may be separated by a lightly-doped semiconductor region or channel. If the channel is n-type (i.e., majority carriers are signals), then the FET may be referred to as a n-type FET. If the channel is p-type (i.e., majority carriers are holes), then the FET may be referred to as a p-type FET. The channel may be capped by an insulating gate oxide. The channel conductivity may be controlled by applying a voltage to the gate. For example, applying a positive voltage or negative voltage to an n-type FET or a p-type FET, respectively, may result in the channel becoming conductive. A transistor may be &#x201c;on&#x201d; or &#x201c;activated&#x201d; when a voltage greater than or equal to the transistor's threshold voltage is applied to the transistor gate.
