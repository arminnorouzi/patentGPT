The labeling device comprises at least a feed assembly, a dispensing assembly and also an application assembly as functional units, which are configured for labeling the individual packs in a labeling routine. The functional units are controlled by means of a control assembly in the labeling routine.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In order to ensure reliable and accurate labeling, the functional units have respective sensor assemblies that determine sensor data associated with carrying out the labeling routine. On the basis of the determined sensor data, for example, the position, orientation and speed of the individual packs are ascertained and the application of the labels is controlled and/or checked. Modern labeling systems have a large number of sensors for the sensor assemblies, a large portion of the determined sensor data being utilized only briefly for the control of the functional units in individual labeling processes in the context of the labeling routine.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The invention additionally proceeds from the fact that the labeling system comprises a monitoring assembly, which during the labeling routine, in a monitoring routine, captures the sensor data determined by the sensor assemblies of the functional units in accordance with a sensor capture density predefined for the respective functional unit. The monitoring assembly is preferably embodied as a data logger and brings about for example regular storage of individual sensor data or variables derived from the sensor data. The sensor data captured by the monitoring assembly serve in particular to provide a history of sensor data for fault analyses, system improvements, for facilitating maintenance or the like. On account of the multiplicity of available sensors and the considerable amount of sensor data associated therewith, only a selected, small portion of the entire sensor data determined is captured in particular in predefined time intervals. The monitoring assembly captures the sensor data determined by the sensor assemblies in accordance with a sensor capture density predefined for the respective functional unit.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">What is problematic here is that a multiplicity of sensor data that are possibly helpful for identifying various fault sources are not captured in the monitoring routine in order to avoid an overwhelming amount of sensor data. At the same time, systematic faults in the labeling routine that have a long-term effect on the labeling quality, through the brief utilization of the sensor data, are often not reliably recognized and not logged either.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The invention addresses the problem of specifying a method for operating a labeling system for labeling individual packs, wherein the monitoring of the labeling system is improved.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the case of a method as claimed in the preamble of claim <b>1</b>, the above problem is solved by means of the features of the characterizing part of claim <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">What is essential is the fundamental consideration that, on the one hand, on account of the sensor assemblies already provided for carrying out the labeling routine, the labeling system can provide a sufficiently large amount of sensor data to enable thorough monitoring of the labeling system. On the other hand, systematic faults in the labeling routine are often perceived by the user, but the user is not readily able to identify the cause of the faults on account of the complexity of the labeling system.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is specifically proposed that a user query routine is carried out by means of the monitoring assembly, in which user query routine a user, by means of the user interface, is requested to input a state relating to a functional aspect of the labeling system and the state thereupon input by the user is communicated to the monitoring assembly, in that the monitoring assembly compares the input state with a predefined state and, in the event of a deviation of the input state from the predefined state, carries out an internal reaction routine.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Furthermore, according to the proposal, it is provided that in the internal reaction routine, by comparison with the previous sensor capture density, a changed, in particular increased, sensor capture density of at least one functional unit is predefined, and that, following the user query routine, the labeling routine and the monitoring routine are carried out using the changed sensor capture density predefined from the user query routine.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">It has been recognized that by means of the user query routine it is possible to determine whether there is possibly a defect in the labeling routine, whereupon the internal reaction routine is initiated, which brings about an adaptation of the monitoring routine.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">On the basis of the result of the user query routine, the identification of possible causes of the input state is thus facilitated by virtue of the fact that a changed, in particular increased, sensor capture density for the further implementation of the monitoring routine is predefined for at least one functional unit. The sensor data are thus captured in reaction to the deviation from the predefined state in accordance with the changed sensor capture density for example for a fault analysis.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The solution according to the proposal can be implemented in a simple manner since, for carrying out the user query routine and for further capture of the sensor data, it is possible to have recourse to the sensor assemblies already provided on the labeling system.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The advantageous embodiments as claimed in claims <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> relate to the predefinition of the changed sensor capture density. In the particularly expedient embodiment as claimed in claim <b>4</b>, the sensor capture density of at least one functional unit is changed by comparison with a predefined sensor capture density appertaining to normal operation.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Claim <b>5</b> relates to an assignment of at least one of the functional units to the state, whereby the sensor capture density can be changed in a targeted manner in relation to the at least one assigned functional unit and the capture of the sensor data is thus optimized further.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the particularly user-friendly embodiment as claimed in claim <b>6</b>, the user, by means of the user interface, is requested to select the state from a compilation of selectable states. The representation of a rising scale from a low to a high state by the compilation of selectable states simplifies the inputting of the state and the taking account thereof.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The advantageous embodiments as claimed in claims <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> relate to the change in the sensor capture density.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">As claimed in claim <b>9</b>, in the monitoring routine the sensor data captured by means of the monitoring assembly are stored and/or caused to be output, such that the sensor data captured in accordance with the changed sensor capture density can be used for a later evaluation.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In order to avoid an incorrect initiation of the internal reaction routine, in one preferred embodiment, a plausibility check of the input state is carried out by means of the monitoring assembly (claim <b>10</b>).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Further functional units of the labeling device, the sensor data of which can likewise be captured in the monitoring routine, are defined in claim <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Claims <b>12</b> to <b>20</b> relate to preferred embodiments of the user query routine.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to a further teaching as claimed in claim <b>21</b>, this further teaching being accorded independent importance, the above-discussed labeling system for labeling individual packs which is configured for carrying out the method according to the proposal is claimed as such. Reference may be made to all explanations concerning the method according to the proposal.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to a further teaching as claimed in claim <b>22</b>, this further teaching likewise being accorded independent importance, the above monitoring assembly serving for carrying out the user query routine in the context of the method according to the proposal is claimed as such. Reference may be made to the above explanations concerning the method according to the proposal.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In one advantageous embodiment, the monitoring assembly comprises a memory having program instructions and at least one processor for implementing the user query routine (claim <b>23</b>).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to a further teaching as claimed in claim <b>24</b>, this further teaching likewise being accorded independent importance, a computer program comprising program instructions is claimed which causes a processor of the monitoring assembly according to the proposal to execute the user query routine when the computer program runs on the processor. In this case, the computer program can be stored on a, in particular nonvolatile, memory. In this respect, too, reference may be made to the above explanations concerning the method according to the proposal.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The invention is explained in greater detail below with reference to a drawing illustrating just one exemplary embodiment.

The feed assembly <b>2</b> is preferably a belt conveyor or a roller conveyor, optionally also at least one robot arm, for moving the respective packs. The feed assembly <b>2</b>, here the belt conveyor, comprises here and preferably at least one transport belt <b>3</b>, via which the respective packs, not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, are transported along a transport direction.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Furthermore, a dispensing assembly <b>4</b> for dispensing a label detachable from a material strip <b>5</b> is provided. A label detachable from a material strip <b>5</b> is taken to mean, in particular, a label which is attached by its adhesive surface detachably on a carrier strip, which forms the material strip <b>5</b> and can consist of paper and/or plastic, for example. It is likewise possible for the label to be produced by separating a partial section from a printable or printed material strip <b>5</b>, for instance by cutting and/or tearing the material strip <b>5</b>. The method according to the proposal is preferably applied to labels which are embodied as adhesive labels and which already have an adhesive surface on the material strip <b>5</b>. The use of adhesive-free labels is likewise conceivable, too, which only later are provided with an adhesive surface or applied to an adhesive surface on the respective pack.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In addition, the labeling device <b>1</b>, here in a common housing with the dispensing assembly <b>4</b>, comprises an application assembly <b>6</b> for applying the dispensed label to the respective pack. Preferably, the dispensed label is picked up by a punch, which is embodied here and preferably as an oscillating punch <b>7</b>, and is applied to the respective pack. In particular, the punch comprises a blowing head for sucking up and blowing off the label. During application, the oscillating punch <b>7</b> here carries out a movement along the transport direction in order to enable the pack moved by means of the feed assembly <b>2</b> to be labeled. By means of the application assembly <b>6</b>, the label can be applied to the pack with contact by pressing the label thereon. Additionally or alternatively, it is conceivable for the label to be applied without contact, for example by a blowing head of the punch blowing off the label onto the pack by producing a blast of compressed air directed toward the pack.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The feed assembly <b>2</b>, the dispensing assembly <b>4</b> and the application assembly <b>6</b> each form functional units of the labeling device <b>1</b>. Besides the functional units already mentioned, even further functional units can be provided, as will be explained in even greater detail below. Likewise, the labeling system can also comprise a plurality of labeling devices <b>1</b>, in particular of the kind described here.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">At least one or all of the functional units mentioned, that is to say here and preferably at least the feed assembly <b>2</b>, the dispensing assembly <b>4</b> and the application assembly <b>6</b>, each comprise a sensor assembly <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>10</b>, which can be used to determine sensor data with regard to carrying out a labeling routine.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The labeling device <b>1</b> furthermore comprises a control assembly <b>11</b>. In the labeling routine the functional units are controlled by means of the control assembly <b>11</b> for the purpose of labeling the individual packs. For this purpose, the control assembly <b>11</b> preferably comprises control electronics for implementing the control tasks that arise in the context of the labeling routine. The control assembly <b>11</b>, as also illustrated in a simplified manner in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, can be a central control assembly <b>11</b>, which controls all or at least a portion of the functional units. It is likewise possible for the control assembly <b>11</b> to comprise a plurality of decentralized control units that communicate with one another, each functional unit preferably being assigned a respective control unit.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The sensor data determined by the respective sensor assemblies <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>10</b> are communicated to the control assembly <b>11</b> and serve firstly for controlling the functional units in the labeling routine. In this case, each of the sensor assemblies <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>10</b> comprises at least one sensor and preferably a plurality of sensors, which determine sensor data for example on the basis of optical, acoustical, mechanical and/or electronic measurement variables. By way of example, the sensors are embodied as temperature sensors and/or as moisture sensors.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Preferably, the sensor assembly <b>8</b> of the feed assembly <b>2</b> can comprise sensors for determining the transport speed and the rotational speed of the drive assemblies driving the transport belt <b>3</b>. The dispensing assembly <b>4</b> comprises for example a sensor assembly <b>9</b> having sensors for determining the speed, the length and the current position of the material strip <b>5</b>. The application assembly <b>6</b> comprises in particular a sensor assembly <b>10</b> for ascertaining the position and orientation of the oscillating punch <b>7</b>. In respect of further embodiments of the sensor assemblies, reference may be made to measures known to the person skilled in the art for controlling the operation of the functional units of the labeling device <b>1</b> in the labeling routine on the basis of sensor technology.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The labeling system comprises a monitoring assembly <b>12</b>. During the labeling routine, in a monitoring routine, by means of the monitoring assembly <b>12</b>, the sensor data determined by the sensor assemblies <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>10</b> of the functional units are captured in accordance with a sensor capture density predefined for the respective functional unit. In respect of the embodiment of the monitoring routine, reference may supplementarily be made to the introductory explanations.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">&#x201c;Determining&#x201d; sensor data by means of the sensor assemblies <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>10</b> is understood to mean any provision of measured values ascertained by sensor measurements of the respective sensor assembly <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>10</b>, and of variables derived therefrom, which are communicated for example to the control assembly <b>11</b>. By contrast, &#x201c;capturing&#x201d; the determined sensor data by means of the monitoring assembly <b>12</b> is understood to mean acquiring&#x2014;in the sense of receiving&#x2014;, in particular storing, and optionally processing sensor data by means of the monitoring assembly <b>12</b>, preferably only a portion of the determined sensor data being captured by means of the monitoring assembly <b>12</b>. In principle, the monitoring assembly <b>12</b> captures the sensor data determined by the sensor assemblies <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>10</b> in accordance with the sensor capture density predefined for the respective functional unit.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The sensor capture density predefines an amount of sensor data to be captured for the respective functional unit, a higher sensor capture density corresponding to a higher amount of sensor data to be captured. The sensor capture density contains a predefinition to the effect of which and how many of the determined sensor data are captured by the monitoring assembly <b>12</b>. Preferably only a smaller amount of sensor data in comparison with the entire sensor data determined or determinable by the sensor assemblies <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>10</b> is captured by way of the sensor capture density. In this case, the amount of sensor data can be understood to mean the size occupied by the sensor data over time on a data memory, for example in bits, wherein the sensor data can be present in compressed or uncompressed form.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The monitoring assembly <b>12</b> can be integrated in the control assembly <b>11</b>. The monitoring assembly <b>12</b> can likewise be embodied as a separate assembly that is in communication with the labeling system. The monitoring assembly <b>12</b> can be embodied for example as an external assembly that communicates with the labeling system and in particular the sensor assemblies <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>10</b> and/or the control assembly <b>11</b> via a network.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The labeling system comprises a user interface <b>13</b>, which is equipped here and preferably with a touchscreen. By way of the user interface <b>13</b>, it is possible to visualize system parameters of the functional units in the labeling routine and for example also sensor data or variables derived therefrom for a user of the labeling system. The user can likewise influence the carrying out of the labeling routine, for example, by way of an input by means of the user interface <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">What is essential, then, is that a user query routine is carried out by means of the monitoring assembly <b>12</b>, in which user query routine a user, by means of the user interface <b>13</b> of the labeling system, is requested to input a state relating to a functional aspect of the labeling system and the state thereupon input by the user is communicated to the monitoring assembly <b>12</b>, that the monitoring assembly <b>12</b> compares the input state with a predefined state and, in the event of a deviation of the input state from the predefined state, carries out an internal reaction routine.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In this respect, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a schematic sequence of the method according to the proposal comprising the user query routine and also the subsequent labeling routine and monitoring routine with various actions that can be carried out.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In action <b>14</b>, a user of the labeling system, by means of the user interface <b>13</b>, is requested to input a state relating to a functional aspect of the labeling system. &#x201c;State&#x201d; is understood to mean a subjective measure of quality regarding a classification of the quality of the work result and/or the process quality in relation to the respective functional aspect.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In action <b>15</b>, the user inputs the state by means of the user interface <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In action <b>16</b>, the state input by the user is communicated to the monitoring assembly <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">By means of the monitoring assembly <b>12</b>, in action <b>17</b>, the state input on the part of the user is compared with a state predefined on the part of the system. The predefined state for the affected functional aspect is for example representative of a course of the labeling routine appertaining to normal operation, and of the fact that for example the quality of the work result and/or the process quality in relation to the respective functional aspect corresponds to the expected quality. In this case, the input state need not necessarily be compared with an individual predefined state. Rather, the input state can also be checked to the effect of whether it lies in a predefined range of states.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">What is furthermore essential is that in the internal reaction routine carried out by the monitoring assembly <b>12</b>, by comparison with the previous sensor capture density, a changed, in particular increased or decreased, sensor capture density of at least one functional unit is predefined.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In one preferred embodiment, in the internal reaction routine the predefinition of the changed, in particular increased or decreased, sensor capture density of at least one functional unit is performed depending on whether the input state falls below or exceeds the predefined state.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, in response to falling below the predefined state, in action <b>18</b>, the internal reaction routine is initiated by means of the monitoring assembly <b>12</b>.

The state predefined on the part of the system in this case is, in particular, the state which was input by the user in a preceding user query routine and which&#x2014;in a manner expressing the dissatisfaction of the user&#x2014;was decreased in comparison with an optimum state. By way of example, after the preceding user query routine in which a comparatively low state was input, maintenance or repair work was carried out on the labeling device <b>1</b>, which has resulted in an improvement in the quality of the work result and/or the process quality in relation to the respective functional aspect. The user is now more satisfied and therefore inputs a state higher than the predefined state. Preferably, here as well an internal reaction routine can be initiated by means of the monitoring assembly <b>12</b>, the sensor capture density of at least one functional unit being newly predefined and in particular reduced on the basis of the input state.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In one preferred embodiment, in the internal reaction routine a degree of the deviation of the input state from the predefined state is determined and in the internal reaction routine the predefinition of the changed, in particular increased or decreased, sensor capture density of at least one functional unit is performed depending on the degree of the deviation. Preferably, in the internal reaction routine the sensor capture density of at least one functional unit is predefined on the basis of the input state in such a way that a higher sensor capture density is predefined with a lower state and/or a lower sensor capture density is predefined with a higher state.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In particular, in the event of the input state falling below the predefined state, the sensor capture density of the assigned functional unit is increased by comparison with a predefined sensor capture density appertaining to normal operation. The predefined sensor capture density appertaining to normal operation is understood to mean a sensor capture density which corresponds to customary storage of sensor data for fault analyses, system improvements, for facilitating maintenance or the like.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Preferably, in the event of the input state exceeding the predefined state, the sensor capture density of the assigned functional unit is reduced by comparison with the predefined sensor capture density appertaining to normal operation, such that a smaller amount of sensor data for the respective functional unit is captured by means of the monitoring routine following the user query routine in order to save resources.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">What is essential, moreover, is that, following the user query routine, the labeling routine is continued using adapted system parameters of one or more of the functional units, which is represented as action <b>20</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">During the labeling routine, furthermore, in action <b>21</b>, the monitoring routine is carried out using the changed sensor capture density predefined from the user query routine.

However, the monitoring routine is used, for example, in the event of a deviation of the input state from the predefined state, to provide an increased amount of sensor data in a targeted manner for the functional unit or functional units affected by the functional aspect. In one embodiment, an assignment of at least one, in particular exactly one, of the functional units to the state is provided on the basis of the relevant functional aspect. The changed, in particular increased, sensor capture density is accordingly predefined for the at least one, in particular exactly one, functional unit assigned to the input state.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The user is requested for example to input a state relating to a predetermined functional aspect (for example the quality of the application of the label), this predetermined functional aspect being assigned at least one functional unit (for example the application assembly <b>4</b>). The assignment to a functional unit arises in particular as a result of the causality of the working mode of the respective functional unit for the work result associated with the state and/or as a result of the causality of the working mode of the respective functional unit for the process quality associated with the state. Preferably, the assignment of the input state to at least one, in particular exactly one, of the functional units is already predefined from the outset, that is to say already before the beginning of the user query routine, on the basis of a stipulated assignment specification. However, it is also conceivable for an assignment of the input state to at least one, in particular exactly one, of the functional units to be carried out only in the internal reaction routine by means of the monitoring assembly <b>12</b>, preferably also on the basis of a stipulated assignment specification, for example if the state is input in a free input by the user.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In one preferred, particularly user-friendly embodiment, in the user query routine the user, by means of the user interface <b>13</b>, is requested to select the state from a compilation of selectable states. This affords a particularly intuitive input of the state.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In one embodiment, the compilation of selectable states can represent a rising scale from a low to a high state. A low state expresses a low satisfaction of the user and a high state expresses a high satisfaction of the user. The state can be represented by a numerical value, for example, a low numerical value representing a low state and a high numerical value representing a high state. In the user query routine the user is requested to input the state on the basis of a selection from the scale. The sensor capture density can thus be predefined in the internal reaction routine in a particularly simple manner on the basis of the input state, for example the changed sensor capture density being determined by way of a mathematical function from the state represented by the numerical value. Preferably in the internal reaction routine the sensor capture density of the assigned functional unit is predefined on the basis of the input state in such a way that a higher sensor capture density is predefined with a lower state or that a lower sensor capture density is predefined with a higher state.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The sensor capture density can be changed in various ways in the internal reaction routine. In this regard, in one embodiment, on the basis of the input state a changed sensor capture density of the respective functional unit is predefined by a changed temporal rate of the sensor data determined by the sensor assembly <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>10</b> and/or of the sensor data captured by the monitoring assembly <b>12</b> being predefined. The temporal rate of the sensor data determined by the sensor assembly <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>10</b> is taken to mean the points in time at which and in particular the predefined time intervals in which the sensor data are determined by the sensor assembly <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>10</b>. The temporal rate of the sensor data captured by the monitoring assembly <b>12</b> is taken to mean the points in time at which and in particular the predefined time intervals in which the sensor data are captured by the monitoring assembly <b>12</b>. An increase of the sensor capture density can accordingly be achieved by way of temporally closer together points in time and in particular smaller time intervals. A decrease of the sensor capture density can accordingly be achieved by way of temporally further apart points in time and in particular larger time intervals.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The sensor capture density of the assigned functional unit can likewise be predefined on the basis of the input state by the number of activated sensors being predefined. By way of example, the sensor assemblies <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>10</b> can comprise sensors which are not absolutely necessary, or not necessary at least at times, for controlling the labeling routine. The sensor capture density can be increased by these additional sensors likewise being activated and used for determining further sensor data. The selection of the activated sensors of the sensor assembly <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>10</b> of the assigned functional unit can likewise be predefined. By way of example, specific sensors relating to the functional aspect affected by the state are activated for the purpose of changing the sensor capture density.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Furthermore, the sensor capture density of the assigned functional unit can be predefined on the basis of the input state by the information density of the sensor data determined by the sensor assembly <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>10</b> being predefined, as a result of which an information density of the sensor data can be changed. In this regard, a processing mode of a processing of the sensor data that is carried out by means of the sensor assembly <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>10</b> can be predefined. In this case, the sensor assembly <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>10</b> is configured to carry out a processing of the determined sensor data, for instance in the context of a preprocessing and/or a (pre)evaluation of the sensor data. Examples thereof are determining a temporal profile of sensor data and determining time-dependent variables from the sensor data. The processing mode is a predefinition of whether and in what form a processing by the sensor assembly <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>10</b> takes place. For an increase of the sensor capture density, an increase of the information density of the sensor data can thus be provided. This can be done by the processing mode being changed in such a way that an additional processing of the sensor data takes place, for example by sensor data with a temporal relation and/or averaged sensor data being provided by the sensor assembly <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>10</b>. A decrease of the information density of the sensor data can likewise be provided by a processing of sensor data not taking place, such that for example only raw data of the sensor data are captured in the context of the monitoring routine. In the case of a comparatively low information density of the sensor data, for example, only the values for a physical variable, e.g. the pressure, are determined by the sensor assembly <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>10</b> or captured in the context of the monitoring routine, whereas in the case of a comparatively high information density of the sensor data, for example, additionally or alternatively the values for the physical variable, e.g. the pressure, in a form linked with a temporal relation and/or in averaged form are determined by the sensor assembly <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>10</b> or captured in the context of the monitoring routine.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">After the user has input a state, in one preferred embodiment, in the internal reaction routine the user, by means of the user interface <b>13</b>, is requested to manually predefine the sensor capture density of at least one functional unit. By way of example, the amount by which the sensor capture density is intended to be increased or reduced can be influenced by the user by means of an input. It is likewise conceivable for the user to deliberately influence the change of the sensor capture density and to be able to activate and/or deactivate individual sensors of the functional units by means of the user interface <b>13</b>, for example. Preferably, at least one of the functional units is assigned to the input state on the basis of the relevant functional aspect and the assignment is output to the user by means of the user interface <b>13</b>, thereby indicating to the user which functional unit(s) may be the cause of the deviation from the predefined state.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In a further, preferred embodiment, in the monitoring routine the sensor data captured by means of the monitoring assembly <b>12</b> are stored, in particular stored in the monitoring assembly <b>12</b>. &#x201c;Storing&#x201d; the captured sensor data is understood to mean that the captured sensor data are stored on a nonvolatile data memory by means of the monitoring assembly <b>12</b>.
