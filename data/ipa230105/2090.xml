When the goods are to be packed, a packing strap is first packed around the circumference of the goods, and then two free ends of the packing strap are inserted through a packing buckle. The two free ends of the packing strap are driven to move relative to each other by using a packing tool to tighten the packing strap, and then the packing tool is further to tighten the packing buckle to fix the packing strap, so as to achieve the purpose of packing the goods.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, the existing packaging strap is in the form of a packing strap. In use, it is manually pulled out a predetermined length and then cut. The operation is time-consuming, and the length of the packing strap required for packing the goods needs to be calculated in advance. There will be a problem of inconsistent length. Under long-term operation, users are easily fatigued, which will reduce the efficiency of cutting operations. Accordingly, the inventor of the present invention has devoted himself based on his many years of practical experiences to solve these problems.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The primary object of the present invention is to provide a packing strap length cutting apparatus, which is capable of automatically pulling out and cutting a predetermined length of a packaging tape to assist the user in completing the cutting operation quickly.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to achieve the above object, the present invention provides a packing strap length cutting apparatus, comprising a main body, including an accommodating member, the accommodating member being connected to a base;

When a user wants to perform a cutting operation, first, the control device <b>20</b> is activated, and the buttons <b>22</b> are used for setting the length of the packing strap <b>200</b> for the calculation unit <b>60</b>. Then, the packing strap <b>200</b> is pulled to the position of the first roller <b>45</b>. The first roller <b>45</b> drives the packing strap <b>200</b> to pass through the second opening <b>162</b> via the strap cutting unit <b>50</b>. The second roller <b>63</b> and the encoder <b>62</b> calculate the length of the packing strap <b>200</b> to be pulled out. When the predetermined length of the packing strap <b>200</b> is reached, the control valve controls the high-pressure gas to enter the first chamber <b>311</b> through the through hole <b>313</b> to move the sealing pad <b>32</b>, the pressing plate <b>33</b> and the shaft <b>34</b> toward the linking member <b>53</b> and the packing strap <b>200</b>. The shaft <b>34</b>, the link rods <b>35</b> and the clamping rods <b>36</b> are moved downward from the initial position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. Next, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, when the fixing plate <b>373</b> abuts against the lower blade seat <b>525</b>, the packing strap <b>200</b> is positioned at the limiting groove <b>371</b> of the fixing blocks <b>37</b>. Next, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the shaft <b>34</b> is further moved downward to link the link rods <b>35</b> to press against the clamping rods <b>36</b> to rotate relative to each other.

In this way, when the shaft <b>34</b> is moved downward, the first contact surface <b>342</b> pushes against the protrusion <b>531</b> a distance, and then the second contact surface <b>343</b> pushes against the recess <b>532</b>. The protrusion <b>531</b> and the recess <b>532</b> are arc-shaped, so they can be pressed stably, thereby reducing the stagnation between the pivot portion <b>341</b> of the shaft <b>34</b> and the linking member <b>53</b>, so that the pivot portion <b>341</b> of the shaft <b>34</b> is more coherent and smoother when moving relatively.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a schematic view of the preferred embodiment of the present invention when in use. Finally, the floating connection unit <b>80</b> can automatically adjust to the position of the packing strap <b>200</b> to be pulled out according to the position of the packing strap <b>200</b> to be pulled out. It is worth mentioning that the coupling seat <b>81</b> has the adjustment hole <b>812</b> and the swing member <b>82</b> is accommodated in the adjustment hole <b>812</b>.
