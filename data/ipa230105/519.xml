In addition, in recent years, a technique has been developed for visualizing the running of a blood vessel in a living body by an image obtained by receiving transmitted light of near-infrared light with which the living body is irradiated.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the metal needle described above, the metal needle body does not transmit near-infrared light. Therefore, the positional relationship between the needle body and the blood vessel in the living body can be visualized by the image (transmitted light image) obtained by receiving the transmitted light of the light (for example, near-infrared light) with which the living body punctured with the needle body is irradiated. However, the transmitted light image indicates the planar positional relationship between the needle body and the blood vessel, and does not indicate the positional relationship between the needle body and the blood vessel in the depth direction. Therefore, a user cannot be aware of whether the needle body is located in the blood vessel based on the transmitted light image.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Embodiments of the present disclosure have been developed in view of such problems, and an object of certain embodiments is to provide a puncture needle, a catheter assembly, and a vascular puncture system capable of allowing a user to recognize when a needle body is located in a blood vessel based on a transmitted light image.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to a first aspect of the present disclosure, a medical puncture needle includes a metal needle body formed in a tubular shape, in which the needle body includes a blade surface formed at a distal end portion of the needle body, a first transmission window configured to transmit light, and a second transmission window configured to transmit light transmitted through the first transmission window, the second transmission window is located on a proximal end side relative to the blade surface, and the first transmission window and the second transmission window are shifted from each other in a circumferential direction of the needle body.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to a second aspect of the present disclosure, a catheter assembly includes the above-described puncture needle and a catheter shaft having a lumen through which the needle body is inserted.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to a third aspect of the present disclosure, a vascular puncture system includes the above-described puncture needle, an irradiation unit configured to irradiate a living body punctured with the needle body with the light; and a light receiving unit configured to receive transmitted light transmitted through the living body.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to certain embodiments of the present invention, light with which the living body punctured with the needle body is irradiated is transmitted through the first transmission window and is guided to the lumen of the needle body. When the needle body is not located in the blood vessel and the blood does not flow into the lumen of the needle body, the light guided from the first transmission window into the lumen of the needle body is transmitted through the second transmission window and led to the outside of the needle body. Therefore, the user can visually recognize the second transmission window in the needle body in the transmitted light image. On the other hand, when the needle body is located in the blood vessel and the blood flowing into the lumen of the needle body covers the second transmission window, the light guided from the first transmission window to the lumen of the needle body is absorbed by the blood and thus is not transmitted through the second transmission window. Therefore, the appearance of the second transmission window of the needle body changes in the transmitted light image (the second transmission window is invisible or the second transmission window is difficult to see). Therefore, the user can recognize when the needle body is located in the blood vessel based on the transmitted light image.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic configuration diagram of a vascular puncture system according to an embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an exploded perspective view of the catheter assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is a plan view of a distal end portion of the needle body of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along line IIIB-IIIB of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along line IIIC-IIIC of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a first explanatory view of a puncture procedure for a blood vessel with the catheter assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a transmitted light image in the state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a second explanatory view of a puncture procedure for a blood vessel with the catheter assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a transmitted light image in the state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> is a plan view of a needle body according to a first modification, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref> is a plan view of a needle body according to a second modification;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref> is a plan view of a needle body according to a third modification, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along line IXB-IXB of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref> is an explanatory view illustrating a state in which the needle body of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref> is inclined by a predetermined puncture angle;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref> is a plan view of a needle body according to a fourth modification, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along line XB-XB in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>C</figref> is a cross-sectional view illustrating another configuration of the first transmission window and the second transmission window in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref>;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref> is a plan view of a needle body according to a fifth modification, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along line XIB-XIB of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>;
