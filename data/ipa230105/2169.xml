Scraper blades wear or become damaged during use and periodically require replacement. Conveyors are typically shut down when scraper blades require replacement so that service personnel can obtain access to the scraper blades for removal and replacement while avoiding injury that could potentially occur if the conveyor belt were moving. Conveyor belt cleaners also often require service due to a buildup of the conveyed material on the scraper blade after the material has been removed from the belt which decreases the cleaning efficiency of the scraper blade. The present invention allows the fast, efficient removal and replacement of scraper blades without needing to move the scraper blades along the length of the mounting cartridge and reduces material buildup on the scraper blades to provide increased cleaning efficiency over the life of the scraper blades.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Existing conveyor belt cleaners, such as the one described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,581,754, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference, have several limitations. The blades of this prior art cleaner can seize/bind during removal due to the build up of fines in the horizontal track within which the blades slide. They require the scraper blades to slide along the length of the cartridge for removal. They have a large extended footprint due to the inclusion of stiffeners. They can allow the build-up of material on the rear surfaces of blades where horizontal surfaces are present.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Reference to cited material or information contained in the text should not be understood as a concession that the material or information was part of the common general knowledge or was known in Australia or any other country.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is an object of this invention to provide to ameliorate, mitigate or overcome, at least one disadvantage of the prior art, or which will at least provide the public with a practical choice.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a first embodiment, the present invention seeks to provide a scraper blade mounting assembly for a conveyor belt cleaner including; at least one scraper blade; a support cartridge arranged to removingly fix the at least one conveyor belt cleaner scraper blade; wherein a top surface of the support cartridge includes an engaging means for receiving the at least one conveyor belt cleaner scraper blade; and wherein the engaging means is arranged to restrain sliding movement along the length of the support cartridge.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Preferably, the engaging means includes a plurality of teeth extending from the top of the support cartridge and angled with respect to the longitudinal extension of the support cartridge.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Preferably, the engaging means includes a space between adjacent teeth of the plurality of teeth; and wherein the space is arranged to receive a pin in the base of the at least one scraper blade to retain the at least one scraper blade on the engaging means.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Preferably, the scraper blade mounting system for a conveyor belt cleaner includes a locking means, wherein the locking means is arranged to engage one end of the at least one scraper blade to fix the at least one scraper blade in place.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Preferably, the locking means is a cam lock.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Preferably, the support cartridge has a square tube profile; and wherein a corner of the square tube profile includes the engaging means.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Preferably, the engaging means is a stiffener.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Preferably, the scraper blade includes no horizontal surfaces in use.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Preferably, the scraper blade mounting system for a conveyor belt cleaner includes a plurality of scraper blades.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Further features of the present invention are more fully described in the following description of several non-limiting embodiments thereof.

The scraper blade mounting assembly <b>11</b> includes a generally linear and elongate cross shaft <b>44</b>. The cross shaft <b>44</b> includes a central axis that extends between a first end <b>49</b> and a second end <b>50</b>. The cross shaft <b>44</b> is formed as a square tube having a hollow rectangular bore extending from the first end <b>49</b> to the second end <b>50</b>. The cross shaft <b>44</b> is positioned in use so that a bottom cross shaft corner <b>45</b> of the rectangular or square tube forming the cross shaft <b>44</b> is at the base of the cross shaft <b>44</b>. Side cross shaft corners <b>46</b> each include apertures <b>43</b> located adjacent the second end <b>50</b> of the cross shaft <b>44</b>.
