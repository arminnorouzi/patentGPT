Furthermore, the present disclosure relates to a process comprising separating at least one purified hydrocarbon stream from at least one crude hydrocarbon feed stream, wherein the process is performed in such a plant.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND INFORMATION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Distillation and absorption for recovery of an LPG stream, a stabilized naphtha stream and a fuel gas stream from feeds comprised of unstabilized naphtha stream(s) and light component gas stream(s) are common separation techniques used in the process industries. Both techniques require a large amount of plot space, raw materials for construction, and capital expenditures. Distillation and absorption often require designing for high-pressure operation, which results in significant quantities of raw materials and capital expenditures to construct the equipment necessary to implement the distillation and absorption techniques.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Known plants for recovery of an LPG stream, a stabilized naphtha stream and a fuel gas stream from feeds comprised of unstabilized naphtha stream(s) and lightened component gas stream(s) typically comprise four separate distillation and absorption column vessels, namely a stripper distillation column, a primary absorber column, a sponge absorber column and a depropanizer or debutanizer column. However, the use of four separate column vessels consumes a lot of plot space, requires foundations for all four columns, increases raw material usage and increases capital expenditures. In addition, this conventional approach to separation leads to a so-called &#x201c;back-mixing&#x201d; of components that takes place in the bottom of the stripper column, because the LPG boiling range products are concentrated at an intermediate point within the stripper column only to be downgraded to a lower concentration at the bottom of the stripper column. Therefore, components that were previously separated are recombined. As set out further below, the design of the present disclosure avoids this inefficiency to also reduce energy consumption as well as capital cost.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In view of this, the object underlying the present disclosure is to provide a plant and process for separating one or more purified hydrocarbon stream(s) from one or more crude hydrocarbon feed stream(s), in particular for recovering stabilized naphtha, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and fuel gas from a feed stream containing unstabilized naphtha and a feed stream containing lightened gas, in which the required plot space is reduced, the raw material consumption for construction is reduced and the capital expenditures are decreased, while improving the separation efficiency and particularly the LPG recovery so that an efficient and cost efficient plant may be installed even at locations with limited plot space.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with the present disclosure, this object is satisfied by providing a plant for separating at least one purified hydrocarbon stream from at least one crude hydrocarbon feed stream, in particular for recovering stabilized naphtha, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and fuel gas from a feed stream containing unstabilized naphtha and a feed stream containing lightened gas. The plant comprises a vessel with a single foundation. The vessel comprises an absorber section and a first divided-wall column. The first divided-wall column comprises a dividing wall, a stripper section and a stabilization section.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">By combining an absorber section, a stripper section and a stabilization section within one vessel with a single foundation, wherein at least the stripper section and the stabilization section are comprised in a first divided-wall column comprising a dividing wall, a plant requiring reduced plot space, with a reduced raw material consumption for construction and lower capital expenditures is obtained. In particular, a plant is obtained in which the separation efficiency, and in particular&#x2014;in a LPG separating plant&#x2014;the LPG recovery, can be improved so that an efficient and cost efficient plant may be installed even at locations with limited plot space. The provision of a first divided-wall column in the vessel also allows one to combine two usually separate distillation columns, namely a stripper column and a stabilization column, into one column, and also to improve the separation efficiency of the two columns. Furthermore, the aforementioned &#x201c;back-mixing&#x201d; of components that takes place in the bottom of the stripper column of the prior art is eliminated. Thus, the plant and process of the present disclosure provide an innovative technique, wherein the components in conventional multi-vessel plants are combined into a single vessel requiring only one foundation. Thereby, the number of required foundations may be reduced from four as in conventional plants to one for the plant of the present disclosure as further described below. In addition, the amount of metal required for the vessel and column insulation of the plant of the present disclosure is drastically lower, namely up to 30% lower, than that of conventional plants due to the merge of two distillation columns into one divided-wall column. Thereby, the number of ladders and platforms can be reduced in half and the resulting weight reduction decreases the load that is supported by the single foundation. The plant and process according to the present disclosure are particularly suitable for the recovery of an LPG stream, a stabilized naphtha stream and a fuel gas stream from crude hydrocarbon feed streams comprising unstabilized naphtha stream(s) and lightened component gas stream(s). All in all, the plant of the present disclosure using divided-wall technology allows significant reduction of the capital investment costs, enables improved product recovery/separation and a decreased plot space requirement for new units. Moreover, the naphtha stabilization and LPG recovery plant of the present disclosure is very tolerant of large variations in the crude hydrocarbon feed stream composition. For example, feeds to the plant may comprise variations of non-condensables (such as hydrogen) without negatively impacting the plant operation and performance. Additional benefits of the naphtha stabilization and LPG recovery plant of the present disclosure are that it allows an improved handling of water in the feed, elimination of the need for a bottoms pump for use in connection with the absorber, a more optimized design of tray count on both sides of the divided-wall column and an improved optimization of column diameters.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The terms &#x201c;stripper section&#x201d;, &#x201c;stabilization section&#x201d; and &#x201c;absorber section&#x201d; as well as the subsequently used terms &#x201c;primary absorber section&#x201d; and &#x201c;sponge absorber section&#x201d; are generally used in the present disclosure without any structural limitation to simply facilitate the denotation of the different sections of the vessel of the plant in accordance with the present disclosure. Preferably, the stripper section is embodied so as to work during the operation of the plant as a stripper (which is also called in this technical field a deethanizer), whereas the stabilization section is preferably embodied so as to work during the operation of the plant as a stabilizer, a depropanizer or a debutanizer, respectively, and the absorber section is preferably embodied so as to work during the operation of the plant as an absorber, as set out below in more detail. As set out below, the absorber section may be provided in the first divided-wall column or may be arranged in the vessel outside of the first divided-wall column.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Moreover, the term first divided-wall column is defined in the present patent disclosure broadly as any column being usable as a distillation column or absorber column comprising a wall, which at least partially subdivides the interior space of the column into at least two sections, which are separated from each other by the dividing wall, irrespective of the location of the dividing wall and irrespective of the form of the dividing wall. The prefix &#x201c;first&#x201d; is only used to easily distinguish this divided-wall column from any other optionally present divided-wall column of the plant and does not mean that another divided-wall column is necessarily present nor that, if one or more other divided-wall columns are present, there is a particular arrangement or order, respectively, between the first and optional other divided-wall columns.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In addition, the term &#x201c;vessel&#x201d; means in accordance with the present disclosure one or more columns using one common foundation. The one or more columns of the vessel are connected with each other so as to form one single vessel, as set out in more detail further below. For instance, the one or more columns of the vessel may be connected with each by a frame, which is for instance made by a wall, or by any other connection part, such as fasteners, screws, bolts and the like. Importantly, the one or more columns are connected such that only one foundation is present and needed, namely the foundation required already for one of the two columns.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Preferably, the dividing wall partially divides the first divided-wall column into a first side comprising the stripper section and into a second side comprising the stabilization section so that the divided-wall column comprises a portion with the first side and the second side being divided by the dividing wall arranged therebetween and one or two other portions that are not divided by the dividing wall, wherein the first divided-wall column further comprises a feed line coupled to the stripper section and configured to provide at least one crude hydrocarbon feed stream to the stripper section and a bottoms removal line coupled to the bottom and configured to remove a bottom stream from the first divided-wall column. The first and second sides separated from each other by the dividing wall may be, but must not be of the same dimensions, i.e. the dividing wall may partially divide the first divided-wall column into a first half comprising the stripper section and into a second half comprising the stabilization section.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In accordance with a further embodiment of the present disclosure, the plant further comprises a condenser, which is coupled to the stabilization section of the first divided-wall column via a gas line so as to receive a gas stream from the stabilization section and via a recirculation line so as to recirculate at least a part of the condensate formed in the condenser into the stabilization section of the first divided-wall column. The condenser may be also considered as part of the first divided-wall column, even if it is located outside the first divided-wall column, because it is coupled via lines to the first divided-wall column.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Moreover, it is preferred that the plant further comprises a reboiler, which is coupled to the bottom of first divided-wall column via a liquid line and configured to receive a bottom stream from the first divided-wall column and coupled to the bottom of first divided-wall column via a recirculation line so as to recirculate at least a part of the gas formed in the reboiler into the first divided-wall column. The reboiler may be also considered as part of the first divided-wall column, even if it is located outside the first divided-wall column, because it is coupled via lines to the first divided-wall column.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In accordance with a first preferred embodiment of the present disclosure, the absorber section is arranged in the vessel outside the first divided-wall column. In this embodiment, the first divided-wall column is a closed column (i.e. a column entirely margined by a wall), wherein the dividing wall extends preferably from the top of the first divided-wall column over a part of the height of the first divided-wall column at least essentially vertically downwards so that the divided-wall column comprises an upper portion with the first side and the second side being divided by the dividing wall arranged therebetween and a further lower portion being not divided by the dividing wall. Essentially vertically downwards means that the angle between the dividing wall and the length axis of the first divided-wall column is at most 20&#xb0;, preferably at most 10&#xb0;, more preferably at most 5&#xb0; and most preferably 0&#xb0;, wherein the height of the first divided-wall column is the straight distance between the top and the bottom of the first divided-wall column.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is preferred in the aforementioned embodiment that the dividing wall of the first divided-wall column extends from the top of the first divided-wall column over 10 to 95%, more preferably over 20 to 90%%, yet more preferably over 20 to 80%, even more preferably over 30 to 70% and most preferably over 40 to 70% of the height of the first divided-wall column. In other words, preferably the lower 5 to 90%, more preferably the lower 10 to 80%%, yet more preferably the lower 20 to 80%, even more preferably the lower 30 to 70% and most preferably the lower 30 to 60% of the height of the first divided-wall column are not subdivided by the dividing wall.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In accordance with a further embodiment of the present disclosure, it is proposed that in the aforementioned first preferred embodiment of the present disclosure the vessel comprises a second column which is arranged on top of (i.e. placed onto) or above (i.e. placed in a distance above) the first divided-wall column, wherein the second column comprises the absorber section, at least one feed line and at least one removal line. More specifically, preferably the whole interior of the second column is in this embodiment the absorber section.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">It is further preferred in the aforementioned embodiment that the second column comprises in its upper part a first gas removal line and in its lower part a second removal line, wherein the plant further comprises a condenser, which is coupled to the second column via the first gas removal line so as to receive a gas stream from the second column and coupled to the second column via a recirculation line so as to recirculate at least a part of the condensate formed in the condenser into the second column.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In accordance with the present disclosure, the vessel comprises both the first divided-wall column and the absorber section, i.e. in the aforementioned embodiment the second column. The first divided-wall column and the second column are preferably connected with each other by a connection part. The connection part may be a continuation of the vessel connected by welding of the vessel metal or using a flange connection with fasteners, such as bolt(s) and the like. Alternatively, or in addition thereto, a frame may be positioned onto the top of the first divided-wall column being adapted in its form to the upper part of the first divided-wall column and to the lower part of the second column so that the frame fixes the second column on the first divided-wall column. As set out above, it is important that the one or more columns are so connected that only one foundation is present and needed, namely the foundation required already for one of the two columns.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The second column of the aforementioned embodiment may be a column with one interior space, which is not subdivided by any wall into two or more sections, i.e. which does not comprise a dividing wall.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Alternatively, the second column may be a divided-wall column comprising a dividing wall, wherein the dividing wall at least partially divides and preferably completely divides the second divided-wall column into a first side comprising a primary absorber section and a second side comprising a sponge absorber section. The sum of the primary absorber section and the sponge absorber section forms the absorber section. Only a low-pressure differential between the primary absorber and the sponge absorber is necessary, which enables the use of relatively thin material for the dividing wall. The vessel wall differential pressure is near 200 psi, whereas the dividing wall differential pressure can be less than 2 psi. Thus, the overall the amount of metal required for the vessel and column insulation of the plant of the present disclosure is drastically lower, namely up to 30% lower, than that of conventional plants due to the merge of two distillation columns into one divided-wall column. In this embodiment, the second divided-wall column replaces two separate absorber columns and the first divided-wall column also replaces two separate distillation columns required in conventional plants, so that the number of columns is reduced from four to two and the number of foundations is reduced from four to one.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Preferably, the dividing wall of the second divided-wall column extends from the top of the second divided-wall column at least essentially vertically downwards to the bottom of the second divided-wall column so as to completely fluid tightly separate the first side from the second side of the second divided-wall column. In other words, in contrast to the preferred embodiment of the first column, wherein the dividing wall of the first divided-wall column only extends over a part of the height of the first divided-wall column, it is preferred for the second divided-wall column that the dividing wall extends over the whole height of the second divided-wall column. Also, in this embodiment it is possible, but not necessary, that the plant further comprises a condenser, which is coupled to the second side of the second divided-wall column via the first gas removal line so as to receive a gas stream from the second side and coupled to the second side of the second divided-wall column via a recirculation line so as to recirculate at least a part of the condensate formed in the condenser into the second side of the second divided-wall column.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In accordance with a second preferred embodiment of the present disclosure, the absorber section is arranged in the vessel within the first divided-wall column and not outside the first divided-wall column as in the first preferred embodiment of the present disclosure. In this embodiment, the vessel is the first distillation column and thus does not need to comprise a further device, such as a further device comprising the absorber section. Thereby, two distillation columns and one absorber column required in conventional plants are combined in this embodiment to one column. Thereby, the overall the amount of metal required for the vessel and column insulation of the plant of the present disclosure is drastically reduced, namely by up to 30%, as compared with conventional plants. In addition, the number of columns is reduced from three to one and the number of foundations is reduced from three to one. Furthermore, this embodiment allows to reduce the total number of ladders and platforms in half and the resulting weight reduction decreases the load that is supported by the single foundation.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Preferably, in this second preferred embodiment of the present disclosure, the first divided-wall column comprises an outer wall comprising an upper section, which comprises the absorber section, and a lower section, which is connected with the upper section, wherein the lower section comprises the dividing wall, the stripper section and the stabilization section. Preferably, the uppermost part of the dividing wall defines the upper end of the lower section and the lower end of the upper section.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Preferably, the upper section of the first divided-wall column of this embodiment has a smaller diameter than the lower section of the first divided-wall column. For example, the diameter of the upper section of the first divided-wall column is 10 to 90% and preferably 20 to 60% of the diameter of the lower section. The reduction in diameter may be stepwise, i.e. the whole lower section has the same diameter and the whole upper section has the same diameter.

The term stabilized naphtha will be dependent on whether the plant stabilizer is to be designed as a depropanizer or as a debutanizer. A stabilizer designed as a depropanizer will have a stabilized naphtha with typically 1 wt % or less C<sub>3 </sub>and lighter components. A stabilizer designed as a debutanizer will have stabilized naphtha typically with 2 wt % or less C<sub>4 </sub>and lighter components and even more commonly has 1 wt % or less C<sub>4 </sub>and lighter components. Downstream processing and product specification requirements will dictate the quantity of these lighter components.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The term &#x201c;LPG&#x201d; or &#x201c;liquefied petroleum gas&#x201d; refers to hydrocarbons where the primary components of these hydrocarbons have boiling points as light as propylene and as high as the heaviest butene component with much less quantity of C<sub>5 </sub>hydrocarbons and heavier components as well as much less quantity of ethane and lighter components. LPG will have less than 10% C<sub>2 </sub>and lighter components and less than 10% C<sub>6 </sub>and heavier components. If the stream LPG is a propane stream from a saturate gas plant and sold as HD5 propane it will have a minimum of 90% propane. Although, some embodiments may include recovering C<sub>5 </sub>hydrocarbons components in the LPG depending on downstream processing requirements. If it is LPG from an FCCU and is fed to an alkylation unit the quantity of lights and heavy components will be dictated by the downstream processing. Downstream processing and product specification requirements will dictate the quantity of these heavier and lighter components.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The term &#x201c;lightened gas&#x201d; refers to hydrocarbons and nonhydrocarbons where the primary components of these hydrocarbons and nonhydrocarbons have boiling points as light as hydrogen and as high as heptane with much less quantity of components having boiling points greater than normal heptane.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The terms &#x201c;off gas&#x201d; and &#x201c;fuel gas&#x201d; refer to hydrocarbons and nonhydrocarbons where the primary components of these hydrocarbons and nonhydrocarbons have boiling points as light as hydrogen and as high as ethane with much less quantity of components having boiling points greater than ethane. Propylene and heavier components are normally much more valuable and their recovery from the normally much lower value off gas stream is usually desired.
