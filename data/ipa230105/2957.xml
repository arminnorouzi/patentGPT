The present invention is situated in the field of professional semi-automatic apparatuses for ironing shirts or similar items, used for example at laundries.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE FINDING</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In such context, apparatuses are known for ironing shirts in series which comprise a plurality of operating stations and a carousel on which manikins are mounted. The carousel moves the manikins so as to arrange them one at a time in each operating station. Such operating stations comprise: a loading station, in which an operator positions a hanger and a shirt on the manikin, one or more ironing stations, in which the shirt arranged on the manikin is ironed by means of hot air and/or steam, an unloading station, in which a suitable device automatically picks up, from the manikin, the hanger and the shirt arranged thereon and conveys it into a storage.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The known document EP 0 209 017 illustrates a device which automatically loads hangers on manikins in a plant for ironing clothing articles. The manikins are carried on a conveyor between a hanger reception station, a station for mounting clothing articles on the hangers, a treatment station and a station for removing the hangers with the clothing articles. In the hanger reception station, the hangers, hung from a tilted bar of a storage, are deposited one at a time on respective manikins by means of a movable pin.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The Applicant has observed that the apparatuses of known type, like that described above, can be improved regarding various aspects with particular reference to the automation of the various operations.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In particular, the Applicant has observed that in the apparatuses of known type, the operator must complete a first manual operation, in order to load a hanger in a suitable seat of the manikin, and then complete a second manual operation, in order to arrange a shirt on the same manikin, in a manner such that the shirt is supported by the manikin and a hook or ring of the hanger protrudes from the neck of the shirt. The operator must also complete further operations in order to correctly arrange the shirt such that it is ironed in the correct manner in the subsequent station.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The Applicant has observed that the multiple manual operations must be executed by the operator with a certain speed compatible with the times of the apparatus.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">This can compromise the precision with which the shirts are arranged on the apparatus and lead to an incorrect ironing and/or lead to a decrease of the speed of the machine and an increase of the cycle time necessary for ironing a shirt. In addition, the operator may over time become stressed.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In such context, the Applicant has therefore set the objective of proposing a device for the automatic loading of hangers in an apparatus for ironing shirts or similar items and an apparatus provided with such device which are capable of overcoming the above-indicated drawbacks.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In particular, the Applicant has set the objective of proposing an apparatus with a greater level of automation, such to allow increasing the operating speed of the apparatus, reducing the cycle time, increasing the quality of the ironing, reducing the stress for the operators.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In particular, the Applicant has set as objective that of reducing the manual operations executed by the operator.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The Applicant has found that the above-listed objects and still others can be substantially achieved by equipping the apparatuses for ironing shirts or similar items in series with a loader of hangers capable of automatically positioning a hanger on each manikin before the shirt to be ironed is arranged on the manikin.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In particular, the Applicant has found that the above-listed objects and still others can be substantially achieved by a device and by an apparatus according to one or more of the enclosed claims and/or according to one or more of the following aspects.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to an independent aspect, the present invention relates to a device for the automatic loading of hangers in an apparatus for ironing shirts or similar items.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Preferably, the apparatus comprises: a conveyor; at least one manikin mounted on the conveyor, wherein the manikin is shaped to accept and support a shirt or similar item to be ironed, wherein the manikin has a seat configured to accept a hanger; a loading station for loading, on the manikin, a shirt to be ironed; at least one ironing station for ironing the shirt supported by the manikin; an unloading station for unloading, from the manikin, the ironed shirt.

While the arm <b>18</b> is in the respective first position, the pick-up member <b>15</b>, which was in the rest position, is carried downward along the return branch, it engages the hook of the hanger <b>6</b> and lifts it together with the ironed shirt <b>4</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>), carrying the shirt <b>4</b> upward to the second position on the upper connecting section, where it releases the hanger <b>6</b> and the shirt <b>4</b>, in order to then redescend and be brought back into into the rest position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). The pick-up member <b>15</b> therefore completes a continuous movement along a closed path and is newly stopped in the rest position.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">At the second position, for example, the pick-up member <b>15</b> hangs the hook of the hanger <b>6</b> on a further slide and releases it.
