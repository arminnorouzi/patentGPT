Such focusing is typically achieved by using a sheath fluid to surround and spatially compress the sample fluid into an extremely thin and precisely spatially located stream. A hydrodynamic focusing device typically consists of two main components: a first channel comprising an envelopment region, and a second channel, typically the channel in which measurements on the sample fluid are performed. A sheath fluid is flowed in the first channel whose purpose is to envelop and focus a second, sample, fluid flow which is introduced into the sheath fluid via a sample fluid inlet at the envelopment region. This second sample fluid typically contains artificial or biological particles to be measured.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The volumetric sheath fluid flow is magnitudes larger than the volumetric sample fluid flow&#x2014;typical by a factor of 30. The sheath fluid flow is introduced in the first channel and is used to focus the sample fluid flow into the second channel. The second channel has a smaller cross-section compared to the first channel and is typically in the region of 0.2&#xd7;0.2 mm. This allows for a laser or other known measurement modality to interrogate the sample particles, which are now flowed in the sample liquid in a single file, at a measurement region of the second channel.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to achieve an effective focusing of the sample fluid, it is important to position the inlet of the sample fluid flow in such a way that the sample fluid becomes completely enveloped by the flowing sheath fluid. The classic method for solving this problem is to introduce the sample fluid flow via a needle inlet positioned co-axially with the sheath fluid flow in an envelopment region of the first channel. This method can, however, be prone to clogging depending on needle dimensions. It also requires very precise alignment between mechanical parts. Moreover, from an economic point of view, it is desirable to use manufacturing methods such as injection molding, additive manufacture or lithography to produce such a device. However, it is very difficult to produce a geometry with the previously mentioned methods that allow the sample fluid inlet to be completely surrounded by the sheath fluid flow.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A hydrodynamic focusing device which addresses the problems associated with the classic method is described in EP 1281059. This hydrodynamic focusing device employs a stub, or &#x2018;chimney&#x2019;, inlet for the sample fluid which protrudes into an envelopment region of the first channel perpendicular to the flow direction of the sheath fluid so that the &#x2018;plume&#x2019; of sample fluid from the chimney will migrate downstream towards the second channel as the sheath fluid flows.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">An advantage of using the chimney design is mostly related to manufacturing because the design has no negative slip angles, that is to say, no overhanging structures. This enables a multitude of cost-effective manufacturing techniques, for example, injection molding, additive manufacture or lithography. However, the chimney itself introduces a significant disturbance in the sheath flow. This, in turn, will have a negative effect on the shape of the focused sample fluid at the measurement region. The main cause of the disturbance is the wake effect downstream of the chimney. Flow conditions in the wake region will tend to widen and distort the plume from the inlet chimney which will have a negative effect on the measurement quality due to differences in, for example, sample fluid velocities, measurement laser illumination intensity, and optical focus.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">An alternative hydrodynamic focusing device has been developed which is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 9,784,664. This device basically replaces the chimney of the device described in EP 1281059 with a specifically shaped island in which the sample fluid inlet is formed. The island is shaped such that the wake effect associated with the known chimney is reduced. The device generally comprises a microfluidic chip in which are formed the first channel for carrying a sheath liquid; a diamond-shaped chamber in-line with the first channel to form the envelopment region; a central diamond-shaped island projecting into and positioned concentrically with the chamber, the island having smaller lateral and vertical dimensions than the chamber so that sheath fluid can flow from the channel, through the chamber, around the lateral sides of the island and over the top surface of the island; a sample fluid inlet through the island which terminates at its top surface; and the second channel for receiving the sheath fluid and the enveloped, focused, sample liquid from the chamber and having a smaller cross-section than the first channel. Any sample fluid that is introduced into the microfluidic device through the sample fluid inlet is thus carried downstream along the top surface of the island, which forms a barrier below the sample fluid, and is confined laterally by the sheath fluid. As the sample fluid flows horizontally off the top surface of the island a portion of the sheath fluid that has flowed around the island constrains the sample fluid from below and the sample fluid becomes hydrodynamically focused.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, depending on flow conditions, there is a risk that the sample fluid flow may smear out over the surface of the island and distort in an unpredictable manner. Moreover, particles in the sample fluid may become trapped at the surface of the island, which again may lead to unpredictable flow characteristics of the sample fluid.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a hydrodynamic focusing device comprising a first flow channel; a second flow channel dimensioned with a smaller cross-section than that of the first flow channel; an envelopment region connected in-line between the first and the second flow channels; and a chimney comprising a body and a sample fluid inlet, the body extending from a wall of the envelopment region into the envelopment region and having smaller lateral and vertical dimensions than the envelopment region; wherein the body and the sample fluid inlet are each formed with an elongate profile having a leading edge facing the first flow channel and long edges opposing one another and relatively tapered towards a trailing edge.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The more hydrodynamically efficient shape of the chimney has an advantage that any wake effect may be suppressed. In some embodiments the chimney is constructed with a trailing edge angle (being the angle formed between the tangents to the long edges of the chimney at its trailing edge) of around 300&#xb0; or less. With this construction it has been found that the wake effect may be essentially removed or, at least, measurably reduced.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">As the extent of the chimney body in the direction of fluid flow through the envelopment region is insufficient to act as support for the sample fluid then smearing of the sample fluid and trapping of particles may be avoided.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some embodiments the floor from which the chimney extends is sloped towards the second flow channel with the slope starting at a distance (upstream or downstream) from the center of the leading edge selected so as to cause the upward sheath flow to influence the morphology of the enveloped sample fluid. This distance is typically within 1.5 times, in some embodiments zero times, the height of the first flow channel at a location immediately upstream of the leading edge. This has an advantage that the morphology of the hydrodynamically focused sample fluid can be more easily adapted.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments the first flow channel, the second flow channel and the envelopment region are formed as part of a substrate, such as a substrate of a microfluidic chip, in which is also formed a lens at a location in the substrate below a measurement region of the second flow channel, the lens being optically coupled to the measurement region through an optically transparent material portion of the substrate.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to a second aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of hydrodynamically focussing a sample fluid using the hydrodynamic focussing device according to the first aspect of the present invention, the method comprising: (i) streaming a sheath fluid through the first flow channel into the envelopment region; (ii) introducing a sample fluid into the envelopment region through the sample fluid inlet of the chimney such that the sample fluid is hydrodynamically focussed by the sheath fluid as it leaves the chimney; and (iii) flowing the sheathed, hydrodynamically focussed, sample fluid out of the envelopment region and into the second flow channel.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Unless specifically stated otherwise, directions and dimensions will be referred to herein relative to the channels or other features being described and the flows within those channels or those other features. Thus &#x201c;axial,&#x201d; &#x201c;flow-wise,&#x201d; or &#x201c;upstream/downstream&#x201d; will refer to directions generally parallel to or in-line with fluid flow through a channel or other feature. The term &#x201c;bottom&#x201d; or &#x201c;floor&#x201d; will refer to a wall of a channel or other feature that is intended to be, in use, the lowest inner-surface of that chamber or feature (for example formed in a chip substrate). Likewise, &#x201c;top&#x201d; or &#x201c;ceiling&#x201d; will refer to a wall of a channel or other feature that is intended to be, in use, the highest inner-surface of that chamber or feature (for example a barrier formed by a layer applied over a chip substrate). The term &#x201c;over&#x201d; will refer to a direction generally away from a floor of the channel or other feature. Likewise, &#x201c;lateral&#x201d; or &#x201c;horizontal&#x201d; will refer to a direction generally toward or away from the sidewalls of a channel or other feature (not being the top or the bottom walls). Corresponding terms are to be interpreted in a similar fashion. In some descriptions, directions or dimensions may additionally or alternatively be referred to in terms of X, Y, and Z, which are mutually orthogonal directions with the X and Y directions lying in a plane parallel to the direction of fluid flow through the channel or other feature.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">An exemplary embodiment of the invention will now be explained in more detail with reference to the drawings in the accompanying figures, of which:</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a plan view of an embodiment of a hydrodynamic focusing device according to the present invention;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a side elevation along A-A of the embodiment of a hydrodynamic focusing device illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">FIGS.

The hydrodynamic focusing device <b>2</b> here comprises a first flow channel <b>4</b> for a sheath fluid flow <b>6</b>; a second flow channel <b>8</b> for a sheathed sample fluid flow <b>10</b>; an envelopment region <b>12</b> connected in-line between the first <b>4</b> and the second <b>8</b> flow channels, here integral with the first flow channel <b>4</b>; and a chimney <b>14</b> comprising a chimney body <b>16</b> and a sample fluid inlet <b>18</b> housed therein. The chimney body <b>16</b> extends from a wall (or floor) <b>20</b> of the envelopment region <b>12</b> and into the envelopment region <b>12</b> and is constructed with smaller lateral (&#x2018;X&#x2019; and &#x2018;Y&#x2019;) and vertical (&#x2018;Z&#x2019;) dimensions than those of the envelopment region <b>12</b>. The sample fluid inlet <b>18</b> terminates at a first end <b>22</b> within the envelopment region <b>12</b>, here coincident with the end of the chimney body <b>16</b>, and connects at an opposite end <b>24</b> to a sample fluid flow <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The chimney body <b>16</b> and the sample fluid inlet <b>18</b> are substantially concentric and together form the chimney <b>14</b> which has a generally elongate profile in the plane parallel to the general direction of fluid flow through the envelopment region <b>12</b> from the first flow channel <b>4</b> to the second flow channel <b>8</b>. The chimney <b>14</b> of the present embodiment is provided with a rounded nose or &#x2018;leading edge&#x2019; <b>28</b> and tapers along its generally opposing long edges <b>30</b><i>a</i>, <b>30</b><i>b </i>to form a narrower tail, or &#x2018;trailing edge&#x2019; <b>32</b>. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> the chimney body <b>16</b> and the sample fluid inlet <b>18</b> are both symmetric teardrop-shaped and extend from the floor <b>20</b>, centrally between the opposing walls <b>34</b>,<b>36</b> of the envelopment region <b>12</b>. This teardrop-shape is particularly hydrodynamically efficient but it will be appreciated that other hydrodynamically efficient shapes of the chimney <b>14</b> may be employed provided they conform to the general form described above. Moreover, in some embodiments one or both of the long edges <b>30</b><i>a</i>, <b>30</b><i>b </i>may be curved and in some embodiments the teardrop-shape is asymmetric. In some embodiments the chimney body may be angled relative to the vertical in a direction of the sheath fluid flow <b>6</b> from the first flow channel <b>4</b> towards the second flow channel <b>8</b>. This provides a vector component of the sample fluid flow <b>26</b> in a direction of the sheath fluid flow <b>6</b> which facilitates the envelopment of this sample fluid flow <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">As the sheath fluid flow <b>6</b> meets the leading edge <b>28</b> of the chimney <b>14</b> it is split by the leading edge <b>28</b> into a flow <b>6</b><i>i</i>, which passes around the chimney following a flow path between the long edge <b>30</b><i>a </i>of the chimney <b>14</b> and opposing wall <b>34</b> of the envelopment region <b>12</b>; a flow <b>6</b><i>ii </i>which passes around the chimney following a flow path between the long edge <b>30</b><i>b </i>of the chimney <b>14</b> and opposing wall <b>36</b> of the envelopment region <b>12</b>; and a flow <b>6</b><i>iii </i>following a flow path between the first end <b>22</b> of the sample fluid inlet <b>18</b> and a cover <b>46</b> (or ceiling) of the envelopment region <b>12</b> which is generally opposite the wall <b>20</b> (or floor) from which the chimney body <b>16</b> extends. The sheath fluid flows <b>6</b><i>i</i>, <b>6</b><i>ii </i>and <b>6</b><i>iii </i>recombine after the trailing edge <b>32</b> of the chimney <b>14</b>. The sample fluid flow <b>26</b> exiting the sample fluid inlet <b>18</b> at the first end <b>22</b> of the sample fluid inlet <b>18</b> during the concurrent flow of sheath fluid flow <b>6</b> through the envelopment region <b>12</b> is, after the trailing edge <b>32</b>, enveloped by the sheath fluid flow <b>6</b> to travel as a hydrodynamically focussed sheathed sample fluid flow <b>10</b> in a direction towards the second flow channel <b>8</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Any wake effect downstream of the chimney <b>14</b> will tend to widen and distort the plume of sample fluid exiting the sample fluid inlet <b>18</b> and negatively impact the shape of the hydrodynamically focussed sample fluid. This is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> for chimneys of known construction. By employing the more hydrodynamically efficient chimney shape of the present invention this wake effect may be suppressed. In particular, by configuring the chimney <b>14</b> with a trailing edge angle, &#x3b8;, less than around 30&#xb0; (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) any wake effect, when present, may be essentially removed and a generally circular-shaped hydrodynamically focused sample stream may be generated, as is illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the trailing edge angle, &#x3b8;, is the angle formed between the tangents (broken line construction in the figure) to the respective long edges <b>30</b><i>a,b </i>of the chimney body <b>16</b> at its trailing edge <b>32</b>. In the present embodiment, in which both long edges <b>30</b><i>a,b </i>are straight edges, the tangents will be parallel to these long edges <b>30</b><i>a,b. </i></p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Usefully, the walls <b>34</b>,<b>36</b> of the envelopment region <b>12</b> which in part oppose the long edges <b>30</b><i>a</i>,<b>30</b><i>b </i>of the chimney <b>14</b> are tapered towards the second flow channel <b>8</b> in order to assist with the positioning of the hydrodynamically focussed sample fluid flow <b>26</b> in relation to the second flow channel <b>8</b>. The wall <b>20</b> from which the chimney body <b>16</b> extends may also be tapered i.e. sloped to assist with this positioning.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">It has been found that it is especially useful if the start of the slope of the wall <b>20</b> is in close vicinity of the chimney <b>14</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). When the slope of the wall <b>20</b> from which the chimney body <b>16</b> extends starts in this close vicinity it has been found that the upward sheath flow direction immediately after the trailing edge <b>32</b> will influence the morphology of the sheathed, hydrodynamically focused, sample fluid and may be employed in combination with the choice of shape of the chimney <b>14</b> to better tailor the morphology of the hydrodynamically focused sample fluid to suit the particular application. For example, in instances where particles in the sample fluid flow <b>26</b> are to be measured using a laser at a measurement region <b>38</b> of the second flow channel <b>8</b>. Often, the illumination from the laser will have a narrow spatial intensity distribution in the direction (&#x2018;Y&#x2019; direction) perpendicular to the flow direction (&#x2018;X&#x2019; direction). By arranging slope of the floor <b>20</b> to start as described above the hydrodynamically focused sample fluid can be focussed with a relatively reduced dimension in the &#x2018;Y&#x2019; direction as is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>. Using appropriate fluid dynamic simulation software such as, for example Siemens Star&#x2122; CCM+ or COMSOL Multiphysics&#x2122; software, the effects of varying the starting position of the slope relative to the chimney <b>14</b> can be readily modelled and its effects on the morphology of the hydrodynamically focussed sample fluid determined. In this manner it has been found that starting the slope at a distance from the center C of the leading edge <b>28</b> of the chimney <b>14</b> which is less than around three times, preferably within about 1.5 times, particularly less than 1 times, the height, h, of the first flow channel <b>4</b> immediately upstream of the leading edge <b>28</b> of the chimney <b>14</b> is particularly advantageous.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments, a lens <b>40</b> may be provided integrally with the hydrodynamic focusing device <b>2</b>. The lens <b>40</b> can be used as the primary focusing lens or as a secondary lens. The secondary lens is only used to improve light collection and requires a primary focusing lens (not illustrated) external to the hydrodynamic focusing device <b>2</b>. Advantages of using the integral lens <b>40</b> as a primary lens include i) saving the cost of the external focusing lens and ii) improving light collection by cancelling refraction in air. The advantage of using the integral lens <b>40</b> as a secondary lens is the improvement in light collection by cancelling refraction in air while leaving the main lens design features to the external primary focusing lens. For the refraction to be cancelled when being used as a secondary lens, the lens <b>40</b> should have hemispheric shape, with the center approximately in the middle of the second flow channel <b>8</b>. This is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. For both uses there is a further, common, advantage regarding optical alignment: this is facilitated since the distance between lens <b>40</b> and second flow channel <b>8</b> is permanently fixed.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Usefully, and as illustrated in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the hydrodynamic focusing device <b>2</b> may be formed on or in a substrate <b>42</b> of a microfluidic chip using conventional fabrication techniques often employed in semiconductor chip manufacturer, for example, injection molding, additive manufacture, micro-machining or lithography and a separate cover <b>46</b> applied. The lens <b>40</b> may then be formed as part of the substrate <b>42</b> directly below the measurement region <b>38</b>. A portion of the substrate <b>44</b> between the measurement region <b>38</b> and the lens <b>40</b> is fabricated using an optically transparent material so that the lens <b>40</b> is thereby optically coupled to at least a section of the measurement region <b>38</b>.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
