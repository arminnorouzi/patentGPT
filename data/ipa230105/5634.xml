For example, spent nuclear fuel is stored in the reactor fuel pool after removal from the core where it continues to generate decay heat. The fuel can be transferred after a period of cooling in the pool to canisters which are placed in dry storage casks (i.e. overpacks) typically constructed of concrete, steel, and iron, etc. to provide containment and radiation shielding. The casks are stored on site at the generating plant.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The concept of using consolidated interim storage (CIS) is intended to provide geographically distributed off-site storage facilities for spent nuclear fuel and radioactive wastes (collectively &#x201c;waste&#x201d;) gathered from a number of individual generating plant sites, thereby providing greater control over the widely dispersed waste stockpiles. The waste materials would initially be transported to the CIS facility from the generating plants for a period of time, with the eventual goal of a final move to a permanent nuclear waste repository when available. Such so called independent spent fuel storage installations (ISFSI) are facilities designed for the interim storage of spent nuclear fuel comprising solid, reactor-related, greater than Class C waste, in addition to other related radioactive materials. Each ISFSI facility would typically maintain an inventor of a multitude of waste canisters containing spent nuclear fuel and/or radioactive waste materials.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present disclosure provides a below-ground used or spent nuclear fuel storage system designed for the compact dry storage of a large number of used fuel canisters in a small land area. In a non-limiting exemplary embodiment, two or more elongated canisters may be stored in vertically oriented and stacked relationship in each of a plurality of underground vertical ventilated storage modules which provide an overpack. The storage modules may be diametrically sized to fit a single canister therein at a given elevation, as further described herein. The collective array of storage modules defines an independent spent fuel storage installation (ISFSI) facility suitable for CIS that may include any number and arrangement of modules.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The canisters may contain both radioactive used nuclear fuel and/or non-fuel waste materials in some embodiments. In one embodiment, the canisters may be Multi-Purpose Canisters (MPCs) available from Holtec International of Marlton, N.J.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The underground storage system is intended to provide vanishingly low site boundary radiation dose levels and safety during catastrophic events. As an underground system, the system takes advantage of the surrounding soil or subgrade to provide shielding, physical protection, and a low center of gravity for a stable storage installation. Each vertical storage module provides storage of canisters in a vertical configuration inside a cylindrical cavity located entirely below the top-of-grade in the storage facility. The vertical modules may each be generally comprised of a cavity enclosure container formed by an outer shell, an inner divider shell, and a top closure lid in addition to various interfacing structures and features, as further described herein.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The canister storage system is further configured to provide passive heat removal from the canisters via natural convection during storage in the modules, thereby rejecting the used fuel's decay heat emitted to the ambient air above the module. Radiation emitted from the used nuclear fuel is substantially contained within the soil fill in which the modules are disposed and canisters stored.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Advantageously, stacking two canisters in each vertical ventilated storage module according to the present disclosure ultimately cuts the required storage area in half. For example, a 14 acre ISFSI for CIS can store 4,000 canisters containing more than 50,000 tons of uranium. This significantly reduces siting requirements. The radiation released to the environment from such a CIS facility storing used fuel may be negligible.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to one exemplary embodiment, a system for vertically-stacked storage of nuclear waste canisters includes an elongated outer shell defining a vertical axis and an internal cavity; a first canister positioned in the cavity in a lower position; a second canister vertically stacked above the first canister in an upper position, the first and second canisters being concentrically aligned with the vertical axis; a centering and spacing ring assembly interspersed between the first and second canisters; and a removable top lid mounted on top of the outer shell covering the cavity. The centering and spacing ring assembly is arranged and operable to transfer weight of the second canister to the first canister.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to another embodiment, a storage module for vertically-stacked storage of nuclear waste canisters includes an elongated outer shell defining a vertical axis and an internal cavity; an elongated inner shell disposed in the internal cavity; a first annular space formed between the inner and outer shells, the first annular spacing defining a vertical downcomer ventilation shaft operable to convey ambient cooling air downwards to the cavity; a first canister positioned in the cavity in a lower position; a second canister vertically stacked above the first canister in an upper position, the first and second canisters being concentrically aligned with the vertical axis; a middle centering and spacing ring assembly interspersed between the first and second canisters, the middle centering and spacing ring assembly operable to transfer weight of the second canister to the first canister; a second annular space formed between the first and second canisters and the inner shell, the second annular space defining a vertical riser ventilation shaft operable to convey cooling air upwards across outer surfaces of the canisters; and a removable top lid mounted on top of the outer shell covering the cavity, the top lid being in fluid communication with the riser ventilation shaft and configured to form an airflow pathway to atmosphere through the lid.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to another embodiment, an underground storage module for vertically-stacked storage of nuclear waste canisters includes an elongated vertical outer shell defining vertical axis and an internal cavity, the outer shell having a top and a hermetically sealed bottom, the outer shell being disposed below grade for a majority of its height; a common inlet air plenum disposed at the top of the outer shell, the air plenum arranged to draw ambient cooling air through a plurality of air inlets in fluid communication with the air plenum; an annular-shaped vertical downcomer ventilation shaft arranged to convey the cooling air from the inlet air plenum downwards along the outer shell to a bottom of the cavity; a first canister positioned in the cavity in a lower position; a second canister vertically stacked above the first canister in an upper position, the first and second canisters being concentrically aligned with the vertical axis; an elongated inner shell disposed inside the outer shell and cavity; an annular-shaped vertical riser ventilation shaft formed between the inner shell and the canisters, the riser ventilation shaft being in fluid communication with the downcomer ventilation shaft near the bottom of the outer shell and arranged to convey cooling air upwards across outer sidewall surfaces of the canisters for removing decay heat; and a removable top lid mounted on top of the outer shell covering the cavity, the top lid in fluid communication with the riser ventilation shaft and configured to form an airflow pathway to atmosphere through the lid from the riser ventilation shaft.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The features of the exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the following drawings, where like elements are labeled similarly, and in which:</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of an ISFSI facility for consolidated interim storage of spent nuclear fuel and waste materials utilizing an array of underground storage modules each capable of holding at least two canisters according to an embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a three-dimensional cross-sectional view of a fully installed storage module of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> showing one nuclear waste canister in a lower position in the module;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is a detailed view from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a three-dimensional cross-sectional view of a fully installed storage module showing two vertically stacked canisters positioned in the module;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is a detailed view from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a three-dimensional cross-sectional view of a storage module with concrete top pad alone without soil or bottom concrete base pad;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> is a detailed view from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> is a detailed view from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref> is a detailed view from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is an airflow diagram showing the storage module and natural convection ventilation system showing the cooling air flow paths through the module;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a three-dimensional cross-sectional view of a fully installed empty storage module before placement of the canisters and removable top lid;

Ring <b>320</b> may be configured and constructed similarly to bottom support ring <b>310</b> described above and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>6</b>A</figref>. In one embodiment, middle ring <b>320</b> may be a composite structure formed of an upper ring <b>320</b>A and lower ring <b>320</b>B each shaped similarly to bottom ring <b>310</b>. The two rings <b>320</b>A, <b>320</b>B may be attached together (e.g. welded) in back-to-back relationship with flat bottoms <b>313</b> in contact and exposed surfaces <b>311</b> with the raised and recessed segments <b>312</b>, <b>314</b> facing axially outwards as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">It will be appreciated that in some embodiments, the upward and downward facing exposed top surfaces <b>311</b> of the middle ring <b>310</b> may be substantially flat without raised/recessed segments <b>312</b>, <b>314</b> depending on the canister design used.

In one construction, the centering lugs <b>322</b> are welded around the perimeter of middle ring <b>320</b> and made integral therewith; both of which preferably are both made of suitable metal such as steel. The lugs <b>322</b> may not be fixedly attached to the inner shell <b>130</b> of storage module <b>110</b> such that the middle ring-lug assembly <b>320</b>/<b>322</b> is removable as a unit from the storage module with the canisters <b>140</b>. This allows the first lower canister <b>140</b> to be first positioned in the bottom half of the storage module <b>110</b>, the middle ring-lug assembly <b>320</b>/<b>322</b> then lowered and placed on top of the lower canister, and then the second upper canister <b>140</b> lowered and positioned into the top half of the storage module <b>110</b> to engage the middle ring-lug assembly <b>320</b>/<b>322</b>. The middle ring-lug assembly <b>320</b>/<b>322</b> may alternatively be lowered into the inner shell <b>130</b> with the lower canister simultaneously allowing the ring-lug assembly to be placed on top of the lower canister before being lowered into the inner shell together in one step.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows the lower canister <b>140</b> in position within the storage module <b>110</b> and ready for receiving the upper canister <b>140</b>. The middle ring-lug assembly <b>320</b>/<b>322</b> is in position. The centering lugs <b>322</b> may have a similar side profile as lugs <b>310</b> already described including angled edges <b>302</b> to help guide and center the bottom <b>143</b> of the upper canister <b>140</b> when lowered into storage module <b>110</b> on top of the lower canister (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>). Both the upper and lower portions of lugs <b>322</b> may include angled edges <b>302</b> as shown which helps center and properly position the middle ring-lug assembly <b>320</b>/<b>322</b> on the top <b>142</b> of the lower canister <b>140</b> when the assembly is lowered into place in the storage module <b>110</b>.

This enhances the load bearing capability of the lower canister for supporting the weight of the upper canister.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The middle ring-lug assembly <b>320</b>/<b>322</b> also laterally restrains the bottom end <b>143</b> of the upper canister <b>140</b>. Accordingly, the centering lugs <b>322</b> are configured, dimensioned, and positioned to engage both the top <b>142</b> of the lower canister <b>140</b> and the bottom <b>143</b> of the upper canister <b>140</b>. Significantly, the middle ring-lug assembly <b>320</b>/<b>322</b> further serves to maintain the inner annular space <b>133</b> and vertical riser ventilation shaft <b>134</b> formed between the canisters <b>140</b> and inner shell <b>130</b> by providing proper horizontal aligned of the canisters along the vertical axis VA of the storage module <b>110</b>. The middle ring-lug assembly <b>320</b>/<b>322</b> also provides some vertical spacing between the top <b>142</b> of the lower canister <b>140</b> and bottom of the upper canister <b>140</b> to permit cooling ventilation air to flow in the small space between the two canisters to enhance cooling the canisters.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>3</b>A</figref>, a top ring-lug assembly <b>330</b>/<b>332</b> is also provided to laterally support and restrain the top <b>142</b> of the upper canister <b>140</b> against the inner shell <b>130</b>. This assembly is comprised of a single support ring <b>330</b> having the arcuate raised/recessed segments <b>312</b>, <b>314</b> facing downwards towards the upper canister. The plurality of centering lugs <b>332</b> are welded to the perimeter of ring <b>330</b> in a similar manner to the middle ring <b>320</b> as already described. Preferably, the lugs <b>332</b> are not fixedly attached to the inner shell <b>130</b> like the middle centering lugs <b>322</b> to allow the top ring-lug assembly <b>330</b>/<b>332</b> to be removable in the same manner from the storage module <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, both the top and bottom surfaces <b>311</b>, <b>313</b> of the top ring <b>330</b> may be substantially flat instead of castellated. The centering lugs <b>332</b> may be configured similarly to lugs <b>310</b> or <b>322</b> already described.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">It should be noted that the centering lugs <b>300</b>, <b>322</b>, and <b>332</b> laterally restrain and horizontally support the lower and upper canisters <b>140</b> inside storage module <b>110</b> during a seismic event (e.g. earthquake) against excessive movement. In addition, these lugs also maintain the inner annular space <b>133</b> along the entire height of the module to preserve the inner annular space <b>133</b> between the sidewalls of the canister shells <b>140</b> and inner shell <b>130</b> of the storage module <b>110</b> thereby protecting the integrity of the vertical riser ventilation shaft <b>134</b> for proper ventilated cooling of the canisters.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">It should be noted that the support rings <b>310</b>, <b>320</b>, and <b>330</b> with undulating top surfaces <b>311</b> having raised and recessed segments <b>312</b>, <b>314</b> may be used with both canisters <b>140</b> having plain (i.e. flat) top and bottom ends, or with specially configured ends as described herein with complementary configured ends as the rings to provide an anti-rotation feature. In other possible embodiments, the rings <b>310</b>, <b>320</b>, <b>330</b> may be substantially flat on both the top surface <b>311</b> and opposing bottom surface <b>313</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In some alternative constructions, the middle and top lugs <b>322</b>, <b>332</b> may be attached (welded) to the inner shell <b>130</b> of the storage module <b>110</b> and rings <b>320</b>, <b>330</b> may be separate and removable elements.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>3</b>A</figref> show storage module <b>110</b> with both lower and upper canisters <b>140</b> in position and top lid <b>200</b> in place after insertion of the canisters. The lower and upper canisters <b>140</b> are concentrically aligned with the vertical axis VA of the storage module <b>110</b>. In one embodiment, the diameter of the inner shell <b>130</b> and diameter of the internal cavity <b>122</b> are only wide enough to accommodate a single canister <b>140</b> at each elevation of the storage module <b>110</b> so that two canisters will not fit in side-by-side relationship in the storage module. The canisters <b>140</b> undergo cooling by natural convection via the ventilated cooling air system described above and shown by the directional airflow arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. It stands noting that the upper canister <b>140</b> does not directly contact the lower canister, but instead bears on middle ring-lug assembly <b>320</b>/<b>322</b> which vertically separates and spaces the two canisters. The dead load or weight of the upper canister is transferred through the middle ring-lug assembly <b>320</b>/<b>322</b> to the lower canister which bears the weight of the upper canister.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">It will be appreciated that the number of vertically stacked canisters in each storage module <b>110</b> may be limited by the load carrying capacity of the canisters themselves since each canister in the stack transmits and bears the weight of the canisters above; the lowermost canister <b>140</b> in the stack bearing the entire dead weight of the whole canister stack. Accordingly, a vertically deeper (higher) storage module <b>110</b> and internal cavity <b>122</b> with additional canisters can be deployed if the structural strength of the lowermost canister <b>140</b> and the support foundation were accordingly strengthened to support greater than two canisters.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">According to the present invention, it bears noting that the top and bottom canisters <b>140</b> can be of different diameters and heights within a range of limits which fit within the storage module <b>110</b>. The centering and spacing rings <b>310</b>, <b>320</b>, <b>330</b> with lugs <b>300</b>, <b>322</b>, <b>332</b> as described herein can be customized to provide the necessary adaptation for varying canister diameters and different end type features.
