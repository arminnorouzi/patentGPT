For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a broadcast channel, a system message, paging, and the like of a network device may be transmitted by using a wide beam, to better cover a terminal device <b>1</b> and a terminal device <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, in a high-frequency scenario, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a path loss of a wireless signal increases. If a wide beam is still used for transmission, cell coverage becomes very small and cannot cover a relatively remote terminal device <b>3</b> and terminal device <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An antenna distance may become smaller in high frequency, so that a unit area can accommodate more antennas. Therefore, a large antenna gain may be obtained by using a massive multiple-input multiple-output (massive MIMO) beamforming technology, to compensate for the path loss. There may be a large quantity of antennas even hundreds of antennas in massive MIMO. When a large antenna gain is obtained, a formed beam is very narrow in width. One narrow beam can cover only a part of an area, but cannot cover all users in a cell. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a beam B<b>2</b> can cover only a terminal device <b>5</b>, but cannot cover a terminal device <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a high-frequency multi-beam transmission scenario, to serve the users in the cell, different beams may need to serve the users in the cell in a time division manner, and the beams need common channels such as a broadcast channel, a synchronization channel, and a control channel to cover all the users in the cell, so that the users in the cell are synchronized and obtain a necessary system message to access the cell.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A beamformed control channel is sent by using an existing method for sending a control channel. For example, an existing control channel is a physical downlink control channel (PDCCH), and a beamformed control channel is a beamformed PDCCH. In this case, in one subframe, there may be both the PDCCH with large coverage used to serve an old terminal device, and the beamformed PDCCH used to serve a terminal device in enlarged coverage. The PDCCH with wide coverage is demodulated by using a common reference signal (CRS) with wide coverage. However, the beamformed PDCCH cannot be demodulated by using the existing CRS, and needs to be demodulated by using a beamformed reference signal. Therefore, when the beamformed PDCCH is used, a UE cannot correctly receive the beamformed PDCCH if there is no corresponding beamformed reference signal.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore, how to transmit a beamformed control channel and a reference signal of the beamformed control channel becomes a problem that urgently needs to be resolved.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Embodiments of the present disclosure provide a signal transmission method, network device, and terminal device. In this method, a beamformed control channel and a reference signal of the beamformed control channel can be transmitted.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to a first aspect, a signal transmission method is provided, and the method includes:</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">determining a first time-frequency resource, where the first time-frequency resource is a first candidate resource in a plurality of candidate resources;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">obtaining a second time-frequency resource and a third time-frequency resource based on the first time-frequency resource and a preset rule, where the third time-frequency resource includes at least one resource element RE at a predefined location in the first time-frequency resource, the second time-frequency resource includes a resource other than the third time-frequency resource in the first time-frequency resource, the preset rule indicates the predefined location, the second time-frequency resource is used to carry a beamformed control channel, and the third time-frequency resource is used to carry a reference signal of the beamformed control channel; and</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">respectively transmitting the beamformed control channel and the reference signal of the beamformed control channel to a terminal device by using the second time-frequency resource and the third time-frequency resource.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Therefore, in this embodiment of the present disclosure, resources carrying the beamformed control channel and the reference signal of the beamformed control channel are determined, to transmit the beamformed control channel and the reference signal of the beamformed control channel. In this way, it becomes possible to improve coverage of a control channel through beamforming in an existing system.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In addition, a design of the beamformed control channel and the reference signal used for demodulating the beamformed control channel is used in this embodiment of the present disclosure, to improve coverage and performance of the control channel in comparison with a conventional control channel, and especially, to improve coverage of a cell using a high-frequency carrier. In addition, introduction of the beamformed control channel has no impact on or has slight impact on compatibility of a conventional terminal device.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">It should be noted that the term &#x201c;candidate resource&#x201d; according to this embodiment of the present disclosure is defined as follows:</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">One time-frequency resource set may be divided into a plurality of time-frequency resource subsets, and the candidate resource is a resource that includes one or more time-frequency resource subsets selected based on a specific rule.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">For example, in a Long Term Evolution (LTE) system, the time-frequency resource set may be time-frequency resources corresponding to first three orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) symbols in a subframe. The time-frequency resource subset may be a control channel element (CCE) or an enhanced control channel element (ECCE). The candidate resource is one or more subsets selected based on the specific rule. For example, the candidate resource includes one CCE, two CCEs, four CCEs, or eight CCEs, and a corresponding aggregation level is respectively 1, 2, 4, or 8.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">For example, a network device may determine the first time-frequency resource based on an existing method for determining a PDCCH resource in LTE.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Optionally, the determining a first time-frequency resource includes:</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">determining an aggregation level, where the aggregation level is used to indicate a size of the candidate resource; and</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">selecting one candidate resource from a set of the plurality of candidate resources corresponding to the aggregation level, and using the candidate resource as the first time-frequency resource.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Specifically, the network device may first determine the aggregation level. The aggregation level is used to indicate the size of the candidate resource. For example, the network device may first determine a PDCCH format. A PDCCH format corresponds to a specific aggregation level, the aggregation level corresponds to a quantity of CCEs carrying a PDCCH, and the quantity of CCEs corresponds to a size of a candidate resource in the PDCCH format.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Then, the candidate resource is selected from the set of the plurality of candidate resources corresponding to the aggregation level, and the candidate resource is used as the first time-frequency resource.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">It should be understood that the aggregation level may include 4 and 8; 1, 2, 4, and 8; or the like. For detailed description of the aggregation level, refer to a definition in an existing standard. Details are not described herein.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">It should be understood that the first time-frequency resource may include a plurality of (a quantity corresponds to an aggregation level) resource element (RE) sets, and each of the plurality of RE sets includes a same fixed quantity of REs.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">For example, in LTE, an RE set is a control channel element CCE, a PDCCH is carried by at least one CCE, and a quantity of CCEs carrying the PDCCH is determined by an aggregation level. For example, a quantity of CCEs may be 1, 2, 4, or 8. One CCE includes nine resource element groups (REGs), and one REG includes four REs. In other words, one RE set may include 36 REs. Only LTE is used as an example herein for description. In different systems, one RE set may include another quantity of REs. This embodiment of the present disclosure is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the LTE system, the first time-frequency resource may be obtained through respectively aggregating one control channel element CCE, two consecutive CCEs, four consecutive CCEs, or eight consecutive CCEs in first three orthogonal frequency division multiplexing OFDM symbols in a subframe for an aggregation level 1, 2, 4, or 8. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the first time-frequency resource includes eight CCEs, respectively CCE 0 to CCE 7.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In other words, the candidate resource set herein may correspond to an existing resource set carrying an existing PDCCH.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In this embodiment of the present disclosure, the first time-frequency resource may be used to carry a beamformed PDCCH, and may be used to carry a reference signal of the beamformed PDCCH.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">It should be understood that the plurality of candidate resources in this embodiment of the present disclosure may include candidate resources corresponding to all aggregation levels, or may include candidate resources corresponding to one aggregation level.

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, for ease of description, a CCE 3 is used as an example to show REs included in the first time-frequency resource.

This is not limited in this embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0172">Alternatively, the third time-frequency resource may include all REs in at least one of the foregoing plurality of RE sets.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0173">For example, the third time-frequency resource may include only all REs in one RE set, or may include all REs in the plurality of RE sets.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0174">For example, when the first time-frequency resource includes a plurality of CCEs, the third time-frequency resource may include all REs in at least one of the plurality of CCEs.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0175">It should be understood that the third time-frequency resource may include all the REs in the at least one of the plurality of CCEs provided that the third time-frequency resource is less than the first time-frequency resource; and the resource other than the third time-frequency resource in the first time-frequency resource is the second time-frequency resource. Similarly, in this embodiment of the present disclosure, the second resource also needs to be less than the first time-frequency resource, and a resource other than the second time-frequency resource in the first time-frequency resource is the third time-frequency resource.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0176">For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the first time-frequency resource includes eight CCEs, and the third time-frequency resource may include one CCE, for example, all REs in the CCE 3.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0177">It should be understood that the preset rule may be a rule on which the network device and the terminal device preagree. After the first resource is determined, the network device and the terminal device may obtain the second resource and the third resource based on the preset rule. Alternatively, the preset rule may be notified by the network device to the terminal device by using signaling. To be specific, the network device sends a message in advance to agree on the preset rule with the terminal device.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0178">Correspondingly, in another embodiment, before <b>410</b>, the method may further include: sending an indication message to the terminal device, where the indication message indicates the predefined location.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0179">For example, the indication message may be an RRC signaling message.

Send a beamformed control channel and a reference signal of the beamformed control channel.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0181">Specifically, the network device respectively transmits, to the terminal device by using the second time-frequency resource and the third time-frequency resource, the beamformed control channel and the reference signal RS corresponding to the beamformed control channel.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0182">Therefore, the terminal device may demodulate the beamformed control channel based on the received reference signal of the beamformed control channel. For example, the terminal device receives a signal on a candidate resource in the candidate resource set in searching space. When blind detection is performed on a candidate resource, for example, the candidate resource may be the first time-frequency resource. The terminal device demodulates, based on the reference signal on the third time-frequency resource at the predefined location, the control channel carried in the second time-frequency resource; decodes information bits of the received control channel; performs CRC check based on an ID of the terminal device; and if the check succeeds, it indicates that the control channel that is sent to the terminal device is successively received, in other words, the blindly detected candidate resource is the first time-frequency resource. If the check fails, it indicates that a base station does not send the control channel on the candidate resource to the terminal device, in other words, the blindly detected candidate resource is not the first time-frequency resource.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0183">Therefore, in this embodiment of the present disclosure, resources carrying the beamformed control channel and the reference signal of the beamformed control channel are determined, to transmit the beamformed control channel and the reference signal of the beamformed control channel.
