More particularly, the invention relates to a handheld solids dispenser.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">One of the very well-known common laboratory tasks is dispensing milligram quantities of the solids (especially in research and development labs) in a highly precise manner. A vast majority of innovative ideas are tested using limited quantities of solids. In some instances, a single stock powder needs to be dispensed to prepare 100s of samples in small precise quantities, for example, for 1) solid form screening, or 2) filling formulated powders in capsules for preclinical studies.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Current practices in this regard involve manually dispensing the solids in a controlled way using spatulas. In addition to possible chemical exposure, this tedious process often requires lots of time and workforce which is not efficient. Additionally, the process is susceptible to spilling or cross contamination of materials. The challenges increase exponentially if the processes comprise with semi high throughput screening, static and sticky materials. These problems increase when using high potency compounds. Approximately 25% of new chemical entities entering into the market are considered to be potent.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">While there have been some high throughput automated systems, these systems are generally not realistic options for a majority of labs as these devices are very costly, occupy a large space and can't be moved that easily.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">There is a need for an economical, handheld device which can dispense solids precisely and more efficiently.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In at least one embodiment, the present invention provides a handheld solids dispenser. The dispenser includes a housing defining an inlet passage and an outlet passage. A delivery mechanism is supported within the housing and is positioned between the inlet passage and the outlet passage.

elements throughout. Certain terminology is used herein for convenience only and is not to be taken as a limitation on the present invention. The following describes preferred embodiments of the present invention. However, it should be understood, based on this disclosure, that the invention is not limited by the preferred embodiments described herein.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>7</b>A</figref>, an exemplary embodiment of a solids dispenser <b>10</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the invention will be described. The dispenser <b>10</b> generally comprises a housing <b>12</b> with an outlet <b>16</b>, an input tube <b>20</b> and a plunger <b>40</b>. The housing <b>12</b> extends from a generally closed end <b>11</b> which defines the outlet <b>16</b> to a top end <b>13</b> through which the plunger <b>40</b> extends. While the outlet <b>16</b> is illustrated as a simple opening, it can have other configurations, for example, an extending tube. A handle portion <b>14</b> may extend from the body <b>12</b>, for example near the top end <b>13</b>, to support the dispenser <b>10</b> on a user's fingers when the plunger <b>40</b> is depressed.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>4</b></figref>, the input tube <b>20</b> has an opening <b>22</b> to a hollow passage <b>24</b> which is communication with a delivery tube <b>26</b> within the housing <b>12</b>. The opening <b>22</b> is configured to receive a bottle <b>60</b> or the like containing the solids material <b>62</b>. While the bottle <b>60</b> is shown in a friction fit within the opening <b>22</b>, other configurations may be utilized, for example, a threaded connection or a flexible gasket connection. The direct connection of the bottle to the input tube <b>20</b> allows the materials to be dispensed with reduced chemical exposure to the technician.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">To control flow of the solids material <b>62</b>, the present embodiment of the invention includes a screw conveyor <b>32</b> extending within the delivery tube <b>26</b>. A shaft <b>30</b> extends from the screw conveyor <b>32</b> and is connected to a drive gear <b>34</b>. Rotation of the drive gear <b>34</b>, as will be described hereinafter, causes the screw conveyor <b>32</b> to rotate and controllably deliver solids material <b>52</b> to an end portion <b>28</b> of the delivery tube <b>26</b>. In applications wherein the solids material are free flowing, i.e. non-clumping and the like, the screw conveyor may not be necessary. The position of the delivery tube <b>26</b> is circumferentially offset from the position of the outlet <b>16</b> such that material does not freely flow from the delivery tube <b>26</b> to the outlet <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">A delivery disk <b>50</b> is pivotally supported on the closed end <b>11</b> of the hollow tube <b>12</b>. The delivery disk <b>50</b> is configured to receive material from the delivery tube <b>26</b> and transport it to the outlet <b>50</b>. In this regard, the delivery disk <b>50</b> defines a delivery chamber <b>52</b> which receives solids material <b>62</b> from the end portion <b>28</b> of the delivery tube <b>26</b> when the disk <b>50</b> is in an initial position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>. The delivery chamber <b>52</b> has a volume equal to the amount of solids material <b>62</b> intended to be delivered. That is, in the initial position, the delivery chamber <b>52</b> fills with the solids material <b>26</b> which is equal to the amount to be delivered. As will described in more detail hereinafter, the delivery disk <b>50</b> is thereafter rotated until the delivery chamber <b>52</b> aligns with the outlet <b>16</b>, at which time the solids material <b>62</b> is dispensed. To change the amount of material dispensed, disks <b>50</b> having delivery chambers <b>52</b> of different volumes may be interchanged within the housing <b>12</b>. As another alternative, inserts (not shown) defining different volumes may be positionable within the delivery chamber <b>52</b> to achieve a desired delivery volume. As another alternative, the delivery chamber may have a moveable wall which is moved to adjust the volume, for example, utilizing a threaded adjustment.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the illustrated embodiment, the delivery disk <b>50</b> has a wedged shape cutout <b>51</b> which defines opposed contact surface <b>53</b>, <b>55</b> which define the range of rotation of the disk <b>50</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, when the disk <b>50</b> is in the initial position when the plunger <b>40</b> is not depressed, the contact surface <b>55</b> is against the stop member <b>15</b> and the delivery chamber <b>52</b> is aligned with the delivery tube <b>26</b>. When the plunger <b>40</b> is depressed, as discussed hereinafter, the delivery disk <b>50</b> rotates until the contact wall <b>53</b> is against the stop member <b>15</b> and the delivery chamber <b>52</b> is aligned with the outlet <b>16</b>. Preferably the outlet <b>16</b> has a diameter equal to or greater than the diameter of the delivery chamber <b>52</b>. To facilitate rotation of the disk <b>50</b>, a drive gear <b>58</b> is connected thereto. The drive gear <b>58</b> is driven by a drive shaft <b>52</b> with gears <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> at each end thereof, with the upper gear <b>54</b> engaged with the gear <b>44</b> on the plunger <b>40</b> and the lower gear <b>56</b> engaged with the drive gear <b>58</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The plunger <b>40</b> extends from a first end <b>41</b> external to the housing <b>12</b> to a second end <b>43</b> with a worm type gear <b>44</b> thereon. The worm gear <b>44</b> is configured to contact the gears <b>34</b>, <b>54</b> which are worm wheels, such that linear motion of the worm gear <b>44</b> causes rotational movement of the gears <b>34</b>, <b>54</b>. As such, depressing of the plunger <b>40</b> causes the gear <b>34</b> to rotate and thereby rotate the screw conveyor <b>32</b>. The preferred gear <b>34</b> is configured as a unitary direction gear such that it rotates when the plunger <b>40</b> is depressed but does not rotate in the opposite direction when the plunger is released. Depressing of the plunger <b>40</b> also causes the gear <b>54</b> to rotate and thereby rotate the delivery disk <b>50</b>. Gear ratios between the worm gear <b>44</b> and the gears <b>34</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> can be controlled to achieve the desired rotation. For example, the smaller gear <b>34</b> will cause the screw conveyor <b>32</b> to rotate several times while the larger drive gear <b>58</b> will achieve only a quarter turn of the delivery disk <b>50</b>. A spring <b>46</b> or the like engages the inner end <b>43</b> of the plunger <b>40</b> to bias the plunger <b>40</b> back to the initial position when the plunger <b>40</b> is released.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">It is understood that other mechanisms may be utilized to convert the linear motion of the plunger <b>40</b> to rotatory motion. For example, a shaft having a spiral cut groove, similar to a yankee screwdriver, may extend between the plunger <b>40</b> and the disk <b>50</b>. A fixed follower extends into the spiral cut groove such that as the shaft moves linearly, it is caused to rotate and thereby rotate the disk <b>50</b>. A gear is positioned along the shaft to engage the drive gear <b>34</b> of the screw conveyor <b>32</b> such that the rotating shaft again causes rotation of the screw conveyor <b>32</b>. Again, a spring would cause the plunger <b>40</b> to return to its initial position, thereby causing the shaft to rotate in the opposite direction. Again, the invention is not limited to the described mechanisms and other mechanisms may also be utilized.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Having described the general components of the solids dispenser <b>10</b>, operation thereof will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>7</b>A</figref>. During initial use, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>4</b>A</figref>, the material bottle <b>60</b> is connected to the input tube <b>20</b> and solids material <b>62</b> flows through the hollow passage <b>24</b> and into contact with the screw conveyor <b>32</b> in the delivery tube <b>26</b>. Since it is the initial use, the dispenser <b>10</b> must be primed to deliver material into the end portion <b>28</b> of the delivery tube <b>26</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>5</b>A</figref>, priming is achieved by depressing the plunger <b>40</b> as indicated by arrow A. As the plunger <b>40</b> is depressed, the disk <b>50</b> is caused to rotate, as indicated by arrow B, such that the delivery chamber <b>52</b> is not aligned with the delivery tube <b>26</b>. As such, material delivered by rotation of the screw conveyor <b>32</b> is delivered into the end portion <b>28</b> as indicated by arrow C.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>6</b>A</figref>, when the plunger <b>40</b> is released, it is biased to the initial position as indicated by arrow D. As the plunger <b>40</b> moves to the initial position, the drive gear <b>58</b> rotates in the opposite direction, as indicated by arrow E, causing the disk <b>50</b> to rotate to the initial position with the delivery chamber <b>52</b> aligned with the delivery tube <b>26</b>. With such alignment, the solids material <b>62</b> in the end portion <b>28</b> is free to fill the delivery chamber <b>52</b>, as indicated by arrow F.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>7</b>A</figref>, the solids material <b>62</b> in the delivery chamber <b>52</b> is dispensed by depressing the plunger <b>40</b>. As the plunger <b>40</b> is depressed, as indicated by arrow G, the delivery disk <b>50</b> is caused to rotate as indicated by arrow H. The disk <b>50</b> rotates until the delivery chamber <b>52</b> is aligned with the outlet <b>16</b>. With such alignment, the solids material <b>62</b> in the delivery chamber <b>52</b> is dispensed through the outlet <b>16</b> as indicated by arrow I. During such plunger <b>40</b> depression, the screw conveyor <b>32</b> is rotated and again fills the end portion <b>28</b> of the delivery tube <b>26</b>. The plunger <b>40</b> is released and the process repeats, returning to the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>6</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>-<b>24</b></figref>, a handheld solids dispenser <b>100</b> in accordance with another embodiment of the invention will be described. Similar to the previous embodiment, the solids dispenser <b>100</b> includes a plunger <b>140</b> defining a delivery chamber <b>155</b> of a desired volume. In the present embodiment, the plunger <b>140</b> is moveable such that the delivery chamber <b>155</b> moves along a linear path between an inlet opening <b>204</b> and an outlet port <b>217</b>. The plunger <b>140</b> is slidable within an outer housing <b>110</b> which supports the inlet opening <b>204</b> and outlet port <b>217</b>. A spring <b>147</b> or the like within the outer housing <b>110</b> automatically moves the plunger <b>140</b> from the initial position aligned with the inlet opening <b>204</b> to the dispensing position aligned with outlet port <b>217</b> upon actuation. The plunger <b>140</b> includes an adjustment rod <b>170</b> which allows for each adjustment of the volume of the delivery chamber <b>155</b> without disassembly of the dispenser <b>100</b>. The various components and operation of the dispenser <b>100</b> will now be described in more detailed.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>, <b>10</b> and <b>19</b></figref>, the outer housing <b>110</b> includes a generally hollow body <b>112</b> extending from a generally open end <b>111</b> to a generally closed end <b>113</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the generally closed end <b>113</b> includes an opening <b>114</b> for passage of a spring guide <b>146</b> extending from the plunger body <b>142</b>. It is recognized that the spring guide may be eliminated and the spring otherwise guided within the outer housing <b>110</b>. In such case, the opening <b>114</b> may also be eliminated. The inside surface <b>115</b> of the generally closed end <b>113</b> defines a spring surface <b>115</b> such that a spring <b>147</b> positioned within the housing <b>110</b> is compressible between the spring surface <b>115</b> and the plunger body <b>142</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The housing body <b>112</b> defines a guide slot <b>116</b> and stop slot <b>118</b>. The guide and stop slots <b>116</b>, <b>118</b> are configured to receive a guide member <b>156</b> and a stop member <b>158</b> of the plunger <b>140</b> as will be described hereinafter. The guide slot <b>116</b> extends between a rear end <b>117</b> and a forward end <b>119</b> and defines the length of travel of the plunger <b>140</b> within the housing <b>110</b>. The housing body <b>112</b> also defines an inlet connection <b>120</b> and an outlet connection <b>126</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the inlet connection <b>120</b> has internal threads <b>121</b> and the outlet connection <b>126</b> has external threads <b>127</b>. It is recognized that other connection mechanisms may be utilized in place of or in combination with the threads <b>121</b>, <b>127</b>. Each of the connections <b>120</b>, <b>126</b> defines a through passage <b>122</b>, <b>128</b>, respectively, in communication with the internal hollow chamber of the housing body <b>112</b>. The length of the guide slot <b>116</b> corresponds with the distance between the axes of the through passages <b>122</b>, <b>128</b> such that as the plunger <b>140</b> moves over its length of travel, the delivery chamber <b>155</b> will automatically align with either the inlet through passage <b>122</b> or the outlet through passage <b>128</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>, <b>14</b>-<b>17</b> and <b>23</b></figref>, inlet and outlet caps <b>200</b> and <b>210</b> which are configured to engage the inlet and outlet connections <b>120</b>, <b>126</b>, respectively, will be described. The inlet cap <b>200</b> has a generally cylindrical body <b>202</b> which defines a series of external threads <b>206</b> configured to engage threads <b>121</b> of the inlet connection <b>120</b>. A set of internal threads <b>208</b> is defined at the opposite end of the body <b>202</b>. The internal threads <b>208</b> are configured to engage threads <b>64</b> of a bottle <b>60</b> or the like containing the solids material <b>62</b>. Again, while a threaded connection is illustrated, the invention is not limited to such and other connection methods may be utilized. With the illustrated embodiment, the threads overlap one another such that a clear path for the solids material is defined (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The outlet cap <b>210</b> has a generally cylindrical body portion <b>212</b> which defines a series of internal threads <b>218</b> configured to engage threads <b>127</b> of the outlet connection <b>126</b>. A conical body portion <b>216</b> extends from the cylindrical body portion <b>212</b> and tapers to the outlet port <b>217</b>. Again, while a threaded connection is illustrated, the invention is not limited to such and other connection methods may be utilized. Additionally, the size and configuration of the outlet port <b>217</b> may be varied to complement the solids material to be dispensed. Again, with the illustrated embodiment, the threads overlap one another such that a clear path for the solids material is defined (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The separate inlet and outlet caps <b>200</b>, <b>210</b> provide versatility, allowing caps with various configurations to be utilized with the housing <b>110</b>. The various caps can provide, for example, different connection mechanisms, different inlet and outlet opening sizes, and different configurations. While separate caps are illustrated, it is also contemplated that the caps or similar inlet and outlet structures may be formed integral with the outer housing <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>, <b>11</b>-<b>13</b> and <b>18</b>-<b>22</b></figref>, the configuration of the plunger assembly will be described. The plunger assembly generally includes the plunger <b>140</b>, the adjustment rod <b>170</b> and a slider member <b>190</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, the slider member <b>190</b> includes first and second walls <b>192</b>, <b>194</b> which extend generally perpendicular to one another. The first wall <b>192</b> defines a movable wall of the delivery chamber <b>155</b> while the second wall <b>194</b> stabilizes the slider member <b>190</b> relative to the plunger <b>140</b>. A socket <b>196</b> extends from the inside surface of the first wall <b>192</b> and is configured to engage with a ball portion <b>179</b> of the adjustment rod <b>170</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the ball portion <b>179</b> snap fits within the socket <b>196</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, the adjustment rod <b>170</b> includes a body <b>174</b> extending from a rear end <b>171</b> to a forward end <b>173</b>. The rear end <b>171</b> defines a grip portion <b>175</b> which will extend from the plunger <b>140</b> and allow rotation of the adjustment rod <b>170</b> relative to the plunger <b>140</b>. The forward end <b>173</b> defines the ball portion <b>179</b> configured to engage the socket <b>196</b> in the slider member <b>190</b>. While a ball and socket connection is illustrated, other connection assemblies may be utilized. A series of external threads <b>178</b> are defined on the rod body <b>174</b> adjacent the ball portion <b>179</b>. As will be described, the threads <b>178</b> engage within the plunger <b>140</b> and facilitate lateral movement of the adjustment arm <b>170</b> relative to the plunger <b>140</b>, thereby adjusting the position of the slider member <b>190</b>. Adjusting the position of the slider member <b>190</b> adjusts the volume of the delivery chamber <b>155</b>, as will be described in more detail hereinafter. In the illustrated embodiment, the rod body <b>172</b> includes a reduced diameter portion <b>177</b> to provide clearance for the release mechanism as will be described hereinafter.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The plunger <b>140</b> includes a body <b>142</b> extending from a generally open end <b>141</b> to a closed end <b>143</b>.

In this position, the delivery chamber <b>155</b> is aligned with the through passage <b>122</b> of the inlet connection <b>120</b>. Depressing of the arm <b>154</b> causes the stop member <b>148</b> to move within the passage <b>145</b> and to disengage from guide slot <b>116</b>. Once the stop member <b>158</b> is disengaged from the guide slot <b>116</b>, the spring <b>147</b> causes the plunger <b>140</b> to automatically move to the dispensing position aligned with through passage <b>128</b> of the outlet connection <b>126</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>). The guide member <b>146</b> contacts the rear end <b>117</b> of the guide slot <b>116</b> to prevent further rearward travel. Additionally, the stop member <b>158</b> enters the stop slot <b>118</b> in the rear portion of the outer housing <b>110</b> such that the arm <b>154</b> is not required to remain in a flexed position.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Having generally described the components of the handheld solids dispenser <b>100</b>, operation thereof will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>23</b> and <b>24</b></figref>. After the plunger assembly has been assembled as described above, it is inserted into the outer housing <b>110</b> and advanced to the initial position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>. In this position, the stop member <b>158</b> is engaged with the rear end <b>117</b> of the guide slot <b>116</b>, the spring <b>147</b> is compressed, and the delivery chamber <b>155</b> is aligned with the through passage <b>122</b> of the inlet connection <b>120</b>. The grip portion <b>175</b> may be utilized to adjust the volume of the delivery chamber <b>155</b> to a desired volume. The inlet and outlet caps <b>200</b> and <b>210</b> are secured to the inlet and outlet connections <b>120</b>, <b>126</b>, respectively. The dispenser <b>100</b> is ready for use.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">A bottle <b>60</b> of solids material <b>62</b>, or the like, is secured to the inlet cap <b>200</b>. The dispenser <b>100</b> may be inverted while the bottle is attached to prevent spillage. Once the bottle <b>60</b> is attached, a clear path is defined from the bottle <b>60</b> through the passages <b>204</b> and <b>122</b> to the delivery chamber <b>155</b>. Once the dispenser <b>100</b> is returned to its upright position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>, solids material <b>62</b> will flow via gravity into the delivery chamber <b>155</b>. Once the delivery chamber <b>155</b> is full, the cantilevered arm <b>154</b> is depressed, for example, by pushing down on the guide member <b>156</b> or the stop member <b>158</b>. Depressing of the arm <b>154</b> causes the stop member <b>158</b> to disengage from the guide slot <b>116</b> and the spring <b>147</b> biases the plunger <b>140</b> toward the dispensing position as indicated by arrow N in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">As the plunger <b>140</b> moves rearward, the plunger body <b>142</b> seals the through passage <b>122</b> of the inlet connection <b>120</b>. The plunger <b>140</b> moves rearward until the guide block <b>156</b> engages the rear end <b>117</b> of the guide slot <b>116</b>, at which time the plunger <b>140</b> is in the dispensing position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>. In this position, the delivery chamber <b>155</b> is aligned with the through passage <b>128</b> of the outlet connection <b>126</b>. The solids material <b>62</b> in the delivery chamber <b>155</b> is free to flow via gravity through the passages <b>128</b>, <b>214</b> to the outlet port <b>217</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Once the solids material is delivered, the process may be quickly repeated by pushing the plunger <b>140</b> back to the initial position as indicated by the arrow O in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>. It is noted that the ramped surface <b>159</b> causes the stop member <b>158</b> to move within the passage <b>145</b> as the plunger <b>140</b> is pushed into the outer housing <b>110</b>. The plunger <b>140</b> is pushed forward until the stop member <b>158</b> is received in the guide slot <b>116</b> such that the plunger <b>140</b> is once again in the initial position. Solids material <b>62</b> will again flow via gravity into the delivery chamber <b>155</b> and the delivery process may be quickly and accurately repeated.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>25</b> and <b>26</b></figref>, a handheld solids dispenser <b>10</b>&#x2032; in accordance with another embodiment of the invention will be described. As in the first embodiment, the dispenser includes a housing <b>12</b> extending from a first end <b>11</b>&#x2032; and to a second end <b>13</b>. The second end <b>13</b> again supports the plunger <b>40</b>&#x2032; and may include a handle <b>14</b>. In the present embodiment, the first end <b>11</b>&#x2032; is configured for connection of a dispensing housing <b>70</b> thereto. The illustrated dispensing housing <b>70</b> includes a conical portion <b>72</b> extending to a delivery tube <b>74</b> and an input tube <b>76</b> with an opening <b>78</b>. A delivery shaft <b>80</b> with a screw conveyor <b>82</b> is positioned within the housing <b>12</b> such that the screw conveyor <b>82</b> extends through the delivery tube <b>74</b>. As illustrated, the screw conveyor <b>82</b> may have a tip <b>83</b> which extends beyond the end of the delivery tube <b>74</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Within the housing <b>12</b>, the delivery shaft <b>80</b> is connected to a drive motor <b>90</b>. The motor <b>90</b> is configured to rotate in response to a switch <b>92</b> associated therewith. The switch <b>92</b> is configured to be engaged by the internal end <b>43</b> of the plunger <b>40</b>&#x2032; to control the motor <b>90</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the switch <b>92</b> is a pressure switch such that increased pressure on the switch <b>92</b> will cause the screw conveyor <b>82</b> to rotate longer and/or faster to deliver more material received from the input tube <b>76</b>. To set the amount of material delivered, the end <b>41</b> of the plunger <b>40</b>&#x2032; external to the housing <b>12</b> includes a setting ring <b>48</b> which is threadably adjustable on threads <b>47</b>. Moving the ring <b>48</b> closer to the housing <b>12</b> will minimize the amount the plunger <b>40</b>&#x2032; may be depressed, thereby lowering the amount of solids material delivered. Rotating the ring <b>48</b> away from the housing <b>12</b> allows the plunger <b>40</b>&#x2032; to be depressed further, thereby causing greater pressure on the pressure switch <b>92</b>, resulting in dispensing of more material. It is contemplated that the motor <b>90</b> may be configured for reversed actuation such that the screw conveyor <b>82</b> may be operated in the opposite direction such that the tip <b>83</b> may remove material if excess is delivered.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b></figref>, a handheld solids dispenser <b>10</b>&#x2033; in accordance with another embodiment of the invention will be described. The dispenser <b>10</b>&#x2033; is substantially the same as in the previous embodiment except that the dispensing amount is controlled electronically. More specifically, the switch <b>92</b>&#x2032; includes an internal processor in communication with an input screen <b>94</b>. The technician sets a desired delivery amount on the input screen <b>94</b> and the switch processor receives the desired delivery amount and controls the motor <b>90</b> to deliver such desired amount. As such, the plunger <b>40</b>&#x2033; does not include any setting elements. Instead, depressing of the plunger <b>40</b>&#x2033; will actuate the switch <b>92</b> which will in turn control the motor <b>90</b> to dispense the desired amount.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>28</b>-<b>40</b></figref>, a handheld solids dispenser <b>210</b> in accordance with another embodiment of the invention will be described. The dispenser includes a housing <b>212</b> extending from a first end <b>211</b> to a second end <b>213</b>. In the present embodiment, the housing <b>212</b> is a two part housing with a outer housing member <b>214</b> and an inner housing member <b>216</b>. The housing may have other configurations, for example upper and lower housing halves or a generally unitary housing with a door or the like to access the inside thereof. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>30</b>-<b>32</b></figref>, the inner housing member <b>216</b> includes a plurality of projections <b>217</b> configured to snap fit within corresponding slots <b>215</b> on the outer housing member <b>214</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The first end <b>211</b> of the housing <b>212</b> is configured for connection of a dispensing housing <b>270</b> thereto via a connecting member <b>240</b>, each of which will be described hereinafter. A vibration motor housing <b>220</b> and a drive shaft <b>250</b> extend from the first end <b>211</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b></figref>) and are enclosed within the connecting member <b>240</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref>). In the illustrated embodiment, the motor actuation switch <b>230</b> is also positioned along the first end <b>211</b> of the housing <b>212</b>. It is understood that the switch may be positioned at any desired location relative to the housing <b>212</b>. A speed control knob <b>236</b> extends from the second end <b>213</b> of the housing <b>212</b>, although it may be otherwise positioned on the housing <b>212</b>. The illustrated speed control knob <b>236</b> is a rotatory knob which is associated with the drive motor <b>226</b> positioned within the inner housing member <b>216</b> and the vibration motor <b>223</b> positioned within the motor housing <b>220</b>. Rotation of the control knob <b>236</b> causes the drive motor <b>226</b> to increase or decrease in speed and the vibration motor <b>223</b> to increase or decrease in vibration. While a rotary knob is shown, the control may have other configurations, for example, a slide mechanism. In the illustrated embodiment, the second end <b>213</b> of the housing <b>212</b> also defines a charging port <b>238</b> which facilitates charging of the power source, e.g. a rechargeable battery, within the housing <b>212</b>. While illustrated on the second end <b>213</b>, the charging port <b>238</b> may be otherwise positioned along the housing <b>212</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>31</b> and <b>32</b></figref>, the inner housing <b>216</b> will be described in greater detail. The inner housing <b>216</b> includes a side wall <b>218</b> extending from an end wall <b>219</b> about a generally open area. An opening <b>231</b> is defined in the end wall <b>219</b> which is configured to support the switch <b>230</b>. The switch <b>230</b> extends into the inner housing <b>216</b> and is connected to a control board (not shown), for example, a PCB. The control board is also connected to the drive motor <b>226</b>, the vibration motor <b>223</b>, a power source (not shown) and the control knob <b>236</b>. The switch <b>230</b> is preferably a three-way switch, having an off, forward and reverse position. In the forward position, the drive motor <b>226</b> rotates the screw conveyor <b>260</b> such that solids material is delivered from the inlet <b>280</b> to the outlet opening <b>279</b>. The reverse position allows material within the helical screw blade <b>268</b> to be returned to the dispensing bottle <b>60</b> or the like. Additionally, the screw conveyor <b>260</b> may extend from the dispensing housing <b>270</b>, at least in part, such that the tip of the screw conveyor <b>260</b> may positioned in a solids material source, e.g. a bottle or pile of material, and the drive motor <b>226</b> operated in the reverse direction such that the screw conveyor <b>260</b> delivers material back to the bottle <b>60</b> attached to the inlet <b>280</b>. Alternatively, the switch <b>230</b> may be a two-way switch with an off and forward position. To clear the screw conveyor <b>260</b>, with the motor off, the bottle <b>60</b> would be removed from the dispensing housing <b>270</b> and aligned with the dispensing outlet <b>278</b>. The drive motor <b>226</b> would then be actuated and the screw conveyor <b>260</b> would deliver any remaining solids material to the bottle through the dispensing outlet.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The vibration motor housing <b>220</b> extends from the end wall <b>219</b>.

The connection skirt <b>228</b> extends about an opening <b>225</b> in the end wall <b>219</b> through which the motor shaft <b>227</b> extends. The connection skirt <b>228</b> has an open end <b>229</b> configured to receive the drive shaft <b>250</b> as will be described hereinafter. A pair of projections <b>221</b> extend from the connection skirt <b>228</b> and are configured to engage slots <b>245</b> in the connecting member <b>240</b>. The vibration motor <b>223</b> is positioned securely in the motor housing <b>220</b> through an opening <b>222</b> in the end wall <b>219</b>. The vibration motor <b>223</b> is a vibratory motor such that when the vibration motor <b>223</b> is actuated, it causes the connecting member <b>240</b>, and thereby the dispensing housing <b>270</b>, to vibrate. Vibration of the dispensing housing <b>270</b> helps promote flow of the solids material, as will be described hereinafter.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The drive motor <b>226</b> is positioned securely within a motor support <b>224</b> within the inner housing <b>216</b>.

In the illustrated embodiment, the inlet <b>280</b> includes a tapered portion <b>284</b> such that solids material from a larger source (e.g. bottle) may be delivered to the narrower passage <b>276</b>. Threads <b>286</b> or other connecting mechanisms are provided within the inlet <b>280</b> to securely connect a bottle or the like to the inlet. In the illustrated embodiment, the central axis Q of the inlet passage <b>282</b> is perpendicular to the axis P of the body passage <b>276</b>, however, the axes P, Q may be otherwise angled relative to one another. Similarly, the central axis Q of the inlet passage <b>282</b> is parallel to the axis S of the outlet opening <b>279</b>, however, the axes Q, S may be otherwise angled relative to one another. It is noted that the inlet passage axis Q is laterally offset from the outlet opening axis S.

A bottle <b>60</b> of solids material <b>62</b> is connected to the inlet <b>280</b>. The material <b>62</b> will flow through the inlet passage <b>282</b> into the body passage <b>276</b> and into contact with the screw conveyor <b>260</b>. The switch <b>230</b> is moved to the forward position such that the motor shaft <b>227</b> is rotated in the forward direction. Such rotation causes the drive shaft <b>250</b>, and thereby the screw conveyor <b>260</b>, to rotate in the forward direction. The control knob <b>236</b> may be utilized to adjust the speed of rotation and the amount of vibration. The rotating screw conveyor <b>260</b> delivers the solids material to the outlet opening <b>279</b>. The vibration caused by vibration motor <b>223</b> may be utilized to aid in the flow of some materials. Once a desired amount of solids material is delivered, for example, as evidenced by a scale, the switch <b>230</b> is moved to the off position.
