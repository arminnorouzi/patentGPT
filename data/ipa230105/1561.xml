The power tool system includes a variety of tools that utilize a common battery pack <b>100</b>. The battery pack <b>100</b> is a removable power tool battery pack and may be of the type shown in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,598,705; 7,661,486; or U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2018/0331335. U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,598,705; 7,661,486; and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2018/0331335 are hereby incorporated by reference.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Each tool in the power tool system of the exemplary embodiment also includes a common base <b>200</b>. Each tool then is built incorporating this common base <b>200</b>. For example, the specific tools may include a rotary tool <b>400</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>; a hot glue gun <b>500</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>; a soldering iron <b>600</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>; a lamp light <b>700</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>; or a fan <b>800</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. Each of these tools is also powered by a battery pack <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates components of the base <b>200</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a partially exploded view and one half of a housing <b>201</b> of the common base <b>200</b> is removed to illustrate internals. As is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the common base <b>200</b> comprises a housing <b>201</b>. The housing <b>201</b> is removably attachable to the power tool battery pack <b>100</b>. There is an actuator <b>205</b> on the front of the housing <b>201</b>. The actuator <b>205</b> may be used to turn on or off one of the variety of tools. For example, the actuator <b>205</b> may be used to turn on or off the rotary tool <b>400</b>, lamp light <b>700</b>, fan <b>800</b>, etc. In the exemplary embodiment, the actuator <b>205</b> is a rotatable knob, but other actuators are possible. The actuator <b>205</b> may provide a variable input. For example, turning the knob more may increase the speed or intensity of the tool. For example, the knob may be used to control the fan <b>800</b> rotation or rotary tool <b>400</b> rotation at different speeds. Similarly, the knob may control the intensity of the light for the lamp light <b>700</b>. In other embodiments the actuator <b>205</b> could simply turn a tool on and off. Additionally, the actuator <b>205</b> may in some tools serve only as an on and off actuator and in other tools provide different settings, such as different speed or intensity settings.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The housing <b>201</b> also houses a circuit board <b>220</b> including a controller <b>221</b>. The controller <b>221</b> can provide a proportional 100 W (watts) PWM (pulse-width-modulation) power delivery system that allows for the setting of speed, temperature control, lighting control or fan speed, depending upon the particular tool. The proportional pulse-width-modulation power delivery may be in the range of 80 W to 120 W. pulse-width-modulation power delivery may be in the range of 50 W to 150 W. The circuit board <b>220</b> may be a printed circuit board. The controller <b>221</b> may include a microprocessor. There may be a memory <b>222</b> on the circuit board <b>220</b> and the controller <b>221</b> may itself have a memory component. Other components may also be mounted on the circuit board <b>220</b> such as sensors, resistors or charge and discharge controls. The circuit board <b>220</b>, controller <b>221</b>, memory <b>222</b> and the provided pulse-width-modulation power delivery may be the same for each of the tools. That allows the same design to be used for a variety of different tools <b>400</b>, <b>500</b>, <b>600</b>, <b>700</b>, <b>800</b>. Each of the tools <b>400</b>, <b>500</b>, <b>600</b>, <b>700</b>, <b>800</b> has a base that is similar to the common base <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As is further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the housing <b>201</b> includes a recess <b>210</b>. When used for some tools, the recess can hold a stamped aluminum tray <b>250</b> for holding a solder sponge or other component. Additionally, the housing <b>201</b> has a pivot projection <b>202</b> which allows pivoting attachment to various tools. The pivot projection <b>202</b> attaches to tool arm rest <b>300</b>. The tool arm rest <b>300</b> may be used to hold a variety of different tools. In other embodiments, the pivot projection <b>202</b> may attach to an alternate tool holder <b>350</b>. In other embodiments there are additional tool specific features, such as a tool rest <b>320</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>6</b></figref>, the battery pack <b>100</b> serves as a weighted base for each of the tools <b>400</b>, <b>500</b>, <b>600</b>, <b>700</b>, <b>800</b>. The battery pack <b>100</b> may be placed on a stable surface, such as a flat horizontal surface made by a table or floor and remain in place. The tools <b>400</b>, <b>500</b>, <b>600</b>, <b>700</b>, <b>800</b> each have working portions which can be remote from the battery pack <b>100</b> and the respective bases and base housings. The working portions of the tools may be connected to the base, base housings and battery packs <b>100</b> by a connection section. The connection section may in some instances be a cord, as in the rotary tool <b>400</b>, glue gun <b>500</b> and soldering iron <b>600</b>. In other instances the connection section may be a movable stand, such as with the light <b>700</b> and the fan <b>800</b>. In each instance, the common control hardware and a similar housing can be used to connect to the battery pack <b>100</b> serving as a weighted base of the product. At the same time, each tool can perform work away from the base and battery pack <b>100</b> owing to the connection section.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">As is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the battery pack <b>100</b> is connected to the base <b>200</b> in a direction A. The PCB <b>220</b> is disposed in a plane parallel to the direction A. The PCB <b>220</b> is also disposed in a plane parallel to a bottom of the battery pack <b>100</b> and a central major plane of the battery pack <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates the rotary tool <b>400</b>. The rotary tool <b>400</b> is powered by the removable battery pack <b>100</b>. The rotary tool <b>400</b> has a base <b>450</b> with a base housing <b>451</b>. The base housing <b>451</b> houses the same components as the base housing <b>201</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.
