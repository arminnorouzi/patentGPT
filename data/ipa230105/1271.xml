In particular, the present disclosure is related to golf club heads having transition regions to reduce aerodynamic drag during a swing.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Golf club manufacturers have designed golf club heads with aerodynamic features to improve the flow of air over and around the golf club head. When air flows around a golf club head during a swing, a wake, or an area of disturbed air flow, is formed behind the club head. In many cases, the wake creates a drag force on the club head, thereby slowing the speed of the golf club head throughout the swing. The transition profiles of a golf club head can be a large contributor to the drag forces on the club head during a swing. Therefore, there is a need in the art for a golf club head having transition regions to reduce the aerodynamic drag on the club head during a swing.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a front view of an exemplary golf club head according to a first embodiment.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a side, cross sectional view of the golf club head in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a front prospective view of the golf club head in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an enlarged side, cross sectional view of the crown transition profile of the golf club head in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is another enlarged side cross sectional view of the crown transition profile of the golf club head in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates data for the drag coefficient resulting from aerodynamic testing of exemplary golf club heads having varying crown transition profiles.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates a trend line of the data from the aerodynamic testing of the golf club heads in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates aerodynamic data for the drag coefficient resulting from aerodynamic testing of exemplary golf club heads having varying crown transition profile lengths.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is an enlarged side cross sectional view of the sole transition profile of the golf club head in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is another enlarged side cross sectional view of the sole transition profile of the golf club head in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> illustrates a trend line of data from aerodynamic testing of exemplary golf club heads having varying sole transition profiles.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is an enlarged side cross sectional view of the rear transition profile of the golf club head in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> illustrates data from aerodynamic testing of exemplary golf club heads having varying rear transition profiles.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> illustrates a method of manufacturing the golf club head in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is a front view of an exemplary golf club head according to a second embodiment.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> is a side, cross sectional view of the golf club head in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> is an enlarged side, cross sectional view of the crown transition profile of the golf club head in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> is an enlarged side, cross sectional view of the crown transition profile of the golf club head in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> is an enlarged side, cross sectional view of the crown transition profile of the golf club head in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Other aspects of the disclosure will become apparent by consideration of the detailed description and accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">For simplicity and clarity of illustration, the drawing figures illustrate the general manner of construction, and descriptions and details of well-known features and techniques may be omitted to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present disclosure. Additionally, elements in the drawing figures are not necessarily drawn to scale. For example, the dimensions of some of the elements in the figures may be exaggerated relative to other elements to help improve understanding of embodiments of the present disclosure.

Transition profiles contribute significantly to the aerodynamic drag on the golf club head. In many embodiments, the club head includes a crown transition profile, a sole transition profile, and a rear transition profile to maximize the reduction of drag resulting from the transition regions of the club head. Specifically, the crown transition profile extends between a top edge of the strike face and an apex of the crown. The crown transition profile includes a first crown radius of curvature between the top edge of the strike face and a first crown transition point, and a major crown transition point positioned between the first crown transition point and the apex. The crown transition profile further includes a plurality of crown radii of curvature and crown transition points between the first crown transition point and the crown apex.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The crown radii of curvature of the crown transition profile between the top edge of the strike face and the major crown transition point contribute significantly to the aerodynamic drag of the golf club head. The crown radii of curvature of the crown transition profile between the top edge of the strike face and the major crown transition point are between 0.18 inch to 2.0 inches. Crown radii of curvature less than 2.0 inches (i.e. smaller radii of curvature) forward the major crown transition point reduce the aerodynamic drag the greatest. Further, crown radii of curvature less than 1.0 inches forward of the major crown transition point reduce the aerodynamic drag the greatest. These crown radii of curvature form a crown transition profile shape of a quick ramp up to the major crown transition point, then flatter near the apex.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The crown transition profile shape (i.e. quick ramp up to the major crown transition point, then flatter near the apex) creates a larger crown transition region, which allows air to move away faster from strike face. Moving air away faster from the strike face reduces aerodynamic drag on the crown. Club heads comprising the crown transition profile including 1) the first crown radius of curvature between 0.18 inch and 0.30 inch, 2) crown radii of curvature less than 2.0 inches forward the major crown transition point, and 3) the plurality of crown radii of curvature and the plurality of crown transition points between the first crown transition point and the crown apex provide desirable aerodynamic drag reduction.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Further, in other embodiments, the club head includes a crown transition profile, a sole transition profile, and a rear transition profile to maximize the reduction of drag resulting from the transition regions of the club head. In many embodiments, the crown transition profile includes a first crown radius of curvature between approximately 0.18-0.30 inches (0.46-0.76 cm), the sole transition profile includes a first sole radius of curvature between approximately 0.3-0.5 inches (0.76-1.27 cm), and the rear transition profile includes a rear radius of curvature between approximately 0.10-0.25 inches (0.25-0.64 cm) to reduce aerodynamic drag on the club head.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Various embodiments of the golf club head are described herein having transition regions to reduce aerodynamic drag include a golf club head having a body and a strike face. The strike face includes a top edge, a bottom edge, and a geometric center. The strike face defines a loft plane positioned tangent to the strike face extending through the geometric center. The body includes a front end, a back end opposite the front end, a heel, a toe opposite the heel, a crown having an apex and a crown transition profile, a sole having a lowest point and a sole transition profile, and a back end or skirt having rear transition profile. The crown transition profile includes a first crown radius of curvature extending from the top edge of the strike face to a first crown transition point, wherein the first crown radius of curvature is between approximately 0.18 inches and 0.30 inches (0.46 cm-0.76 cm). The sole transition profile includes a first sole radius of curvature extending from the bottom edge of the strike face to a first sole transition point, wherein the first sole radius of curvature is between approximately 0.30 inches and 0.50 inches (0.76 cm-1.27 cm). The rear transition profile includes a rear radius of curvature between approximately 0.10 inches and 0.25 inches (0.25 cm-0.64 cm).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Some embodiments include a golf club comprising a golf club head and a shaft coupled to the golf club head.

For example, the apex distance can be approximately 0.9 inches (2.29 cm), 1.0 inches (2.54 cm), 1.1 inches (2.79 cm), 1.2 inches (3.05 cm), 1.3 inches (3.30 cm), or 1.4 inches (3.56 cm).</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">In many embodiments, aerodynamic drag reduction can result from varying the apex distance.

Similarly, decreasing the first sole radius of curvature does not always result in increased drag. For example, decreasing the first sole radius of curvature may result in an increase or a decrease in drag. In the illustrated example, when the first sole radius of curvature is increased from 0.10 inches (0.25 cm) to 0.30 inches (0.76 cm), the drag is reduced by a greater extent than when the first sole radius of curvature is increased from 0.10 inches (0.25 cm) to 0.50 inches (1.27 cm) for an optimal closed face club angle at impact (i.e. 90 degrees).
