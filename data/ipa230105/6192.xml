No. 63/217,085, filed on Jun. 30, 2021, at the USPTO, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure is related to an porous composite and a method of manufacturing same. In particular, the present disclosure is related to a porous metal matrix composite and a method for manufacturing same.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The storage of electric power is a key technique in electric power source management and in the usage of regenerating energy. The storage of electric power includes physical and chemical types. In consideration of the necessity of rapid electricity charging and discharging capability as well as high storage capacity, the electrochemical battery has become the first priority for the application of micro-grid energy storage.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the field of electrochemical batteries, the well-developed hybrid lead-carbon battery, which is a combination of a conventional lead-acid battery and an asymmetrical super capacitor, provides a possible solution to implement an electric power storage device that is likely to achieve economic benefits. The super capacitor having a rapid charge and discharge capability and combined with the conventional lead-acid battery can inhibit the occurrence of a sulfurization reaction on the negative electrode (e.g. a lead plate electrode) of the battery during the high rate partial stage of charge (HRPSoC) process, which dramatically decreases the life time of the battery after each cycle of charging and discharging. The so-called sulfurization effect is that the solid metal lead (Pb<sub>(s)</sub>) on the negative electrode reacts with the sulfite ion (HSO<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup><sub>(aq)</sub>) in the sulfuric acid solution during the oxidation process, and is converted into non-conductive solid sulfuric lead (PbSO<sub>4(s)</sub>). During the period in deep discharge or in the HRPSoC process, lead sulfate, which is non-conductive, easily forms and crystallizes. As the non-conductive lead sulfate grains gradually cover the surface of the lead electrode, the reverse reduction reaction cannot reduce all lead sulfate into metal lead due to poor conductivity. Thus, the energy storage efficiency of the battery is reduced and battery cycle life is also shortened.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Currently, a method to improve the issue of sulfurization of the negative electrode is to add a carbon material to the lead electrode to increase the effective electrical contact area between the lead sulfate and the conductive carbon material. This method can increase the cycle life of lead-acid batteries. However, without undergoing special high pressure (about 400 MPa) and high temperature (about 950&#xb0; C.) treatment to form chemical bonds at the carbon-lead interface, the contact between the carbon materials and the lead electrode is only physically rather than chemically bonded, so the structure of the carbon modified electrode in the general process is quite loose. That is to say, the structural strength of the lead electrode decreases with the increase in the amount of carbon material added, so there is a certain limit to the addition ratio of the carbon material.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition, in the manufacture of such a hybrid type lead-carbon battery, a lead battery paste on a negative electrode of a conventional lead-acid battery is replaced partly or completely with a carbon material capacitor paste having a high specific area porosity. That is to say, the production of the hybrid lead-carbon battery can be completed through a highly industrialized conventional lead-acid battery manufacturing process, so it has the added benefit of low production costs. Moreover, the lead-acid battery itself has the properties of extremely high stability (or low maintenance cost) and high cyclic charge/discharge efficiency (above 75%). Therefore, this kind of hybrid lead-carbon battery can be used as an energy storage device of the micro grid class and for the lowest cost.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Although the combination of the conventional lead-acid battery and the asymmetric super capacitor can provide low-cost power storage, the high self-discharge rate and low cycle life of the battery at deep depth of discharge (DoD&#x3e;50%) limit the wide application of the conventional hybrid type lead-carbon battery. The reason for the low cycle life at deep DoD is that two materials, i.e. a carbon material and a lead plate, present on the negative electrode plate are unable to bond to each other and cause the phenomena such as electrode interface corrosion and the like that easily occur on the lead-carbon interface. The reason for the high self-discharge rate is that porous carbon material with high surface area acts as an electrolyte super-capacitor storing charges and excess concentration of ions across the electric double layer. Those excess concentration of ions diffuse away and charges leak through the super-capacitor circuit when uncharged.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore, a method that can effectively bond carbon material to lead material and form a porous structure of lead matrix with balanced super-capacitor effect is very important for the preparation of an electrode for the hybrid lead-carbon battery. In other words, it is a very important step on the way to achieving the goals of mass production and development of the porous hybrid lead-carbon battery with long cycle life at deep DoD.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In prior art, although the bonding problem between the lead and carbon materials can be solved by using coupling agents such as the precious metal, e.g. titanium, palladium, and platinum, or their oxides, these precious metal coupling agents are quite expensive and are still not beneficial to electrode production.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Therefore, the Applicant has disclosed a method for forming a lead-based porous substrate containing continuously interconnected lead-carbon interface layer to improve the problems of the prior art mentioned above. In addition, the Applicant has disclosed a porous metal matrix composite (MMC) having the lead-carbon interface layer and pores along the interface, and a method for producing the same.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In accordance with one aspect of the present disclosure, a method for producing a porous metal matrix composite (MMC) is provided.

It is to be noted that the following descriptions of embodiments of the present disclosure are presented herein for the purposes of illustration and description only; they are not intended to be exhaustive or to be limited to the precise form disclosed.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a natural property that lead and carbon contact. Normally, trying to bond the lead material and the carbon material by a melted lead and a carbon material is very difficult. Because of the nature of lead and carbon, when a melted lead material <b>11</b> contacts the carbon material <b>12</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, there will be a high contact angle CA between the melted lead material <b>11</b> and the carbon material <b>12</b>. It means that the interacting force between these two materials is weak, so that it is hard to bond lead and carbon physically or chemically.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The present invention provides a feasible way to obtain a substrate having a chemically bonded lead-carbon interface. In addition, the present invention provides a feasible way to obtain a porous metal matrix composite having a lead-carbon interface.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">One example of the porous metal matrix composite (MMC) is a porous lead plate having a carbon material embedded therein, or called a porous lead-carbon composite (LLC). A porous metal matrix composite having a lead-carbon interface made by the method according to the present invention can be applied to electrodes used in an acid battery including, but not limited to, a lead-acid battery. For example, the material for either one of the positive electrode (i.e. the cathode) and the negative electrode (i.e. the anode) can be a porous metal matrix composite.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic diagram showing a cross section of a porous metal matrix composite <b>20</b>. The porous MMC includes a metal material <b>21</b>, a layer of plurality of spacing materials <b>22</b>, pathways <b>23</b> along the interface of the metal material <b>21</b> and the spacing materials <b>22</b>. The pathways <b>23</b> includes the pores that originally exist in the spacing materials, and the pores and passages generated because of erosion of the metal material <b>21</b> during the production process of the MMC. In an embodiment of the present invention, the porous MMC can be a porous lead carbon composite, the metal material is lead, and the plurality of spacing materials can be carbon fibers.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic diagram showing a part of the layer of a plurality of spacing materials according to an embodiment of the present invention. The plurality of spacing materials can be woven or non-woven fibers <b>31</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, each fiber <b>31</b> can be solid or hollow, and/or the surface of the fiber <b>31</b> can have at least a hole <b>32</b>. When the non-woven fibers are used to make the porous lead-carbon material, the non-woven fibers can be densely distributed all over the surface of a lead plate, so that some of the fibers <b>31</b> can at least partially contact their neighboring fibers <b>31</b> and form an inter-connected structure. The inter-connected structure assists extension or progress of the pathways <b>23</b> during the production of the porous MMC <b>20</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to an embodiment of the present invention, the candidate for the plurality of spacing materials can be one of a porous material and a nonporous material. The porous material is one selected from a group consisting of a microporous material, a mesoporous material, a macroporous material and a nonporous material. The microporous material is one selected from a group consisting of a microporous activated carbon material, a carbon fiber material, an activated carbon fiber material, a carbon black material, a graphene material, a graphene oxide material, a carbon nanotube material, a zeolite material, a metal organic framework material. The mesoporous material is one selected from a group consisting of a mesoporous activated carbon material and a zeolite material. The macroporous material is one selected from a group consisting of a fiber, a macroporous zeolite, a macroporous mesh, a macroporous resin, and a macroporous silica. The nonporous material is a chemically inert material. The chemically inert material is one selected from a group consisting of a stainless metal material, a metal oxide material, and a PTFE material.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In comparison with the non-woven fibers, the fibers in the woven fibers are interwoven so that the woven fibers are also inter-connected. It can be realized that, when using the woven fibers to make the porous lead-carbon material, the passages are more easily formed than that using the non-woven fibers.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>7</b></figref> shows a flowchart of the methods for producing a porous MMC having a plurality of spacing materials embedded therein according to an embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-<b>8</b>C</figref> shows how the porous MMC is produced using a mold according to an embodiment of the present invention.

In a preferred embodiment according to the present invention, two MMC blanks (hereinafter called Blank A and Blank B) are immersed in an electrolyte, such as H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, and serve as an anode and a cathode respectively. Similar to the operation of a lead acid battery, at the first discharging stage, a first voltage is applied to the anode and the cathode, Blank A serves as the anode, and Blank B serves as the cathode. The lead at the surface <b>91</b> or the lead at the inner surfaces <b>92</b><i>a </i>of Blank A is oxidized to form lead ions (Pb<sup>2+ </sup>), and the lead ions react with sulfate ions dissociated from the sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) to newly form additional grains <b>94</b><i>b </i>of PbSO<sub>4 </sub>at the surface or at the inner surfaces <b>92</b><i>b </i>that is further eroded from the inner surface <b>92</b><i>a </i>in the Blank A. It should be noted that, the size of the grains <b>94</b><i>b </i>newly formed at the first discharging stage is usually smaller than those of the grains <b>94</b><i>a </i>formed at the initial activation stage. It means that a lot of second pores/passages/pathways <b>95</b><i>b </i>are further formed between the grains <b>94</b><i>b </i>at the first discharging stage. The size of the second pores <b>95</b><i>b </i>is smaller than the pores <b>95</b><i>a</i>. In the meantime, the grains of the lead sulfate formed on the surfaces of the Blank B (not shown) serving as the cathode will dissociate into lead ions and sulfate ions, the lead ions dissociated from Blank B are reduced into lead to form at the surfaces or at the inner surfaces <b>92</b><i>b </i>in Blank B, and the sulfate ions are reduced to form sulfuric acid. The reduction-oxidation (redox) reaction occurs at the anode and the cathode results from an electro-chemical reaction during the first discharging process.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">First Charging Stage</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">At the first charging stage, Blank B serves as the anode, and Blank A serves as the cathode now. A second voltage is applied to the anode and the cathode. The lead at the surface or at the inner surfaces of the pores in Blank B is oxidized to form lead ions, and the lead ions react with sulfate ions to form additional grains of lead sulfate at the surface or at the inner surfaces of Blank B. If the applied voltage is high enough, some gases such as hydrogen and/or oxygen are generated because of hydrolysis of water in the sulfuric acid solution. The generated gases are capable of expanding the spaces in the passages or pathways. In the meantime, Blank A serves as a cathode. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref>, some of the grains <b>94</b><i>b </i>formed on Blank A will dissociate to form lead ions, and the lead ions are reduced to lead <b>96</b> and formed at the surface or at the inner surfaces <b>92</b><i>b </i>of Blank A. It should be noted that, the grain size of the reduced lead <b>96</b> formed at the first charging stage is usually smaller than those of the grains <b>94</b><i>a </i>of lead sulfate formed at the initial activation stage. Accordingly, in Blanks A and B, expansion of the pores (including and/or extension of pathways are achieved. At present, a porous MMC, which is a lead carbon composite (LCC) in an embodiment according to the present invention, is formed.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">It is noted that, the reduction-oxidation (redox) reactions occurring at the first discharging stage and the first charging stage constitute one redox cycle. More redox cycles can be performed to obtain finer grains of the lead sulfate and finer grains of the reduced lead growing at Blanks A and B.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">After experiencing the initiate stage, the first discharging stage, and a second discharging stage, some of the pores and passages (which form an erosion region) are formed at the positions (or the contact surfaces) that the lead material contacts the embedded plurality of the spacing materials. At the charging stage, the gasses (bubbles) of hydrogen and oxygen are formed to further erode the porous lead plate to form the erosion region.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">If Blanks A and B are installed in a lead-acid battery, when the battery is operating in a vehicle, through continuing discharging and charging processes, the grains of the lead sulfate and the reduced lead will keep growing, and the size of each of the grains of the lead sulfate and the reduced lead will become smaller and smaller.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">It should be also noted that, it is feasible to select any combination of the metal material and the electrolyte having the redox reaction similar to lead and sulfuric acid according to the present invention.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-<b>10</b>C</figref> each shows a cross-section of a piece of an MMC blank <b>100</b>, and the semi-products <b>100</b><i>a </i>and <b>100</b><i>b</i>, with a tubular carbon fiber <b>102</b> having a hollow core <b>103</b> embedded in a lead material <b>101</b> at different stages.

That is to say, during the charging and discharging cycles, the pores generated along the pathways at the lead-carbon interface dramatically increased. In comparison, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>, when the electrode using the pure lead plate was tested for 30 cycles with the high charging rate of 20 C for one hour and with the discharging rage of (1/4) C for 4 hours, and the depth of discharging is 100%, the capacities maintain almost the same at 0.2 Ah with the increase of the cycles from 0 to 30. In other words, the capacitance of the electrode using the porous lead plate was almost 4.5 times growth of that using the pure lead plate. In addition, it can be explained that the surface area of the pores in the porous lead plate that participated in the charging and discharging processes gradually increased, and the phenomenon of increase of the capacitance effect appeared.
