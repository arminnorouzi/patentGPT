More particularly, the present invention relates to a coating tape in which an inorganic layer formed on one surface or both surfaces of an electrode is formed in the form of an adhesive tape so as to be attached to a battery, and a method of manufacturing the same.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In general, a secondary battery includes an electrode assembly in which a positive electrode/separator/negative electrode is stacked. Each of the positive electrode and the negative electrode is manufactured by applying a slurry including an electrode active material to one surface or both surfaces of a metal current collector, drying the slurry, and rolling the metal current collector having the dried slurry applied thereto. In addition, the separator serves to pass an electrolyte and ions while preventing an electrical short circuit between the two electrodes by separating the positive electrode and the negative electrode.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In general, the separator includes a porous substrate to prevent an electrical short circuit between the two electrodes. A polyolefin substrate, which is mainly used as a porous substrate, shrinks into a form before elongation at a high temperature, causing a problem in that the positive electrode and the negative electrode are short-circuited. In order to solve this problem, heat resistance is improved by a method such as imparting an additional material to the porous substrate. Alternatively, heat resistance of the entire separator is improved by adding a coating layer to one surface of the porous substrate to improve the heat resistance of the entire separator. At this time, the coating layer may improve the heat resistance of the separator by adding a heat-resistant material to the coating layer itself or by changing the physical properties of the coating layer itself.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The method of improving the heat resistance of the separator as described above increases the temperature at which the separator shrinks. However, when the temperature eventually exceeds a limit temperature, the separator with improved heat resistance also eventually shrinks. The present invention is directed on this point and considers a method of adding a layer to an electrode, the layer capable of preventing an electrical short circuit.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Patent Document 1 discloses a method of forming an inorganic coating layer on at least one surface of an electrode. When the inorganic coating layer is directly applied (coated) to the electrode as in Patent Document 1, inorganic powder penetrates into pores of the electrode as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, thereby making the thickness of the inorganic coating layer non-uniform. In addition, the penetrated inorganic powder acts as a resistance of the electrode, thereby deteriorating battery performance.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In Patent Document 2, a solution containing a dispersion medium for inorganic coating and a binder is applied to an electrode active material layer in order to keep the thickness of the inorganic coating layer constant. When the binder is added separately, the density of a battery decreases, and the binder acts as a resistance, deteriorating battery performance. In the case in which a separate coating layer is formed in Patent Document 2, there is a problem in that the coating layer is hardened, causing cracks or tearing.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Patent Document 3 adds a plasticizer to a negative electrode active material layer, but this simply proposes a solution to prevent an internal short circuit of a battery.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Patent Document 4 discloses a method of increasing the workability of a dried coating layer while improving the flexibility of a coating layer by mixing a plasticizer in a slurry for a separator. However, in the case of Patent Document 4, since the coating layer is bonded to a separate inorganic support, the problem that an internal short circuit occurs when the separator shrinks has not been solved. Moreover, since sintering is required to attach the coating layer to the inorganic support, there is a disadvantage in that the pore size and distribution of the coating layer may be different from the pore size and distribution during the initial slurry formation.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">As described above, there is a need for a technology capable of improving the safety and performance of the battery by preventing an internal short circuit of the battery.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">PRIOR ART DOCUMENTS</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Documents</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Korean Patent Application Publication No. 2008-0105853 (Dec. 4, 2008) (Patent Document 1)</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Korean Patent Application Publication No. 2014-0028754 (Mar. 10, 2014) (Patent Document 2)</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2012-238396 (Dec. 6, 2012) (Patent Document 3)</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Korean Patent Application Publication No. 2018-0077030 (Jul. 6, 2018) (Patent Document 4)</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present invention has been made in view of the above problems, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a coating tape by forming an inorganic layer formed on one surface or both surfaces of an electrode in the form of an adhesive tape for insulation so as to be attached to a battery, and a method of manufacturing the same, thereby improving battery performance and preventing an internal short circuit.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Technical Solution</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a first aspect of the present invention, the above and other objects can be accomplished by the provision of a coating tape comprising a film, and an inorganic layer including an inorganic material, a binder, and a plasticizer attached to one surface of the film.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The plasticizer may include at least one or more selected from the group consisting of dibutyl phthalate, propylene glycol, benzyl alcohol, n-butyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, diethyl phosphate, triethyl phosphate, trimethyl phosphate, tributyl phosphate, isoamyl acetate, ethyl lactate, methyl lactate, ethyl butylate, diethyl carbonate, tributyl orthopropionate, methyl amyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, diisobutyl ketone, methyl ethyl ketone, dipropyl ketone, ethyl butyl ketone, and methyl amyl ketone, and a mixture thereof.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The plasticizer may be greater than 17 parts by weight to less than 50 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the binder.

This is provided only for illustration of the present invention and should not be construed as limiting the scope of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The present invention relates to a coating tape comprising a film, and an inorganic layer including an inorganic material, a binder, and a plasticizer attached to one surface of the film.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Inorganic Material</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The inorganic material may be an inorganic material having a dielectric constant of 1 or more, an inorganic material having piezoelectricity, an inorganic material having lithium ion transfer ability, or a mixture of two or more thereof. It is preferable that the inorganic material is in a particle form.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Examples of the inorganic material having a dielectric constant of 1 or more may be SrTio<sub>3</sub>, SnO<sub>2</sub>, CeO<sub>2</sub>, MgO, NiO, CaO, ZnO, ZrO<sub>2</sub>, Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, TiO<sub>2</sub>, SiC or a mixture thereof, but the present invention is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The inorganic material having piezoelectricity means a material which is a nonconductor at normal pressure but, when a certain pressure is applied thereto, an internal structure is changed and thereby has conductivity. In particular, the inorganic material having piezoelectricity exhibits high dielectric constant characteristics having a dielectric constant of 100 or more and has a potential difference between both faces in which one face is charged by a positive charge and the other face is charged by a negative charge by electric charge generated when particles are tensioned or compressed by a certain pressure.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In a case in which the inorganic material having the above-mentioned characteristics is used, a short-circuit may occur in the positive electrode and the negative electrode, whereby the positive electrode and the negative electrode may not directly contact each other due to the inorganic material, and potential differences in particles may occur due to piezoelectricity of the inorganic material. Accordingly, electron migration, namely, fine current flow, is achieved between the positive electrode and the negative electrode, whereby voltage of the battery is gradually reduced, and therefore safety may be improved.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Examples of the inorganic material having piezoelectricity may be BaTiO<sub>3</sub>, Pb(Zr,Ti)O<sub>3 </sub>(PZT), Pb<sub>1&#x2212;x</sub>La<sub>x</sub>Zr<sub>1&#x2212;y</sub>Ti<sub>y</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>(PLZT), Pb(Mg<sub>1/3</sub>Nb<sub>2/3</sub>)O<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;PbTiO<sub>3 </sub>(PMN-PT), hafnia (HfO<sub>2</sub>), or a mixture thereof, but the present invention is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The inorganic material having lithium ion transfer ability indicates an inorganic material which contains lithium elements, does not save lithium, and transports lithium ions. The inorganic material having lithium ion transfer ability may transfer and transport lithium ions by a defect present in a particle structure. Consequently, lithium ionic conductivity in a battery is improved, and therefore battery performance can be improved.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Examples of the inorganic material having lithium ion transfer ability may be lithium phosphate (Li<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>), lithium titanium phosphate (Li<sub>x</sub>Ti<sub>y</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, where 0&#x3c;x&#x3c;2 and 0&#x3c;y&#x3c;3), lithium aluminum titanium phosphate (Li<sub>x</sub>Al<sub>y</sub>Ti<sub>z </sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, where 0&#x3c;x&#x3c;2, 0&#x3c;y&#x3c;1, and 0&#x3c;z&#x3c;3), (LiAlTiP)<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y</sub>-based glasses (where 0&#x3c;x&#x3c;4 and 0&#x3c;y&#x3c;13) such as 14Li<sub>2</sub>O-9Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-38TiO<sub>2</sub>-39P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, lithium lanthanum titanate (Li<sub>x</sub>La<sub>y</sub>TiO<sub>3</sub>, where 0&#x3c;x&#x3c;2 and 0&#x3c;y&#x3c;3), lithium germanium thiophosphate (Li<sub>x</sub>Ge<sub>y</sub>P<sub>z</sub>S<sub>w</sub>, where 0&#x3c;x&#x3c;4, 0&#x3c;y&#x3c;1, 0&#x3c;z&#x3c;1, and 0&#x3c;w&#x3c;5) such as Li<sub>3.25</sub>Ge<sub>0.25</sub>P<sub>0.75</sub>S<sub>4</sub>, lithium nitride (Li<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub>, where 0&#x3c;x&#x3c;4 and 0&#x3c;y&#x3c;2) such as Li<sub>3</sub>N, SiS<sub>2</sub>-based glass (Li<sub>x</sub>Si<sub>y</sub>S<sub>z</sub>, where 0&#x3c;x&#x3c;3, 0&#x3c;y&#x3c;2, and 0&#x3c;z&#x3c;4) such as Li<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4&#x2014;</sub>Li<sub>2</sub>S&#x2014;SiS<sub>2</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>S<sub>5</sub>-based glass (Li<sub>x</sub>P<sub>y</sub>S<sub>z</sub>, where 0&#x3c;x&#x3c;3, 0&#x3c;y&#x3c;3, and 0&#x3c;z&#x3c;7) such as LiI&#x2014;Li<sub>2</sub>S&#x2014;P<sub>2</sub>S<sub>5</sub>, or a mixture thereof, but the present invention is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">When the above-described high dielectric constant inorganic material, inorganic material having piezoelectricity, and inorganic material having lithium ion transfer ability are used together, the effects obtained through these ingredients may be further improved.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The size of each of the inorganic materials, which is in a particle form, is not particularly restricted. In order to form a coating layer having a uniform thickness and to achieve appropriate porosity, however, each of the inorganic materials may have a size of 0.001 &#x3bc;m to 10 &#x3bc;m. In the case in which the size of each of the inorganic materials is less than 0.001 &#x3bc;m, dispersibility is reduced, whereby it is difficult to exhibit a uniform insulation effect. In the case in which the size of each of the inorganic materials is greater than 10 &#x3bc;m, it is difficult to form a thin coating layer. In addition, a short circuit may easily occur in the battery when the battery is charged and discharged due to excessively large-sized pores.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Binder</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The binder is used to bind the inorganic material and make the inorganic layer have a certain degree of viscosity.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The binder used in the present invention may be a polymer commonly used in the formation of an inorganic layer coated on at least one surface of a porous substrate used as a separator in the art. In particular, the binder may use a polymer having a glass transition temperature (Tg) of &#x2212;200&#xb0; C. to 200&#xb0; C. so as to improve the mechanical properties such as flexibility and elasticity of the inorganic layer finally formed. Such a binder serves to connect and fix stably inorganic materials therebetween, thereby preventing the mechanical property of the inorganic layer from being reduced.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Also, the binder is not necessarily required to have ionic conductivity, however, a polymer having ionic conductivity may be used to improve the performances of electrochemical devices. Accordingly, the binder used in the present invention preferably includes one having a high dielectric constant. Actually, the degree of dissociation of a salt in an electrolyte solution depends on a dielectric constant of the electrolyte solution. Therefore, as the dielectric constant of the polymer is higher, the degree of dissociation of a salt in an electrolyte solution increases. In this regard, in the present invention, the binder may have a dielectric constant of 1.0 to 100 (measuring frequency=1 kHz), preferably 10 or higher.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In addition, the binder may be gelatinized when impregnated with a liquid electrolyte solution to exhibit a high degree of swelling in an electrolyte solution. In this regard, it is preferred that the binder polymer has a solubility parameter of 15 to 45 MPa<sup>1/2</sup>, 15 to 25 MPa<sup>1/2</sup>, or 30 to 45 MPa<sup>1/2</sup>. Accordingly, a hydrophilic polymer having many polar groups is favorably used as compared to a hydrophobic polymer such as polyolefine. When the solubility parameter of the polymer is less than 15 MPa<sup>1/2 </sup>or higher than 45 MPa<sup>1/2</sup>, the polymer is difficult to be swelled by a conventional liquid electrolyte solution for a battery.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Non-limiting examples of the binder may be any one selected from the group consisting of polyvinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropylene, polyvinylidene fluoride-trichloroethylene, polymethylmethacrylate, polybutylacrylate, polyacrylonitrile, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinylacetate, polyethylene-co-vinylacetate, polyethyleneoxide, polyarylate, cellulose acetate, cellulose acetate butyrate, cellulose acetate propionate, cyanoethylpullulan, cyanoethylpolyvinylalcohol, cyanoethylcellulose, cyanoethylsucrose, pullulan, carboxymethylcellulose, and tannic acid, or a mixture of two or more thereof.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Preparation of Inorganic Layer</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The weight ratio of the inorganic material and the binder may range from 1:1 to 99:1, from 60:40 to 90:10, or from 70:30 to 80:20.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In the inorganic layer, the binder allows the adhesion of inorganic materials so that the inorganic materials can be bound with each other. Also, the inorganic layer comes in contact with the porous substrate by the binder. In the inorganic layer, the inorganic materials are substantially present in contact with each other to form a closest packed structure, and an interstitial volume generated from the contact of the inorganic materials with each other becomes a pore of the inorganic layer.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The pores of the inorganic layer are a space formed by the inorganic materials that are in contact with each other in a closed packed or densely packed structure of the inorganic materials. Through the pores of the inorganic layer, it is possible to provide a channel for movement of lithium ions.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Plasticizer</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">A plasticizer is used to give flexibility to the inorganic layer and prevent cracking or tearing in the inorganic layer after drying.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Non-limiting examples of the plasticizer may be at least one or more selected from the group consisting of dibutyl phthalate, propylene glycol, benzyl alcohol, n-butyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, diethyl phosphate, triethyl phosphate, trimethyl phosphate, tributyl phosphate, isoamyl acetate, ethyl lactate, methyl lactate, ethyl butylate, diethyl carbonate, tributyl orthopropionate, methyl amyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, diisobutyl ketone, methyl ethyl ketone, dipropyl ketone, ethyl butyl ketone, and methyl amyl ketone, and a mixture thereof.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The plasticizer may be greater than 17 parts by weight to less than 50 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the binder. In the case in which the plasticizer is 17 parts by weight or less based on 100 parts by weight of the binder, the inorganic layer may be hardened and cracks may occur, or the inorganic layer may be torn when the inorganic layer is attached using a coating tape. In the case in which the plasticizer is 50 parts by weight or more based on 100 parts by weight of the binder, the amount of the binder is reduced in the total weight of the inorganic layer, thereby sufficient adhesion cannot be obtained. As a result, the inorganic layer cannot be attached to the electrode when the inorganic layer is attached using a coating tape.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In addition, when there is too much plasticizer, the plasticizer itself acts as a resistance, which may deteriorate battery performance.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">More preferably, the plasticizer may be greater than 22 parts by weight and less than 40 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the binder. In the case in which the plasticizer is 22 parts by weight or less based on 100 parts by weight of the binder, since the ratio of plasticizer is low, it is not possible to prevent cracks in the inorganic layer or a phenomenon in which a portion of the inorganic layer is damaged when attached using a coating tape, thereby resulting in a fire due to overcharging. In the case in which the plasticizer is 40 parts by weight or more based on 100 parts by weight of the binder, the plasticizer acts as a resistance, which may deteriorate battery performance.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The weight average molecular weight of the plasticizer may be 350 g/mol to 10000 g/mol. In the case in which the weight average molecular weight is less than 350 g/mol, there may be a problem in that the inorganic layer does not obtain adhesion that can be attached to the electrode. In the case in which the weight average molecular weight is greater than 10000 g/mol, there may be a problem in that the plasticizer may be biased towards one portion. The higher the molecular weight, the better the adhesion and electrical insulation, and the lower the volatility. Therefore, within the above range, it is possible to select a plasticizer capable of exhibiting appropriate adhesion, electrical insulation, and desired air permeability and porosity.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">By adding the plasticizer as described above, the inorganic layer can be directly attached to the electrode without causing cracks when attached using a coating tape. In order for the inorganic layer to be attached to one surface of the electrode, the adhesion between the inorganic layer and the electrode must be 20 gf/cm or more. In order to use the inorganic layer as a coating tape used by removing the inorganic layer from the film, it is preferable that the inorganic layer has adhesion that is easily peeled off the film. Therefore, it is preferable that the adhesion between the inorganic layer and the film is less than the adhesion between the inorganic layer and the electrode.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Additive</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The inorganic layer according to the present invention may include an additive other than the inorganic material, the binder, and the plasticizer. The additive is a material which is essentially or additionally required for the improvement of the operation and performances of an electrochemical device, and may be applied without any particular limitation if it requires a continuous supplement due to its consumption during the operation of the electrochemical device.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Non-limiting examples of the additive may be an additive for inhibiting a side reaction occurring in a battery, an additive for improving thermal stability, an additive for inhibiting overcharging, a dispersant, and a mixture of two or more thereof.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">As the additive for inhibiting a side reaction occurring in a battery, at least one selected from the group consisting of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, tetramethylethylenediamine, pyridine, dipyridyl, ethylbis(diphenylphosphine), butyronitrile, succinonitrile, iodine, ammonium halide, and a derivative thereof, or a mixture of two or more thereof may be used, but the present invention is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">As the additive for improving thermal stability, at least one selected from the group consisting of hexamethyldisiloxane, hexamethoxycyclotriphosphazene, hexamethylphosphoramide, cyclohexylbenzene, biphenyl, dimethylpyrrole, and a derivative thereof, or a mixture of two or more thereof may be used, but the present invention is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">An example of an additive for improving thermal stability may be a flame retardant. The flame retardant may include a phosphor-based or inorganic-based flame retardant, and may further include a flame retardant synergist capable of improving a flame retardant effect in addition to the flame retardant.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">As the additive for inhibiting overcharging, at least one selected from the group consisting of n-butyl ferrocene, a halogen-substituted benzene derivative, cyclohexylbenzene, and biphenyl, or a mixture of two or more thereof may be used, but the present invention is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The dispersant is not limited as long as it is a material that improves dispersibility and maintains uniform dispersion. However, it is preferable that the dispersant is a material having high dispersibility. For example, an anionic surfactant may be used. The anionic surfactant may be a component in which an anionic component containing one or more salts selected from the group consisting of carboxylate, phosphate, sulfonate, and sulfate constitutes a head portion. In addition, examples of substances that can be used as a dispersant may be any one or more selected from oil-soluble polyamines, oil-soluble amine compounds, fatty acids, fatty alcohols, sorbitan fatty acid esters, tannic acid, tannic acid, and pyrogallic acid.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Coating Tape</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The coating tape according to the present invention can be used in the form of a tape by applying an inorganic layer to a film. The inorganic layer is attached to the film similar to a double-sided adhesive tape before being attached to the electrode. For this purpose, it is preferable that the adhesion between the inorganic layer attachment surface of the film and the inorganic layer itself is greater than the weight of the inorganic layer and lower than the adhesion between the inorganic layer itself and the electrode.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The coating tape can be rolled into a circular shape and stored, and then used by hanging it on a roll when used. Alternatively, the coating tape may take a form that can be used by placing a separate film on a film cut to a specific size and an inorganic layer so as to cover an exposed surface of the inorganic layer and then removing it.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">As described above, when the coating tape is rolled into a circular shape and stored or the film is used by removing it, the film may be a release film having different adhesion on both surfaces. When the release film is used in a state in which the coating tape is laminated in multiple layers, the adhesion between the inorganic layer and the attachment surface may be equal to or lower than the adhesion of the other surface for ease of use.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The film may use any material as long as it has a low surface roughness and can be easily peeled so that no residue remains when the inorganic layer is peeled off. Examples of the film may include a synthetic resin film such as polyethylene, polypropylene, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer, and polyethylene terephthalate, a metal foil, and the like.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The film may be coated or surface-treated at least on the inorganic layer attachment surface so that no residue of the inorganic layer remains. Examples of the surface treatment include a plasma treatment, a surface modification treatment such as a sulfonation treatment, or a peel treatment such as a silicon treatment, a long cyclic alkyl treatment, and a fluorine treatment.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The film may use a material that evaporates by heat treatment, ultraviolet irradiation, or solution treatment.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The present invention provides a method of manufacturing a coating tape, the method including 1) preparing an inorganic slurry by mixing a solvent with an inorganic layer composition comprising an inorganic material, a binder, and a plasticizer; 2) applying the inorganic slurry of step 1) to a film; and 3) drying the inorganic slurry applied in step 2) to form an inorganic layer.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The inorganic material, the binder, the plasticizer, and the mixing ratio thereof and the film are as described above.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">As the solvent, a conventional solvent known in the art may be used without limitation. Non-limiting examples of solvents include acetone, tetrahydrofuran, methylene chloride, chloroform, dimethylformamide, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), cyclohexane, water, and a mixture thereof.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">In the drying step, an oven or a heated chamber may be used in a temperature range in consideration of a vapor-pressure of the solvent. Alternatively, a method of allowing the solvent to volatilize by leaving the inorganic slurry at room temperature is also possible. At this time, a temperature condition of 25&#xb0; C. to 100&#xb0; C. for the temperature range and a condition of a relative humidity of 40% or more may be taken into consideration.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">A step of uniformly controlling the amount of the inorganic slurry applied may be further included between step 2) and step 3).</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">In the step of uniformly controlling the amount of the inorganic slurry applied, it may be uniformly controlled using a roll. Alternatively, a method of cutting the applied surface using a blade may also be used. In addition, a method of placing a film in a container having a desired size, applying a slurry, and then pressing a surface to fit the container may also be used.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">In step 2), the inorganic slurry may have a higher binder content in an electrode contact surface than in other portions. By increasing the binder content, it is possible to improve adhesion to an electrode without adding a separate binder.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The coating tape according to the present invention may have adhesion even after drying in step 3). This is because the inorganic layer is formed by mixing the plasticizer in the binder at a ratio of more than 22 parts by weight and less than 40 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the binder. The coating tape, which maintains adhesion even after drying as described above, may be applied directly to the electrode without adding a separate binder.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Manufacture of an Electrode</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">A method of manufacturing an electrode according to the present invention may include 1) supporting the coating tape according to the above description on a roll or pressing the coating tape by using a roll, so that the inorganic layer contacts the electrode; and 2) removing the film after applying the inorganic layer of the coating tape to the electrode.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">The electrode may be a negative electrode or a positive electrode.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">The positive electrode may be manufactured by, for example, applying a positive electrode mixture, in which a positive electrode active material consisting of positive electrode active material particles, a conductive agent, and a binder are mixed, on a positive electrode current collector. As needed, a filler may be further added to the positive electrode mixture.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In general, the positive electrode current collector is manufactured so as to have a thickness of 3 &#x3bc;m to 500 &#x3bc;m. The positive electrode current collector is not particularly restricted, as long as the positive electrode current collector exhibits high conductivity while the positive electrode current collector does not induce any chemical change in a battery to which the positive electrode current collector is applied. For example, the positive electrode current collector may be made of one selected from stainless steel, aluminum, nickel, and titanium.
