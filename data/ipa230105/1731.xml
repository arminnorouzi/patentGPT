Boxes, bags, glues, seals . . . all these single-use items generate significant amounts of waste and pollutants. A confluence of current trends and needs are driving consumers raise their awareness of the amount of waste they generate. Consequently, there is a need for reusable containers that can be assembled cleanly and simply and that do not require the use of glues or other additional components. Pursuant to the above, the use of articles that generate zero residues is necessary to reduce the waste generated by consumption of single-use containers, thus refraining from contributing to increased environmental pollution.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present disclosure provides a bookmark card that shifts between a collapsed or dismantled bookmark card configuration and a upright display configuration for small gift articles to address the aforesaid problems.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The following is the technical solution that the present invention proposes to solve the problems mentioned above:</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A bookmark card and a display case that includes a flat cardboard main body punched into a shape that defines various sections by means of creases and a decorative upper part. The sections are folded along predefined creases for assembly of a display case for presentation of small articles.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The bookmark card and display case are composed of 4 lower and 1 upper sections. The lower sections are those configured to form the structural base of the display case.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The bookmark card and display case is provided with 2 holes in the lower sections at opposite ends that are connected to each other by inserting the article to be presented. Both the components&#x2014;the structure and the article to be presented&#x2014;are thus secured.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The bookmark card and display case is configured with an upper section as a variable decorative component, visible as a promotional claim panel and decorative support both in the upright display case configuration and the collapsed or dismantled bookmark configuration. In this latter configuration, said upper part is the section that protrudes to mark the place in the book.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The bookmark card and display case does not require the use of adhesives for assembly.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The bookmark card and display case, in which the card body is made of sufficiently thick cardboard to provide the appropriate rigidity to the display case.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The following are the advantages of the present disclosure compared to the state of the art:</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Due to its dual configuration, the bookmark card and display case provides retailers and consumers with two items in one. It is provided in the collapsed configuration for shipment and, once received by the retailers and/or consumers, is folded appropriately and the assembled case is used to present small articles. When the end consumer receives the display case with the presented article and removes it, the configuration returns to its unfolded form as a bookmark card. Thus the final consumer obtains two articles in one and avoids generating unnecessary waste.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The embodiments of the present invention further include an assembly method by folding sections that form the walls of the display case and openings that connect the sections. By inserting the article to be presented, the display case is assembled without requiring the use of glues or other kinds of adhesive, thus simplifying assembly for retailers and consumers. Consequently, the invention prevents unnecessary production of waste. The following are brief descriptions of the drawings in the description of the embodiments in order to more clearly illustrate the technical solutions of the present disclosure.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an unfolded front view of Embodiment 1 of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective view of the folding process of Embodiment 1 of the present description.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a front view of the display case in its upright position ready to receive the article and complete assembly of Embodiment 1 of the present description.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a perspective view of the display case in the upright position for receiving the article and completing assembly of Embodiment 1 of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a side view of the display case receiving the article and being assembled as Embodiment 1 of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is an unfolded front view of Embodiment 2 of the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Detailed embodiments of the present invention are described herein.
