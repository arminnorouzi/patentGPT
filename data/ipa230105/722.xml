The prior art is presented below:</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">International patent application WO 2018/065081 discloses a method for the production of pharmaceutical tablets, in which tablet compacts are pressed and provided with a coating, wherein the tablet compacts are stored in an intermediate storage device for a product-specific curing time before they are provided with the coating, and thereafter are automatically removed from the intermediate storage device for further processing, wherein a system controller in which the product-specific curing times can be stored or are stored registers the time at which the tablet compacts are introduced into the intermediate storage device and, after the product-specific curing time has expired, initiates the automatic removal of the tablet compacts, and also discloses a system for producing pharmaceutical tablets, having at least one tablet press, having at least one coater which is downstream of the tablet press and which provides the tablet compacts formed in the tablet press with a coating, wherein the system has containers that are configured to receive the pressed tablets that are discharged from the tablet press, the system comprises an intermediate storage device with at least two storage locations, the system has a handling system that brings containers into the intermediate storage device and removes them from the intermediate storage device, and the system comprises a system controller which controls the handling system, wherein product-specific curing times can be stored or are stored in the system controller, and the system controller detects the contents of a container, the storage space assigned to a container in the intermediate storage device, and the start of the curing time and, after the curing time has elapsed, activates the handling system to remove the corresponding container from the intermediate storage device and convey it for further processing.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">European patent EP 2 427166 B1 discloses a method for the production of tablets, and a module for the production of tablets which is suitable for carrying out the method, the module having at least one inlet for an active pharmaceutical ingredient, at least one inlet for an excipient, at least one mixing unit, a tablet press, and at least one discharge for tablets, wherein the inlets are in fluid communication with an inlet of the at least one mixing unit, a discharge of the at least one mixing unit is in fluid communication with an inlet of the tablet press, and a discharge of the tablet press is in fluid communication with the tablet discharge, characterised in that the module is enclosed, in that at least one analysis sensor is provided, the at least one analysis sensor being positioned to analyse the content or properties upstream of the tablet press, and in that the inlets comprise a detachable active pharmaceutical ingredient inlet line and a detachable excipient inlet line, and the discharge comprises a detachable tablet discharge port, such that the respective inlet lines and discharge port are generally closed, but&#x2014;to allow for the insertion of the API and the excipients into the module and/or the removal of tablets from the module&#x2014;can be opened, wherein the detachable inlet lines are in fluid communication with the inlet of the mixing unit, and the discharge of the tablet press is in fluid communication with the detachable tablet discharge port.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The technical solutions mentioned in the prior art for producing tablets have the disadvantage that they have long transfer times for the preparation of the dosage-form bulk material. In addition, in conventional manufacturing processes for dosage-form bulk materials, the individual handling processes between the process stations in the system are not connected, nor are they modular and correspondingly automated.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The object of the invention is therefore to provide both a modular system and a method for producing dosage-form bulk material comprising a modular system, wherein the transfer times of the dosage-form bulk material are shortened by the reduction of vertical and horizontal handling technology for the transport, and wherein the handling of dosage-form bulk material being processed is reduced.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">This object is achieved with a modular system of the type mentioned at the outset in that, of the process stations, one process station is designed as a feed station, one process station is designed as a mixing or granulating station for carrying out a mixing process with regard to the dosage-form bulk material, and one process station is designed as a discharge station, and in that the modular system has an electronic system control device which controls each handling system, wherein process data for controlling each handling system can be stored or is stored in the system control device, which process data define a specific method for the production of dosage-form bulk material, wherein carrying out this method results in at least one container being moved between a plurality of process stations by means of at least one handling system. Individual pieces of equipment that work in batches are advantageously connected to each other by the modular system in such a way that the method carried out on the modular system runs fully automatically. As a result, a quasi-continuous process is thus provided.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A further advantage is that the handling system enables both horizontal and vertical transport, and/or both horizontal and vertical handling of the containers. The horizontal and/or vertical movement in this case can be carried out in particular as a movement that is executed sequentially, or as a movement that is superimposed in time.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The feed station is preferably designed as a container feed station, and/or as a container filling station. More preferably, the discharge station is designed as a container discharge station and/or as a container emptying station. Empty or already-filled containers are fed to the modular system in the container feed station, while empty or filled containers are removed from the modular system in the container discharge station. In the container filling station, an empty or already-filled container is filled with dosage-form bulk material, whereas a container filled with dosage-form bulk material is emptied in the container emptying station.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Pharmaceutical active ingredients and/or excipients are referred to as dosage-form bulk material. Dosage-form bulk material is usually in the form of a powder, granules, tablets, pellets, coated tablets, or capsules, in particular soft gelatine capsules or hard gelatine capsules.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to an advantageous refinement of the modular system, the feed station and the discharge station are designed in the form of a structural unit as one process station. This further reduces the space requirement of the modular system.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The preferred modular system for producing dosage-form bulk material has the advantage that the at least one handling system reduces complex vertical and horizontal handling technology, on the one hand, and shortens transfer times between the basic operations which must run at the individual process stations, on the other hand. In addition, the investment and maintenance costs for the handling technology installed in the modular system, and for process equipment, as well as the associated supply systems, are reduced. Unmanned operation, i.e., fully automated operation, of the modular system is also feasible.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to a preferred embodiment, the modular system has at least one processing unit, which has a process station designed as a container filling unit and/or a granulating station and/or a sieving station and/or a detection station for determining a quantity of the dosage-form bulk material based on the number of pieces or the weight thereof, and/or a drying station and/or an analysis station and/or a forming station and/or a sorting station and/or an inspection station and/or a control station and/or a storage station and/or a coating station and/or a tool changing station and/or a container cleaning station. The granulating station can also be designed as a mixing station, or can be designed as a structural unit together with the mixing station. The advantage in this regard is that various basic operations, such as granulating, drying, forming, weighing, mixing, etc., can be carried out with the modular system, and this means that both the modular system and the method for producing dosage-form bulk materials can be expanded and configured in a very flexible manner.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The at least one processing unit preferably has the process station designed as a container feed station and the process station which is suitable as a mixing station or granulating station for carrying out a mixing or granulation process with regard to the dosage-form bulk material. Such a configuration reduces the space taken up by the modular system, which is advantageous when converting existing systems, or building new systems. In addition, the modular system is designed as a very compact system, and the transfer times of the dosage-form bulk material during transport and handling are correspondingly shortened.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In this regard, the at least one processing unit advantageously has the process station designed as a forming station. The forming station can be, for example, a tablet press, a capsule filling station, or some other manner of filling station. The process of forming the dosage-form bulk material that is carried out in the forming station includes, for example, pressing tablets or filling capsules or filling pouches (bag filling) of the loose dosage-form bulk material.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to an additional advantageous refinement of the modular system, the at least one processing unit has a plurality of handling systems. As a result, the modular system can be expanded as required, for example with a plurality of handling systems in one processing unit. Because the handling systems work in parallel, the process sequences can be divided between the individual handling systems and can therefore be optimised, for example with regard to the time required to carry out the process.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to a preferred embodiment variant of the modular system, the at least one handling system is arranged in a central area of the processing unit, and the plurality of process stations is arranged around the central area. As a result, the space required for the modular system is reduced, and the media supply costs required therefor are reduced. In this regard, the plurality of process stations is preferably arranged in a substantially circular arc-shaped line around the central area. Such an arrangement of the plurality of process stations further reduces the space required, and thus reduces the media supply costs required therefor, and also shortens the transfer times and paths between the individual process stations.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to a further advantageous refinement of the modular system, the modular system has a plurality of processing units. This makes it possible, for example, to assign a basic operation, such as mixing, granulating, forming, coating, etc., to the individual processing units of the modular system. Furthermore, it is possible to expand the modular system in almost any way.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In this regard, at least two processing units of the modular system form a pair of processing units, wherein the pair of processing units has a process station which can be assigned to each of the processing units forming the pair of processing units. This makes it possible to connect or interconnect processing units with each other.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In addition, the process station that can be assigned to each of the processing units forming the pair of processing units is preferably designed as a container transfer station, the same being designed as a container removal station for the processing unit delivering the container and as a container feed station for the processing unit receiving the container. Such a design of the modular system establishes a connection between the processing units by means of a process station designed as a container transfer station at which a container of one processing unit can be transferred to another processing unit.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Also preferably, a processing unit chain can be formed or is formed by at least two pairs of processing units.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In this regard, the at least one processing unit has a plurality of process stations designed as container filling stations. Due to this advantageous embodiment, the containers can be filled with different dosage-form bulk material.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to an advantageous refinement of the modular system, at least one container and/or at least one process station comprises a normally closed connecting system, which can be opened or is opened for a dosage-form bulk material transfer. The connecting system is configured to connect, for example, two containers, or one container and a process station, with each other in such a way that during the transfer of dosage-form bulk material, the requirements for the degree of containment of the modular system during the filling or emptying of dosage-form bulk material into or out of the container and into or out of the process station are met. For example, absolutely reliable docking devices from the Glatt SKS or TKS containment valve system series can be used as the connecting system. The TKS containment valve system with two identical static seals guarantees a contamination-free dosage-form bulk material transfer. It enables dust-free product transfer even with substances with high OEL or OEB requirements, and also with requirements in the nanogram range. The intelligent valve technology ensures maximum safety for the product, people and the environment. The abbreviations OEL and OEB stand for &#x201c;Occupational Exposure Band&#x201d; and &#x201c;Occupational Exposure Limit&#x201d;, and provide information about the risk potential of a substance. The OEB value describes the toxicology of the pure dosage-form bulk material, while the OEL expresses the average exposure to the concentration of the active ingredient during an 8-hour shift for personnel.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The modular system has a degree of confinement below 5000 &#x3bc;g/m<sup>3</sup>, preferably below 1000 &#x3bc;g/m<sup>3</sup>, more preferably below 100 &#x3bc;g/m<sup>3</sup>, particularly preferably below 10 &#x3bc;g/m<sup>3</sup>, very particularly preferably below 1 &#x3bc;g/m<sup>3</sup>, and most preferably below 10 ng/m<sup>3</sup>. This serves to ensure the safety of dosage-form bulk material; the required degree of containment is advantageous for people and the environment. The SMEPAC test, for example, is used for the measurement, and the measurements are only carried out on each installed connecting system.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In addition, the modular system comprises a process station designed as a storage station, and has an electronic storage control device, wherein storage times specific to the dosage-form bulk material can be or are stored in the storage control device, the storage control device can record the start time of the storage of the at least one container filled with the dosage-form bulk material in the storage station, and, after the storage time has elapsed, can initiate the further processing of the at least one container filled with the dosage-form bulk material. By storing the dosage-form bulk material in the process station designed as a storage station, the dosage-form bulk material is stabilized during the storage period, such that the subsequent further processing can be carried out in an optimal manner. For example, dosage-form bulk material in the form of tablets has to harden, with the tablets growing or shrinking in their physical size. After the storage time which is specific to the dosage-form bulk material, in the storage station, a coating process can then be carried out in the coating station, for example, without the coating produced being adversely affected by the aforementioned expansion processes.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In this regard, the storage control device is designed as part of the system control device. This has the advantage that the investment costs can be reduced as a result.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to an advantageous refinement of the modular system, at least one process station has a sensor, preferably an analytical sensor. The substance properties of the dosage-form bulk material can be determined in the processing station by means of the analytical sensor, for example. For example, an analytical sensor can analyse the homogeneity of the mixture in the process station designed as a mixing station.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In addition, the object is achieved with a method of the type mentioned at the outset, in that, of the process stations, one process station is designed as a feed station, one process station is designed as a mixing or granulating station for carrying out a mixing or granulating procedure with regard to the dosage-form bulk material, and one process station is designed as a removal station, and in that the modular system has an electronic system control device that controls each handling system, with process data for controlling each handling system being stored in the system control device, which process data define a specific method for the production of dosage-form bulk material, during the execution of which at least one container is moved by means of at least one handling system between a plurality of process stations.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to a further preferred method, the modular system comprises a container filling station, the container being filled with dosage-form bulk material in the at least one container filling station.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The modular system preferably comprises a forming station, and the dosage-form bulk material located in the at least one container is mixed in the mixing station before it is formed in the forming station.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Advantageously, according to a refinement of the preferred method, the modular system comprises a dosage form coating station in which the dosage-form bulk material is coated.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">According to an additional advantageous refinement of the method, the modular system includes a storage station in which the dosage-form bulk material is stored. In this regard, the storage station has a storage control device, wherein dosage-form-specific storage times are stored in the storage control device, and wherein the storage control device records the start time of storage of the at least one container filled with dosage-form bulk material and, after the storage time has elapsed, triggers the further processing of the at least one container filled with dosage-form bulk material. By storing the dosage-form bulk material in the process station designed as a storage station, the dosage-form bulk material is stabilized during the storage period, such that the subsequent further processing can be carried out in an optimal manner. For example, dosage-form bulk material in the form of tablets has to harden, with the tablets growing or shrinking in their physical size.

To ensure safety for the dosage-form bulk material, people and the environment, the modular system <b>1</b> or its system components have a degree of confinement below 5000 &#x3bc;g/m<sup>3</sup>, preferably below 1000 &#x3bc;g/m<sup>3</sup>, more preferably below 100 &#x3bc;g/m<sup>3</sup>, particularly preferably below 10 &#x3bc;g/m<sup>3</sup>, very particularly preferably below 1 &#x3bc;g/m<sup>3</sup>, most preferably below 10 ng/m<sup>3</sup>, based on the dust emerging from the modular system <b>1</b>, in particular the active ingredient dust.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The modular system <b>1</b> according to the first example of an embodiment comprises a processing unit <b>2</b> with two process stations <b>3</b> and a handling system <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The handling system <b>4</b> is arranged in a central area <b>5</b> of the processing unit <b>2</b>, with the process stations <b>3</b> being arranged substantially on a circular arc-shaped line <b>6</b> around the central area <b>5</b>. The handling system <b>4</b> enables both horizontal and vertical transport or both horizontal and vertical handling of the containers <b>9</b>. The horizontal and/or vertical movement in this case can be carried out in particular as a movement that is executed sequentially, or as a movement that is superimposed in time.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In an embodiment that is not shown, the handling system is designed as an industrial robot arranged on a lifting column. As a result, a linear movement in the vertical direction can be carried out by the lifting column, which enables a simple, fast and yet very precise movement. The lifting column has a platform which can be rotated about a vertical lifting axis and on which the industrial robot is arranged. This makes it possible to move the industrial robot linearly in the vertical direction, and thus to arrange it in different height positions for the corresponding method steps and processes.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In an embodiment that is not shown, the industrial robot has a lifting column that performs a linear movement in the vertical direction, and/or a transport device, for example in the form of a carriage, that performs a linear movement in the horizontal direction.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The process station <b>3</b><i>a </i>is designed as a single unit with a feed station <b>7</b> and a discharge station <b>8</b> for a container <b>9</b> which is suitable for receiving dosage-form bulk material. In the first example of an embodiment, the feed station <b>7</b> is therefore referred to as the container feed station <b>10</b>, and the discharge station <b>8</b> is referred to as the container discharge station <b>11</b>. The process station <b>3</b><i>b </i>is designed as a mixing station <b>12</b> for carrying out a mixing procedure with respect to the dosage-form bulk material.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The container <b>9</b> and mixing station <b>12</b> each comprise a connecting system <b>13</b>. The connecting system <b>13</b> is configured to connect two containers <b>9</b> or one container <b>9</b> and a process station <b>3</b><i>b </i>designed as a mixing station <b>12</b> with each other in such a way that the requirements for the degree of containment of the modular system <b>1</b> or its system components during a dosage-form bulk material transfer from the container <b>9</b> to the process station <b>3</b><i>b </i>designed as a mixing station <b>12</b>, or vice versa, are met. The connecting system <b>13</b> is closed in the non-connected state and is opened in the connected, coupled state for dosage-form bulk material transfer. The connecting system <b>13</b> thus ensures that the people operating the modular system <b>1</b> are protected from exposure to dosage-form bulk material. Valve systems from the SKS or TKS valve series from Glatt GmbH, for example, are preferably used as the connecting system <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In addition, the mixing unit <b>12</b> has a sampling device <b>14</b>. Dosage-form bulk material samples can be taken from the mixing unit <b>12</b> by means of the sampling device <b>14</b>, and are then analysed with regard to their homogeneity, for example in a laboratory.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In addition, the mixing station <b>12</b> comprises a sensor <b>15</b>, preferably an analytical sensor.
