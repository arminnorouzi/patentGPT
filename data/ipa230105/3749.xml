In certain embodiments, when the detection device determines that the first substance is present in the first sample, and further, the second substance is present in the second sample, the detection device generates an indication or a signal associated with the confirmation of target substance presence in the sample source of the person. In certain embodiments, the first and the second samples are different samples such as oral fluid and exhaled breath. In certain embodiments, the first and the second samples are the same type of samples such as oral fluid or exhaled breath.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In certain embodiments, the detection device is programmed to analyze the first sample and the second sample concurrently.
