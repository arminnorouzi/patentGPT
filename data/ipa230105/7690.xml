This restriction is imposed by the state of the art in radio technology, which, due to limitations in isolation capabilities of hardware, has necessitated that a radio on a particular frequency band only either transmit or receive at a particular time instant. In practice, this may be accommodated using either Frequency Division Duplex (FDD), or Time Division Duplex (TDD) transmission schemes wherein as noted, separation of transmitted and received signals are accomplished using either frequency or time. Due to advances in self-interference cancelation techniques (both hardware and software) in recent years, the feasibility of full-duplex at the physical layer has been demonstrated. However, at a given device, interference from a primary transmission may hinder the reception of a secondary transmission from another device. Thus, it would be desirable to have a full-duplex opportunity discovery mechanism and corresponding full-duplex transmission set up procedures.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Methods and apparatuses are described herein for full-duplex transmission opportunity discovery and transmission in a wireless 802.11 network.

In the example of 802.11ah, the primary channel may be 1 MHz wide for STAs (e.g., MTC type devices) that support (e.g., only support) a 1 MHz mode, even if the AP, and other STAs in the BSS support 2 MHz, 4 MHz, 8 MHz, 16 MHz, and/or other channel bandwidth operating modes. Carrier sensing and/or Network Allocation Vector (NAV) settings may depend on the status of the primary channel. If the primary channel is busy, for example, due to a STA (which supports only a 1 MHz operating mode), transmitting to the AP, the entire available frequency bands may be considered busy even though a majority of the frequency bands remains idle and may be available.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In the United States, the available frequency bands, which may be used by 802.11ah, are from 902 MHz to 928 MHz.

As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, an FDW WTRU may comprise at least three functional hardware/software groupings: (1) antenna isolation; (2) analog cancellation; and (3) digital cancellation. It may be noted that each of these functions aim to provide a specific degree of transmission and reception isolation/cancellation with a unique set of design constraints and limitations.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The antenna isolation function may provide 25 to 40 dB of isolation between transmit and receive signal paths. The analog cancellation function may provide an additional 25 to 30 dB of isolation. Lastly, the digital cancellation function may provide a further 10 to 25 dB of isolation. Using the combination of these functions, an FDW WTRU may provide up to 80 dB of isolation between the transmit and receive signal paths. This may be considered to be the minimum necessary for a practical FDW WTRU.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, to facilitate full-duplex transmission (that is to say, simultaneous transmission and reception), the first step may be antenna isolation of the transmit and receive antennas (shown collectively as antenna <b>200</b>). Isolation may be accomplished using a number of different approaches such as physical alignment, location, phase cancellation, isolation using a circulator, or the like. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a circulator <b>210</b>, but this is exemplary and one skilled in the art will recognize that multiple ways of achieving antenna isolation may be used here. Using these methods for antenna isolation may approximately provide 30 dB of isolation.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the analog cancellation function may address interference that is created by the transmit path that affects the receive path. This may be accomplished through the use of a cancellation signal that is applied to the receive signal. Examples of analog cancellation may include, but are not limited to: (1) use of a balun for coupling of a portion of the transmit signal and inverted prior to cancellation in the receive path; (2) use of an analog cancellation circuit to actively adjust the cancellation signal; and (3) use of a branch line coupler to facilitate analog cancellation. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an analog cancellation circuit <b>220</b> that is configured to perform any and/or all of the above mentioned procedures to achieve analog cancelation.

As described above, digital cancellation may provide 10 to 25 dB of isolation. However, this may not be sufficient without other elements of signal cancellation. The consequence of quantization limitations for broadband digital converter technologies may be one reason it is difficult to achieve a higher degree of digital cancellation.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The digital cancellation function may include two components: circuitry configured to estimate the self-interference of the received waveform, and circuitry configured to use the channel estimate on the known transmit signal to generate digital reference samples for subtraction from the received signal. Since the quality of digital cancellation may depend on the quality of channel estimation, if the FDW WTRU is implemented in a WLAN system, channel estimation may be particularly prone to interference due to other WTRUs that cause interference during the training period of the reception. A potential solution to this problem is the use an interference-free period for channel estimation via a carrier sense mechanism.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In order to implement a FDW WTRU, a full-duplex medium access control (MAC) design that supports full-duplex operation in WLAN networks is needed.

The centralized medium access mechanism may be controlled by an AP and operated in a 3-step cycle. For example, at a first step, the AP may collect information about data-length and interference relationships from WTRUs. At a second step, the AP may broadcast the scheduling decision packet and initiate data transmissions. At a third step, the WTRUs may send ACKs in a predefined order embedded in the scheduling decision packet.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In order to maximize spectrum utilization, in-band full-duplex may be considered for IEEE 802.11ax. Examples of high level designs for in-band full-duplex MAC may include, but are not limited to: (1) adding an STR preamble to support in-band full-duplex; (2) including a partial association identifier (AID) in the very high throughput signal A1 (VHT-SIGA1) field indicating a recipient of PPDU; (3) group ID/partial AID of a second WTRU indicating that the second WTRU should also transmit; (4) requirement that a second WTRU end PPDU transmission before the L_LENGTH duration; (5) in band STR capable AP that can transmit and receive ACK simultaneously; and (6) a WTRU sending feedback of the WTRU transmit buffer status to an AP to assist the AP in scheduling UL transmissions.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates an example of interference that may exist in full-duplex operation.

AP <b>510</b> performs self-interference cancellation so that it can receive the primary transmission while simultaneously transmitting the secondary transmission. However, interference from the primary transmission may hinder the reception of the secondary transmission by the second WTRU <b>530</b>. Thus, in order to support full-duplex operation in WLAN, it is desirable to design a full-duplex opportunity discovery mechanism and corresponding full-duplex transmission set up procedure such that the transmitter (WTRU) of a primary transmission will not cause interference to a receiver (WTRU) of a secondary transmission.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The solutions detailed below may be implemented in a WTRU or an AP, and may include, but are not limited to: (1) a full-duplex compatibility discovery procedure; (2) a full-duplex transmit opportunity (TXOP) based on wireless medium sensing before a trigger frame with possible backward compatibility to downlink WTRUs; (3) a full-duplex transmit opportunity (TXOP) with possible backward compatibility to both uplink/downlink legacy WTRUs; and (4) broadcasting a RTS/CTS/negative CTS (NCTS).</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The full-duplex compatibility discovery procedure ensures that there is no interference between WTRUs, however the uplink and downlink WTRUs may need to be carefully selected and the transmit power used by the AP may need to be carefully estimated. In one embodiment, WTRUs are selected to limit interference based on an exhaustive identification procedure that pairs the WTRUs that may transmit/receive together (i.e. to identify the WTRUs that may be transmitted to using full-duplex (FD) while they are receiving from a different WTRU). This may be referred to as forward FD compatibility (i.e. the ability of WTRU A to send a frame in the uplink to the AP while the AP sends a frame to a different WTRU B in the downlink with the interference at WTRU B less than a threshold).</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">There may also be a need to identify reverse FD compatibility, in which WTRU B offers less interference than a threshold to WTRU A. It should be noted that the reverse FD compatibility may have a different threshold from the forward FD compatibility. In one example, the reverse direction may tolerate more interference in the case that the reverse FD transmission is needed to support FD ACKs as they may be sent with a lower modulation and coding scheme (MCS) or higher coding rate. It should also be noted that forward and reverse incompatibility may be defined in which WTRUs that may not transmit/receive together are identified.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">The FD compatibility discovery procedure may comprise a measurement phase and a reporting phase. In the measurement phase, an AP may send an FD_discovery setup frame to a WTRU or a group of WTRUs initiating the discovery procedure. The FD_discovery setup frame may include one or more of the identification of WTRU(s), interference threshold(s), indication of whether to identify compatible or incompatible WTRUs, the number of WTRUs, or other setup parameters. The identification of WTRUs may be used to perform the procedure. Examples of identification may include, but are not limited to, the WTRU identifier (for example, STA ID), the list of WTRU identifiers (STA IDs) or group IDs of the WTRUs. The interference threshold(s) may be used to identify FD compatible or FD incompatible WTRUs. In one example, the threshold(s) may be AP configurable or fixed. In another example, the threshold(s) may be WTRU specific or common for all WTRUs. In another example, the threshold(s) may be the same or differ for the forward and reverse FD compatibility measurements. The number of WTRUs may be used to identify in the forward compatibility scenario. For example, each WTRU may be asked to identify a fixed number of the best WTRUs.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Each WTRU signaled in the FD_discovery setup frame may send out an FD measurement frame. For example, quality of service (QoS) null or a specialized frame that contains the transmit power used by the WTRU may be transmitted. The WTRUs may send out the frames in a pre-determined order. For example, the WTRUs may send out the frames based on the order determined in the FD_discovery setup frame.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">The FD discovery phase may use beamforming and/or power control to limit the amount of interference. In the measurement phase, each transmitting WTRU may send out frames directed to maximize the energy of the received signal at the AP. In one example, the WTRU transmitting a discovery frame may use beamformed or sectorized antennas to limit the amount of interference experienced by other WTRUs. In the measurement phase, each WTRU that is not transmitting a discovery frame may modify its receive antenna to minimize energy from all WTRUs apart from the AP, for example, using beamformed or sectorized antennas, to limit the amount of interference received from other WTRUs. The transmitting WTRU may also send (e.g., only) the amount of transmit power needed to enable successful decoding of the packet to limit the amount of interference to other WTRUs.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">All other WTRUs may measure the amount of interference received from each transmitting WTRU and determine its compatibility by comparing received signal strength with the threshold. If an indication of the transmit power is included in the transmitted frame, the WTRU may be able to determine the reverse FD compatibility by estimating the receive power at the originating WTRU if it has to transmit to the WTRU. A WTRU B may also be able to send the AP feedback regarding the transmit power that WTRU A may be able to use (or the difference in power) to ensure FD compatibility.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">In the reporting phase, each WTRU may send a list of compatible or incompatible WTRUs to the AP. In one example, the AP may poll each WTRU (e.g. WTRU B) to request its list (e.g., one or more of the forward or reverse FD (in)compatible WTRUs). In another example, the AP may send out an NDP feedback request to multiple WTRUs and request the WTRUs to feedback their lists using OFDMA. For each WTRU on the list (e.g. WTRU A), the feedback may include a WTRU identifier. For example, the WT RU identifier includes the WTRU ID or the index of the WTRU in the FD_discovery setup request (e.g., the first WTRU sending out its measurement frame is identified as WTRU <b>0</b>, the second is identified as WTRU <b>1</b>, and so on). For each WTRU on the list (e.g., WTRU A), the feedback may include a power value (or power difference) that may be used by that WTRU (WTRU A) to ensure FD compatibility with the WTRU feeding back the list. The AP may relay this information to the WTRU (WTRU A) when the WTRU is scheduled for uplink transmission with WTRU B that is scheduled for downlink transmission. The WTRU (e.g., WTRU A) may overhear this information during the feedback from WTRU B.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates an example wireless network with a FD AP showing full-duplex compatibility between stations (WTRUs).

Specifically, an AP <b>710</b> transmits an FD TxOP setup frame followed by a discovery setup frame. In some embodiments, these two frames may be combined, or one may be omitted altogether.

To avoid interference from the primary transmitter that may hinder the reception of the secondary transmission, the transmission of UL can be based on carrier sensing before receipt of a trigger frame from the AP, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. For example, AP <b>910</b> will perform a full-duplex TXOP by sending a request-to-send (RTS) frame to one or more DL WTRUs (e.g., WTRU <b>1920</b> and WTRU <b>2</b> <b>930</b>). The RTS frame may be a multi-user (MU) request-to-send (MU-RTS). The WTRUs addressed by the RTS/MU-RTS may be the WTRUs that the AP wishes to perform DL transmission to. The WTRUs addressed by the RTS/MU-RTS may respond with a clear-to-send (CTS) frame/simultaneous CTS frame. The AP may then schedule a trigger frame (TF) addressed to one or more UL WTRUs (e.g., WTRU <b>1</b> <b>920</b>) an interframe spacing (IFS) (e.g. a short IFS, SIFS) after the end of the (expected) CTS frame transmission.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0102">The UL WTRUs may determine, based on the medium busy status of duration T before the reception of the TF, possibly with additional sensing of the medium busy status an IFS after the TF, whether to perform UL TB PPDU transmission scheduled by the TF. The sensing before the TF may be referred to as a CTS test. For example, if WTRU <b>1920</b> has received a CTS frame from WTRU <b>2</b> <b>930</b>, or the medium is sensed busy T before the TF, WTRU <b>1</b> <b>920</b> may not perform a TB PPDU transmission. The AP <b>910</b> may configure UL WTRUs to perform a CCA/CTS procedure in a beamformed antenna pattern instead of an omni-directional setup. The same beamformed antenna pattern may be used for UL TB PPDU transmission. Based on channel reciprocity and the CTS procedure, if WTRU <b>1</b> <b>920</b> cannot receive from WTRU <b>2</b> <b>920</b>, WTRU <b>1</b> <b>920</b>'s UL transmission does not interfere with WTRU <b>2</b> <b>930</b>'s reception.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0103">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the AP <b>910</b> may perform DL data transmission at the same time or after the TF transmission.

The DL WTRUs may perform UL ACK/BA at the same time. The UL WTRUs' (e.g. WTRU <b>1920</b>) reception of BA from AP <b>910</b> may not be interfered with UL ACK/BA.

In the MU-PPDU, padding may or may not applied after the TF (e.g., for ensuring the same PPDU duration for all receivers). The AP <b>910</b> may not require the UL WTRU (e.g., WTRU <b>1920</b>) to perform carrier sensing a SIFS interval after the TF. The TF may be sent with DL data in separate PPDUs with a SIFS separation (i.e. TF+ SIFS+DL PPDU).

The CTS in the above embodiment may be another message that responds to a triggering message from the AP. The information of the TF may be included in the MU-RTS frame such that the legacy WTRU would not decode this additional information. In this case, the TB PPDU transmission may be an IFS (e.g., SIFS) after the end of the expected CTS frame, if CTS procedure is successful in acquiring the medium.
