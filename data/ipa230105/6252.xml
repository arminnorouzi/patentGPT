the Examples in which the interparticle porosity of the second negative electrode mixture layer was higher than that of the first negative electrode mixture layer, the quick charge cycle characteristic was improved. It is considered that this resulted because, by setting the interparticle porosity of the second negative electrode mixture layer higher, the electrolyte solution easily permeated from the mixture layer surface facing the positive electrode toward the current collector, and the electrolyte solution easily permeated the entire negative electrode mixture layer. Further, from the results of Examples 1, 3, and 4, it was found that the quick charge cycle characteristic is improved when the applied mass per unit area is larger for the first negative electrode mixture layer than for the second negative electrode mixture layer. It is considered that this is because the amount of the electrolyte solution permeating the negative electrode mixture layer becomes optimized. Further, in Examples 1 to 4, it was ascertained that a high-capacity battery can be obtained.</p><heading id="h-0019" level="1">REFERENCE SIGNS LIST</heading><p id="p-0087" num="0085"><b>10</b> secondary battery; <b>11</b> positive electrode; <b>12</b> negative electrode: <b>13</b> separator: <b>14</b> electrode assembly. <b>15</b> outer casing: <b>16</b> sealing assembly, <b>17</b>,<b>18</b> insulating plate; <b>19</b> positive electrode lead; <b>20</b> negative electrode lead; <b>21</b> grooved portion; <b>22</b> filter; <b>23</b> lower valve member; <b>24</b> insulating member; <b>25</b> upper valve member; <b>26</b> cap: <b>26</b><i>a </i>opening; <b>27</b> gasket: <b>30</b> negative electrode current collector; <b>32</b> negative electrode mixture layer; <b>32</b><i>a </i>first negative electrode mixture layer; <b>32</b><i>b </i>second negative electrode mixture layer.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
