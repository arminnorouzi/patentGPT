Micro-LED control systems can support arrays of thousands to millions of microscopic LED pixels that actively emit light and are individually controlled. As compared to backlight LED technologies, micro-LED arrays can have higher brightness and energy efficiency, making them attractive for a variety of applications such as televisions, automotive headlights, mobile phones, residential lighting, commercial lighting, or architectural lighting. To display an image, the current levels of the micro-LED pixels at different locations on an array can be adjusted individually according to a specific image, light intensity, or color profile.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A micro-LED lighting system can include an LED array matrix having n LED pixels, each of which has one or more LEDs connected in series or parallel. To display an image, current levels of individual micro-LED pixels at different locations on the array matrix are adjusted. An LED control system may use pulse width modulation (PWM) control for dimming and color tuning functionality. PWM control works by turning on and off the pixels at a certain frequency, in effect adjusting the ratio between the conduction time and the period or cycle time, also known as a duty cycle. The average DC current through a pixel is the product of the current amplitude and the duty cycle.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a conventional PWM-based imaging technology, a system control unit determines the duty cycle value of each pixel based on a received image. The current amplitude can be kept identical for all pixels for a given image, but the current amplitude may vary between different images. Therefore, the individual duty cycle sets the pattern of the image, and the current amplitude is either a constant or a collective variable to adjust the brightness of the whole array, providing global dimming.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram of an example vehicle headlamp system that includes a micro-LED assembly according to some embodiments of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an example micro-LED assembly and power system according to some embodiments of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates an alternate arrangement of the micro-LED assembly and power system according to some embodiments of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating two exemplary pixel assemblies according to some embodiments of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a graph illustrating an example relationship between forward current and forward voltage; and</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates a process for dynamically adjusting a power supply for an LED array, according to some embodiments of the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Overview</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The systems, methods and devices of this disclosure each have several innovative aspects, no single one of which is solely responsible for all of the desirable attributes disclosed herein. Details of one or more implementations of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the description below and the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">For purposes of illustrating the LED pixel assemblies described herein, it might be useful to understand phenomena that may come into play in micro-LED assemblies with PWM control. The following foundational information may be viewed as a basis from which the present disclosure may be properly explained. Such information is offered for purposes of explanation only and, accordingly, should not be construed in any way to limit the scope of the present disclosure and its potential applications.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Existing micro-LED arrays that use PWM control typically include, in each pixel, a micro-LED, a PWM switch, and a transistor that acts as a current source for the micro-LED. The transistor receives a current signal at its gate; the current signal is used to set a current amplitude for the micro-LED. The micro-LED receives a fixed supply voltage for powering the micro-LED. In a typical PWM-controlled micro-LED array, all of the micro-LEDs receive the same current control signal, and all of the micro-LEDs receive the same supply voltage. The supply voltage is generally fixed.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">However, in operation, the minimum required supply voltage for a micro-LED array is not a constant. Instead, it is a function of the process spread of the micro-LED array, e.g., process spread of LED forward voltage and of current source voltage caused by variation in production. Further, the LED forward voltage varies based on temperature. In addition, if different current source amplitudes are used, the LED forward voltage and current source voltage also vary based on the selected current source amplitude. In order to cover all the variations between LED arrays and operating conditions, in prior micro-LED arrays, the power supply voltage was set at the maximum value for worst case conditions to guarantee operation. However, use of an excessively high power supply voltage that is greater than what is actually required for a specific operating condition requires the extra voltage to be absorbed by the current source switch in the form of losses. These losses reduce the system power efficiency and can also lead to overheating or other thermal issues.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Embodiments of the present disclosure provide a variable power supply and dynamic control of the power supply. A power supply control block retrieves condition data describing forward voltage properties of the LED array and operating conditions of the LED array, e.g., temperature and current amplitude. The LED array may be tested during production to obtain process spread data describing LED forward voltage and/or current source voltage, such as a minimum supply voltage under a set of baseline testing condition. Process spread data may further include data describing how the minimum supply voltage varies based on current and/or temperature. The power supply control block receives real-time operating condition data and determines a supply voltage specific to the LED array based on the operating conditions. The power supply control block dynamically adjusts the supply voltage provided by the power supply to the LED array as operating conditions vary over time. This increases efficiency of the LED array and avoids thermal issues in the LED array brought on by excessive power losses.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In one aspect, a lighting system includes an LED array and a control block. The LED array includes a plurality of LED pixels, each LED pixel arranged to receive a power supply voltage from a power supply that generates a dynamically adjustable power supply voltage. The LED array further includes at least one current source to drive the plurality of LEDs. The control block is configured to be coupled to the power supply and adjusts the power supply voltage generated by the power supply based on at least one condition of the LED array.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In another aspect, a method for setting a power supply voltage for an LED array includes receiving operating condition data describing operating conditions of an LED array comprising a plurality of LED pixels; retrieving process data associated with the LED array, the process data describing forward voltage for the plurality of LED pixels under at least one operating condition; and determining a power supply voltage to power the LED array based on the operating condition data and the process data.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In still another aspect, an LED array includes a plurality of LED pixels arranged in a matrix and at least one temperature sensor to sense a temperature of the LED array. Each LED pixel includes at least one LED coupled to a supply voltage, a current source to drive the at least one LED at an operating current having a current amplitude, and a PWM switch for alternately driving the at least one LED with the operating current. The at least one temperature sensor is located proximate to at least one of the plurality of LED pixels.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, aspects of the present disclosure, in particular aspects of micro-LED pixel arrays with a dynamically regulated power supply, described herein, may be embodied in various manners&#x2014;e.g. as a method, a system, a computer program product, or a computer readable storage medium. Accordingly, aspects of the present disclosure may take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment, an entirely software embodiment (including firmware, resident software, micro-code, circuit designs, etc.) or an embodiment combining software and hardware aspects that may all generally be referred to herein as a &#x201c;circuit,&#x201d; &#x201c;module&#x201d; or &#x201c;system.&#x201d; Functions described in this disclosure may be implemented as an algorithm executed by one or more hardware processing units, e.g. one or more microprocessors, of one or more computers.

However, is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized, and structural or logical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. In general, the innovations described herein can be embodied in a multitude of different ways, for example, as defined and covered by the claims and/or select examples, and the following detailed description is not to be taken in a limiting sense.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Example Systems for Micro-LED Arrays</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Micro-LED arrays support applications that benefit from fine-grained intensity, spatial, and temporal control of light distribution. For example, micro-LED arrays can provide precise spatial patterning of emitted light from pixel blocks or individual pixels. Depending on the application, emitted light may be spectrally distinct, adaptive overtime, and/or environmentally responsive. Micro-LED arrays may provide pre-programmed light distribution in various intensity, spatial, or temporal patterns. The emitted light may be based at least in part on received sensor data. Associated optics may be distinct at a pixel, pixel block, or device level. Example micro-LED arrays include devices having a commonly controlled central block of high intensity pixels with an associated common optic, and edge pixels that have individual optics. Some applications supported by micro-LED arrays include video lighting, automotive headlights, architectural and area illumination, street lighting, and informational displays.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Vehicle headlamps, or headlights, are one example application of micro-LED arrays. Vehicle headlamps comprised of micro-LED include a large number of pixels and have a high data refresh rate. Automotive headlights that actively illuminate only selected sections of a roadway can be used to reduce problems associated with glare or dazzling of oncoming drivers. For example, using infrared cameras as sensors, micro-LED arrays can activate only those pixels needed to illuminate the roadway, while deactivating pixels that may dazzle pedestrians or drivers of oncoming vehicles. As another example, a micro-LED array may be used to selectively illuminate off-road pedestrians, animals, or signs to improve driver environmental awareness. If pixels of the micro-LED array are spectrally distinct, the color temperature of the light may be adjusted according to respective daylight, twilight, or night conditions. Some pixels may be used for optical wireless vehicle to vehicle communication.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram of an example vehicle headlamp system <b>100</b> that includes a micro-LED assembly. The vehicle headlamp system <b>100</b> includes an electronic control unit (ECU) <b>110</b> and a headlamp <b>130</b>. While one headlamp <b>130</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, it should be understood that the vehicle includes two or more headlamps similar to headlamp <b>130</b>; the other headlamps are similar to the headlamp <b>130</b> and operate in a similar manner. Furthermore, other vehicle lights (e.g., running lights, fog lights, etc.) may be similarly configured and operate in a similar manner to the headlamp <b>130</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The ECU <b>110</b> is an embedded system within a vehicle that controls electrical systems or subsystems of the vehicle, including the headlamp <b>130</b>. In addition to controlling headlamps, the ECU <b>110</b> may include, for example, controls for engine components, powertrain components, doors, brakes, telematics, battery management, etc. The ECU <b>110</b> may be located in or near the engine compartment. The ECU <b>110</b> receives image data <b>105</b>, e.g., from a memory accessible to the ECU <b>110</b> that stores different headlamp images used in different settings or applications. A vehicle microprocessor <b>115</b> of the ECU <b>110</b> may generate or select an image for the headlamp <b>130</b>. For example, the vehicle microprocessor <b>115</b> receives data from one or more environmental sensors, selects an image for the headlamp <b>130</b> based on the sensed environment, and retrieves image data <b>105</b> for the selected image. The vehicle microprocessor <b>115</b> generates control signals for the headlamp <b>130</b> based on the selected image and transmits the control signals to the serializer <b>120</b>. The serializer <b>120</b> serializes the control signals and transmits them over a serial connection, such as an unshielded twisted pair (UTP) or coaxial connection. The serializer <b>120</b> may convert the control signals to a low voltage differential signaling (LVDS) format. The physical connection and data format between the ECU <b>110</b> and headlamp <b>130</b> are selected so that the control signals are reliably transmitted through the vehicle, which may experience a wide temperature variation, moisture, noise, and other adverse conditions.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The headlamp <b>130</b> includes a deserializer <b>135</b> that reformats the control signals and transmits the control signals to a micro-LED assembly <b>155</b>. For example, the control signals provided to the micro-LED assembly <b>155</b> may include a vertical synch signal, a pixel clock, a pixel enable signal, and a number of pixel data lines. The micro-LED assembly <b>155</b> outputs an image according to the control signal. The micro-LED assembly <b>155</b> is shown in further detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, and an example pixel assembly is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The headlamp <b>130</b> also includes a headlamp microprocessor <b>140</b>, a DC/DC converter <b>145</b>, and a power supply <b>150</b>. The deserializer <b>135</b> provides control signals to the headlamp microprocessor <b>140</b>, and may receive feedback (e.g., error information) from the headlamp microprocessor <b>140</b> to return to the ECU <b>110</b>. In this arrangement, the headlamp microprocessor <b>140</b> controls the power supply <b>150</b>, which supplies power to the DC/DC converter <b>145</b> via one output line and to the micro-LED assembly <b>155</b> via a second output line. The voltage supplied by the power supply <b>150</b> to the micro-LED assembly <b>155</b>, referred to as VIED <b>160</b>, is used to power the LED pixels. The voltage sent to the DC/DC converter is used to power internal logic of the headlamp <b>130</b>, e.g., the headlamp microprocessor <b>140</b> and logic internal to the micro-LED assembly <b>155</b>. The DC/DC converter <b>145</b> converts the direct current (DC) signal received from the power supply to a different voltage used to power the headlamp microprocessor <b>140</b> and the micro-LED assembly <b>155</b> logic. The DC/DC converter <b>145</b> distributes the converted DC voltage to the headlamp microprocessor <b>140</b> and the micro-LED assembly <b>155</b>. The headlamp microprocessor <b>140</b> also has an interface to the micro-LED assembly <b>155</b>, e.g., to exchange data, provide clock control, and receive fail data from the micro-LED assembly <b>155</b> in the event of a failure.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">It should be understood that the vehicle headlamp system <b>100</b> is only one example application of a micro-LED array. In another application, a micro-LED assembly <b>155</b> is used in a lighting installation to selectively and adaptively illuminate buildings or environments for improved visual display or to reduce lighting costs. For example, in conjunction with tracking sensors and/or cameras, micro-LED arrays may be used to selectively illuminate areas around pedestrians. As another example application, micro-LED arrays are used to project media facades for decorative motion or video effects. Spectrally distinct pixels may be used to adjust the color temperature of lighting, as well as support wavelength specific horticultural illumination.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Street lighting is another example application that benefits from use of micro-LED arrays. A single type of light emitting array may be used to mimic various street light types, allowing, for example, switching between a Type I linear street light and a Type IV semicircular street light by appropriate activation or deactivation of selected pixels. Street lighting costs may be lowered by adjusting light beam intensity or distribution according to environmental conditions or time of use. For example, light intensity and area of distribution may be reduced when pedestrians are not present. If pixels of the micro-LED array are spectrally distinct, the color temperature of the light may be adjusted according to respective daylight, twilight, or night conditions.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Micro-LED arrays are also well suited for supporting applications requiring direct or projected displays. For example, warning, emergency, or informational signs may all be displayed or projected using micro-LED arrays. This allows, for example, color changing or flashing exit signs to be projected. If a micro-LED array is composed of a large number of pixels, textual or numerical information may be presented. Directional arrows or similar indicators may also be provided.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">A micro-LED array may be used alone or in conjunction with primary or secondary optics, including lenses or reflectors. To reduce overall data management requirements, some or all of the pixels in the micro-LED array can be limited to on/off functionality or switching between relatively few light intensity levels. Full pixel level control of light intensity is not necessarily supported.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In operation, image data corresponding to pixels in the micro-LED array is used to define response of corresponding pixels in the micro-LED array, with intensity and spatial modulation of the pixels being based on the image(s). To reduce data rate issues, groups of pixels (e.g. 5&#xd7;5 blocks) can be controlled as single blocks in some embodiments. High speed and high data rate operation may be supported, with pixel values from successive images able to be loaded as successive frames in an image sequence at a rate between, for example, 30 Hz and 100 Hz, e.g., at 60 Hz. In conjunction with a pulse width modulation module, each pixel in the pixel module can be operated to emit light in a pattern and with intensity at least partially dependent on the image held in the image frame buffer.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Example Micro-LED Assembly and Power System</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an example of the micro-LED assembly <b>155</b> and power system according to some embodiments of the present disclosure. The power system includes the power supply <b>150</b> and a power controller <b>280</b>, which is a control block that sets the voltage VIED <b>160</b> supplied by the power supply <b>150</b> to the micro-LED assembly <b>155</b> to power the micro-LEDs. The micro-LED assembly <b>155</b> and power system may be used in the vehicle headlamp application, any of the other applications described above, or other potential applications of an LED array. The micro-LED assembly <b>155</b>, power supply <b>150</b>, and power controller <b>280</b> may have different arrangements from the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. In some embodiments, the power controller <b>280</b> is integrated into the micro-LED assembly <b>155</b>, e.g., into the micro-LED controller <b>210</b>. In some embodiments, the power controller <b>280</b> is integrated into the power supply <b>150</b>. In some embodiments, the power controller <b>280</b> is a component of the headlamp microprocessor <b>140</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In some embodiments, the micro-LED assembly <b>155</b> has an integrated power supply, and the power supply <b>150</b> and power controller <b>280</b> are both included in the micro-LED assembly <b>155</b>. In some embodiments, the memory <b>240</b> is located outside the micro-LED assembly <b>155</b>, e.g., in the power controller <b>280</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The micro-LED assembly <b>155</b> includes a block for micro-LED control <b>210</b> and a pixel array <b>260</b>. The micro-LED control <b>210</b> includes a pulse width modulator <b>220</b>, a current controller <b>230</b>, and a memory <b>240</b>. The pixel array <b>260</b> includes pixel assemblies <b>265</b>, e.g., pixel assemblies <b>265</b><i>a </i>and <b>265</b><i>b</i>, which are arranged in a matrix. Each pixel assembly <b>265</b> actively emits light and may be individually controlled by the micro-LED control <b>210</b>. While 25 example pixel assemblies <b>265</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the pixel array <b>260</b> may include thousands to millions of microscopic LED pixel assemblies. To emit light in a pattern or sequence that results in display of an image, the current levels of the micro-LEDs in the pixel assemblies <b>265</b> at different locations on an array are adjusted individually according to a specific image. This can be accomplished using pulse width modulation (PWM), which turns on and off the pixels at a certain frequency. During PWM operation, the average DC current through a pixel is the product of the current amplitude and the PWM duty cycle, which is the ratio between the conduction time and the period or cycle time.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The pulse width modulator <b>220</b> generates PWM signals <b>225</b> that are output to the pixel array <b>260</b> to control the PWM duty cycles of the pixels. In some embodiments, the pulse width modulator <b>220</b> generates an individual PWM signal <b>225</b> for each pixel in the pixel array <b>260</b>. In other embodiments, one PWM signal may control multiple pixels, e.g., a particular subset of pixels in the pixel array <b>260</b>. In the vehicle headlamp example described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the pulse width modulator <b>220</b> receives the image control signals from the deserializer <b>135</b> and generates the PWM signals <b>225</b> based on the image control signals. In other embodiments, another control block within the micro-LED assembly <b>155</b> or in another system may generate the image data that is fed to the pulse width modulator <b>220</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The current controller <b>230</b> generates a current signal <b>235</b> provided to the pixel array <b>260</b>. More particularly, the current signal <b>235</b> is provided to a current source within each pixel assembly <b>265</b> that generates a forward current for the micro-LED within each pixel assembly <b>265</b>. While each pixel assembly <b>265</b> receives a unique PWM signal <b>225</b>, the full pixel array <b>260</b>, or blocks of multiple pixel assemblies <b>265</b> within the pixel array <b>260</b>, may receive the same current signal <b>235</b>, setting the same forward current across the pixel array <b>260</b> or across a given block of pixel assemblies <b>265</b>. The current controller <b>230</b> receives a control signal indicating the current level from the deserializer <b>135</b> (in the vehicle headlamp example) or another digital control interface (e.g., an inter-integrated circuit (I2C) interface). The micro-LEDs in the pixel assemblies <b>265</b> emit light based on the current signal <b>235</b> and the PWM signals <b>225</b>. The pixel structure and operation are described in greater detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The memory <b>240</b> stores process data <b>245</b>, which is retrieved by the power controller <b>280</b>. The process data <b>245</b> describes the supply voltage needed to turn on the pixel assemblies <b>265</b> under one or more operating conditions. The process data <b>245</b> may vary from one pixel array <b>260</b> to another pixel array based on manufacturing variation. In particular, the minimum supply voltage varies from array to array based on the process spread of the forward voltage of the micro-LEDs and process spread in the voltage drops across other circuit elements in the pixel assemblies <b>265</b>, e.g., the voltage across the current source in each pixel assembly <b>265</b>. After the pixel assemblies <b>265</b> are fabricated, a testing procedure may be performed to determine the process data <b>245</b> for the pixel array <b>260</b>, and this process data <b>245</b> is stored in the memory <b>240</b>. The memory <b>240</b> may be a non-volatile memory programmed during the manufacturing process.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Not only does the minimum required power supply voltage vary between different pixel arrays, but also between different operating conditions of a given pixel array. The minimum required power supply voltage is a function of multiple variables, such as the amplitude of the current source for the pixel array <b>260</b> and the temperature of the pixel array <b>260</b>. In particular, variation in temperature of the micro-LEDs in the pixel assemblies <b>265</b> affects the LED forward voltage, and variation in the current amplitude affects both the LED forward voltage and the current source voltage. Example curves showing the relationship between LED forward current, LED forward voltage, and temperature are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The process data <b>245</b> may be obtained from a production test that determines the minimum supply voltage for a baseline set of operating conditions, e.g., an LED temperature of 25&#xb0; C. and a current amplitude of 4 mA. In some embodiments, the process data <b>245</b> describes the minimum required supply voltage under various different operating conditions. For example, the process data <b>245</b> may include supply voltage levels for different combinations of temperatures and current amplitudes, e.g., a maximum and minimum current amplitude and a maximum and minimum operating temperature. In some examples, the process data <b>245</b> includes one or more formulas for calculating the supply voltage V<sub>LED </sub><b>160</b> based on temperature and/or current amplitude. In other embodiments, the formulas for adjusting the supply voltage V<sub>LED </sub><b>160</b> based on the operating conditions are assumed to be the same across a set of micro-LED assemblies <b>155</b>, and the formulas may be stored in the power controller <b>280</b> or elsewhere. For example, the power controller <b>280</b> may be programmed decrease the supply voltage by &#x2212;2 mV for each 1 C&#xb0; increase in temperature relative to a baseline temperature, or increase the supply voltage +2 mV for each 1 C&#xb0; decrease in temperature relative to the baseline temperature.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">There may also be process spread between individual pixel assemblies <b>265</b> on a given pixel array <b>260</b>, e.g., the pixel assembly <b>265</b><i>a </i>may have a minimum supply voltage that is 50 mV higher than another pixel assembly <b>265</b><i>b</i>. However, because the same supply voltage V<sub>LED </sub><b>160</b> and current signal <b>235</b> are used across the pixel array <b>260</b>, the highest minimum supply voltage across the pixel array <b>260</b> generally dictates the supply voltage V<sub>LED </sub><b>160</b> supplied to the pixel array <b>260</b>. Therefore, the memory <b>240</b> may store the highest minimum supply voltage across the pixel array <b>260</b>, i.e., the supply voltage that causes all or nearly all of the pixel assemblies <b>265</b> to turn on for a baseline set of conditions and/or other sets of conditions, as described above. In other embodiments, the process data <b>245</b> includes individualized data for each individual pixel assembly <b>265</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The power controller <b>280</b> receives the process data <b>245</b> from the memory <b>240</b>.

In other embodiments, some or all of the operating data <b>275</b> may be received from the micro-LED control block <b>310</b>, e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. The operating data <b>275</b> includes an operating current amplitude, e.g., the current amplitude specified by the current signal <b>235</b>, or a current amplitude generated by the pixel assemblies <b>265</b> and measured on the pixel array <b>260</b> (ideally, the generated current amplitude is the same as the current amplitude instructed by the current signal <b>235</b>).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The operating data <b>275</b> may further include data from one or more temperature sensors <b>270</b> included in the pixel array <b>260</b>.

A third example temperature sensor <b>270</b><i>c </i>is positioned within the matrix of pixel assemblies <b>265</b>, and in particular, between two of the pixels.

The power controller <b>280</b> may process the temperature readings from multiple temperature sensors <b>270</b> to determine an average or maximum temperature across the pixel array <b>260</b>, or to estimate temperature across the pixel array <b>260</b> based on the array geometry. In some embodiments, the power controller <b>280</b> may further receive image data (e.g., the PWM signals <b>225</b> or image data from the deserializer <b>135</b>) and estimate the temperature across the pixel array <b>260</b> based on the image data in combination with the sensed temperature(s).</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The power controller <b>280</b> determines a voltage setting for the power supply <b>150</b>, i.e., the V<sub>LED </sub><b>160</b> that causes the micro-LEDs in the pixel array <b>260</b> to turn on under the present conditions, based on the process data <b>245</b> and the operating data <b>275</b>. For example, the power controller <b>280</b> obtain a baseline supply voltage for the pixel array <b>260</b> from the process data <b>245</b> and adjusts the supply voltage from the baseline based on the operating data <b>275</b>.

While one LED <b>410</b> is shown in each pixel assembly <b>265</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, in other embodiments, each pixel assembly <b>265</b> includes multiple LEDs <b>410</b> connected in series and/or in parallel. The LED <b>410</b> is arranged to receive the LED supply voltage V<sub>LED </sub><b>160</b> that is provided by the power supply <b>150</b> and adjusted by the power controller <b>280</b>. When an LED current, e.g., <b>11</b> in pixel assembly <b>1</b> <b>265</b><i>a</i>, passes through the LED <b>410</b><i>a</i>, the LED <b>410</b><i>a </i>emits light, as indicated by the arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The PWM switch <b>420</b> receives a PWM signal <b>225</b> from a pulse width modulator, e.g., the PWM switch <b>420</b><i>a </i>in pixel assembly <b>1</b> <b>265</b><i>a </i>receives PWM signal <b>1</b> <b>225</b><i>a</i>, which is one of the PWM signals <b>225</b> provided by the pulse width modulator <b>220</b>. In this example, each PWM switch <b>420</b> receives an individual PWM signal <b>225</b>, e.g., PWM switch <b>1</b> <b>420</b><i>a </i>receives PWM signal <b>1</b> <b>225</b><i>a</i>, and PWM switch <b>2</b> <b>420</b><i>b </i>receives PWM signal <b>2</b> <b>225</b><i>b</i>. The PWM switch <b>420</b> alternately turns the LED <b>410</b> on and off according to the received PWM signal <b>225</b>. In particular, the PWM switch <b>420</b> couples the current source transistor <b>430</b> to the LED <b>410</b> to turn supply the LED current (e.g., <b>11</b> or <b>12</b>) to turn the LED <b>410</b> on, and decouples the current source transistor <b>430</b> from the LED <b>410</b> to turn the LED <b>410</b> off.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The current source transistor <b>430</b> generates the LED current (e.g., <b>11</b> or <b>12</b>) for driving the LED <b>410</b>. The current source transistor <b>430</b> is an n-type metal-oxide-semiconductor (NMOS) transistor having a gate coupled to the current signal <b>235</b>, a source connected to ground, and a drain coupled to the LED <b>410</b>. The amplitude of the LED current generated by the current source transistor <b>430</b> varies based on the voltage of the current signal <b>235</b>. While in this example, the PWM switch <b>420</b> sits between the drain of the current source transistor <b>430</b> and the LED <b>410</b>, in other embodiments, the PWM switch <b>420</b> sits between the gate of the current source transistor <b>430</b> and the current signal <b>235</b>. the PWM switch <b>442</b> is opened and closed according to a PWM signal.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Example Pixel Assemblies</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a graph illustrating an example relationship between LED forward current and LED forward voltage under three example temperature conditions. The LED forward current is the current generated by the current source transistor <b>430</b> based on the current signal <b>235</b>. The LED forward voltage is the voltage across the LED <b>410</b> when the LED <b>410</b> is powered on. Three lines <b>510</b>, <b>520</b>, and <b>530</b> are plotted. In general, as the LED forward current increases, the LED forward voltage increases. This means that when the current for the pixel array <b>260</b> increases, a higher V<sub>LED </sub><b>160</b> is used. For example, along the line <b>510</b>, a 3 mA current has a 3.3V forward voltage across the LED <b>410</b>; a 4 mA current has a 3.4V forward voltage across the LED <b>410</b>; and a 6 mA current has a 3.5V forward voltage across the LED <b>410</b>. Note that V<sub>LED </sub><b>160</b> is generally higher than the forward voltage of the LED <b>410</b>, to account for voltage across other circuit elements, e.g., the PWM switch <b>420</b> and the current source transistor <b>430</b>. The voltage across the PWM switch <b>420</b> and the current source transistor <b>430</b> may also vary based on current in a similar manner, increasing as the current amplitude increases.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The line <b>510</b> may be the forward voltage curve at a baseline operating temperature, e.g., 25&#xb0; C. The line <b>520</b> above the line <b>510</b> shows a forward voltage curve at a lower temperature, e.g., at a minimum operating temperature of &#x2212;40&#xb0; C. The line <b>530</b> below the line <b>510</b> shows a forward voltage curve at a higher temperature, e.g., at a maximum operating temperature of 85&#xb0; C. As illustrated by these curves, temperature generally has a negative relationship to LED forward voltage, so that at lower operating temperatures, a higher V<sub>LED </sub><b>160</b> is used, and at higher operating temperatures, a lower V<sub>LED </sub><b>160</b> may be used.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The power controller <b>280</b> sets the V<sub>LED </sub><b>160</b> to be high enough for a given operating condition. For example, if the operating temperature is 25&#xb0; C., corresponding to line <b>510</b>, and the forward current specified by the current signal <b>235</b> is set at 4 mA, the power controller <b>280</b> selects a V<sub>LED </sub><b>160</b> that allows for a 3.4V forward voltage across the LEDs <b>410</b>. The supply voltage V<sub>LED </sub><b>160</b> may be, for example, 3.4V+0.6V=4.0V, if the voltage across the other components in each pixel assembly (e.g., the PWM switches <b>420</b> and current source transistors <b>430</b>) is 0.6V for a 4 mA current. As another example, if the operating temperature is 85&#xb0; C., corresponding to line <b>530</b>, and the forward current specified by the current signal <b>235</b> is set at 6 mA, the power controller <b>280</b> selects a V<sub>LED </sub><b>160</b> that allows for a 3.4V forward voltage across the LEDs <b>410</b>. The supply voltage V<sub>LED </sub><b>160</b> may be, for example, 3.4V+0.8V=4.2V, if the voltage across the other components in each pixel assembly (e.g., the PWM switches <b>420</b> and current source transistors <b>430</b>) is 0.8V for a 6 mA current.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In a system without dynamic power control, V<sub>LED </sub><b>160</b> is typically set at the maximum possible voltage needed across the operating conditions of the pixel array <b>260</b>. In this example, if the minimum operating temperature is &#x2212;40&#xb0; C. (corresponding to line <b>520</b>) and the maximum current is 6 mA, the V<sub>LED </sub><b>160</b> is high enough to account for a 3.6V forward voltage across the LEDs <b>410</b>, and the voltage across the other pixel assembly components (e.g., 0.8V), resulting in a constant 4.4V V<sub>LED</sub>. By providing dynamic power control, the power system can significantly reduce power consumption by the micro-LED assembly <b>155</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Example Process for Adjusting a Power Supply</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates a process for dynamically adjusting a power supply for an LED array, according to some embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">A power controller <b>280</b> receives <b>610</b> operating condition data describing operating conditions of the LED array.
