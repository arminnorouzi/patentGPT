When a channel structure of the flash memory device is made, a trench may be formed by the etching process. In this case, a problem may occur that the trench is not formed by the etching process due to an influence of a mask formed in a word line cut region.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Some example embodiments a nonvolatile memory device with improved reliability.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Alternatively or additionally, some example embodiments may also provide a method for fabricating a nonvolatile memory device with improved reliability.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, example embodiments are not restricted to those set forth herein.
