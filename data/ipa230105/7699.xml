Typical wireless communication systems may employ multiple-access technologies capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing available system resources (e.g., bandwidth, transmit power, or the like). Examples of such multiple-access technologies include code division multiple access (CDMA) systems, time division multiple access (TDMA) systems, frequency division multiple access (FDMA) systems, orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems, single-carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) systems, time division synchronous code division multiple access (TD-SCDMA) systems, and Long Term Evolution (LTE). LTE/LTE-Advanced is a set of enhancements to the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) mobile standard promulgated by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A wireless network may include one or more base stations that support communication for a user equipment (UE) or multiple UEs. A UE may communicate with a base station via downlink communications and uplink communications. &#x201c;Downlink&#x201d; (or &#x201c;DL&#x201d;) refers to a communication link from the base station to the UE, and &#x201c;uplink&#x201d; (or &#x201c;UL&#x201d;) refers to a communication link from the UE to the base station.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The above multiple access technologies have been adopted in various telecommunication standards to provide a common protocol that enables different UEs to communicate on a municipal, national, regional, and/or global level. New Radio (NR), which may be referred to as 5G, is a set of enhancements to the LTE mobile standard promulgated by the 3GPP. NR is designed to better support mobile broadband internet access by improving spectral efficiency, lowering costs, improving services, making use of new spectrum, and better integrating with other open standards using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) with a cyclic prefix (CP) (CP-OFDM) on the downlink, using CP-OFDM and/or single-carrier frequency division multiplexing (SC-FDM) (also known as discrete Fourier transform spread OFDM (DFT-s-OFDM)) on the uplink, as well as supporting beamforming, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna technology, and carrier aggregation. As the demand for mobile broadband access continues to increase, further improvements in LTE, NR, and other radio access technologies remain useful.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In some implementations, an apparatus for wireless communication at a user equipment (UE) includes a memory and one or more processors, coupled to the memory, configured to: receive, from a base station via a system information block (SIB), a random access configuration associated with aerial UEs, wherein the random access configuration indicates one or more aerial UE specific parameters;

In the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), the term &#x201c;cell&#x201d; can refer to a coverage area of a base station <b>110</b> and/or a base station subsystem serving this coverage area, depending on the context in which the term is used.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">A base station <b>110</b> may provide communication coverage for a macro cell, a pico cell, a femto cell, and/or another type of cell. A macro cell may cover a relatively large geographic area (e.g., several kilometers in radius) and may allow unrestricted access by UEs <b>120</b> with service subscriptions. A pico cell may cover a relatively small geographic area and may allow unrestricted access by UEs <b>120</b> with service subscription. A femto cell may cover a relatively small geographic area (e.g., a home) and may allow restricted access by UEs <b>120</b> having association with the femto cell (e.g., UEs <b>120</b> in a closed subscriber group (CSG)). A base station <b>110</b> for a macro cell may be referred to as a macro base station. A base station <b>110</b> for a pico cell may be referred to as a pico base station. A base station <b>110</b> for a femto cell may be referred to as a femto base station or an in-home base station.

A base station may support one or multiple (e.g., three) cells.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some examples, a cell may not necessarily be stationary, and the geographic area of the cell may move according to the location of a base station <b>110</b> that is mobile (e.g., a mobile base station). In some examples, the base stations <b>110</b> may be interconnected to one another and/or to one or more other base stations <b>110</b> or network nodes (not shown) in the wireless network <b>100</b> through various types of backhaul interfaces, such as a direct physical connection or a virtual network, using any suitable transport network.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The wireless network <b>100</b> may include one or more relay stations. A relay station is an entity that can receive a transmission of data from an upstream station (e.g., a base station <b>110</b> or a UE <b>120</b>) and send a transmission of the data to a downstream station (e.g., a UE <b>120</b> or a base station <b>110</b>). A relay station may be a UE <b>120</b> that can relay transmissions for other UEs <b>120</b>. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the BS <b>110</b><i>d </i>(e.g., a relay base station) may communicate with the BS <b>110</b><i>a </i>(e.g., a macro base station) and the UE <b>120</b><i>d </i>in order to facilitate communication between the BS <b>110</b><i>a </i>and the UE <b>120</b><i>d. </i>A base station <b>110</b> that relays communications may be referred to as a relay station, a relay base station, a relay, or the like.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The wireless network <b>100</b> may be a heterogeneous network that includes base stations <b>110</b> of different types, such as macro base stations, pico base stations, femto base stations, relay base stations, or the like. These different types of base stations <b>110</b> may have different transmit power levels, different coverage areas, and/or different impacts on interference in the wireless network <b>100</b>. For example, macro base stations may have a high transmit power level (e.g., 5 to 40 watts) whereas pico base stations, femto base stations, and relay base stations may have lower transmit power levels (e.g., 0.1 to 2 watts).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">A network controller <b>130</b> may couple to or communicate with a set of base stations <b>110</b> and may provide coordination and control for these base stations <b>110</b>. The network controller <b>130</b> may communicate with the base stations <b>110</b> via a backhaul communication link. The base stations <b>110</b> may communicate with one another directly or indirectly via a wireless or wireline backhaul communication link.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The UEs <b>120</b> may be dispersed throughout the wireless network <b>100</b>, and each UE <b>120</b> may be stationary or mobile. A UE <b>120</b> may include, for example, an access terminal, a terminal, a mobile station, and/or a subscriber unit. A UE <b>120</b> may be a cellular phone (e.g., a smart phone), a personal digital assistant (PDA), a wireless modem, a wireless communication device, a handheld device, a laptop computer, a cordless phone, a wireless local loop (WLL) station, a tablet, a camera, a gaming device, a netbook, a smartbook, an ultrabook, a medical device, a biometric device, a wearable device (e.g., a smart watch, smart clothing, smart glasses, a smart wristband, smart jewelry (e.g., a smart ring or a smart bracelet)), an entertainment device (e.g., a music device, a video device, and/or a satellite radio), a vehicular component or sensor, a smart meter/sensor, industrial manufacturing equipment, a global positioning system device, and/or any other suitable device that is configured to communicate via a wireless medium.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Some UEs <b>120</b> may be considered machine-type communication (MTC) or evolved or enhanced machine-type communication (eMTC) UEs. An MTC UE and/or an eMTC UE may include, for example, a robot, a drone, a remote device, a sensor, a meter, a monitor, and/or a location tag, that may communicate with a base station, another device (e.g., a remote device), or some other entity. Some UEs <b>120</b> may be considered Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, and/or may be implemented as NB-IoT (narrowband IoT) devices. Some UEs <b>120</b> may be considered a Customer Premises Equipment. A UE <b>120</b> may be included inside a housing that houses components of the UE <b>120</b>, such as processor components and/or memory components. In some examples, the processor components and the memory components may be coupled together. For example, the processor components (e.g., one or more processors) and the memory components (e.g., a memory) may be operatively coupled, communicatively coupled, electronically coupled, and/or electrically coupled.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In general, any number of wireless networks <b>100</b> may be deployed in a given geographic area. Each wireless network <b>100</b> may support a particular RAT and may operate on one or more frequencies. A RAT may be referred to as a radio technology, an air interface, or the like. A frequency may be referred to as a carrier, a frequency channel, or the like. Each frequency may support a single RAT in a given geographic area in order to avoid interference between wireless networks of different RATs. In some cases, NR or 5G RAT networks may be deployed.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some examples, two or more UEs <b>120</b> (e.g., shown as UE <b>120</b><i>a </i>and UE <b>120</b><i>e</i>) may communicate directly using one or more sidelink channels (e.g., without using a base station <b>110</b> as an intermediary to communicate with one another). For example, the UEs <b>120</b> may communicate using peer-to-peer (P2P) communications, device-to-device (D2D) communications, a vehicle-to-everything (V2X) protocol (e.g., which may include a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) protocol, a vehicle-to-infrastructure (V21) protocol, or a vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P) protocol), and/or a mesh network. In such examples, a UE <b>120</b> may perform scheduling operations, resource selection operations, and/or other operations described elsewhere herein as being performed by the base station <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Devices of the wireless network <b>100</b> may communicate using the electromagnetic spectrum, which may be subdivided by frequency or wavelength into various classes, bands, channels, or the like. For example, devices of the wireless network <b>100</b> may communicate using one or more operating bands. In 5G NR, two initial operating bands have been identified as frequency range designations FR1 (410 MHz-7.125 GHz) and FR2 (24.25 GHz-52.6 GHz). It should be understood that although a portion of FR1 is greater than 6 GHz, FR1 is often referred to (interchangeably) as a &#x201c;Sub-6 GHz&#x201d; band in various documents and articles. A similar nomenclature issue sometimes occurs with regard to FR2, which is often referred to (interchangeably) as a &#x201c;millimeter wave&#x201d; band in documents and articles, despite being different from the extremely high frequency (EHF) band (30 GHz-300 GHz) which is identified by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) as a &#x201c;millimeter wave&#x201d; band.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The frequencies between FR1 and FR2 are often referred to as mid-band frequencies. Recent 5G NR studies have identified an operating band for these mid-band frequencies as frequency range designation FR3 (7.125 GHz-24.25 GHz). Frequency bands falling within FR3 may inherit FR1 characteristics and/or FR2 characteristics, and thus may effectively extend features of FR1 and/or FR2 into mid-band frequencies. In addition, higher frequency bands are currently being explored to extend 5G NR operation beyond 52.6 GHz. For example, three higher operating bands have been identified as frequency range designations FR4a or FR4-1 (52.6 GHz-71 GHz), FR4 (52.6 GHz-114.25 GHz), and FR5 (114.25 GHz-300 GHz). Each of these higher frequency bands falls within the EHF band.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">With the above examples in mind, unless specifically stated otherwise, it should be understood that the term &#x201c;sub-6 GHz&#x201d; or the like, if used herein, may broadly represent frequencies that may be less than 6 GHz, may be within FR1, or may include mid-band frequencies. Further, unless specifically stated otherwise, it should be understood that the term &#x201c;millimeter wave&#x201d; or the like, if used herein, may broadly represent frequencies that may include mid-band frequencies, may be within FR2, FR4, FR4-a or FR4-1, and/or FR5, or may be within the EHF band. It is contemplated that the frequencies included in these operating bands (e.g., FR1, FR2, FR3, FR4, FR4-a, FR4-1, and/or FR5) may be modified, and techniques described herein are applicable to those modified frequency ranges.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some aspects, a UE (e.g., UE <b>120</b>) may include a communication manager <b>140</b>.

When the base station communicates with either the terrestrial UE or the aerial UE, a line of sight probability may increase with height. In other words, increasing a height associated with the terrestrial UE or the UAV may increase a probability that the terrestrial UE or the UAV has a line of sight with the base station. Once the height satisfies a threshold, a line of sight probability may approach 90% or more. A probability of serving cells and/or interfering cells being line of sight with an aerial UE is relatively high, due to a relatively large height typically associated with an aerial UE.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0091">As indicated above, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is provided as an example.

However, the random access parameters may be the same for all UEs, including both terrestrial UEs and aerial UEs. In other words, the random access parameters may not differentiate terrestrial UEs from aerial UEs, even though terrestrial UEs and aerial UEs are associated with significantly different heights and lines of sight with the base station. For example, when a target preamble received power for an aerial UE is the same as a target preamble received power for a terrestrial UE, an interference during a preamble reception may be increased, which may cause more potential random access failure. The interference may increase since the aerial UE is likely to have a line of sight with the base station, whereas the terrestrial UE is not as likely to have a line of sight with the base station as compared to the aerial UE.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0093">In various aspects of techniques and apparatuses described herein, a UE may be considered to be an aerial UE or may be classified as an aerial UE based at least in part on an aerial subscription, a height associated with the UE that satisfies a threshold, and/or an up-tilted base station beam associated with a random access. The UE may receive, from a base station via a SIB1, a random access configuration associated with aerial UEs. The random access configuration may indicate one or more aerial UE specific parameters. The random access configuration may indicate random access occasions for aerial UEs, power control parameters for aerial UEs, a random access type, and/or a msgA uplink shared channel configuration for aerial UEs.

Further, the base station may indicate, via the SIB1, different random access parameters related to msg3 of the four-step random access procedure. As a result, aerial UEs and terrestrial UEs may be configured with different random access occasions, different power control parameters (e.g., different target preamble received powers), different random access types, and/or different msgA PUSCH configurations for aerial UEs, due to different conditions (e.g., heights) associated with the aerial UEs in relation to the terrestrial UEs.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0095">In some aspects, the UE may be considered to be an aerial UE when various conditions are satisfied.
