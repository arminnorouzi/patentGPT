The invention also relates to an ammunition unit comprising a repeatable plasma generator for initiation of propellant charges when launching projectiles from a barrel weapon and a launching device comprising a repeatable plasma generator.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">A conventional barrel weapon means here a weapon of the type of an artillery piece, a naval piece, or a tank piece or other piece containing a barrel in which a projectile is fired and propelled through the barrel by a propellant charge which is ignited by means of a pyrotechnical igniter, such as a spark plug, an ignition cartridge, etc. The propellant charge, also called the propellant, refers here to a powder of solid form, which gives off gases during its burning, driving the projectile forward to the mouth of the barrel under high pressure in the barrel. The propellant can also be a type other than a solid powder.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">High gas pressure for a long time means a high muzzle velocity of the projectile when the projectile leaves the barrel. The high muzzle velocity of the projectile is utilized, for example, to increase the range of the weapon, to improve the projectile's penetrating power or reduce the time course of the projectile's trajectory.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A pressure curve for an optimal combustion process, and thus high launch speed, should show an almost immediate pressure increase to P<sub>max</sub>, then a long-lasting plateau phase with a maintained constant barrel pressure at P<sub>max </sub>for the entire time that the propellant charge is burning inside the barrel, and then dropping immediately to zero when the projectile leaves the barrel. All of the propellant charge should have normally been burned at this time.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Regardless of the choice of propellant charge, the ignition process is of great importance to the pressure course and therefore the igniter and ignition system are critical to achieving high launch speed.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">While at the same time the highest possible launch speed is desired, there is a need to reduce the vulnerability of the propellant. A propellant of this type is known as LOVA (LOw VulnerAbility). The low-vulnerability propellant is hard to ignite, which lessens the risk of accidental initiation of propellant in risky situations, for example, when a combat vehicle is being fired upon by enemy fire. The decreased vulnerability also means increased requirements for the igniters. The igniters must then generate an increased amount of energy and/or increased pressure in order to create the ignition process. The igniters normally consist of an easily initiated explosive, and if the quantity of the explosive is increased, this stands in direct opposition to adopting a propellant of LOVA type. Basically, ignition occurs through an ignition chain, where a very small quantity of sensitive explosive, known as the primary set, such as lead azide or silver azide, is ignited by mechanical shock or electrical pulse. The primary set then ignites the secondary set of the igniter, usually black powder, which in turn initiates the propellant. By replacing the pyrotechnical igniter or the entire ignition chain with a plasma igniter, the vulnerability of the system to unintentional initiation is decreased. At the same time, an increased dynamism is made possible for generating the more powerful ignition pulses needed to ignite the low-vulnerability (LOVA) propellant.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Conventional igniters also have a logistical and technical problem. For barrel weapons using propellant charges separated from the projectiles, such as artillery and heavy ship cannons, a separate ignition cartridge is often used for initiation of the propellant charge. An ignition cartridge is used for each firing. Thus, a mechanical system mounted on the cannon is needed for storing, loading, and removing of the ignition cartridge. By using a plasma igniter, the logistical problems of ignition cartridges are avoided. A commonly occurring problem is that the ignition cartridge gets stuck in the cartridge position. Ignition cartridges expand when the weapons system is fired, so that the ignition cartridge gets wedged in the cartridge position and firearm malfunction occurs. By adopting a plasma igniter, firearm malfunction is avoided and the functional safety is increased.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Plasma igniters for initiation of propellant charges have been described, for example, in patent documents U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,231,242 (A) and 6,703,580 (B2). The plasma igniters are built on the principle of exploding wires, that is, an electrically conductive wire which is heated, gasified, and partly ionized by an electric current. The drawback is that the wire is consumed and needs to be replaced with a new one before each firing. Thus, the plasma igniter is a onetime type.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Repeatable plasma igniters are known, for example in patent documents DE-103 35 890 (A1) and DE-40 28 411 (A1). The plasma igniters are built on the principle of spraying an electrically conductive liquid between two electrodes with an electrical potential difference, whereupon the electrical circuit is short-circuited and generates a discharge and a plasma generation. The use of liquids means complicated devices for dispensing and supplying, and also problems with possibly toxic, high-energy or easily ignitable substances. The use of liquids also requires a complicated logistics for handling of liquids.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Swedish patent application SE 1001194-8 shows a plasma igniter with ionization electrodes for ionization of a combustion chamber body, where the ionization makes possible an electrical flashover between two electrodes. The proposed plasma igniter is only partially adjustable for different lengths of the plasma igniter and different ignition energies.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Swedish patent application SE 1130128-0 shows a plasma igniter where filling gas in a combustion chamber is ionized by ionization electrodes energized with high voltage. The ionization in the combustion chamber makes possible an electrical flashover between two electrodes. The proposed plasma igniter has only ionization electrodes arranged on the outer enclosure of the plasma igniter. High pressure is generated in a plasma igniter, so that openings in the outer shell of the plasma igniter mean a risk of gas leakage or malfunction of the plasma igniter.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is desirable to solve the above-identified problem. It is also desirable to provide an improved plasma generator for repeatable initiation of propellant charges in a weapons system, avoiding complicated arrangements for dispensing and supplying of liquids between electrodes.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is also desirable to provide an improved plasma generator for repeatable initiation of propellant charges in a weapons system, where the length and ignition energy of the plasma generator can be adapted.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is also desirable to provide an improved plasma generator for repeatable initiation of propellant charges in a weapons system, where the plasma generator lacks openings in the outer shell of the plasma igniter.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is also desirable to provide an ammunition unit comprising said improved plasma generator.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">It is also desirable to provide a launching device comprising said improved plasma generator.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The neutral filling gas may be composed of atmosphere gas or residual gas from a previous firing. The electrical discharge may consist of or comprise a surface flashover, a volume flashover, or a transition from a surface flashover from bound charges in the surface of the combustion chamber body to a volume flashover in the combustion chamber channel. The volume flashover in the combustion chamber channel and the following power development increases the gas pressure in the combustion chamber and energy is surrendered via recombination between free electrons and ions, as well as neutral particles, to photons which dissociate and ionize the filling gas as well as the surface of the combustion chamber body. This surface thereby releases gas to the combustion chamber channel, which further increases the pressure and supplies further neutral particles to the volume, having a braking effect on the impedance collapse which occurs in the combustion chamber channel and increases the share of the electrical power in the combustion chamber, where the impedance does not drop to zero as in gas discharges with an open geometry. The pressure and the temperature rise in the combustion chamber expel the ignition gas with plasma-like and electrically conductive characteristics from the passageway of the one terminal to reach the propellant being initiated.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Thus, according to the present invention an improved plasma generator has been created for initiation of propellant charges in a weapons system, for example when launching projectiles from a barrel weapon, by electrical discharge between a rear electrode and a front electrode in a combustion chamber channel enclosed in a combustion chamber body and filled with filling gas, designed to ignite at least one propellant charge, where the plasma generator comprises at least one ionization electrode situated inside the enclosing combustion chamber body, where ionization electrodes are connected to an initiation circuit comprising at least one first high-voltage generator, for ionization of the filling gas in the combustion chamber channel (<b>3</b>), and a second high-voltage generator designed for electrical discharge in the electrically conductive gas from the rear electrode via at least one ionization electrode onward to the front electrode so that hot ignition gas under high pressure is formed.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Having at least one ionization electrode situated inside the enclosing combustion chamber body means that ionization electrodes do not penetrate the combustion chamber body.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Ionization electrodes are entirely enclosed by the combustion chamber body.

The flashover conductor is arranged as a piece projecting from the ionization electrodes, preferably sticking out from the conical holder <b>32</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The function and application of the plasma generator <b>1</b> according to the invention is as follows in the case when four ionization electrodes are used.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">During the firing and initiation of the plasma generator <b>1</b>, the capacitors <b>120</b>, <b>121</b> charged by the high-voltage generator <b>2</b> are made to discharge by the circuit breaker <b>130</b>. The capacitors <b>120</b>, <b>121</b> are connected to the ionization electrodes <b>100</b>, <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>103</b>, and the charge redistribution upon discharging of the capacitors brings about an ionization of the filling gas in the combustion chamber channel <b>3</b>. When the degree of ionization is such that plasma generation can be initiated, the second high-voltage generator <b>5</b> is made to produce a powerful electrical energy pulse, having a high current strength and/or a high voltage, both with a particular determined amplitude and pulse length adapted to the properties of the particular weapon, the temperature, the propellant charge, the projectile, the target, the surroundings, etc. The impedance of the plasma generator <b>1</b> is low in the active state, i.e., during the plasma generation, so that preferably a high current is generated from the second high-voltage generator <b>5</b>, on the order of 10 to 100 kA, but in order to have a successful flashover a high voltage is needed, on the order of 1 to 10 kV. To produce an effective plasma, for flashover of the propellant bed, each energy pulse should exceed 1 kJ, but it may be as much as 30 kJ, and is supplied to the plasma with a pulse length between 1 and 10 ms.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The design with multiple successive ionization electrodes <b>100</b>, <b>101</b>, <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> in the combustion chamber channel <b>3</b> causes the electrical flashover between the rear electrode <b>22</b> and the front electrode <b>24</b> to move step by step between the ionization electrodes. During the first flashover or discharge from the rear electrode <b>22</b> to the first ionization electrode <b>100</b>, UV light from the discharge ionizes the filling gas. The electrical field then moves from the rear electrode <b>22</b> to the first ionization electrode <b>100</b>, facilitating the next discharge from the ionization electrode <b>100</b> to the ionization electrode <b>101</b>. UV light is also produced during the discharge between the ionization electrodes <b>100</b> and <b>101</b> for further ionization and a further movement of the electrical field. In the same way, the electrical flashover occurs onward to the front electrode <b>21</b>. A very limited current will flow to ground in the ionization electrodes, since the resistance to ground is high. Most of the electrical energy in the high-voltage generator <b>5</b> will be discharged from the rear electrode <b>22</b> to the front electrode <b>21</b> and to the filling gas in the combustion chamber channel <b>3</b>. The resistors have a resistance on the order of 1 to 100 kOhm in order to limit the portion of the current flowing from the high-voltage generator <b>5</b> to ground via the ionization electrodes <b>100</b>, <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>103</b>. When the initiation of the plasma generator <b>1</b> occurs by the closing of the circuit breaker <b>130</b>, a charged voltage in the capacitors <b>120</b> and <b>121</b> is discharged partly across the circuit breaker <b>130</b> to ground, at the same time that a charge redistribution occurs from the ionization electrodes <b>100</b>, <b>101</b>, <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> and the capacitors <b>120</b> and <b>121</b>. The charge redistribution from the ionization electrode <b>100</b> occurs through the resistor <b>111</b> and the charge redistribution from the ionization electrode <b>103</b> occurs through the resistor <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The powerful electrical energy pulse generates an electrical flashover, also called an arc discharge, between the rear electrode <b>22</b> and the front electrode <b>21</b>, via the ionization electrodes <b>100</b>, <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>103</b>, and in the plasma channel created by the arc discharge the temperature becomes so high that the outermost layer of the conical holder <b>32</b> is melted, gasified, and finally ionized to form a very hot plasma. In one alternative embodiment, a substance supplied to the combustion chamber channel <b>3</b> can be part of the substance forming a plasma in connection with the arc discharge. It may also be the case that only the filling gas is ionized; in this case, none of the conical holder <b>32</b> is consumed. Moreover, it may be the case that an outer coating on the conical holder <b>32</b> is ionized and creates a plasma channel so that an arc discharge occurs between the rear electrode <b>22</b> and the front electrode <b>21</b>; in this case, none of the conical holder <b>32</b> is consumed. Due to the high pressure generated by the gasification in the combustion chamber channel <b>3</b>, the generated plasma-like gas is caused to spurt out through the gas outlet <b>24</b>, which gas outlet <b>24</b> is shaped like a nozzle. The pulse length, pulse shape, current strength and voltage can be varied according to the current conditions of the firing situation, such as the surrounding temperature, the humidity, etc., and the special properties of the particular weapons system and ammunition or projectile type, as well as the current target type, including the range to that target.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">A plasma generator with variable ignition energy enables an instantaneous flashover of the entire propellant charge and thereby makes possible an immediate pressure rise. A plasma generator also has the advantage that the ignition energy can be varied over time, unlike a pyrotechnical igniter. Variable ignition energy means that the ignition energy can be adapted to different types and sizes of propellant charges, so as to vary the firing range of the projectile, and also to compensate for the temperature dependence of the propellant charge. The quantum of energy with which the high-voltage generator <b>5</b> is charged is adapted according to the size and performance of the plasma generator <b>1</b>. Since the impedance in the electrical flashover between the rear electrode <b>22</b>, via the ionization electrodes <b>100</b>, <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>103</b>, to the front electrode <b>21</b> approaches zero, electrical energy is no longer supplied to the plasma channel. Since no energy is supplied to the plasma channel, the pulse from the high-voltage generator <b>5</b> can be interrupted or terminated. Preferably, the quantum of energy in the high-voltage generator <b>5</b> is thus adapted so that the impedance in the electrical flashover approaches zero when the high-voltage generator <b>5</b> is discharged. In this way, the plasma generator <b>1</b> is optimized in terms of energy.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Weapons systems can be ignited more easily and safely with the proposed repeatable plasma generator. The avoidance of vulnerable ignition substances and ignition cartridges means that complete use of propellants with low vulnerability can be adopted. Problems with difficult mechanisms such as one for changing of ignition cartridges or dispensing equipment for liquids can be avoided. The technique provides increased control over the parameters of the ignition pulse, such as energy content, pulse length, and ignition time. The ignition pulse can be adapted to the size of the propellant charge depending on the quantity of propellant, the sensitivity of the propellant, and the ambient temperature.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The example of a plasma generator according to the invention, intended for use in an artillery system as replacement for a conventional ignition cartridge, utilized energy pulses of around 1 to 10 kJ with duration of several milliseconds and voltage in the range of 5 to 20 kV.
