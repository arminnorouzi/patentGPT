The contents of that application are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an electromagnetic relay.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">For example, as shown in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application publication No. 2019-175603, an electromagnetic relay includes a fixed contact and a movable contact. When the movable contact contacts the fixed contact, electricity flows between the movable contact and the fixed contact. When the movable contact is separated from the fixed contact, electricity is cut off between the movable contact and the fixed contact. The fixed contact is connected to the fixed terminal. The movable contact is connected to the movable piece. The fixed terminal and the movable piece are supported by the base. A case is attached to the base.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">On the other hand, some electromagnetic relays are equipped with a magnet for extinguishing an arc. Due to the magnetic field from the magnet, Lorentz force acts on the arc generated between the fixed contact and the movable contact. The arc is quickly extinguished by being stretched by the Lorentz force.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to extinguish the arc quickly, it is desirable to have a large space around the contacts. Therefore, for example, by enlarging the base, a wide space is provided around the contacts. However, the base is a component that defines the positional relationship between the fixed terminal, the fixed contact, the movable piece, and the movable contact, and high dimensional accuracy is required. Therefore, it is not easy to redesign the base. In addition, when the shape of the base is changed, it is necessary to newly design a production line for electromagnetic relays. In that case, the manufacturing cost increases. An object of the present invention is to expand a space for extinguishing an arc in an electromagnetic relay while suppressing an increase in manufacturing cost.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An electromagnetic relay according to one aspect of the present invention includes a base, a fixed terminal, a fixed contact, a movable piece, a movable contact, a magnet, a base holder, and a case. The fixed terminal is supported by the base. The fixed contact is connected to the fixed terminal. The movable piece is supported by the base. The movable contact is connected to the movable piece and faces the fixed contact. The magnet exerts a Lorentz force on an arc generated between the fixed contact and the movable contact. The base holder is a separate body from the base. The base holder is attached to the base. The base holder is disposed in at least a direction in which the Lorentz force acts on the base. The case is attached to the base holder.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the electromagnetic relay according to the present aspect, the base holder is disposed in at least a direction in which the Lorentz force acts on the base. Therefore, in the case, a space for extinguishing the arc is expanded in the direction in which the Lorentz force acts. The base holder is a separate body from the base. Therefore, the space for extinguishing the arc is expanded without changing a shape of the base. As a result, the space for extinguishing the arc is expanded while suppressing an increase in manufacturing cost.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The magnet may be disposed above the fixed contact and the movable contact. In this case, the Lorentz force can act on the arc without the magnet interfering with a movement of the movable piece.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The movable contact may contact and separate from the fixed contact by moving in a front-rear direction. The Lorentz force may act in a left-right direction. The base holder may be disposed at least in the left-right direction of the base. In this case, the space for extinguishing the arc is expanded in the left-right direction on which the Lorentz force acts.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A direction in which the movable contact contacts the fixed contact is defined as forward. A direction in which the movable contact separates from the fixed contact is defined as rearward. The base holder may include a front holder portion, a rear holder portion, a left holder portion, and a right holder portion. The front holder portion may be disposed in front of the base. The rear holder portion may be disposed behind the base. The left holder portion may be disposed on a left side of the base. The right holder portion may be disposed on a right side of the base. In this case, the base holder is disposed on the front, rear, left and right sides of the base. Therefore, the base holder is firmly attached to the base.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The base holder may include an opening. The base may be disposed in the opening. In this case, the base holder can be easily attached to the base.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The base holder may include a holder frame and a convex portion. The holder frame may include an opening. The convex portion may protrude into the opening from the holder frame. The protrusion may contact the base from above. In this case, the convex portion prevents the base from coming off upward. As a result, the base holder is stably attached to the base.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The base holder may include a protrusion. The protrusion may protrude into the opening from the holder frame. The protrusion may support the base from below. In this case, the protrusion prevents the base from coming off downward. As a result, the base holder is stably attached to the base.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The base holder may include a step portion that supports the case from below. In this case, the case is stably supported by the base holder.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The case may include a magnet chamber. The magnet chamber may be disposed above the fixed contact and the movable contact. The magnet chamber may be partitioned from a space in the case. The magnet may be stored in the magnet chamber. In this case, the magnet can be easily disposed near the fixed contact and the movable contact.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The case may further include a lid that closes the magnet chamber and is made of a soft magnetic material. In this case, the lid functions as a yoke, so that the magnetic flux of the magnet is collected around the contacts. In addition, the magnetic flux of the magnet is less likely to leak out of the electromagnetic relay.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a side view of an electromagnetic relay in an open state according to an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a side view of the electromagnetic relay in a closed state.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is an enlarged side view of the electromagnetic relay.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a front view of the electromagnetic relay.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a perspective view of a base and a base holder.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a perspective view of the base and the base holder.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is an exploded perspective view of the base and the base holder.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a perspective view of the base holder.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a bottom view of the base holder.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Hereinafter, an electromagnetic relay <b>1</b> according to an embodiment will be described with reference to the drawings. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a side view of the electromagnetic relay <b>1</b> according to the embodiment.

When a current flows through the coil <b>16</b>, the magnetic force of the coil <b>16</b> attracts the first portion <b>23</b> of the armature <b>13</b> to the iron core <b>18</b>.
