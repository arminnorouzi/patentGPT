Plant breeding begins with the analysis and definition of problems and weaknesses of the current germplasm, the establishment of program goals, and the definition of specific breeding objectives. The next step is selection of germplasm that possess the traits to meet the program goals. The breeder's goal is to combine in a single variety or hybrid, various desirable traits. For field crops, these traits may include resistance to diseases and insects, resistance to heat and drought, reducing the time to crop maturity, greater yield, altered fatty acid profile, abiotic stress tolerance, improvements in compositional traits, and better agronomic characteristics and quality.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">These product development processes, which lead to the final step of marketing and distribution, can take from six to twelve years from the time the first cross is made until the finished seed is delivered to the farmer for planting. Therefore, development of new varieties and hybrids is a time-consuming process. A continuing goal of maize breeders is to develop stable, high yielding maize varieties and hybrids that are agronomically sound with maximal yield over one or more different conditions and environments.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Provided is a novel maize, Zea mays L., variety, designated 1PEVY61 and processes for making 1PEVY61. Seed of maize variety 1PEVY61, plants of maize variety 1PEVY61, plant parts and cells of maize variety 1PEVY61, and to processes for making a maize plant that comprise crossing maize variety 1PEVY61 with another maize plant are provided. Also provided are maize plants having all the physiological and morphological characteristics of the inbred maize variety 1PEVY61.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Processes are provided for making a maize plant containing in its genetic material one or more traits introgressed into 1PEVY61 through one or more of backcross conversion, genetic manipulation and transformation, and to the maize seed, plant and plant parts produced thereby. Hybrid maize seed, plants or plant parts produced by crossing the variety 1PEVY61 or a locus conversion of 1PEVY61 with another maize variety are also provided.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The inbred maize plant may further comprise a cytoplasmic or nuclear factor capable of conferring male sterility or otherwise preventing self-pollination, such as by self-incompatibility. Parts of the maize plant described herein are also provided, for example, pollen obtained from an inbred plant and an ovule of the inbred plant.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Seed of the inbred maize variety 1PEVY61 is provided. The inbred maize seed may be an essentially homogeneous population of inbred maize seed of the variety designated 1PEVY61. Essentially homogeneous populations of inbred seed are generally free from substantial numbers of other seed. Therefore, inbred seed generally forms at least about 97% of the total seed. The population of inbred maize seed may be particularly defined as being essentially free from hybrid seed. The inbred seed population may be separately grown to provide an essentially homogeneous population of inbred maize plants designated 1PEVY61.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Compositions are provided comprising a seed of maize variety 1PEVY61 comprised in plant seed growth media. In certain embodiments, the plant seed growth media is a soil or synthetic cultivation medium. In specific embodiments, the growth medium may be comprised in a container or may, for example, be soil in a field.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Maize variety 1PEVY61 comprising an added heritable trait is provided. The heritable trait may comprise a genetic locus that is a dominant or recessive allele. In certain embodiments, a plant of maize variety 1PEVY61 comprising a single locus conversion is provided. The locus conversion may be one which confers one or more traits such as, for example, male sterility, herbicide tolerance, insect resistance, disease resistance (including, for example) bacterial, fungal, nematode or viral disease, waxy starch, modified fatty acid metabolism, modified phytic acid metabolism, modified carbohydrate metabolism and modified protein metabolism is provided. The trait may be, for example, conferred by a naturally occurring maize gene introduced into the genome of the variety by backcrossing, a natural or induced mutation, or a transgene introduced through genetic transformation techniques. When introduced through transformation, a genetic locus may comprise one or more transgenes integrated at a single chromosomal location.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">An inbred maize plant of the variety designated 1PEVY61 is provided, wherein a cytoplasmically-inherited trait has been introduced into the inbred plant. Such cytoplasmically-inherited traits are passed to progeny through the female parent in a particular cross. An exemplary cytoplasmically-inherited trait is the male sterility trait. Cytoplasmic-male sterility (CMS) is a pollen abortion phenomenon determined by the interaction between the genes in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Alteration in the mitochondrial genome and the lack of restorer genes in the nucleus will lead to pollen abortion. With either a normal cytoplasm or the presence of restorer gene(s) in the nucleus, the plant will produce pollen normally. A CMS plant can be pollinated by a maintainer version of the same variety, which has a normal cytoplasm but lacks the restorer gene(s) in the nucleus and continues to be male sterile in the next generation. The male fertility of a CMS plant can be restored by a restorer version of the same variety, which has the restorer gene(s) in the nucleus. With the restorer gene(s) in the nucleus, the offspring of the male-sterile plant can produce normal pollen grains and propagate. A cytoplasmically inherited trait may be a naturally occurring maize trait or a trait introduced through genetic transformation techniques.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A tissue culture of regenerable cells of a plant of variety 1PEVY61 is provided. The tissue culture can be capable of regenerating plants capable of expressing all of the physiological and morphological or phenotypic characteristics of the variety, and of regenerating plants having substantially the same genotype as other plants of the variety. Examples of some of the physiological and morphological characteristics that may be assessed include characteristics related to yield, maturity, and kernel quality. The regenerable cells in such tissue cultures can be derived, for example, from embryos, meristematic cells, immature tassels, microspores, pollen, leaves, anthers, roots, root tips, silk, flowers, kernels, ears, cobs, husks, or stalks, or from callus or protoplasts derived from those tissues. Maize plants regenerated from the tissue cultures, and plants having all the physiological and morphological characteristics of variety 1PEVY61 are also provided.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Processes are provided for producing maize seeds or plants, which processes generally comprise crossing a first parent maize plant as a male or female parent with a second parent maize plant, wherein at least one of the first or second parent maize plants is a plant of the variety designated 1PEVY61. These processes may be further exemplified as processes for preparing hybrid maize seed or plants, wherein a first inbred maize plant is crossed with a second maize plant of a different, distinct variety to provide a hybrid that has, as one of its parents, the inbred maize plant variety 1PEVY61. In these processes, crossing will result in the production of seed. The seed production occurs regardless of whether the seed is collected or not.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments, the first step in &#x201c;crossing&#x201d; comprises planting, such as in pollinating proximity, seeds of a first and second parent maize plant, and preferably, seeds of a first inbred maize plant and a second, distinct inbred maize plant. Where the plants are not in pollinating proximity, pollination can be achieved by transferring a pollen or tassel bag from one plant to the other as described below.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">A second step comprises cultivating or growing the seeds of said first and second parent maize plants into plants that bear flowers&#x2014;male flowers (tassels) and female flowers (silks).</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">A third step comprises preventing self-pollination of the plants, i.e., preventing the silks of a plant from being fertilized by any plant of the same variety, including the same plant. This can be done by emasculating the male flowers of the first or second parent maize plant, (i.e., treating or manipulating the tassels so as to prevent pollen production, to produce an emasculated parent maize plant). Self-incompatibility systems may also be used in some hybrid crops for the same purpose. Self-incompatible plants still shed viable pollen and can pollinate plants of other varieties but are incapable of pollinating themselves or other plants of the same variety.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">A fourth step may comprise allowing cross-pollination to occur between the first and second parent maize plants. When the plants are not in pollinating proximity, this is done by placing a bag, usually paper or glassine, over the tassels of the first plant and another bag over the silks of the incipient ear on the second plant. The bags are left in place for at least 24 hours. Since pollen is viable for less than 24 hours, this assures that the silks are not pollinated from other pollen sources, that any stray pollen on the tassels of the first plant is dead, and that the only pollen transferred comes from the first plant. The pollen bag over the tassel of the first plant is then shaken vigorously to enhance release of pollen from the tassels, and the shoot bag is removed from the silks of the incipient ear on the second plant. Finally, the pollen bag is removed from the tassel of the first plant and is placed over the silks of the incipient ear of the second plant, shaken again and left in place. Yet another step comprises harvesting the seeds from at least one of the parent maize plants. The harvested seed can be grown to produce a maize plant or hybrid maize plant.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Also provided are maize seed and plants produced by a process that comprises crossing a first parent maize plant with a second parent maize plant, wherein at least one of the first or second parent maize plants is a plant of the variety designated 1PEVY61. In one embodiment, maize seed and plants produced by the process are first generation (F1) hybrid maize seed and plants produced by crossing an inbred with another, distinct plant such as another inbred. Seed of an F1 hybrid maize plant and an F1 hybrid maize plant and seed thereof are provided.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The genetic complement of the maize plant variety designated 1PEVY61 is provided. The phrase &#x201c;genetic complement&#x201d; is used to refer to the aggregate of nucleotide sequences, the expression of which sequences defines the phenotype of, in the present case, a maize plant, or a cell or tissue of that plant. A genetic complement thus represents the genetic make-up of an inbred cell, tissue or plant, and a hybrid genetic complement represents the genetic make-up of a hybrid cell, tissue or plant. Maize plant cells that have a genetic complement in accordance with the inbred maize plant cells disclosed herein, and plants, seeds and diploid plants containing such cells are provided.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Plant genetic complements may be assessed by genetic marker profiles, and by the expression of phenotypic traits that are characteristic of the expression of the genetic complement, e.g., isozyme typing profiles. It is understood that variety 1PEVY61 could be identified by any of the many well-known techniques used for genetic profiling disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In another aspect, hybrid genetic complements are provided, as represented by maize plant cells, tissues, plants, and seeds, formed by the combination of a haploid genetic complement of an inbred maize plant disclosed herein with a haploid genetic complement of a second maize plant, such as, another, distinct inbred maize plant. In another aspect, a maize plant regenerated from a tissue culture that comprises a hybrid genetic complement of the inbred maize plant disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Methods of producing an inbred maize plant derived from the maize variety 1PEVY61 are provided, the method comprising the steps of: (a) preparing a progeny plant derived from maize variety 1PEVY61, wherein said preparing comprises crossing a plant of the maize variety 1PEVY61 with a second maize plant; (b) crossing the progeny plant with itself or a second plant to produce a seed of a progeny plant of a subsequent generation; (c) repeating steps (a) and (b) with sufficient inbreeding until a seed of an inbred maize plant derived from the variety 1PEVY61 is produced. In the method, it may be desirable to select particular plants resulting from step (c) for continued crossing according to steps (b) and (c). By selecting plants having one or more desirable traits, an inbred maize plant derived from the maize variety 1PEVY61 is obtained which possesses some of the desirable traits of maize variety 1PEVY61 as well as potentially other selected traits.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">A new and distinctive maize inbred variety designated 1PEVY61, which has been the result of years of careful breeding and selection in a comprehensive maize breeding program is provided.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Definitions</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) can be referred to as maize or corn.

The variety has shown uniformity and stability within the limits of environmental influence for all the traits as described in the Variety Description Information (Table 1, found at the end of the section). The variety has been self-pollinated and ear-rowed a sufficient number of generations with careful attention paid to uniformity of plant type to ensure sufficient homozygosity and phenotypic stability for use in commercial hybrid seed production. The variety has been increased both by hand and in isolated fields with continued observation for uniformity. No variant traits have been observed or are expected in 1PEVY61.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Genotypic Characteristics of 1PEVY61</heading><p id="p-0177" num="0176">In addition to phenotypic observations, a plant can be identified by its genotype. The genotype of a plant can be characterized through a genetic marker profile.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0177">1PEVY61 is substantially homozygous. This homozygosity can be characterized at the loci shown in a marker profile. An F1 hybrid made with 1PEVY61 would substantially comprise the marker profile of 1PEVY61. This is because an F1 hybrid is the sum of its inbred parents, e.g., if one inbred parent is homozygous for allele x at a particular locus, and the other inbred parent is homozygous for allele y at that locus, the F1 hybrid will be xy (heterozygous) at that locus. A genetic marker profile can therefore be used to identify hybrids comprising 1PEVY61 as a parent, since such hybrids will comprise two sets of alleles, one set of which will be from 1PEVY61. The determination of the male set of alleles and the female set of alleles may be made by profiling the hybrid and the pericarp of the hybrid seed, which is composed of maternal parent cells. One way to obtain the paternal parent profile is to subtract the pericarp profile from the hybrid profile.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0178">Subsequent generations of progeny produced by selection and breeding are expected to be of genotype xx (homozygous), yy (homozygous), or xy (heterozygous) for these locus positions. When the F1 plant is used to produce an inbred, the resulting inbred should be either x or y for that allele.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0179">Therefore, in accordance with the above, an embodiment is a 1PEVY61 progeny maize plant or plant part that is a first generation (F1) hybrid maize plant comprising two sets of alleles, wherein one set of the alleles is the same as 1PEVY61 at substantially all loci. A maize cell wherein one set of the alleles is the same as 1PEVY61 at substantially all loci is also provided. This maize cell may be a part of a hybrid seed, plant or plant part produced by crossing 1PEVY61 with another maize plant.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0180">Genetic marker profiles can be obtained by techniques such as Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms (RFLPs), Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNAs (RAPDs), Arbitrarily Primed Polymerase Chain Reaction (AP-PCR), DNA Amplification Fingerprinting (DAF), Sequence Characterized Amplified Regions (SCARs), Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLPs), Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs) which are also referred to as Microsatellites, and Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs).</p><p id="p-0182" num="0181">Particular markers used for these purposes may include any type of marker and marker profile which provides a means of distinguishing varieties. A genetic marker profile can be used, for example, to identify plants of the same variety or related varieties or to determine or validate a pedigree. In addition to being used for identification of maize variety 1PEVY61, a hybrid produced through the use of 1PEVY61, and the identification or verification of pedigree for progeny plants produced through the use of 1PEVY61, a genetic marker profile is also useful in developing a locus conversion of 1PEVY61.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0182">Methods of isolating nucleic acids from maize plants and methods for performing genetic marker profiles using SNP and SSR polymorphisms are well known in the art. SNPs are genetic markers based on a polymorphism in a single nucleotide. A marker system based on SNPs can be highly informative in linkage analysis relative to other marker systems in that multiple alleles may be present.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0183">A method comprising isolating nucleic acids, such as DNA, from a plant, a plant part, plant cell or a seed of the maize plants disclosed herein is provided. The method can include mechanical, electrical and/or chemical disruption of the plant, plant part, plant cell or seed, contacting the disrupted plant, plant part, plant cell or seed with a buffer or solvent, to produce a solution or suspension comprising nucleic acids, optionally contacting the nucleic acids with a precipitating agent to precipitate the nucleic acids, optionally extracting the nucleic acids, and optionally separating the nucleic acids such as by centrifugation or by binding to beads or a column, with subsequent elution, or a combination thereof. If DNA is being isolated, an RNase can be included in one or more of the method steps. The nucleic acids isolated can comprise all or substantially all of the genomic DNA sequence, all or substantially all of the chromosomal DNA sequence or all or substantially all of the coding sequences (cDNA) of the plant, plant part, or plant cell from which they were isolated. The amount and type of nucleic acids isolated may be sufficient to permit whole genome sequencing of the plant from which they were isolated or chromosomal marker analysis of the plant from which they were isolated.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0184">The methods can be used to produce nucleic acids from the plant, plant part, seed or cell, which nucleic acids can be, for example, analyzed to produce data. The data can be recorded. The nucleic acids from the disrupted cell, the disrupted plant, plant part, plant cell or seed or the nucleic acids following isolation or separation can be contacted with primers and nucleotide bases, and/or a polymerase to facilitate PCR sequencing or marker analysis of the nucleic acids. In some examples, the nucleic acids produced can be sequenced or contacted with markers to produce a genetic profile, a molecular profile, a marker profile, a haplotype, or any combination thereof. In some examples, the genetic profile or nucleotide sequence is recorded on a computer readable medium. In other examples, the methods may further comprise using the nucleic acids produced from plants, plant parts, plant cells or seeds in a plant breeding program, for example in making crosses, selection and/or advancement decisions in a breeding program. Crossing includes any type of plant breeding crossing method, including but not limited to crosses to produce hybrids, outcrossing, selfing, backcrossing, locus conversion, introgression and the like.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0185">Favorable genotypes and or marker profiles, optionally associated with a trait of interest, may be identified by one or more methodologies. In some examples one or more markers are used, including but not limited to AFLPs, RFLPs, ASH, SSRs, SNPs, indels, padlock probes, molecular inversion probes, microarrays, sequencing, and the like. In some methods, a target nucleic acid is amplified prior to hybridization with a probe. In other cases, the target nucleic acid is not amplified prior to hybridization, such as methods using molecular inversion probes (see, for example Hardenbol et al. (2003) Nat Biotech 21:673-678). In some examples, the genotype related to a specific trait is monitored, while in other examples, a genome-wide evaluation including but not limited to one or more of marker panels, library screens, association studies, microarrays, gene chips, expression studies, or sequencing such as whole-genome resequencing and genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) may be used. In some examples, no target-specific probe is needed, for example by using sequencing technologies, including but not limited to next-generation sequencing methods (see, for example, Metzker (2010) Nat Rev Genet 11:31-46; and, Egan et al. (2012) Am J Bot 99:175-185) such as sequencing by synthesis (e.g., Roche 454 pyrosequencing, Illumina Genome Analyzer, and Ion Torrent PGM or Proton systems), sequencing by ligation (e.g., SOLiD from Applied Biosystems, and Polnator system from Azco Biotech), and single molecule sequencing (SMS or third-generation sequencing) which eliminate template amplification (e.g., Helicos system, and PacBio RS system from Pacific BioSciences). Further technologies include optical sequencing systems (e.g., Starlight from Life Technologies), and nanopore sequencing (e.g., GridION from Oxford Nanopore Technologies). Each of these may be coupled with one or more enrichment strategies for organellar or nuclear genomes in order to reduce the complexity of the genome under investigation via PCR, hybridization, restriction enzyme and expression methods. In some examples, no reference genome sequence is needed in order to complete the analysis. 1PEVY61 and its plant parts can be identified through a molecular marker profile. Such plant parts may be either diploid or haploid. The plant part includes at least one cell of the plant from which it was obtained, such as a diploid cell, a haploid cell or a somatic cell. Also provided are plants and plant parts substantially benefiting from the use of variety 1PEVY61 in their development, such as variety 1PEVY61 comprising a locus conversion.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Comparing 1PEVY61 to Other Inbreds</heading><p id="p-0187" num="0186">A breeder uses various methods to help determine which plants should be selected from segregating populations and ultimately which inbred varieties will be used to develop hybrids for commercialization. In addition to knowledge of the germplasm and plant genetics, a part of the selection process is dependent on experimental design coupled with the use of statistical analysis. Experimental design and statistical analysis are used to help determine which plants, which family of plants, and finally which inbred varieties and hybrid combinations are significantly better or different for one or more traits of interest. Experimental design methods are used to assess error so that differences between two inbred varieties or two hybrid varieties can be more accurately evaluated. Statistical analysis includes the calculation of mean values, determination of the statistical significance of the sources of variation, and the calculation of the appropriate variance components. Either a five or a one percent significance level is customarily used to determine whether a difference that occurs for a given trait is real or due to the environment or experimental error. One of ordinary skill in the art of plant breeding would know how to evaluate the traits of two plant varieties to determine if there is a significant difference between the two traits expressed by those varieties. For example, see Fehr, Walt, Principles of Cultivar Development, p. 261-286 (1987). Mean trait values may be used to determine whether trait differences are significant. Trait values should preferably be measured on plants grown under the same environmental conditions, and environmental conditions should be appropriate for the traits or traits being evaluated. Sufficient selection pressure should be present for optimum measurement of traits of interest such as herbicide tolerance, insect or disease resistance. A locus conversion of 1PEVY61 for herbicide tolerance should be compared with an isogenic counterpart in the absence of the converted trait. In addition, a locus conversion for insect or disease resistance should be compared to the isogenic counterpart, in the absence of disease pressure or insect pressure.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Development of Maize Hybrids using 1PEVY61</heading><p id="p-0188" num="0187">A single cross maize hybrid results from the cross of two inbred varieties, each of which has a genotype that complements the genotype of the other. A hybrid progeny of the first generation is designated F1. In the development of commercial hybrids in a maize plant breeding program, only the F1 hybrid plants are sought. F1 hybrids are more vigorous than their inbred parents. This hybrid vigor, or heterosis, can be manifested in many polygenic traits, including increased vegetative growth and increased yield.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0188">1PEVY61 may be used to produce hybrid maize. One such embodiment is the method of crossing maize variety 1PEVY61 with another maize plant, such as a different maize variety, to form a first generation F1 hybrid seed. The first generation F1 hybrid seed, plant and plant part produced by this method are provided. The first generation F1 seed, plant and plant part will comprise an essentially complete set of the alleles of variety 1PEVY61. One of ordinary skill in the art can utilize molecular methods to identify a particular F1 hybrid plant produced using variety 1PEVY61. Further, one of ordinary skill in the art may also produce F1 hybrids with transgenic, male sterile and/or locus conversions of variety 1PEVY61.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0189">The development of a maize hybrid in a maize plant breeding program involves three steps: (1) the selection of plants from various germplasm pools for initial breeding crosses; (2) the selfing of the selected plants from the breeding crosses for several generations to produce a series of varieties, such as 1PEVY61, which, although different from each other, breed true and are highly uniform; and (3) crossing the selected varieties with different varieties to produce the hybrids. During the inbreeding process in maize, the vigor of the varieties decreases, and so one would not be likely to use 1PEVY61 directly to produce grain. However, vigor is restored when 1PEVY61 is crossed to a different inbred variety to produce a commercial F1 hybrid. A consequence of the homozygosity and homogeneity of the inbred variety is that the hybrid between a defined pair of inbreds may be reproduced indefinitely as long as the homogeneity of the inbred parents is maintained.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0190">1PEVY61 may be used to produce a single cross hybrid, a double cross hybrid, or a three-way hybrid. A single cross hybrid is produced when two inbred varieties are crossed to produce the F1 progeny. A double cross hybrid is produced from four inbred varieties crossed in pairs (A&#xd7;B and C&#xd7;D) and then the two F1 hybrids are crossed again (A&#xd7;B)&#xd7;(C&#xd7;D). A three-way cross hybrid is produced from three inbred varieties where two of the inbred varieties are crossed (A&#xd7;B) and then the resulting F1 hybrid is crossed with the third inbred (A&#xd7;B)&#xd7;C. In each case, pericarp tissue from the female parent will be a part of and protect the hybrid seed.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0191">Molecular data from 1PEVY61 may be used in a plant breeding process. Nucleic acids may be isolated from a seed of 1PEVY61 or from a plant, plant part, or cell produced by growing a seed of 1PEVY61,or from a seed of 1PEVY61 with a locus conversion, or from a plant, plant part, or cell of 1PEVY61 with a locus conversion. One or more polymorphisms may be isolated from the nucleic acids. A plant having one or more of the identified polymorphisms may be selected and used in a plant breeding method to produce another plant.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Combining Ability of 1PEVY61</heading><p id="p-0193" num="0192">Combining ability of a variety, as well as the performance of the variety per se, is a factor in the selection of improved maize inbreds. Combining ability refers to a variety's contribution as a parent when crossed with other varieties to form hybrids. The hybrids formed for the purpose of selecting superior varieties may be referred to as test crosses, and include comparisons to other hybrid varieties grown in the same environment (same cross, location and time of planting). One way of measuring combining ability is by using values based in part on the overall mean of a number of test crosses weighted by number of experiment and location combinations in which the hybrid combinations occurs. The mean may be adjusted to remove environmental effects and known genetic relationships among the varieties.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0193">General combining ability provides an overall score for the inbred over a large number of test crosses. Specific combining ability provides information on hybrid combinations formed by 1PEVY61 and a specific inbred parent. A variety such as 1PEVY61 which exhibits good general combining ability may be used in a large number of hybrid combinations.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0194">Hybrid comparisons represent specific hybrid crosses with 1PEVY61 and a comparison of these specific hybrids with other hybrids with favorable characteristics. These comparisons illustrate the good specific combining ability of 1PEVY61. A specific hybrid for which 1PEVY61 is a parent is compared with other hybrids. Numerous species of the genus of F1 hybrids created with 1PEVY61 have been reduced to practice. These comparisons illustrate the good specific combining ability of 1PEVY61 or 1PEVY61 comprising locus conversions.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Introduction of a new trait or locus into 1PEVY61</heading><p id="p-0196" num="0195">Inbred 1PEVY61 represents a new base genetic variety into which a new locus or trait may be introduced or introgressed. Transformation and backcrossing represent two methods that can be used to accomplish such an introgression. The term locus conversion is used to designate the product of such an introgression.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0196">A backcross or locus conversion of 1PEVY61 occurs when DNA sequences are introduced through backcrossing, with 1PEVY61 utilized as the recurrent parent. Both naturally occurring, modified and transgenic DNA sequences may be introduced through backcrossing techniques. A backcross or locus conversion may produce a plant with a trait or locus conversion in at least one or more backcrosses, including at least 2 backcrosses, at least 3 backcrosses, at least 4 backcrosses, at least 5 backcrosses and the like. Molecular marker assisted breeding or selection may be utilized to reduce the number of backcrosses necessary to achieve the backcross conversion.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0197">The complexity of the backcross conversion method depends on the type of trait being transferred (a single gene or closely linked genes compared to unlinked genes), the level of expression of the trait, the type of inheritance (cytoplasmic or nuclear), dominant or recessive trait expression, and the types of parents included in the cross. It is understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that for single locus or gene traits that are relatively easy to classify, the backcross method is effective and relatively easy to manage. Desired traits that may be transferred through backcross conversion include, but are not limited to, waxy starch, sterility (nuclear and cytoplasmic), fertility restoration, grain color (white), nutritional enhancements, drought tolerance, nitrogen utilization, altered fatty acid profile, increased digestibility, low phytate, industrial enhancements, disease resistance (bacterial, fungal, or viral), insect resistance, and herbicide tolerance or resistance. A locus conversion, also called a trait conversion, can be a native trait or a transgenic trait. In addition, an recombination site itself, such as an FRT site, Lox site, or other site specific integration site may be inserted by backcrossing and utilized for direct insertion of one or more genes of interest into a specific plant variety. A single locus may contain several transgenes, such as a transgene for disease resistance that, in the same expression vector, also contains a transgene for herbicide tolerance or resistance. The gene for herbicide tolerance or resistance may be used as a selectable marker and/or as a phenotypic trait. A single locus conversion of a site specific integration system allows for the integration of multiple genes at a known recombination site in the genome. At least one, at least two or at least three and less than ten, less than nine, less than eight, less than seven, less than six, less than five or less than four locus conversions may be introduced into the plant by backcrossing, introgression or transformation to express the desired trait, while the plant, or a plant grown from the seed, plant part or plant cell, otherwise retains the phenotypic characteristics of the deposited seed when grown under the same environmental conditions.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0198">The backcross or locus conversion may result from either the transfer of a dominant allele or a recessive allele. Selection of progeny containing the trait of interest can be accomplished by direct selection for a trait associated with a dominant allele. Transgenes transferred via backcrossing typically function as a dominant single gene trait and are relatively easy to classify. Selection of progeny for a trait that is transferred via a recessive allele, such as the waxy starch characteristic, requires growing and selfing the first backcross generation to determine which plants carry the recessive alleles. Recessive traits may require additional progeny testing in successive backcross generations to determine the presence of the locus of interest. The last backcross generation is usually selfed to give pure breeding progeny for the gene(s) being transferred, although a backcross conversion with a stably introgressed trait may also be maintained by further backcrossing to the recurrent parent with selection for the converted trait.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0199">Along with selection for the trait of interest, progeny are selected for the phenotype and/or genotype of the recurrent parent. While occasionally additional polynucleotide sequences or genes may be transferred along with the backcross conversion, the backcross conversion variety &#x201c;fits into the same hybrid combination as the recurrent parent inbred variety and contributes the effect of the additional locus added through the backcross.&#x201d; Poehlman et al (1995) <i>Breeding Field Crop, </i>4th Ed., Iowa State University Press, Ames, Iowa., pp. 132-155 and 321-344. When one or more traits are introgressed into the variety a difference in quantitative agronomic traits, such as yield or dry down, between the variety and an introgressed version of the variety in some environments may occur. For example, the introgressed version may provide a net yield increase in environments where the trait provides a benefit, such as when a variety with an introgressed trait for insect resistance is grown in an environment where insect pressure exists, or when a variety with herbicide tolerance is grown in an environment where herbicide is used.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0200">One process for adding or modifying a trait or locus in maize variety 1PEVY61 comprises crossing 1PEVY61 plants grown from 1PEVY61 seed with plants of another maize variety that comprise the desired trait or locus, selecting F1 progeny plants that comprise the desired trait or locus to produce selected F1 progeny plants, crossing the selected progeny plants with the 1PEVY61 plants to produce backcross progeny plants, selecting for backcross progeny plants that have the desired trait or locus and the phenotypic characteristics of maize variety 1PEVY61 to produce selected backcross progeny plants; and backcrossing to 1PEVY61 one or more times in succession to produce backcross progeny plants that comprise the trait or locus.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0201">The modified 1PEVY61 or a plant otherwise derived from 1PEVY61 may be further characterized as having all or essentially all of the phenotypic characteristics, or essentially all of the morphological and physiological characteristics of maize variety 1PEVY61, such as those listed in Table 1 and/or may be characterized by percent identity to 1PEVY61 as determined by molecular markers, such as SSR markers or SNP markers. By essentially all of the phenotypic or morphological and physiological characteristics, it is meant that all of the characteristics of a plant are recovered that are otherwise present when compared in the same environment, other than an occasional variant trait that might arise during backcrossing or direct introduction of a transgene. Such traits may be determined, for example, relative to the traits listed in Table 1 as determined at the 5% significance level when grown under the same environmental conditions.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0202">In addition, the above process and other similar processes described herein may be used to produce F1 hybrid maize seed by adding a step at the end of the process that comprises crossing 1PEVY61 with the locus conversion with a different maize plant and harvesting the resultant F1 hybrid maize seed.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0203">Traits are also used by those of ordinary skill in the art to characterize progeny. Traits are commonly evaluated at a significance level, such as a 1%, 5% or 10% significance level, when measured in plants grown in the same environmental conditions.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">Male Sterility and Hybrid Seed Production</heading><p id="p-0205" num="0204">Hybrid seed production requires elimination or inactivation of pollen produced by the female inbred parent. Incomplete removal or inactivation of the pollen provides the potential for self-pollination. A reliable method of controlling male fertility in plants offers the opportunity for improved seed production.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0205">1PEVY61 can be produced in a male-sterile form. There are several ways in which a maize plant can be manipulated so that it is male sterile. These include use of manual or mechanical emasculation (or detasseling), use of one or more genetic factors that confer male sterility, including cytoplasmic genetic and/or nuclear genetic male sterility, use of gametocides and the like. A male sterile designated 1PEVY61 may include one or more genetic factors, which result in cytoplasmic genetic and/or nuclear genetic male sterility. All of such embodiments are within the scope of the present claims. The male sterility may be either partial or complete male sterility.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0206">Hybrid maize seed is often produced by a male sterility system incorporating manual or mechanical detasseling. Alternate strips of two maize inbreds are planted in a field, and the pollen-bearing tassels are removed from one of the inbreds (female). Provided that there is sufficient isolation from sources of foreign maize pollen, the ears of the detasseled inbred will be fertilized only from the other inbred (male), and the resulting seed is therefore hybrid and will form hybrid plants.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0207">The laborious detasseling process can be avoided by using cytoplasmic male-sterile (CMS) inbreds. Plants of a CMS inbred are male sterile as a result of genetic factors in the cytoplasm, as opposed to the nucleus, and so nuclear linked genes are not transferred during backcrossing. Thus, this characteristic is inherited exclusively through the female parent in maize plants, since only the female provides cytoplasm to the fertilized seed. CMS plants are fertilized with pollen from another inbred that is not male-sterile. Pollen from the second inbred may or may not contribute genes that make the hybrid plants male-fertile, and either option may be preferred depending on the intended use of the hybrid. The same hybrid seed, a portion produced from detasseled fertile maize and a portion produced using the CMS system, can be blended to insure that adequate pollen loads are available for fertilization when the hybrid plants are grown. CMS systems have been successfully used since the 1950's and the male sterility trait is routinely backcrossed into inbred varieties.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0208">There are several methods of conferring genetic male sterility available, such as multiple mutant genes at separate locations within the genome that confer male sterility, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,654,465 and 4,727,219. and chromosomal translocations as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,861,709 and 3,710,511. In addition to these methods U.S. Pat. No. 5,432,068 describes a system of nuclear male sterility which includes: identifying a gene which is needed for male fertility; silencing this native gene which is needed for male fertility; removing the native promoter from the essential male fertility gene and replacing it with an inducible promoter; inserting this genetically engineered gene back into the plant; and thus creating a plant that is male sterile because the inducible promoter is not &#x201c;on&#x201d; resulting in the male fertility gene not being transcribed. Fertility is restored by inducing, or turning &#x201c;on&#x201d;, the promoter, which in turn allows the gene that confers male fertility to be transcribed.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0209">These, and the other methods of conferring genetic male sterility in the art, each possess their own benefits and drawbacks. Some other methods use a variety of approaches such as delivering into the plant a gene encoding a cytotoxic substance associated with a male tissue specific promoter or an antisense system in which a gene needed for fertility is identified and an antisense to that gene is inserted in the plant (see EP 89/3010153.8 publication no. 329,308 and PCT application PCT/CA90/00037 published as WO 90/08828).</p><p id="p-0211" num="0210">Another system for controlling male sterility makes use of gametocides. Gametocides are not a genetic system, but rather a topical application of chemicals. These chemicals affect cells that are needed for male fertility. The application of these chemicals affects fertility in the plants only for the growing season in which the gametocide is applied (see U.S. Pat. No.: 4,936,904). Application of the gametocide, timing of the application and genotype specificity often limit the usefulness of the approach and it is not appropriate in all situations.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0211">Incomplete control over male fertility may result in self-pollinated seed being unintentionally harvested and packaged with hybrid seed. This would typically be only female parent seed, because the male plant is grown in rows that are typically destroyed prior to seed development. Once the seed from the hybrid bag is planted, it is possible to identify and select these self-pollinated plants. These self-pollinated plants will be one of the inbred varieties used to produce the hybrid. Though the possibility of 1PEVY61 being included in a hybrid seed bag exists, the occurrence is very low because much care is taken by seed companies to avoid such inclusions. It is worth noting that hybrid seed is sold to growers for the production of grain or forage and not for breeding or seed production. These self-pollinated plants can be identified and selected by one skilled in the art due to their less vigorous appearance for vegetative and/or reproductive characteristics, including shorter plant height, small ear size, ear and kernel shape, or other characteristics.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0212">Identification of these self-pollinated varieties can also be accomplished through molecular marker analyses. Through these technologies, the homozygosity of the self-pollinated variety can be verified by analyzing allelic composition at various loci along the genome. Those methods allow for rapid identification of the plants disclosed herein.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Transformation</heading><p id="p-0214" num="0213">Transgenes and transformation methods facilitate engineering of the genome of plants to contain and express heterologous genetic elements, such as foreign genetic elements, or additional copies of endogenous elements, or modified versions of native or endogenous genetic elements in order to alter at least one trait of a plant in a specific manner. Any sequences, such as DNA, whether from a different species or from the same species, which have been stably inserted into a genome using transformation are referred to herein collectively as &#x201c;transgenes&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;transgenic events&#x201d;. Transgenes can be moved from one genome to another using breeding techniques which may include crossing, backcrossing or double haploid production. In some embodiments, a transformed variant of 1PEVY61 may comprise at least one transgene but could contain at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and/or no more than 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, or 2. Transformed versions of the claimed maize variety 1PEVY61 as well as hybrid combinations containing and inheriting the transgene thereof are provided. F1 hybrid seed are provided which are produced by crossing a different maize plant with maize variety 1PEVY61 comprising a transgene introduced into maize variety 1PEVY61 by backcrossing or genetic transformation and which transgene is inherited by the F1 hybrid seed.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0214">Numerous methods for plant transformation have been developed, including biological and physical plant transformation protocols. In addition, expression vectors and in vitro culture methods for plant cell or tissue transformation and regeneration of plants are available.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0215">In general, methods to transform, modify, edit or alter plant endogenous genomic DNA include altering the plant native DNA sequence or a pre-existing transgenic sequence including regulatory elements, coding and non-coding sequences. These methods can be used, for example, to target nucleic acids to pre-engineered target recognition sequences in the genome. Such pre-engineered target sequences may be introduced by genome editing or modification. As an example, a genetically modified plant variety is generated using &#x201c;custom&#x201d; or engineered endonucleases such as meganucleases produced to modify plant genomes (see e.g., WO 2009/114321; Gao et al. (2010) Plant Journal 1:176-187). Another site-directed engineering method is through the use of zinc finger domain recognition coupled with the restriction properties of restriction enzyme. A transcription activator-like (TAL) effector-DNA modifying enzyme (TALE or TALEN) is also used to engineer changes in plant genome. See e.g., US20110145940. Site-specific modification of plant genomes can also be performed using the bacterial type II CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas (CRISPR-associated) system. The Cas9/guide RNA-based system allows targeted cleavage of genomic DNA guided by a customizable small noncoding RNA in plants (see e.g., WO 2015026883A1).</p><p id="p-0217" num="0216">Plant transformation methods may involve the construction of an expression vector. Such a vector comprises a DNA sequence that contains a gene under the control of or operatively linked to a regulatory element, for example a promoter. The vector may contain one or more genes and one or more regulatory elements.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0217">A transgenic event which has been stably engineered into the germ cell line of a particular maize plant using transformation techniques, could be moved into the germ cell line of another variety using traditional breeding techniques that are well known in the plant breeding arts. For example, a backcrossing approach is commonly used to move a transgenic event from a transformed maize plant to another variety, and the resulting progeny would then comprise the transgenic event(s). Also, if an inbred variety was used for the transformation then the transgenic plants could be crossed to a different inbred in order to produce a transgenic hybrid maize plant.</p><p id="p-0219" num="0218">Various genetic elements can be introduced into the plant genome using transformation. These elements include, but are not limited to genes, coding sequences; inducible, constitutive, and tissue specific promoters; enhancing sequences; and signal and targeting sequences. For example, see the traits, genes and transformation methods listed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,118,055 and 6,284,953. In addition, transformability of a variety can be increased by introgressing the trait of high transformability from another variety known to have high transformability, such as Hi-II. See US Patent Publication US2004/0016030.</p><p id="p-0220" num="0219">With transgenic or genetically modified plants, a foreign protein can be produced in commercial quantities. Thus, techniques for the selection and propagation of transformed plants, which are well understood in the art, yield a plurality of transgenic or genetically modified plants that are harvested in a conventional manner, and a foreign protein then can be extracted from a tissue of interest or from total biomass. Protein extraction from plant biomass can be accomplished by known methods.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0220">Transgenic events can be mapped by one of ordinary skill in the art and such techniques are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0221">Plants can be genetically engineered or modified to express various phenotypes of agronomic interest. Through the transformation or modification of maize the expression of genes can be altered to enhance disease resistance, insect resistance, herbicide tolerance, agronomic traits, grain quality and other traits. Transformation can also be used to insert DNA sequences which control or help control male-sterility. DNA sequences native to maize as well as non-native DNA sequences can be transformed into maize and used to alter levels of native or non-native proteins. Various promoters, targeting sequences, enhancing sequences, and other DNA sequences can be inserted into the maize genome for the purpose of altering the expression of proteins. Reduction of the activity of specific genes (also known as gene silencing, or gene suppression) is desirable for several aspects of genetic engineering in plants.</p><p id="p-0223" num="0222">Many techniques for gene silencing are well known to one of skill in the art, including but not limited to knock-outs (such as by insertion of a transposable element such as mu (Vicki Chandler, <i>The Maize Handbook </i>Ch. 118 (Springer-Verlag 1994) or other genetic elements such as a FRT, Lox or other site specific integration site, antisense technology (see, e.g., Sheehy et al.

However, varieties such as 1PEVY61 also provide a source of breeding material that may be used to develop new maize inbred varieties. Plant breeding techniques known in the art and used in a maize plant breeding program include, but are not limited to, recurrent selection, mass selection, bulk selection, mass selection, backcrossing, pedigree breeding, open pollination breeding, restriction fragment length polymorphism enhanced selection, genetic marker enhanced selection, making double haploids, and transformation. Often combinations of these techniques are used. The development of maize hybrids in a maize plant breeding program requires, in general, the development of homozygous inbred varieties, the crossing of these varieties, and the evaluation of the crosses. There are many analytical methods available to evaluate the result of a cross. The oldest and most traditional method of analysis is the observation of phenotypic traits but genotypic analysis may also be used.</p><p id="p-0279" num="0278">Methods for producing a maize plant by crossing a first parent maize plant with a second parent maize plant wherein either the first or second parent maize plant is a maize plant of the variety 1PEVY61 are provided. The other parent may be any other maize plant, such as another inbred variety or a plant that is part of a synthetic or natural population. Any such methods may be used with the maize variety 1PEVY61 such as selfing, sibbing, backcrosses, mass selection, pedigree breeding, bulk selection, hybrid production, crosses to populations, and the like. These methods are well known in the art and some of the more commonly used breeding methods are described below.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">Pedigree Breeding</heading><p id="p-0280" num="0279">Pedigree breeding starts with the crossing of two genotypes, such as 1PEVY61 and one other inbred variety having one or more desirable characteristics that is lacking or which complements 1PEVY61. If the two original parents do not provide all the desired characteristics, other sources can be included in the breeding population. In the pedigree method, superior plants are selfed and selected in successive filial generations. In the succeeding filial generations the heterozygous condition gives way to homogeneous varieties as a result of self-pollination and selection. Typically in the pedigree method of breeding, five or more successive filial generations of selfing and selection is practiced: F1&#x2192;F2; F2&#x2192;F3; F3&#x2192;F4; F4&#x2192;F5, etc. After a sufficient amount of inbreeding, successive filial generations will serve to increase seed of the developed inbred. Preferably, the inbred variety comprises homozygous alleles at about 95% or more of its loci.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="1">Recurrent Selection and Mass Selection</heading><p id="p-0281" num="0280">Recurrent selection is a method used in a plant breeding program to improve a population of plants. 1PEVY61 is suitable for use in a recurrent selection program. The method entails individual plants cross pollinating with each other to form progeny. The progeny are grown and the superior progeny selected by any number of selection methods, which include individual plant, half-sib progeny, full-sib progeny, selfed progeny and toperossing. The selected progeny are cross pollinated with each other to form progeny for another population. This population is planted and again superior plants are selected to cross pollinate with each other. Recurrent selection is a cyclical process and can be repeated as many times as desired. The objective of recurrent selection is to improve the traits of a population. The improved population can then be used as a source of breeding material to obtain inbred varieties to be used in hybrids or used as parents for a synthetic cultivar. A synthetic cultivar is the resultant progeny formed by the intercrossing of several selected inbreds.</p><p id="p-0282" num="0281">1PEVY61 is suitable for use in mass selection. Mass selection is a useful technique when used in conjunction with molecular marker enhanced selection. In mass selection seeds from individuals are selected based on phenotype and/or genotype. These selected seeds are then bulked and used to grow the next generation. Bulk selection requires growing a population of plants in a bulk plot, allowing the plants to self-pollinate, harvesting the seed in bulk and then using a sample of the seed harvested in bulk to plant the next generation. Instead of self pollination, directed pollination could be used as part of the breeding program.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="1">Mutation Breeding</heading><p id="p-0283" num="0282">Mutation breeding is one of many methods that could be used to introduce new traits into 1PEVY61. 1PEVY61 is suitable for use in a mutation breeding program. Mutations that occur spontaneously or are artificially induced can be useful sources of variability for a plant breeder. The goal of artificial mutagenesis is to increase the rate of mutation for a desired characteristic. Mutation rates can be increased by many different means including temperature, long-term seed storage, tissue culture conditions, radiation; such as X-rays, Gamma rays (e.g. cobalt 60 or cesium 137), neutrons, (product of nuclear fission by uranium 235 in an atomic reactor), Beta radiation (emitted from radioisotopes such as phosphorus 32 or carbon 14), or ultraviolet radiation (preferably from 2500 to 2900 nm), or chemical mutagens (such as base analogues (5-bromo-uracil), related compounds (8-ethoxy caffeine), antibiotics (streptonigrin), alkylating agents (sulfur mustards, nitrogen mustards, epoxides, ethylenamines, sulfates, sulfonates, sulfones, lactones), azide, hydroxylamine, nitrous acid, or acridines. Once a desired trait is observed through mutagenesis the trait may then be incorporated into existing germplasm by traditional breeding techniques, such as backcrossing. In addition, mutations created in other varieties may be used to produce a backcross conversion of 1PEVY61 that comprises such mutation.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="1">Production of Double Haploids</heading><p id="p-0284" num="0283">The production of double haploids can also be used for the development of inbreds in the breeding program. For example, an F1 hybrid for which 1PEVY61 is a parent can be used to produce double haploid plants. Double haploids are produced by the doubling of a set of chromosomes (1N) from a heterozygous plant to produce a completely homozygous individual. For example, see Wan et al., Theoretical and Applied Genetics, 77:889-892, 1989 and US Patent Publication No. 2003/0005479. This can be advantageous because the process omits the generations of selfing needed to obtain a homozygous plant from a heterozygous source.</p><p id="p-0285" num="0284">Haploid induction systems have been developed for various plants to produce haploid tissues, plants and seeds. The haploid induction system can produce haploid plants from any genotype by crossing a selected variety (as female) with an inducer variety.
