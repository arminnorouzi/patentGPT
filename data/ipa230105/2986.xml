Hurricanes form over warm ocean water in the tropical region and are characterized by large rotating low-pressure systems that produce heavy rain and sustained wind speeds of 74 miles per hour or greater.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Other names for this weather phenomenon are &#x201c;cyclones&#x201d; and &#x201c;typhoons&#x201d;. Use of the different names is based on the global location of the storms. Hurricanes occur in the Atlantic Ocean and northeastern Pacific Ocean, cyclones occur in the south Pacific or Indian Ocean, and typhoons occur in the northwestern Pacific Ocean. Regardless of the name used, these storms often cause significant loss of life and property when they hit land. To simplify our discussions, and where possible, the single term &#x201c;hurricane&#x201d; will be used to describe this weather phenomenon.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Throughout history, many countries located on or near the sea have been devastated by the effects of hurricanes. Hurricanes often create a phenomenon called a storm surge. A storm surge is a rise in the ocean water near the shore and is caused by the approach of the hurricane's low-pressure weather system where the associated high winds push the ocean water onto the shore. Storm surges can produce extensive flooding up to 25 miles inland and are by far the most costly and deadly characteristic of hurricanes. For example, in 2005, in the United States, Hurricane Katrina produced a storm surge of 28 feet that caused $108 billion in damages and the deaths of 1,200 people. In 2008, in the United States, Hurricane Ike produced a storm surge of 20 feet that caused $29.5 billion in damages and 82 deaths. Given this recent history and the high probability for future similar losses given the warming of the planet, several countries around the world have a vested interest in deploying a practical defense system against storm surges.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Two of the most common defenses against storm surges are &#x201c;storm surge barriers&#x201d; and &#x201c;artificial levees.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Storm surge barriers are tall elongated walls constructed with concrete and steel. An example of this type of barrier is the Lake Borgne Surge Barrier located in New Orleans, La. The Lake Borgne Surge Barrier is permanently fixed to the ground, stands 26 feet high and extends a distance of 1.8 miles. The barrier was completed in 2013 at a cost of $1.1 billion, or $611 million a mile. At this rate, it would cost approximately $10.5 trillion to protect the 17,141 miles of the U.S. tidal coastline along the Gulf of Mexico. This price does not include the cost to protect the U.S. Atlantic coast. Though they may be effective against storm surges, the construction of these barriers to protect American shores may be cost-prohibitive.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Artificial levees, also known as dykes or dikes, are elongated constructed walls that are built by piling earth on a cleared, level, ground surface. Levees are typically wide at the base and taper to a top level where the resulting structure can stand several feet high as measured from the levee's base. In addition to storm surge protection, artificial levees are commonly used to prevent river flooding. Even though levees are used extensively throughout the world, levees often have a serious weakness. Since levees are made from piles of earth (e.g., dirt and rocks), if any portion of the levee's earthen structure becomes saturated, eroded, or is overtopped with water, such a levee will often fail or &#x201c;breach.&#x201d; A breach represents a special hazard because the sudden release of water can quickly inundate a community, destroying property and life along the way.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Using these flood barrier technologies may present some of the following challenges, for example: (1) the construction cost per mile may be very high; (2) these structures may be permanent; (3) these structures may be aesthetically unappealing; (4) these structures often block aesthetically appealing views, such as coastlines; (5) public resistance is often high when these structures are proposed for pristine locations; (6) the maintenance cost per mile may be very high; and (7) these structures may be subject to failure over time due to exposure to water or weather.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Turning to the field of railcars, there are a number of different railcar types, including gondola railcars and flatcar railcars.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a side view of a conventional gondola railcar <b>11</b> with railcar couplers <b>12</b> attached at each end of the gondola railcar <b>11</b>.

The mobile water barriers may include sealing elements along their sidewalls, which may be lowered and translated together to form water seals for creating a water barrier assembly. The systems and methods of the present disclosure may be used to form water (e.g., storm surge) barriers more quickly, efficiently, and cost-effectively than conventional techniques.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0176"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> shows a side view of a water barrier system according to some embodiments of the present disclosure, including mobile water barriers in the form of railcars <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, and <b>3</b> connected together and riding on a railroad track <b>4</b> that may be laid on a gravel railroad track roadbed <b>5</b>. The water barrier system is shown in a transportation mode, for moving along the track <b>4</b> to a location where it is desired to form a water (e.g., storm surge) barrier.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0177"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> shows a side view of the railcars <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, and <b>3</b> at the target location, in a state in which the railcars <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, and <b>3</b> are in the process of their transformation into a water barrier by lowering their sidewalls <b>38</b>, including their sidewall assembly bottoms <b>10</b>, toward a planar surface <b>6</b> adjacent to the track <b>4</b>. Later in the transformation process, the left <b>8</b> and right <b>9</b> sides of the railcar sidewalls <b>38</b> may be drawn closer together.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0178"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> shows a side view of the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> after the completion of the process of transformation into a water barrier. The left <b>8</b> and right <b>9</b> sides of the railcar sidewalls <b>38</b> may contact each other to form a water-resistant or water-tight mechanical seal <b>7</b> between the sidewalls <b>38</b>. The sidewall assembly bottoms <b>10</b> may rest on the planar surface <b>6</b> creating a water-resistant or water-tight mechanical seal between the sidewall assembly bottoms <b>10</b> and the planar surface <b>6</b>. With the transformation process completed, the railcars <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, and <b>3</b> have been transformed into a continuous water barrier that may be as high as their sidewalls <b>38</b> and may extend from the left side <b>8</b> of the first railcar <b>1</b> to the right side <b>9</b> of the third railcar <b>3</b>. The length of the water barrier can be varied by varying the number of railcars used. The reversal of the transformation process may result in the railcars being made ready for transport to another location, such as for storage or for further deployment and reuse. Additional details regarding the system's modes of operation will be discussed later in this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0179">There may be two major assemblies that make up each of the railcars <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, and <b>3</b>, referred to herein as the Water Barrier Assembly (WBA) and the Barrier Transport and Positioning System (BTPS). The WBA may be made by modifications to conventional gondola railcar technology, while the BTPS may be made by modifications to conventional flatcar railcar technology. Construction of the WBA will be discussed first, followed by the BTPS.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0180">The WBA uses an underframe that is similar to the underframe of a gondola railcar. The WBA underframe may support the water barrier walls (i.e., the sidewalls <b>38</b>), endwalls <b>42</b>, floor <b>39</b>, and other components. Vertical motion of the underframe may be controlled by components positioned on the BTPS that operate on the underframe. As indicated above, the BTPS will be further discussed below. Substantial forces from waves and loads may act on the WBA underframe. Therefore, the WBA underframe may be made with components and materials (e.g., steel) that exhibit sufficient strength to withstand the expected forces and loads.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0181"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> shows a top perspective view of a WBA underframe <b>26</b> with WBA end sills <b>27</b> at both ends of the WBA underframe <b>26</b>.

With the WBA side sills <b>29</b> longer than the WBA end sills <b>27</b>, the assembly of these sills may create a rectangular outer frame of the WBA underframe <b>26</b>. A WBA center sill <b>28</b> may be centered between and parallel to the WBA side sills <b>29</b> and may terminate with connections to the WBA end sills <b>27</b>.

The WBA body bolsters <b>30</b> may terminate with connections to the WBA side sills <b>29</b>. Additional strength may be provided by the WBA cross bearers <b>31</b> connected from WBA side sill <b>29</b> to opposing WBA side sill <b>29</b> by connecting through the WBA center sill <b>28</b> at right angles. Additional strength and support for the WBA floor (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>) may be provided by WBA floor stringers <b>33</b>, which may be supported by WBA stringer supports <b>32</b>.

In some examples, each of the strike plates <b>35</b>, <b>36</b>, and <b>37</b> may include a steel plate (e.g., a one-inch thick steel plate) in a planar, square configuration. The linear-motion bearings <b>34</b> may be attached to and may pass through the WBA body bolsters <b>30</b>. The strike plates <b>35</b>, <b>36</b>, and <b>37</b> are also identified herein as the interlocking beam strike plates <b>35</b>, the WBA vertical position controlling cylinder strike plates <b>36</b>, and the service/safety block strike plates <b>37</b>.

The WBA sidewalls <b>38</b> may be used as water barriers because water cannot flow through the solid metallic wall surfaces. Therefore, the effective water barrier surface for the WBA <b>40</b> has a length L<b>1</b> and a height H<b>2</b>. Steel rib wall reinforcements <b>44</b> may be attached to the WBA sidewall's <b>38</b> surface to add support and rigidity against forces attempting to bend or otherwise compromise the structural integrity of the WBA sidewall <b>38</b>. Additional wall reinforcements including, but not limited to, base tracks, beams, braces, channel steel, cladding, metal sheets, metal plates, ribs, studs, top tracks, and wall girts may be used to strengthen the WBA sidewalls <b>38</b> to the meet the design requirements and anticipated forces on the WBA sidewalls <b>38</b>.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0188">In order for the WBA <b>40</b> to create water-resistant or water-tight mechanical seals against the ground-level planar surface and against the WBAs <b>40</b> of adjacent connected railcars, in some embodiments the WBA may be fitted with sealing elements to form the water-resistant or water-tight mechanical seals. Example sealing elements are referred to herein as gasket/housing assemblies (GHA) <b>45</b> and <b>46</b>. The GHAs <b>45</b> and <b>46</b> may be respectively attached to the sides and bottom of the WBA <b>40</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref> shows a side view of the WBA <b>40</b> with a horizontally oriented bottom GHA <b>46</b> removed from the sidewall bottom <b>47</b> and vertically oriented side GHAs <b>45</b> removed from the ends of the WBA sidewall extensions <b>41</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref> shows a side view of the WBA <b>40</b> with the GHAs <b>45</b> and <b>46</b> fully assembled and attached to the WBA sidewall bottom <b>47</b> and sidewall extensions <b>41</b>. With the physical additions of the bottom GHA <b>46</b> and side GHAs <b>45</b>, the effective water barrier surface for the WBA <b>40</b> may be extended to a length L<b>5</b> and a height H<b>4</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>), which is measured from the outer contact surfaces of the gaskets.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0189"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b>A</figref> shows a cross-sectional exploded view of the bottom GHA <b>46</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b>B</figref> shows a cross-sectional assembled view of the bottom GHA <b>46</b>. The bottom GHA <b>46</b> may include a c-section steel beam with a housing flange <b>43</b> attached to each side of a housing web <b>52</b> at right angles. The housing flanges <b>43</b> may have a width L<b>18</b>. Screws <b>51</b> or other fasteners may pass through the housing web <b>52</b> and into a bottom gasket <b>208</b>, forcing a gasket contact surface <b>53</b> to press against the housing web <b>52</b> inner surface. Optionally, a sealant can be used between the housing web <b>52</b> and the gasket contact surface <b>53</b>. An upper surface of the housing web <b>52</b> may be attached to a bottom of the WBA sidewall <b>38</b>, such as by welding or other attachment means, such that the junction between the components may be water-resistant or water-tight. The bottom gasket <b>208</b> may have a height H<b>5</b> that exceeds an internal flange height H<b>7</b>, such that, when assembled and uncompressed, the bottom gasket <b>208</b> may have an exposed height H<b>6</b>. The bottom gasket <b>208</b> may have a width L<b>8</b> and a length that extends the length L<b>5</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>) of the WBA <b>40</b>. The bottom gasket <b>208</b> can be made of a compressible material, such as rubber, with physical properties that are suitable to create a mechanical seal to inhibit the flow of water, or other fluid, when the bottom gasket's <b>208</b> outer contact surface <b>106</b> is forced against a generally planar surface (e.g., a surface adjacent to a railroad track).</p><p id="p-0191" num="0190"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b>C</figref> shows a cross-sectional end view of the bottom GHA <b>46</b> as it is forced downward onto the planar surface <b>6</b>.

As another option, the flange <b>43</b> may include a surface with a vertical saw-tooth pattern, which can extend along its length L<b>5</b>. Use of such a vertical saw-tooth pattern on the contact surface of the flange <b>43</b> may increase a friction coefficient between the flange <b>43</b> and the planar surface <b>6</b> as the points of the saw-tooth pattern may penetrate the planar surface <b>6</b>. A higher friction coefficient between the flange <b>43</b> and the planar surface <b>6</b> may increase a force (e.g., from water) required to move the deployed WBA <b>40</b>. The bottom gasket <b>208</b> may be compressed by opposing forces from the housing web <b>52</b> and the planar surface <b>6</b> onto the gasket upper <b>53</b> and lower <b>106</b> contact surfaces, respectively. The compressive forces against the bottom gasket <b>208</b> may create a water seal (e.g., a water-resistant or water-tight mechanical seal) between the housing web <b>52</b> inner surface and the gasket upper contact surface <b>53</b> as well as between the planar surface <b>6</b> and the gasket lower contact surface <b>106</b>, such that, together, water, or other fluid, may be inhibited or cannot pass from side A of the bottom gasket <b>208</b> to side B of the bottom gasket <b>208</b>.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0191"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>A</figref> shows a cross-sectional end view of the WBA <b>40</b> with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>B</figref> showing a detailed view <b>82</b> of the bottom GHA <b>46</b> prior to the WBA <b>40</b> landing on a ground level planar surface and where the bottom gasket <b>208</b> is uncompressed by said surface.

The truck side frame assemblies <b>74</b>, truck bolster <b>73</b>, and spring assembly <b>267</b> may be parts of a suspension system of the truck <b>21</b>. When assembled, the truck bolster <b>73</b> may be fitted with two truck side bearings <b>72</b> that interact with BTPS underframe side bearings <b>70</b> to provide longitudinal roll stability to the BTPS underframe <b>23</b> when the BTPS is in motion on the railroad tracks <b>4</b> (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>-<b>14</b></figref>).

When the assembled BTPS underframe <b>23</b> and BTPS trucks <b>21</b> are operated on railroad tracks, the mechanical interaction between the railroad track and trucks may provide a &#x201c;gross&#x201d; horizontal alignment between this and adjacent railcar assemblies. The automatic mechanical alignment of railcars into water barriers is a highly efficient aspect of this rail-based water barrier design. Methods for further improving the horizontal alignment between railcars (e.g., providing a &#x201c;fine&#x201d; alignment) will be discussed later in this document.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0200">Starting at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>49</b></figref>, some of the drawings will show different views of the BTPS operating on different railroad track beds.

These four vertical control components <b>55</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>57</b>, and <b>58</b> will be described individually and illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>36</b>-<b>47</b></figref>. The WBA sidewalls <b>38</b> and endwalls <b>42</b> described above are removed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>36</b>-<b>47</b></figref> for purposes of illustration, so that the mechanical interactions between the vertical control components <b>55</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>57</b>, and <b>58</b> relative to the BTPS <b>24</b> and the WBA underframe <b>26</b> can more easily be seen. Since the WBA sidewalls <b>38</b> and endwalls <b>42</b> are normally firmly attached to the WBA underframe <b>26</b>, any movement of the WBA underframe <b>26</b> may cause a corresponding movement of the WBA sidewalls <b>38</b> and endwalls <b>42</b>.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0207"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>36</b></figref> shows a partial cross-sectional side view of the BTPS <b>24</b> and WBA underframe <b>26</b> when assembled together. The vertical guide rail <b>55</b> may be attached to the BTPS floor <b>22</b>. The WBA underframe <b>26</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>36</b></figref> in an upper position above the BTPS floor <b>22</b>. The vertical guide rail <b>55</b> may be a vertically oriented cylinder made of, for example, rigid, hardened steel with a size (e.g., outer radius) sufficient to present resistance to lateral movement when subjected to expected lateral forces. In order to maintain control of the position of the WBA underframe <b>26</b> at all operational heights, the length of the vertical guide rail <b>55</b> may exceed a maximum operational height of the WBA underframe <b>26</b>. A smooth, rounded cap may be provided on top of the vertical guide rail <b>55</b> to aid in the proper alignment and lowering of the WBA <b>40</b> over the BTPS <b>24</b> during assembly. To assemble the WBA <b>40</b> to the BTPS <b>24</b>, the vertical guide rail <b>55</b> may be passed partially through and into the WBA's linear-motion bearing <b>34</b>. In embodiments that include four vertical guide rails <b>55</b> on each BTPS <b>24</b>, one located near each corner of the BTPS <b>24</b>, the four vertical guide rails <b>55</b> may be passed partially through and into four respective linear-motion bearings <b>34</b> on the WBA underframe <b>26</b>. The linear-motion bearings <b>34</b> may be sized and shaped to allow the vertical guide rails <b>55</b> to pass or slide through them vertically with low friction and lateral motion. In some embodiments, a lubricant (e.g., grease or oil) may be introduced between the vertical guide rails <b>55</b> and the linear-motion bearings <b>34</b>. The linear-motion bearings <b>34</b> can include one or more of various types of bearings including, but not limited to: ball bearings, roller bearings, or plain bearings (bushings). The vertical guide rails <b>55</b> and linear-motion bearings <b>34</b> may provide a mechanism to keep the WBA underframe <b>26</b>, and therefore the entire WBA <b>40</b>, horizontally aligned over the BTPS <b>24</b> as the WBA <b>40</b> is vertically lifted and/or lowered by another mechanism.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0208"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>37</b></figref> shows a partial cross-sectional side view of the BTPS <b>24</b> assembled with the WBA <b>40</b>, with the WBA <b>40</b> located in a lower position above the BTPS floor <b>22</b>. In the view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>37</b></figref>, the WBA underframe <b>26</b> has been vertically lowered (relative to the upper position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>36</b></figref>) and the mechanical interaction between the vertical guide rail <b>55</b> and linear-motion bearing <b>34</b> has restricted the WBA underframe <b>26</b> to a substantially vertical (e.g., substantially not horizontal) motion relative to the BTPS <b>24</b>. Thus, the WBA underframe <b>26</b> may be kept in continuous substantial horizontal alignment over the BTPS <b>24</b> as the WBA underframe <b>26</b> is lowered from the upper position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>36</b></figref>) to the lower position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>37</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0210" num="0209">Maintaining the substantial horizontal alignment of the WBA <b>40</b> over the BTPS <b>24</b> may ensure the proper operation of the entire WBA <b>40</b> as it moves vertically over the BTPS <b>24</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>36</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>37</b></figref> show that the WBA end sill vertical plane <b>140</b> may be located outside the BTPS end sill vertical plane <b>141</b>. Therefore, a gap <b>107</b> may exist between the two vertical planes <b>140</b> and <b>141</b>. This gap is referred to herein as the WBA-to-BTPS gap <b>107</b>. The WBA-to-BTPS gap <b>107</b> may allow inner surfaces of the WBA end walls <b>42</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>36</b> and <b>37</b></figref>), which are attached to the WBA end sill's <b>27</b> outer surfaces, to slide past the BTPS <b>24</b> without striking and binding against the BTPS <b>24</b> as the WBA <b>40</b> is vertically lowered or lifted. The WBA-to-BTPS gap <b>107</b> is also identified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>110</b></figref>, which also illustrates the WBA endwall <b>42</b>.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0210">In addition, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>49</b></figref> shows that the WBA-to-BTPS gap <b>107</b> may exist between inner surfaces of the WBA sidewall <b>38</b> and outer surfaces of the BTPS <b>24</b>, such as for the same reasons as discussed above. The vertical guide rails <b>55</b> and linear-motion bearings <b>34</b> may facilitate the maintenance of the WBA-to-BTPS gap <b>107</b> between all four WBA walls <b>38</b>, <b>42</b> and the BTPS <b>24</b>, which may allow the WBA <b>40</b> to move up or down without striking and/or binding against the outer surfaces of the BTPS <b>24</b>. Thus, the WBA-to-BTPS gap <b>107</b> may help avoid the WBA <b>40</b> becoming stuck, immovable, and inoperable. Of course, due to mechanical constraints, the WBA sidewalls <b>38</b> or WBA endwalls <b>42</b> may occasionally bump into or strike against some part of the BTPS <b>24</b> during normal operation. However, the vertical guide rails <b>55</b> and WBA-to-BTPS gap <b>107</b> may inhibit (e.g., reduce or eliminate) binding of the WBA <b>40</b> against the BTPS <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0211"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>38</b>A</figref> shows another partial cross-sectional side view of the BTPS <b>24</b> fitted with a WBA vertical position controlling cylinder <b>57</b>. The term &#x201c;vertical position controlling cylinder&#x201d; will hereafter be referred to as &#x201c;VPCC.&#x201d; The WBA VPCC <b>57</b> may be attached to the BTPS floor <b>22</b> and may operate on a WBA VPCC strike plate <b>36</b>. The WBA VPCC <b>57</b> may be operated by pressurized hydraulic fluid (hydraulic oil). Basic hydraulic cylinder technology is well known to one of ordinary skill in the art. However, since hydraulic cylinders are employed by several embodiments of this disclosure, basic construction and operation will be discussed. The hydraulic cylinder of the WBA VPCC <b>57</b> may include a cylinder barrel <b>211</b>, in which a piston may be disposed. The piston may be connected to a piston rod <b>212</b> that may move back and forth relative to the cylinder barrel <b>211</b>. The cylinder barrel <b>211</b> may be welded closed on one end by a cylinder cap and flange assembly and the other end by the cylinder head through which the piston rod <b>212</b> may extend. The piston may include sliding rings and seals that prevent the hydraulic fluid from passing between the piston and cylinder barrel's <b>211</b> inner surfaces. The movement of the piston, and thus the movement of the piston rod <b>212</b> outward or inward (e.g., upward or downward), may be caused by hydraulic fluid pressure applied to either the cylinder's base port <b>209</b> or rod port <b>210</b>, and/or may be caused by the release of hydraulic fluid pressure from either the cylinder's base port <b>209</b> or rod port <b>210</b>. It should be noted that the larger diameter portion of the WBA VPCC <b>57</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>38</b>A</figref> represents the cylinder barrel <b>211</b> and the smaller diameter portion represents the piston rod <b>212</b>. Hydraulic fluid pressure may be produced by a hydraulic fluid pump that is connected to a series of valves to regulate the hydraulic fluid flow through connecting hoses <b>100</b> to the ports <b>209</b> and <b>210</b>, as seen in the detailed view <b>81</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>38</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0212">Although not shown, the cylinder ports of this disclosure may, when fully assembled, include connecting hoses <b>100</b> to their respective controlling valves. The valves can be controlled manually or by a controlling computer. In some examples, multiple railcars will be used to establish a water barrier defense. Accordingly, computer automation and computer regulation of such controlling valves may be useful to efficiently and accurately deploy the disclosed system to form a water barrier. To appropriately regulate the operation of valves, the system may use position sensing &#x201c;smart cylinders&#x201d; to send position data to the controlling computer. Such smart cylinders may include an attached external sensing &#x201c;bar&#x201d; that may use the Hall Effect (or another position-sensing mechanism) to sense the position of a permanent magnet in the piston through the walls of the cylinder barrel <b>211</b>. Since the piston may be connected to the piston rod <b>212</b>, the smart cylinder can provide position data for the piston rod <b>212</b> and, by mechanical connection, position data of other components connected to the piston rod <b>212</b>. In this case, since the piston rod <b>212</b> is operating on the WBA VPCC strike plate <b>36</b> of the WBA <b>40</b>, the WBA VPCC <b>57</b> may send vertical position data of the WBA <b>40</b> to the controlling computer through a wired or wireless connection. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>34</b>A and <b>35</b></figref>, in some embodiments, each BTPS <b>24</b> may include four WBA VPCCs <b>57</b>, with one WBA VPCC <b>57</b> located in each corner region of the BTPS <b>24</b>. With vertical position data being supplied by each of the WBA VPCCs <b>57</b> and fed into a controlling computer, the controlling computer can regulate the valves of the WBA VPCCs <b>57</b> such that the WBA <b>40</b> can be vertically raised or lowered while the WBA underframe <b>26</b> remains substantially parallel to the BTPS underframe <b>23</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>38</b>A</figref> shows the WBA VPCC <b>57</b> in its upper, extended position. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>39</b></figref> shows the WBA VPCC <b>57</b> in a lower, retracted position. Substantially uniform lifting and lowering of the WBA <b>40</b> by the WBA VPCCs <b>57</b> may be performed to avoid any significant non-uniform, non-parallel, lifting or lowering of the WBA <b>40</b> that might otherwise cause the linear-motion bearings <b>34</b> to strike and bind against the vertical guide rails <b>55</b> or the WBA sidewalls <b>38</b> or WBA endwalls <b>42</b> to strike and bind against the BTPS <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0213">The disclosed system can be fitted with discrete vertical distance and/or position sensors to provide data to the controlling computer that is independent of, or in place of, data provided by the smart cylinders. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>38</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>39</b></figref>, WBA position sensors <b>80</b> may be attached to internal surfaces near each corner of the WBA <b>40</b> and BTPS <b>24</b> to provide distance data between the two platforms by a wired or wireless connection. The system can also be fitted with ultrasonic sensors, which will be discussed in greater detail below. In either case, the position data may be sent to one or both of a manual control panel or the controlling computer, where this data can be used to validate or override the data provided by the smart cylinders (if smart cylinders are employed).</p><p id="p-0215" num="0214"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>40</b></figref> shows another partial cross-sectional view of the BTPS <b>24</b> and WBA <b>40</b>, taken from a view of an interlocking beam <b>56</b> interposed between the WBA <b>40</b> and BTPS <b>24</b>. The bottom of the interlocking beam <b>56</b> may be attached to the BTPS <b>24</b> by a first mounting bracket and clevis hinge assembly <b>86</b>, and the top of the interlocking beam <b>56</b> may be in contact with interlocking beam strike plate <b>35</b>. Thus, the interlocking beam <b>56</b> may support at least a portion of the weight of a WBA <b>40</b>. The interlocking beam <b>56</b> can be made of a steel I-beam or material of another configuration with sufficient strength to support the WBA <b>40</b> (together with other interlocking beams <b>56</b>, as described above). In its vertical position (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>40</b></figref>), the interlocking beam <b>56</b> may mechanically block the WBA <b>40</b> from being vertically lowered toward the BTPS <b>24</b> and, therefore, may lock the WBA <b>40</b> an upper position. The interlocking beam <b>56</b> can be rotated around the clevis pin axis provided by the first mounting bracket and clevis hinge assembly <b>86</b>. A clockwise (from the view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>40</b></figref>) rotation <b>71</b> of the interlocking beam about the clevis pin axis may result in lowering of the interlocking beam <b>56</b> from a raised position. Conversely, a counter-clockwise (from the view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>40</b></figref>) rotation <b>171</b> may result in the raising of the interlocking beam <b>56</b> from a lowered position to the raised position. The interlocking beam <b>56</b> may be raised or lowered by, for example, an interlocking beam controlling cylinder <b>78</b>. One end of the interlocking beam controlling cylinder <b>78</b> may be attached to the BTPS floor <b>22</b> with a second mounting bracket and clevis hinge assembly <b>87</b> and the other end of the interlocking beam controlling cylinder <b>78</b> may be attached to the interlocking beam <b>56</b> with a third mounting bracket and clevis hinge assembly <b>85</b>. The interlocking beam controlling cylinder <b>78</b> may be hydraulically operated by valves to supply hydraulic fluid to the cylinder's ports by connecting hoses (like the hoses <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>38</b>B</figref>). The valves can be operated manually or by computer control. As the interlocking beam controlling cylinder <b>78</b> is operated to draw the piston rod inward toward the cylinder barrel, the mechanical connection between the interlocking beam controlling cylinder <b>78</b> and the interlocking beam <b>56</b> may force the interlocking beam <b>56</b> to rotate clockwise <b>71</b> around the first mounting bracket and clevis hinge assembly <b>86</b> to result in the lowering of the interlocking beam <b>56</b>. In some embodiments, rotating of the interlocking beam <b>56</b> from the raised position to the lowered position may be facilitated by extending the WBA VPCC <b>57</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>38</b>A</figref>) to relieve at least some weight on the interlocking beam <b>56</b>.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0215"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>41</b></figref> shows the interlocking beam <b>56</b> in a lowered position.

To remove or restore the interlocking beam <b>56</b> from or to its fully raised, vertical position, the WBA <b>40</b> may be lifted slightly and temporarily by the WBA VPCCs <b>57</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>38</b>A</figref>) such that there is an air gap between the top of the interlocking beam <b>56</b> and the interlocking beam strike plate <b>35</b> of sufficient size to allow the interlocking beam <b>56</b> to rotate without contacting the interlocking beam strike plate <b>35</b>.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0216"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>42</b></figref> shows an alternative embodiment of an interlocking beam <b>56</b>, in which the interlocking beam <b>56</b> may be operated by the same interlocking beam controlling cylinder <b>78</b>, but the hinging mechanism at the bottom of the interlocking beam <b>56</b> is modified compared to the embodiment discussed above. Instead of using the first mounting bracket and clevis hinge assembly <b>86</b> that has a single hinge, a double hinge assembly may be used to allow the bottom of the interlocking beam <b>56</b> to come in direct contact with the BTPS floor <b>22</b> (or with a component, such as a plate, connected to the BTPS floor <b>22</b>). The BTPS floor <b>22</b> may be capable of reliably sustaining greater vertical and lateral forces compared to the hinge pin of the single hinge assembly <b>86</b> discussed above. One end of the double hinge assembly may be attached to the BTPS <b>24</b> with a fourth mounting bracket and clevis hinge assembly <b>92</b>, and the other end of the double hinge assembly may be attached to the interlocking beam <b>56</b> by a fifth mounting bracket and clevis hinge assembly <b>90</b>. The fourth mounting bracket and clevis hinge assembly <b>92</b> and the fifth mounting bracket and clevis hinge assembly <b>90</b> may be connected by a double clevis link <b>91</b>. At its first end, the double clevis link <b>91</b> may be rotationally attached to the clevis pin of the fourth mounting bracket and clevis hinge assembly <b>92</b> and, at its other end, the double clevis link <b>91</b> may be rotationally attached to the clevis pin of fifth mounting bracket and clevis hinge assembly <b>90</b>. As the interlocking beam <b>56</b> is rotated counter-clockwise <b>171</b> by the interlocking beam controlling cylinder <b>78</b>, the double clevis link <b>91</b> may also rotate counter-clockwise <b>171</b> until the bottom of the interlocking beam <b>56</b> lands on the BTPS floor <b>22</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>44</b></figref>, after landing on the BTPS floor <b>22</b>, the interlocking beam <b>56</b> may continue its counter-clockwise rotation <b>171</b> until the interlocking beam's upper portion <b>97</b> strikes the beam stop block <b>94</b>. The mechanical action of the double hinge assembly may ensure that the bottom of the interlocking beam <b>56</b> lands consistently and reliably in a fixed location on the BTPS floor <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0217">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>42</b></figref>, in order to decrease the frictional forces when the interlocking beam <b>56</b> lands on the BTPS floor <b>22</b>, a trunnion <b>88</b> and trunnion bearing <b>89</b> may be added to the bottom of the interlocking beam <b>56</b> and interlocking beam <b>56</b> landing spot on the BTPS floor <b>22</b>, respectively.</p><p id="p-0219" num="0218">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>43</b>A</figref>, the trunnion <b>88</b> can be formed from a cylinder (e.g., a thick, hard, steel cylinder) of sufficient length L<b>11</b> and radius, such that when cut in a plane across its diameter, one of the resulting semi-circle halves can cover the bottom <b>213</b> of the interlocking beam <b>56</b> and be attached to the interlocking beam <b>56</b> by a weld. The trunnion bearing <b>89</b> can be formed with a shape that is complementary to the trunnion <b>88</b>. For example, a steel block <b>214</b> (e.g., a thick, hard, steel block <b>214</b>) of sufficient size may be formed (e.g., molded, cut) with a semi-cylindrical groove with a length and radius slightly larger than the trunnion's <b>88</b> length and outer radius, such that the trunnion <b>88</b> can easily fit into the trunnion bearing <b>89</b>. To prevent the inserted trunnion <b>88</b> from working its way out of the sides of the trunnion bearing <b>89</b>, blocking plates <b>215</b> (e.g., thick steel blocking plates <b>215</b>), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>43</b>B</figref>, can be attached and welded to cover both sides of the trunnion bearing <b>89</b>.</p><p id="p-0220" num="0219">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>43</b>B</figref>, alternatively, the steel block <b>214</b> can be fabricated with integral steel walls blocking both sides of the trunnion bearing <b>89</b>.

The double hinge assembly's radial action may place the interlocking beam's trunnion <b>88</b> into the trunnion bearing <b>89</b> as the interlocking beam <b>56</b> rotates to a vertical position. It should be noted that the placement of the interlocking beam's trunnion <b>88</b> into the trunnion bearing <b>89</b> may lock the bottom of the interlocking beam <b>56</b> into a fixed position such that normal lateral forces cannot move it, such as during transportation of the system along the railroad track <b>4</b> (which may subject the system to significant lateral movements, vibrations, and forces).</p><p id="p-0222" num="0221">In some embodiments, the disclosed system may also include a mechanism to lock an upper portion of the interlocking beam <b>56</b> into its raised position.

(2) After a beam position switch <b>111</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>43</b>C</figref>) or other position sensor verifies that the interlocking beam <b>56</b> is in its proper vertical position, the WBA VPCCs <b>57</b> may lower the WBA <b>40</b> until the interlocking beam strike plate <b>35</b> (labeled in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>43</b>C</figref>) contacts and rests on interlocking beam <b>56</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>45</b></figref>.

In one example, steering, acceleration, and braking controls may be located on the manual control operator platform <b>204</b> and manual control panel <b>205</b> of the WBA <b>40</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>117</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0338" num="0337">In some embodiments, the endwall <b>42</b> cut-outs <b>153</b> and other endwall <b>42</b> openings described above in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>79</b></figref> may be omitted in non-railcar contexts. Thus, the endwall <b>42</b> may be a solid element that is impermeable to water flow. The WBA bottom GHA <b>46</b> may be extended along the length L<b>9</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b> and <b>19</b></figref>) of the endwall <b>42</b>. The length L<b>6</b> of the WBA sidewall extension <b>41</b>, as described above in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>, may be shortened or the WBA sidewall extensions <b>41</b> may be removed to deploy the mobile water barriers via bus, van, or semi-truck. If removed, the WBA side GHAs <b>45</b> may be attached directly to the WBA endwalls <b>42</b>. Alternatively, if the WBA sidewall extensions <b>41</b> are removed, a single, and potentially larger, WBA side GHA <b>45</b> may be positioned in a middle of a width L<b>13</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>) of the WBA endwall <b>42</b> to form a water seal with an adjacent vehicle or tower structure along its height H<b>4</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>), as described above. A side gasket <b>49</b> of such a modified WBA side GHA <b>45</b> may have a planar outer contact surface <b>106</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref>, or an arcuate outer contact surface <b>142</b> and <b>143</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>88</b></figref>. License plates, signal lights, and/or head lights may be attached to the endwalls <b>42</b> as needed for transportation along roads or other similar surfaces.</p><p id="p-0339" num="0338">Because vans, buses, and/or semi-trucks may not be deployed along rails, a GPS and auto-parking technology may be employed to automatically align, position, park, and deploy a plurality of the mobile water barriers into a water barrier assembly. Thus, a GPS location system <b>102</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>48</b></figref>) may be included in such embodiments. The controlling computer system <b>104</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>48</b></figref>) may use the GPS location system <b>102</b> to determine a location of the mobile water barrier and to activate an auto-parking technology to automatically deploy a water barrier assembly in a location and with physical orientations as desired. Suitable auto-parking technologies are described in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,931,930, titled &#x201c;AUTOMATIC PARKING DEVICE FOR AUTOMOBILE,&#x201d; issued Jun. 5, 1990, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0340" num="0339">Accordingly, disclosed are water barrier systems that may be deployed quickly, efficiently, cost-effectively, and securely. In some embodiments, this disclosure describes specialized railcars that can be used in a system of similar railcars. The system may have the ability to automatically or manually convert from a mobile form into a continuous water barrier assembly of any desired length to protect large land masses from major flooding events, such as storm surges, river flooding, and other flooding events. After the flood threat has diminished, the system of mobile water barriers can automatically or manually convert from the water barrier assembly form into a mobile form to be transported to another location, such as by rail, for storage or for re-deployment.</p><p id="p-0341" num="0340">In some embodiments, as described above and shown in the accompanying drawings, a mobile water barrier of the present disclosure may have the ability to automatically join its sidewalls with the sidewalls of an adjacent mobile water barrier. The sidewalls can be lowered and sealed onto a surface, such as a ground-level planar surface. Thus, the system may transform itself from a mobile form into a continuous water barrier assembly of substantial height and length, where the length of the water barrier assembly is determined by the number of mobile water barriers used. This system can be used to form an effective barrier against storm surges, river flooding, and other significant flooding events. The system can be used strategically to protect cities and towns or can be used tactically to protect facilities such as oil refineries and nuclear power plants. After the flood threat has passed, the system can transform itself from the water barrier assembly form back into a mobile form to then be transported to another location (e.g., for storage or for another deployment), such as by rail.</p><p id="p-0342" num="0341">The process parameters and sequence of the steps described and/or illustrated herein are given by way of example only and can be varied as desired.
