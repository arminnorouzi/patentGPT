The disclosures of all the above Applications are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">During a surgical or endoscopic operation on a body lumen, e.g., a blood vessel, an aperture is formed (e.g., from an arteriotomy) in the tissue of the lumen. Following the procedure, the aperture has to be closed in order for the lumen to heal. One relatively new type of closure apparatus has a flexible disc that is delivered into the body lumen to seal the aperture. The disc maintains the tissue in apposition until the lumen is healed, allowing the wound to heal from the inside of the lumen. The disc may operate in conjunction with a rigid core, which prevents the disc from dislodging from the sealing position.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In certain patient groups, the area surrounding the tissue within the body lumen is diseased and/or has accumulation (e.g., plaque or calcified lesions on the tissue wall). Due to the irregular surface topology of such areas, the effectiveness of the seal made by certain closure apparatuses is reduced, as channels are formed between the disc and the tissue surface.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">There are benefits of improving the seal formed by a closure apparatus when closing an aperture formed in the tissue of the body lumen.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The disclosed technologies provide an implant closure device having a flexible sealable member and a flexible support member that operate in conjunction to improve a seal formed between the sealable member and the tissue surface of the body lumen during closure of an aperture in the body lumen. The support member maintains the peripheral portions of the sealable member against an interior tissue of the body lumen and/or provides greater rigidity to the peripheral regions of the flexible sealable member. The structure, in combination with the hydraulic pressure present in the body lumen (e.g., hemodynamic pressure of blood in a blood vessel), improves the tamponade formed by the device over the aperture. The structure is sufficiently flexible to bend so as to fit through the aperture during the deployment of the closure device in the body lumen.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The disclosed technologies prevent the inadvertent dislodgment of the closure device from the sealing position and reduce the risk of inadvertent pull-out of the implant device from within the lumen, e.g., during the deployment of the device or post-implantation of the device. A surgeon can assert greater force on the tissue, giving the surgeon a better tactile feedback of the positioning of the implant. As demonstrated herein, the provided technologies achieve unprecedented acute sealing time in closing a blood vessel and unprecedented loss of fluid from such vessel. In certain embodiments, the increased rigidity is directional to allow greater force to be directed to a specific area of the tissue surrounding the formed aperture.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A remarkable feature of the provided technologies is that they enable new types of interventional, surgical, and endoscopic procedures in providing a reliable and consistent closure of an aperture in a body lumen without regard to the tissue surface topography. In addition, closure of larger apertures in healthy tissue can also be performed.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, provided technologies allow for a thin-profile implant closure device to be deployed in the body lumen. The thin-profile implant is quicker to be encapsulated by the build-up resulting from the natural response of the body to the closure implant. In addition, the thin profile implant creates less resistance to flow in the lumen. As a result, closure of small vessels can also be performed.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, provided technologies improve the manufacturability of the implant closure device. The support member includes a structural feature to allow the flexible sealable member to be assembled with the support member, without distortion or deformation, thereby ameliorating the risk of the sealable member being damaged during such assembly.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In certain embodiments, the implant closure device self-guides to a sealing position due to, for example, hemostatic hydraulic pressure in the body lumen so a surgeon does not have to hold the device in a particular location when the device is being deployed.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one aspect, the present disclosure describes a device for sealing an aperture in a tissue of a body lumen (e.g., to close a surgical or endoscopic perforation in a body cavity, such as the gastrointestinal tract, heart, peritoneal cavity, esophagus, vagina, rectum, trachea, bronchi, and blood vessel, e.g., the femoral artery, iliac artery, subclavian artery, ascending and decending aorta, auxiliary and brachial arteries, femoral vein, iliac vein, subclavian vein, and vena cava). The device comprises a sealable member and a support member. The support member (e.g., a foot with an O-ring foot-core) comprises a base and a column, the base being disposed in the body lumen to retain and/or hold the sealable member against the interior surface of the tissue of the body lumen when the device is in the sealing position. The base comprises: (i) a central portion having a support surface to engage the sealable member against the interior surface of the tissue when the device is in the sealing position; and (ii) one or more lateral support portions (e.g., a ring, cantilever, arc-protrusion, perimeter) extending from the central portion such that the one or more lateral support portions provide additional support surfaces to engage peripheral portions of the sealable member against the interior surface of the tissue when the device is in the sealing position (e.g., wherein the one or more lateral support surface provide compression exertion against the interior surface of the tissue).</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments, the closure device comprises a guard member. The column is disposed in and through the aperture and has an engagement portion to secure the guard member to the support member. In some embodiments, the support member retains the guard member near the exterior surface of the tissue when the device is in the sealing position. In some embodiments, the guard member (e.g., an insertable or engagable pin or cage) is positionable near the exterior surface of the tissue adjacent the aperture when the device is in the sealing position, the guard member being moveable to be positioned relative to the tissue such a portion of the tissue is disposed between the guard member and the sealable member when the device is in the sealing position. The sealable member (e.g., a flexible wing) is positionable against an interior surface of the tissue adjacent the aperture in the tissue when the device is in a sealing position (e.g., so as to form a tamponade at the aperture).</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some embodiments, the base has a gap between the one or more lateral support portions and the central portion, thereby allowing the base of the support member to bend to conform to the interior surface of the tissue when the device is in the sealing position.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments, the base does not have a gap between the one or more lateral support portions and the central portion.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some embodiments, the central portion includes an anterior support portion and a posterior support portion (e.g., wherein the posterior support portion is disposed proximally to the column, and the anterior support portion is disposed distally to the column).

The anterior support portion is disposed distally to the column and has a second maximum cross-sectional area, the first maximum cross-sectional area being larger than the second maximum cross-sectional area such that the posterior support portion is more rigid than the anterior support portion (e.g., to provide more resistance and/or surface contact to the sealable member along the direction of the posterior support portion in keeping the device from being withdrawn through the aperture).</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some embodiments, the first maximum cross-sectional area is substantially similar to the second maximum cross-sectional area (e.g., wherein each of the first maximum cross-sectional area and the second maximum cross-sectional area is at least 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, or 80% of a maximum cross-sectional area of the central portion).</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some embodiments, the column is angularly disposed, when the device is in the sealing position, in the aperture along an axis corresponding to a longitudinal axis of a delivery shaft to which the support member is releasably attached (e.g., wherein the column forms an angle, e.g., between about 10 and 70 degrees, between a plane corresponding to the sealable member in a rest configuration and the longitudinal axis of the delivery shaft). The posterior support portion is more rigid along a direction of the delivery shaft than along other directions, thereby providing more resistance to the sealable member along the direction of the delivery shaft in keeping the device from being withdrawn through the aperture.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some embodiments, the one or more lateral support portions extend from the posterior support portion at a location between a posterior end of the posterior support portion and the central portion such that a region of the posterior support portion defines additional surface area to maintain and/or push a posterior end of the sealable member against the interior surface of the tissue when the device is in the sealing position.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some embodiments, the one or more lateral support portions extend from the anterior support portion at a location between an anterior end of the anterior support portion and the central portion such that a region of the anterior support portion defines additional surface area to maintain and/or push an anterior end of the sealable member against the interior surface of the tissue when the device is in the sealing position.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some embodiments, the sealable member and the support member, collectively, form a single integrated structure.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some embodiments, the one or more lateral support portions form a ring (e.g., circle, oval, rectangular, ellipse, diamond) around the central portion.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some embodiments, each of the one or more lateral support portion and the central portion aligns along a plane when the device is in a stowed configuration.

useful for (i) bringing about alignment of the tissues surrounding a perforation in a body lumen, thereby closing the aperture in the body lumen, (ii) forming a tamponade at the aperture when bringing about the alignment of the tissues, and (iii) maintaining the tissues surrounding the perforation in alignment until the perforation is sealed. The systems, devices, and methods are used, in some embodiments, to close a surgical perforation in a body cavity, such as the gastrointestinal tract, heart, peritoneal cavity, esophagus, vagina, rectum, trachea, bronchi, and blood vessel, including for example, but not limited to the femoral artery, subclavian artery, ascending and descending aorta, auxiliary and brachial arteries femoral vein, iliac vein, subclavian vein, and vena cava.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> are diagrams showing a perspective view and a cross-sectional view of an exemplary closure device <b>100</b> deployed at a sealing position <b>102</b> in a body lumen <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The closure device <b>100</b> includes a sealable member <b>106</b> (e.g., a flexible wing) positionable against an interior surface <b>108</b> of the tissue <b>110</b> adjacent the aperture <b>112</b> in the tissue (e.g., so as to form a tamponade at the aperture <b>112</b>). Although flat or slightly curved when in a relaxed state, the sealable member <b>106</b> flexibly curves to conform to the interior surface <b>108</b> of the lumen <b>104</b> to which it engages, in the deployed state.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The closure device <b>100</b> includes a support member <b>118</b> (e.g., a foot) comprising a base <b>120</b> (e.g., an O-ring foot-core) and a column <b>122</b>. The base <b>120</b> supports the sealable member <b>106</b> during the delivery and deployment of the sealable member <b>106</b> in the body lumen <b>104</b> by retaining and/or holding the sealable member <b>106</b> against the interior surface <b>108</b> of the tissue <b>110</b> when the closure device <b>100</b> is in the sealing position.

In certain embodiments, the base <b>120</b> slightly bends when in the relaxed position.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In some embodiments, once implanted in the body lumen, the base <b>120</b> presses against the interior shape of the lumen <b>104</b> by hydraulic pressure exerted by fluids in the body lumen <b>104</b> (e.g., by hemodynamic hydraulic forces exerted by blood in a blood vessel). In doing so, the base <b>120</b> improves the seal formed by the sealable member <b>106</b> over the aperture <b>112</b>, thus, providing a faster and more secure closure of the aperture <b>112</b>. The base <b>120</b> connects to the column <b>122</b>, which is disposed, when the device is in the sealing position, in and through the aperture <b>110</b>. In certain embodiments, a guard member <b>126</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>) maintains the column <b>122</b> in position at the sealing position once the device <b>100</b> is deployed, whereby the guard member <b>126</b> prevents the dislodgement of the sealable member <b>106</b> from the sealing position, e.g., due to impact near the aperture or movement of the patient.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In some embodiments, once implanted in the body lumen, the base <b>120</b> bends against the interior shape of the lumen <b>104</b> so as to compress the peripheral portions of the sealable member <b>106</b> against the interior surface <b>108</b> of the tissue <b>110</b>. Hydraulic pressure, as discussed above, may contribute to the bending of the base <b>120</b> in such embodiments. The base <b>120</b>, in these embodiments, also improves the seal formed by the sealable member <b>106</b> over the aperture <b>112</b>, thus, providing a faster and more secure closure of the aperture <b>112</b>.

The base <b>120</b> of the support member <b>118</b> includes (i) a central portion <b>302</b> that connects to column <b>122</b> and (ii) one or more lateral support portions <b>306</b> extending from the central portion <b>302</b>. The lateral support portions <b>306</b> have support surfaces <b>308</b> that retain and/or hold the peripheral portions of the sealable member <b>106</b> against the interior surface <b>108</b> of the tissue <b>110</b>. In certain embodiments, the lateral support portion <b>306</b> retains and/or holds the peripheral portions and exerts a force that biases the sealable member <b>106</b> against the tissue. In certain embodiments, the force is compressive. The lateral support portions <b>306</b> in conjunction with the sealable member <b>106</b> increase the rigidity of the closure device <b>100</b> at regions of contact with the tissue <b>110</b>, while allowing the closure device <b>100</b> to bend during the deployment and during the delivery. The increased rigidity reduces the risk that of inadvertent dislodgment of the closure device <b>100</b> after it has been deployed in the body lumen <b>104</b>, e.g., due to an impact near the closure device or movements of the patient or of inadvertent pull-out of the device <b>100</b> (e.g., through the aperture) during its deployment into the body lumen <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In some embodiments, the central portion <b>302</b> forms a rigid core to which the lateral support portions <b>306</b> flexibly connect. In some embodiments, the central portion <b>302</b> and the lateral support portions <b>306</b> form a single unitary body.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In some embodiments, the lateral support portions <b>306</b> forms a gap <b>320</b> with respect to the central portion <b>302</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref>, the central portion <b>302</b> of the base <b>120</b> includes an anterior support portion <b>310</b> and a posterior support portion <b>312</b>. The contact surfaces <b>304</b> of both the anterior and posterior support portions <b>310</b>, <b>312</b> contact and/or press against the anterior and posterior portions of the sealable member <b>106</b>. The lateral support portions <b>306</b> extend from at least one of the anterior support portion <b>310</b> and the posterior support portion <b>312</b>. As shown, the posterior support portion <b>312</b>, in some embodiments, is disposed proximally to the column <b>122</b> of the support member <b>118</b>, and the anterior support portion <b>312</b> is disposed distally to the column <b>122</b>.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">Directionally-Inducted Rigidity of the Devices</heading><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In another aspect, the flexible support member <b>118</b> may be shaped to provide more rigidity to peripheral portions of the sealable member <b>106</b> along a direction to which the sealable member is pulled during the deployment of the closure device <b>100</b>. The directionally-induced rigidity ameliorates the risk of an accidental pull-out of the sealable member from the lumen <b>104</b> during deployment.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref> are diagrams showing a support member <b>118</b> of the closure apparatus <b>100</b> with directionally-induced rigidity. This increased rigidity is employed at a specific part of the base <b>120</b> that, preferably, corresponds to the direction of the column <b>122</b>. In certain embodiments, the base <b>120</b> provides more resistance, for example, at region <b>312</b>, making the portion of the sealable member <b>106</b> corresponding to such region subject to less bending. Thus, greater force may be applied to that region of the sealable member <b>106</b> before the sealable member <b>106</b> would pull through the aperture <b>112</b>. This reduces the risk that the implant can dislodge from its deployed position due to, for example, movements by the patient and/or impact to the nearby area. The greater force also gives the surgeon a better tactile feel of sealable member <b>106</b> during the deployment and creates better apposition of the sealable member <b>106</b> against the inner lumen of the body lumen <b>104</b>. Thus, a faster and more effective seal can be created.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref>, the posterior support portion <b>312</b> is disposed proximally to the column <b>122</b> of the support member <b>118</b> and has first maximum cross-sectional area <b>402</b>.

It includes a hole from the bottom of the center of the O-ring section to the top of the column for guide wire access. It further includes a hole in the foot core column to hold the pin. It includes two recesses on the proximal tip of the column for engaging with the delivery system.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0125">In some embodiments, the shapes of the two spokes in the O-ring are different. This serves the purpose of the larger rear spoke providing extra support (see, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref>) that helps to push the wing against the vessel luminal surface, thereby providing an improved seal. This rear spoke also provides additional security to the user, so that the implant is less likely to be accidently withdrawn fully out of the artery due to folding and/or deformation of the rear spoke. This in turn, provides enhanced tactile feedback to the user during deployment.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0126">In some embodiments, the surface of a vessel lumen can be uneven and is not always uniformly smooth. The ability of the wings to form an effective seal against a vessels wall can be adversely affected if it has a very uneven topography. The rear spoke member, in some embodiments, pushes the wing against the vessel wall forcing the artery to conform to the wing. This creates a seal between the wing and the vessel surface in a variety of vessel surface topographies.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0127">In some embodiments, the base of the O-Ring is flat, at rest, while the artery has a curvature. When the O-Ring implant is deployed into the artery, the flat foot core base adapts to the curvature of the artery and, in some embodiments, pushes the wing against the artery wall to form a contact between the flexible wing and artery inner luminal wall. This may directly enhance the effectiveness of the seal at the tamponade stage of the deployment as it does not rely on the user having to hold the device in a precise location.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0128">In some embodiments, although the O-Ring foot core is constructed of a plastic material, its profile is thin enough to facilitate the &#x201c;compression/folding&#x201d; of the transverse sections and not damage itself or the flexible wing during pass through of the implant in the funnel into the loading cannula. The geometry of the foot core base allows the supporting members to fold down under the foot core as it is withdrawn through the loading funnel. The extra support member also keeps the wing in contact with the funnel internal surface during loading giving more consistent loading.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0129">The O-ring foot core design and its variants provides, in some embodiments, support for the flexible wing portion of the implant throughout the life cycle of the implant from initial manufacturing when the implant is assembled through transportation and storage and ultimately during all stages of implant deployment into the hole in the hollow vessel for which it is intended to seal. The O-ring foot core provides, in some embodiments, structural support for the flexible wing when the device is fully assembled in its storage tray. During deployment to close a hole in a hollow vessel, the implant is loaded into a cannula through a loading funnel which reduces the cross-sectional area of the implant (O-ring and flexible wing) to make it possible to deliver the implant through an introducer catheter into a hollow vessel (such as an artery or a vein) within which there had been made an access hole to perform a minimally invasive procedure. During this delivery and deployment of the implant, in certain embodiments, the O-ring foot core supports the wing.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0130">Uses can include closing access site holes in hollow vessels; closing access site holes in blood vessels; closing holes in arteries; closing small and large holes up to 30F in hollow vessels; closing access site holes in the abdominal post endoscopic procedures; and closing access site holes in the femoral artery, subclavian artery, ascending aorta, axillary and brachial arteries.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0131">Although certain figures and embodiments relate to use of systems and devices for closure of a perforation associated with vascular surgery, one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that components of a provided device are not size dependent (i.e., are scalable) and are therefore useful for closure of any perforation in a lumen of a mammal.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0132">Although certain figures and embodiments relate to use of systems and devices for closure of a perforation associated with vascular surgery, one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that components of a provided device are not size dependent (i.e., are scalable) and are therefore useful for closure of any perforation in a lumen of a mammal.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0133">Some embodiments of the present invention are directed to a closure system, device, and method of percutaneous closure of an arteriotomy following endovascular/intra S arterial procedures.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0134">Although the present invention has been described with reference to particular examples and exemplary embodiments, it should be understood that the foregoing description is in no manner limiting. Moreover, the features described herein may be used in any combination.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0135">In certain embodiments, the invention is used for closing access site holes in blood vessels or arteries, for example, but not limited to, the femoral artery, subclavian artery, ascending aorta, axillary and brachial arteries.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0136">In certain embodiments, the invention is used for closing access site holes in the abdominal post endoscopic procedures.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0137">In certain embodiments, the invention is used for closing access site holes in hollow vessels.

For the in vitro test, the sealable member was tested on a test bench using either a flexible tube or a bovine artery to simulate the body lumen. The bovine artery has an inner diameter between 7.8 mm and 9 mm and a wall thickness between 1.4 and 1.9 mm. The flexible tube has an inner diameter of 7.1 mm and a wall thickness of 0.55 mm. In each of the flexible tube and the bovine artery, an aperture was created with a diameter of 6 and 8 mm respectively. A deployment sheath (e.g., the delivery cannula), used in the procedure, has an inner/outer diameter of 20 F/24 F.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0139">The test was performed with water flowing through each of the respective bovine artery and flexible tube, under physiological conditions with a pulse of approximately 60 hertz, a systolic pressure of about 120 mm-Hg, and a diastolic pressure of about 80 mm-Hg. Ten data samples were collected for each test.
