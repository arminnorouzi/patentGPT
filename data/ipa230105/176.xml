More specifically, the present invention relates to a novel disposable clothing cover that features a detachable napkin. The cover also provides a pocket for collecting food items dropped during eating and drinking. The cover provides combined bib and napkin and is removably attached to clothing of a user using adhesive lines. The cover is not required to be tied around the neck and therefore, can be used easily by both adults and children. Accordingly, the present disclosure makes specific reference thereto. Nonetheless, it is to be appreciated that aspects of the present invention are also equally applicable to other like applications, devices, and methods of manufacture.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">By way of background, eating and drinking are one of the major difficulties faced by individuals who are suffering from disabilities which makes them unable to move their hands or neck. Such individuals find it impossible to have food and drinks without staining their clothes. To avoid clothes staining, senior citizens and individuals with disabilities often require a family member or a caretaker to feed them. Spilling food and drink on clothing can lead to permanent stains which not only cause embarrassment, but forces individuals to purchase new clothes which is expensive and/or to change clothes frequently.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Children also face a challenge to eat food and consume drinks without spilling on their clothes. Conventional bibs are difficult to wear and children often cry while wearing conventional bibs. Further, conventional bibs are ineffective in preventing staining of trousers and more caused due to dropping of food on trousers and torso. Similarly, patients in hospitals, and residents in nursing homes, wear bibs to prevent staining of clothes while patients/residents consume food themselves or have food fed to them. Standard bibs are ineffective and patients/residents require improved bibs that eliminate staining of clothes.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Many individuals like to use napkins to wipe their mouth and face after consuming food. When consuming food outdoors, individuals do not always have access to napkins which becomes frustrating and discomforting for them. Individuals desire a clothing cover that can prevent clothes from stains and can also provide a napkin for wiping their mouth.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Conventional bibs for both adults and children are required to be worn or tied around the neck of a wearer. Such bibs are not only difficult to wear but are also discomforting around the neck. Further, individuals often need assistance in wearing these conventional bibs. Therefore, individuals desire a bib which can be easily worn without any discomfort.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, there exists a long felt need in the art for an improved bib that can be used by both adults and children while eating and drinking. There is also a long felt need in the art for a clothing cover that provides a bib and a napkin. Additionally, there is a long felt need in the art for a bib that is not required to be tied around the neck of a user for preventing staining of clothes. Moreover, there is a long felt need in the art for bibs that can prevent food from falling onto trousers. Further, there is a long felt need in the art for an improved bib that does not slip or displace while being worn by a user. Furthermore, there is a long felt need in the art for clothing cover that can be used anywhere easily. Finally, there is a long felt need in the art for lightweight bibs that offer a way for both adults and children to keep their clothes clean while eating and drinking, and also providing a napkin for wiping the mouth and hands.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The subject matter disclosed and claimed herein, in one embodiment thereof, comprises a clothing cover for preventing stains on clothes while eating and drinking. The clothing cover further comprising a front surface and a rear surface; a pair of side edges, a top edge and a bottom edge; a perforated curvilinear portion along the top edge forming a part of said cover which is configured to be detached for forming a napkin; a pair of adhesive tabs disposed on the front surface near the bottom edge; a folding line positioned parallel to said bottom edge and between a virtual lateral line joining said adhesive tabs and the bottom edge; a pair of L-shaped adhesive lines disposed on said rear surface for removably attaching the cover to clothing of a user, wherein each adhesive line extends from said perforated curvilinear position to the folding line.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In this manner, the disposable clothing cover of the present invention accomplishes all of the forgoing objectives and provides users with a disposable clothing cover with an integrated napkin capable of prohibiting clothing stains from food and drink while eating. The cover features perforations on the upper part so that a portion can be detached and used as a napkin. The cover is attached using adhesive and therefore, obviates the requirement of tying around the neck. The cover is easy to wear and can be used by both adults and children.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The following presents a simplified summary in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the disclosed innovation.
