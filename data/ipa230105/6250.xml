Among these secondary batteries, a lithium-ion battery (LIB), which is a battery system having high energy density, is in the spotlight, and is currently being used in various devices.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0005">The lithium-ion battery is generally composed of a positive electrode that includes a positive electrode active material formed of a transition metal oxide containing lithium, a negative electrode including a negative electrode active material capable of storing lithium ions, an electrolyte solution that becomes a medium for transferring lithium ions, and a separator.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0006">The positive electrode stores energy through a redox reaction of transition metal, wherein this results in the fact that the transition metal must be essentially included in a positive electrode material. Also, the electrolyte solution is composed of a lithium salt, an organic solvent dissolving the lithium salt, and a functional additive, wherein proper selection of these components is important to improve electrochemical properties of the battery.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0007">There is a disadvantage in that the transition metal is easily dissolved from the positive electrode into the electrolyte solution during charge and discharge or exposure to high temperatures. For example, since the lithium salt, typically LiPF<sub>6</sub>, contained in the electrolyte solution is very vulnerable to heat, the lithium salt generates a Lewis acid, such as PF<sub>5</sub>, while being thermally decomposed when the battery is exposed to high temperatures. The Lewis acid destructs a film formed on a surface of the electrode to easily dissolve the transition metals of the positive electrode into the electrolyte solution.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0008">These dissolved transition metal ions become a cause of increasing resistance of the positive electrode while being re-deposited on the positive electrode, and, in contrast, cause additional consumption of lithium ions and an increase in resistance due to self-discharge of the negative electrode and destruction and regeneration of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) by being transferred to the negative electrode through the electrolyte solution and then electrodeposited on the negative electrode.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0009">Thus, there is an urgent need to develop a method which may reduce degradation of the battery at high temperatures by scavenging by-products (HF and PF<sub>5</sub>, etc.), which are generated by the thermal decomposition of the lithium salt, and simultaneously suppressing the dissolution of the transition metal from the positive electrode.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0010">An aspect of the present invention provides an electrolyte solution additive for a secondary battery which has an excellent effect of scavenging a decomposition product generated from a lithium salt and simultaneously forms a robust film on a surface of a positive electrode.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0011">Another aspect of the present invention provides a non-aqueous electrolyte solution for a lithium secondary battery, which may achieve excellent high-temperature stability and high-temperature cycle characteristics by including the electrolyte solution additive for a secondary battery, and a lithium secondary battery including the same.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Solution</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0012">According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided an electrolyte solution additive for a secondary battery which includes a compound represented by the following Formula 1.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-C00002" he="13.29mm" wi="69.85mm" file="US20230006251A1-20230105-C00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0017" num="0013">In Formula 1,</p><p id="p-0018" num="0014">X is oxygen (O) or sulfur (S), and</p><p id="p-0019" num="0015">R is a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group having 1 to 5 carbon atoms or N(R<sub>1</sub>)<sub>2 </sub>where R<sub>1 </sub>is hydrogen or a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group having 1 to 5 carbon atoms.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0016">According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a non-aqueous electrolyte solution for a lithium secondary battery which includes a lithium salt, an organic solvent, and the electrolyte solution additive for a secondary battery of the present invention as a first additive.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0017">According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a lithium secondary battery which includes a positive electrode including a positive electrode active material;

The terms of a singular form may include plural forms unless referred to the contrary.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0023">Before describing the present invention, it will be further understood that the terms &#x201c;include,&#x201d; &#x201c;comprise,&#x201d; or &#x201c;have&#x201d; in this specification specify the presence of stated features, numbers, steps, elements, or combinations thereof, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, numbers, steps, elements, or combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0024">The expressions &#x201c;a&#x201d; and &#x201c;b&#x201d; in the description of &#x201c;a to b carbon atoms&#x201d; in the present specification each denote the number of carbon atoms included in a specific functional group. That is, the functional group may include &#x201c;a&#x201d; to &#x201c;b&#x201d; carbon atoms. For example, the expression &#x201c;alkylene group having 1 to 5 carbon atoms&#x201d; denotes an alkylene group including 1 to 5 carbon atoms, that is, &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;, &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;, &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;, &#x2014;CH<sub>2 </sub>(CH<sub>3</sub>) CH&#x2014;, &#x2014;CH(CH<sub>3</sub>) CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;, and &#x2014;CH(CH<sub>3</sub>) CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0025">The expression &#x201c;alkylene group&#x201d; denotes a branched or unbranched divalent unsaturated hydrocarbon group. In an embodiment, the alkylene group may be substituted or unsubstituted. The alkylene group may include a methylene group, an ethylene group, a propylene group, an isopropylene group, a butylene group, an isobutylene group, a tert-butylene group, a pentylene group, and 3-pentylene group.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0026">Also, unless otherwise defined in the specification, the expression &#x201c;substitution&#x201d; denotes that at least one hydrogen bonded to carbon is substituted with an element other than hydrogen, for example, an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms or fluorine.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0027">In general, transition metals constituting a positive electrode may be easily dissolved in an electrolyte solution due to hydrogen fluoride (HF) generated from the electrolyte solution during battery operation or structural variation of the positive electrode according to repeated charge and discharge, and dissolved transition metal ions are re-deposited on the positive electrode to be a cause of increasing resistance of the positive electrode. Also, since the transition metals moved to a negative electrode through the electrolyte solution are electrodeposited on the negative electrode to self-discharge the negative electrode and destruct a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) that gives passivation ability to the negative electrode, interfacial resistance of the negative electrode is increased by promoting an additional electrolyte solution decomposition reaction.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0028">Since this series of reactions reduces an amount of available lithium ions in a battery, it not only leads to the degradation of capacity of the battery, but an electrolyte solution decomposition reaction is also accompanied, and thus, resistance is increased. In addition, in a case in which metal impurities are included in the electrode during configuration of the positive electrode, since the metal impurities are dissolved from the positive electrode during initial charge, metal ions thus dissolved are electrodeposited on a surface of the negative electrode. The electrodeposited metal ions become a major cause of low-voltage failure by growing into dendrites to cause an internal short circuit of the battery.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0029">The present invention aims at providing a non-aqueous electrolyte solution for a lithium secondary battery, which includes an additive capable of suppressing the dissolution of the transition metal by forming a robust film on a surface of the positive electrode as well as preventing the electrodeposition on the negative electrode or positive electrode by scavenging the dissolved metal ions, a cause of such degradation and failure behavior, in the battery, and a lithium secondary battery including the same.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0030">Electrolyte Solution Additive for Secondary Battery</p><p id="p-0035" num="0031">In the present invention, provided is an electrolyte solution additive for a secondary battery which includes a compound represented by the following Formula 1.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00003" num="00003"><img id="EMI-C00003" he="13.29mm" wi="69.85mm" file="US20230006251A1-20230105-C00003.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0037" num="0032">In Formula 1,</p><p id="p-0038" num="0033">X is oxygen (O) or sulfur (S), and</p><p id="p-0039" num="0034">R is a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group having 1 to 5 carbon atoms or N(R<sub>1</sub>)<sub>2 </sub>where R<sub>1 </sub>is hydrogen or a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group having 1 to 5 carbon atoms.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0035">Specifically, in Formula 1, X is S, and R may be a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms or N(R<sub>1</sub>)<sub>2 </sub>where R<sub>1 </sub>is hydrogen or a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0036">Also, in Formula 1, X is S, and R may be N(R<sub>1</sub>)<sub>2 </sub>where R<sub>1 </sub>is hydrogen or a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0037">More specifically, the compound represented by Formula 1 may be a compound represented by Formula 1a below.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00004" num="00004"><img id="EMI-C00004" he="13.38mm" wi="69.85mm" file="US20230006251A1-20230105-C00004.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0044" num="0038">Since the compound represented by Formula 1 contains a nitrogen (N) atom-based unshared electron pair in its structure, it basically has a high binding force with a Lewis acid material. Thus, it may scavenge a by-product causing degradation of the secondary battery at high temperatures, for example, a decomposition product generated by thermal decomposition of a lithium salt, and it may prevent the resulting degradation of the film on the surface of the positive electrode to suppress the dissolution of the transition metal. In addition, the nitrogen (N) atom-based material may be electrochemically reductively decomposed to form a nitrogen (N) atom-based film (SEI) on the negative electrode. The nitrogen (N) atom-based film has a characteristic in which it is not easily decomposed and maintained when the battery is exposed to high temperatures. Thus, since the characteristic, in which the SEI is not decomposed and stably maintained on the surface of the negative electrode, is provided, a negative electrode reduction reaction of additional transition metals due to the decomposition of the SEI may be controlled and the re-deposition of the transition metal dissolved from the positive electrode during high-temperature storage on the negative electrode may be prevented.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0039">In a case in which the compound of Formula 1 includes an amine group (N(R<sub>1</sub>)<sub>2</sub>) as a substituent (R), a more robust film may be formed on the surface of the positive electrode while an unshared electron pair of the amine group is oxidized. Thus, an effect of suppressing the dissolution of the transition metal from the positive electrode at high temperature may be further improved, and high-temperature storage and cycle performance may be improved by mitigating self-discharge of the secondary battery.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0040">Non-Aqueous Electrolyte Solution</p><p id="p-0047" num="0041">Also, in the present invention, a non-aqueous electrolyte solution including the electrolyte solution additive for a secondary battery, which includes the compound represented by Formula 1, may be provided.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0042">The non-aqueous electrolyte solution may further include a lithium salt, an organic solvent, and other additives.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0043">(1) Additive</p><p id="p-0050" num="0044">Since a description of the compound represented by Formula 1, which is included as the electrolyte solution additive of the present invention, overlaps with that described above, the description thereof will be omitted.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0045">However, in consideration of an effect of forming a stable film on the surface of the electrode and an effect of scavenging the thermal decomposition product of the lithium salt, the electrolyte solution additive for a secondary battery may be included in an amount of 0.05 wt % to 3 wt %, particularly 0.1 wt % to 3 wt %, and more particularly 0.5 wt % to 1.5 wt % based on a total weight of the non-aqueous electrolyte solution.

Any conductive agent may be used without particular limitation so long as it has conductivity without causing adverse chemical changes in the battery, and, for example, a conductive material, such as: graphite such as natural graphite or artificial graphite; carbon black such as acetylene black, Ketjen black, channel black, furnace black, lamp black, and thermal black; conductive fibers such as carbon fibers or metal fibers; metal powder such as fluorocarbon powder, aluminum powder, and nickel powder; conductive whiskers such as zinc oxide whiskers and potassium titanate whiskers; conductive metal oxide such as titanium oxide; or polyphenylene derivatives, may be used.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0107">The binder is a component that assists in the binding between the conductive agent, the active material, and the current collector, wherein the binder is commonly added in an amount of 0.1 wt % to 10 wt % based on the total weight of the negative electrode active material layer. Examples of the binder may be polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), polyvinyl alcohol, carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), starch, hydroxypropylcellulose, regenerated cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polytetrafluoroethylene, polyethylene, polypropylene, an ethylene-propylene-diene polymer, a sulfonated-ethylene-propylene-diene polymer, a styrene-butadiene rubber, a nitrile-butadiene rubber, a fluoro rubber, or various copolymers thereof.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0108">The negative electrode may be prepared by a method of preparing a negative electrode which is known in the art. For example, the negative electrode may be prepared by a method in which a negative electrode collector is coated with a negative electrode slurry, which is prepared by dissolving or dispersing the negative electrode active material as well as optionally the binder and the conductive agent in a solvent, rolled and dried to form a negative electrode active material layer, or may be prepared by casting the negative electrode active material layer on a separate support and then laminating a film separated from the support on the negative electrode collector.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0109">The negative electrode collector is not particularly limited as long as it has high conductivity without causing adverse chemical changes in the battery, and, for example, copper, stainless steel, aluminum, nickel, titanium, fired carbon, copper or stainless steel that is surface-treated with one of carbon, nickel, titanium, silver, or the like, or an aluminum-cadmium alloy may be used. Also, the negative electrode collector may typically have a thickness of 3 &#x3bc;m to 500 &#x3bc;m, and, similar to the positive electrode collector, microscopic irregularities may be formed on the surface of the collector to improve the adhesion of the negative electrode active material. The negative electrode collector, for example, may be used in various shapes such as that of a film, a sheet, a foil, a net, a porous body, a foam body, a non-woven fabric body, and the like.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0110">The solvent may be a solvent normally used in the art, and may include dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), isopropyl alcohol, N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), acetone, or water, and any one thereof or a mixture of two or more thereof may be used. An amount of the solvent used may be sufficient if the negative electrode slurry may be adjusted to have appropriate viscosity in consideration of a coating thickness of the negative electrode slurry, manufacturing yield, and workability, and is not particularly limited.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0111">(3) Separator</p><p id="p-0118" num="0112">The lithium secondary battery according to the present invention includes a separator between the positive electrode and the negative electrode.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0113">The separator separates the negative electrode and the positive electrode and provides a movement path of lithium ions, wherein any separator may be used without particular limitation as long as it is typically used as a separator in a lithium secondary battery, and particularly, a separator having high moisture-retention ability for an electrolyte solution as well as low resistance to the transfer of electrolyte ions may be used.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0114">Specifically, a porous polymer film, for example, a porous polymer film prepared from a polyolefin-based polymer, such as an ethylene homopolymer, a propylene homopolymer, an ethylene/butene copolymer, an ethylene/hexene copolymer, and an ethylene/methacrylate copolymer, or a laminated structure having two or more layers thereof may be used. Also, a typical porous nonwoven fabric, for example, a nonwoven fabric formed of high melting point glass fibers or polyethylene terephthalate fibers may be used.
