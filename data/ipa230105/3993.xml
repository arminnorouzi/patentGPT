These voids <b>4</b> block internal thermal conduction X of the wavelength conversion element, thereby reducing the thermal conductivity of the wavelength conversion element.

level="1">Embodiment 1</heading><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The following will describe an embodiment of the present disclosure in detail.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view of a wavelength conversion element <b>10</b> in accordance with the present embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is an SEM image (magnification ratio: 5,000) of a cross-section of the wavelength conversion element <b>10</b> in accordance with the present embodiment, prepared by slicing using a cross-section polisher. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>7</b></figref> show that the wavelength conversion element <b>10</b> contains: a binder <b>1</b>; a plurality of phosphor particles <b>2</b>, dispersed in the binder <b>1</b>, that emit light with a prescribed wavelength under excitation light; and a plurality of voids dispersed in the binder <b>1</b>. At least some of the voids have a first coating film <b>3</b> of metal alkoxide on at least a part of the inner wall thereof.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The voids with the first coating film <b>3</b>, unlike the related-art voids <b>4</b> with no coating film, provide a thermal conduction path and do not block internal thermal conduction X of the wavelength conversion element. This structure therefore increases the thermal conductivity of the wavelength conversion element. When the phosphor particles emit high-luminance light under excitation light, the accompanying heat is promptly discharged out of the wavelength conversion element. The structure hence increases luminous efficiency, thereby achieving high fluorescence intensity.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is a graph representing a relationship between energy density and fluorescence luminance for the wavelength conversion element <b>10</b> (Embodiment 1) in accordance with the present embodiment and a wavelength conversion element (comparative example) of related art. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> shows that the wavelength conversion element <b>10</b> in accordance with the present embodiment, including the first coating film <b>3</b> in the voids, can withstand a high level of laser power (irradiation energy density) in excess of 60 W/mm<sup>2 </sup>and achieve a high level of fluorescence luminance in excess of 1.4 a.u. In contrast, the wavelength conversion element of related art, similarly structured except for the absence of coating film, exhibits decreased luminous efficiency and hence decreased fluorescence luminance under laser power of 40 W/mm<sup>2</sup>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> is a graph representing a relationship between peak laser power density and peak temperature for the wavelength conversion element <b>10</b> (Embodiment 1) in accordance with the present embodiment and a wavelength conversion element (comparative example) of related art. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> shows that the wavelength conversion element <b>10</b> in accordance with the present embodiment has lower surface temperature, higher thermal conductance, and higher heat dissipation than the wavelength conversion element of related art under the same laser power (irradiation energy density).</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">Binder <b>1</b></heading><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Although not limited in any particular manner, the binder <b>1</b> preferably contains an inorganic compound for enhanced heat resistance. Examples of such an inorganic compound include alumina, silica, and zinc oxide. Alumina and zinc oxide are particularly preferred in view of their thermal conductance.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The binder <b>1</b> may contain inorganic nanoparticles with an average primary particle diameter of approximately 1 to 1,000 nm in a preferred embodiment. Examples of such inorganic nanoparticles include those of a metal or a metal compound. Particularly preferred among these examples are nanoparticles of a metal oxide such as silica or alumina.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The inorganic nanoparticles are not limited in any particular manner in shape and may be spherical, spheroidal, fibrous, bulky, or acicular, When the inorganic nanoparticles are spherical, the &#x201c;particle diameter&#x201d; is equivalent to the diameter of the sphere; when the inorganic nanoparticles are not spherical, the &#x201c;particle diameter&#x201d; is equivalent to the diameter of the circumscribed sphere of the inorganic nanoparticle. In the specification of the present application, the average primary particle diameter of the inorganic nanoparticles is the arithmetic average of the particle diameters of 10 to 100 particles, obtained by observation of the inorganic nanoparticles under an electron microscope.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">Phosphor Particles <b>2</b></heading><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The phosphor particles <b>2</b> are not limited in any particular manner and may be publicly known phosphor particles. Preferably, the phosphor particles <b>2</b> are garnet-based inorganic phosphor particles prepared using alumina as the base material, in view of material cost, manufacturing cost, and optical properties. Examples of such garnet-based inorganic phosphor particles include YAG:Ce (yellow phosphor) and LuAG:Ce (green phosphor). Garnet-based inorganic phosphor particles emit high-luminance light under high-intensity excitation light. It is known however that these phosphor particles have a decreased luminous efficiency at high temperature. In contrast, the wavelength conversion element in accordance with the present disclosure can prevent the phosphor particles from being overheated and suffering from falling luminous efficiency owing to its high thermal conductivity.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="1">First Coating Film <b>3</b></heading><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The first coating film <b>3</b> inside the voids is a translucent film-like member prepared from a metal alkoxide by a publicly known sol-gel technique. The metal alkoxide may be a mixture with a metal oxide. Examples of the metal in the metal alkoxide and the metal oxide include silicon, aluminum, tin, zinc, zirconium, and titanium. Preferred among these examples are aluminum alkoxide prepared using alumina as the base material and a mixture of aluminum alkoxide and alumina, similarly to the garnet-based inorganic phosphor particles above.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The first coating film <b>3</b>, if provided inside at least some of the voids dispersed in the binder <b>1</b>, can increase the thermal conductance and luminous efficiency of the wavelength conversion element. The proportion of the total volume of those voids with the first coating film <b>3</b> to the total volume of the voids dispersed in the binder <b>1</b> is not limited in any particular manner.
