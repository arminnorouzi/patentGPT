The first elastic arm <b>133</b><i>a </i>and the second elastic arm <b>133</b><i>b </i>are oppositely disposed on both sides of the second end of the angle block <b>13</b>. In addition, a first raised positioning platform <b>134</b><i>a </i>and a second raised positioning platform <b>134</b><i>b </i>are respectively provided on outer sides of the first elastic arm <b>133</b><i>a </i>and the second elastic arm <b>133</b><i>b </i>in a direction perpendicular to a rotation plane of the angle block <b>13</b>, and a first operating portion <b>135</b><i>a </i>and a second operating portion <b>135</b><i>b </i>are respectively provided on the first elastic arm <b>133</b><i>a </i>and the second elastic arm <b>133</b><i>b </i>close to the first raised positioning platform <b>134</b><i>a </i>and the second raised positioning platform <b>134</b><i>b. </i>A second end of the first limiting plate <b>121</b> is provided with a first group of angle gear grooves <b>1214</b> for the first raised positioning platform <b>134</b><i>a </i>to be embedded therein. Similarly, a second end of the second limiting plate <b>122</b> is provided with a second group of angle gear grooves <b>1224</b> for the second raised positioning platform <b>134</b><i>b </i>to be embedded therein. The first group of angle gear grooves <b>1214</b> and the second group of angle gear grooves <b>1224</b> each comprise at least two angle gear grooves distributed along a circumferential direction. For example, in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the second group of angle gear grooves <b>1224</b> comprises three angular gear grooves <b>1224</b><i>a, </i><b>1224</b><i>b </i>and <b>1224</b><i>c, </i>as does the first group of angular gear grooves <b>1214</b>. When the first raised positioning platform <b>134</b><i>a </i>and the second raised positioning platform <b>134</b><i>b </i>are respectively embedded within a corresponding angle gear groove <b>1214</b> and <b>1224</b>, a fixed angle for biopsy operation can be formed between the angle block <b>13</b> and the mounting base <b>12</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, when the angle for biopsy operation needs to be changed, the first operating portion <b>135</b><i>a </i>and the second operating portion <b>135</b><i>b </i>can be pressed by a user to make the first elastic arm <b>133</b><i>a </i>and the second elastic arm <b>133</b><i>b </i>elastically deform, so that the first raised positioning platform <b>134</b><i>a </i>and the second raised positioning platform <b>134</b><i>b </i>are respectively released from the corresponding angle gear grooves <b>1214</b> and <b>1224</b>, then the angle block <b>13</b> can be rotated to another desired angle gear position, and then the pressing on the first operating portion <b>135</b><i>a </i>and the second operating portion <b>135</b><i>b </i>are released, the first elastic arm <b>133</b><i>a </i>and the second elastic arm <b>133</b><i>b </i>are restored, and the first raised positioning platform <b>134</b><i>a </i>and the second raised positioning platform <b>134</b><i>b </i>can be inserted into another corresponding angle gear groove <b>1214</b> and angle gear groove <b>1224</b> again, and angle adjustment and positioning is realized. In order to facilitate a doctor to select an angle for biopsy operation, angle gear marks <b>1216</b> and <b>1226</b> corresponding to the first group of angle gear grooves <b>1214</b> and the second group of angle gear grooves <b>1224</b> are provided on the outer surface <b>1215</b> of the first limiting plate <b>121</b> and the outer surface <b>1225</b> of the second limiting plate <b>122</b> respectively, by means of which the doctor can align a desired angle for biopsy operation conveniently.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Because the needle guiding bracket <b>1</b> is used as a reusable instrument in the hospital, it needs to be sterilized after each use, and its service life needs to meet the requirements of long-term multiple use. However, the first elastic arm <b>133</b><i>a </i>and the second elastic arm <b>133</b><i>b </i>have relatively small elastic forces, which may weaken or even fail during long-term use. Moreover, there is a risk of releasing of angle positioning during use caused by mistakenly pressing the first operating portion <b>135</b><i>a </i>and the second operating portion <b>135</b><i>b. </i>Therefore, the angle block <b>13</b> is also provided with an elastic element <b>136</b>, which is configured to apply elastic force to the first elastic arm <b>133</b><i>a </i>and the second elastic arm <b>133</b><i>b </i>to urge the first raised positioning platform <b>134</b><i>a </i>and the second raised positioning platform <b>134</b><i>b </i>to be embedded in the corresponding angle gear grooves <b>1214</b> and <b>1224</b>. Referring specifically to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the elastic element <b>136</b> is a compression spring, a first cylinder <b>138</b><i>a </i>and a second cylinder <b>138</b><i>b </i>are oppositely provided on inner side surfaces of the first elastic arm <b>133</b><i>a </i>and the second elastic arm <b>133</b><i>b </i>in a direction perpendicular to the rotation plane of the angle block <b>13</b>, and two ends of the compression spring <b>136</b> are respectively sleeved on the first cylinder <b>138</b><i>a </i>and the second cylinder <b>138</b><i>b. </i>The compression spring <b>136</b> is in a contracted state, providing stronger and lasting support for the first elastic arm <b>133</b><i>a </i>and the second elastic arm <b>133</b><i>b, </i>so that the first raised positioning platform <b>134</b><i>a </i>and the second raised positioning platform <b>134</b><i>b </i>are embedded in the corresponding angle gear grooves <b>1214</b> and <b>1224</b> and are not easy to be released. When the angle for biopsy operation needs to be changed, pressing the first operating portion <b>135</b><i>a </i>and the second operating portion <b>135</b><i>b </i>from both sides of the angle block <b>13</b> to the middle at the same time, makes the first elastic arm <b>133</b><i>a, </i>the second elastic arm <b>133</b><i>b </i>and the compression spring <b>136</b> to deform together, bringing the first raised positioning platform <b>134</b><i>a </i>and the second raised positioning platform <b>134</b><i>b </i>being released from the corresponding angle gear grooves <b>1214</b> and <b>1224</b>. Then the angle block <b>13</b> is rotated to make the first raised positioning platform <b>134</b><i>a </i>and the second raised positioning platform <b>134</b><i>b </i>align with the angle gear grooves <b>1214</b> and <b>1224</b> of a desired needle guiding angle, and then the pressing on the first operating portion <b>135</b><i>a </i>and the second operating portion <b>135</b><i>b </i>is released, the first operating portion <b>135</b><i>a, </i>the second operating portion <b>135</b><i>b </i>and the compression spring <b>136</b> deform and rebound, so that the first raised positioning platform <b>134</b><i>a </i>and the second raised positioning platform <b>134</b><i>b </i>are respectively embedded in the angle gear grooves <b>1214</b> and <b>1224</b> of the adjusted needle guiding angle. Then angle adjustment and positioning is completed. According to different embodiments of the present application, the elastic element <b>136</b> may also adopt other elements other than the compression spring, such as a torsion spring, as long as elastic forces can be applied to the elastic arms <b>133</b><i>a, </i><b>133</b><i>b </i>to urge the raised positioning platforms <b>134</b><i>a, </i><b>134</b><i>b </i>to be embedded in the angle gear grooves <b>1214</b>, <b>1224</b>. Depending on types of the elastic element used, installation structure of the elastic element can also be changed correspondingly. In the illustrated embodiment, the elastic arms, the raised positioning platforms and the operating portions on the angle block <b>13</b> are arranged in pairs, which is easier to adjust the angle, and the two raised positioning platforms can also prevent the angle positioning from being released by mistakenly pressing the operating portions during the operation. However, according to different embodiments of the present application, only a set of an elastic arm, a raised positioning platform and an operation portion are provided on the angle block to cooperate with a group of angle gear grooves correspondingly provided on the mounting base, and the angle adjustment and positioning can also be realized.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Further referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> in combination with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, in order to limit an over-range rotation of the angle block <b>13</b> during the adjustment of the needle guiding angle, the mounting base <b>13</b> is further provided with a track block <b>123</b>, and the track block <b>123</b> has an undercut <b>1231</b>. An elastic rail arm <b>137</b> extends from the angle block <b>13</b> opposite to the track block <b>123</b>. The elastic rail arm <b>137</b> has an elastic barb <b>1371</b>, and the elastic barb <b>1371</b> can elastically lock into the undercut <b>1231</b> of the track block <b>123</b>. During angle adjustment, when the angle block <b>13</b> is rotated to a maximum angle relative to the mounting base <b>12</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the elastic barb <b>1371</b> is just locked with the undercut <b>1231</b> to provide position limitation, thereby restricting the angle block <b>13</b> only rotating within a required rotation range, thus the angle block <b>13</b> cannot fall out of the mounting base <b>12</b>. At the same time, when the needle guiding angle is adjusted to the maximum angle, positioning stability of the angle block <b>13</b> will become lower and it is easier to shake because rotation matching areas between the angle block <b>13</b> and the first limiting plate <b>121</b> and the second limiting plate <b>122</b> become smaller. To this end, the elastic rail arm <b>137</b> is provided with a first protrusion <b>1372</b> and a second protrusion <b>1373</b>, and two inner surfaces of the first protrusion <b>1372</b> and the second protrusion <b>1373</b> opposite to each other form a first sliding matching surface <b>1372</b><i>a </i>and a second sliding matching surface <b>1373</b><i>a </i>which are slidably matched with both sides of the track block <b>123</b> to enhance the positioning stability of the angle block <b>13</b>. In addition, a first extension plate <b>1217</b> and a second extension plate <b>1218</b> are additionally provided at the second ends of the first limiting plate <b>121</b> and the second limiting plate <b>122</b>. Inner sides of the first extension plate <b>1217</b> and the second extension plate <b>1218</b> cooperate with the first rotating matching surface <b>131</b><i>a </i>and the second rotating matching surface <b>131</b><i>b </i>of the angle block <b>13</b> to increase limitation and ensure the stability of angle positioning.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The above is only the preferred embodiments of the present application, and is not intended to limit the present application.
