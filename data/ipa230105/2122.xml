Field of Invention</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to cosmetics and, more particularly, to a container for cosmetics.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">2. Related Prior Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">A typical container for cosmetics includes a case and a cover. The case is used to contain a lipstick or lip gloss. The cover is engaged with the case to keep the lipstick or lip gloss in the case.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The cover can be engaged with the case in various manners such as threads and magnets. Where threads are used, the case is formed with a thread for engagement with a thread formed on the cover. The cover has to be rotated relative to the case for a certain angle in a direction to engage the cover with the case adequately. The cover has to be rotated relative to the case for the angle in an opposite direction to disengage the cover from the case. Such rotation is a waste of time.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Where magnets are used, one of the magnets is connected to the case and the remaining one of the magnets is connected to the cover. The magnets attract each other to keep the cover on the case. The engagement of the cover with the case and the disengagement of the cover from the case are convenient. However, each of the magnets must be connected to the cover or the case in a correct position or the magnets would repulse each other instead of attract each other. The attachment of each of the cover or the case is troublesome for a worker.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention is therefore intended to obviate or at least alleviate the problems encountered in the prior art.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is the primary objective of the present invention to provide a magnetic container that is manufactured efficiently.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">To achieve the foregoing objective, the magnetic container includes a cover assembly, a base assembly, magnets and a ferromagnetic element. The cover assembly includes an edge extending around an open end. The base assembly includes an open end inserted in the cover assembly via the open end of the cover assembly when the edge of the cover assembly covers the open end of the base assembly. The magnets are connected to the cover assembly or the base assemblies while the ferromagnetic element is connected to the base assembly or the cover assembly. The magnets are operable to magnetically attract the ferromagnetic element to keep the cover assembly covering the open end of the base assembly.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Other objectives, advantages and features of the present invention will be apparent from the following description referring to the attached drawings.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention will be described via detailed illustration of the preferred embodiment referring to the drawings wherein:</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of a container according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an exploded view of the container shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a cut-away view of a cap of the container shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the cap taken along a line A-A shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is an exploded view of a cup of the container shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the cup taken along a line B-B shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is an enlarged partial view of the cup shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>; and</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a cut-away view of the container in another position than shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a magnetic container <b>10</b> includes a cover assembly <b>11</b> and a base assembly <b>12</b> according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention.

There is no magnetic repulsion between the ferromagnetic element <b>40</b> and each of the magnets <b>70</b> because the ferromagnetic element <b>40</b> alone does not generate magnetism.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The bent portions <b>22</b> of the external cap <b>20</b> are aligned to the bent portions <b>83</b> of the shield <b>80</b> so that the cover assembly <b>11</b> is not rotatable relative to the base assembly <b>12</b>. Now, the open end <b>14</b> of the cover assembly <b>11</b> is aligned to the open end <b>15</b> of the base assembly <b>12</b> so that the space of the cover assembly <b>11</b> is in communication with the space of the base assembly <b>12</b>. The combination of the space of the cover assembly <b>11</b> with the space of the base assembly <b>12</b> is used to receive cosmetics such as a lipstick.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The present invention has been described via the illustration of the preferred embodiment.
