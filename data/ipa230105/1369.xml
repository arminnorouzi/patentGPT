In 2010, the Shenhua Baotou methanol-to-olefin plant using DMTO technology was completed and put into operation. This is the world's first industrial application of MTO technology. As of the end of 2019, 14 DMTO industrial plants have been put into production, with a total production capacity of about 8 million tons of low-carbon olefins per year.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In recent years, DMTO technology has been further developed, and a new generation of DMTO catalyst with better performance have gradually begun industrial applications, creating higher benefits for DMTO plants. The new generation of DMTO catalyst has higher methanol processing capacity and low-carbon olefin selectivity. It is difficult for the existing DMTO industrial devices to take full advantage of the advantages of the new generation of DMTO catalyst. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a DMTO device and production method that can meet the needs of a new generation of DMTO catalyst with high methanol processing capacity and high selectivity of low-carbon olefins.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to an aspect of the present application, a coke control reactor is provided, which can achieve the on-line modification of a DMTO catalyst; and the modification in the present application refers to controlling the coke content, coke content distribution, and coke species in the DMTO catalyst to improve the activity of the DMTO catalyst and the selectivity for low-carbon olefins.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A major characteristic of a DMTO catalyst is that the low-carbon olefin selectivity in a methanol conversion process increases with the increase of a coke content in the catalyst. The low-carbon olefins mentioned in the present application refer to ethylene and propylene.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The applicants have found through research that main factors affecting the activity of a DMTO catalyst and the selectivity for low-carbon olefins include coke content, coke content distribution, and coke species in the catalyst. Under the same average coke content in catalysts, the narrower the coke content distribution, the higher the selectivity and activity of low-carbon olefins. Coke species in a catalyst may include polymethyl aromatic hydrocarbon compounds, polymethyl cycloalkanes, and the like, where polymethylbenzene and polymethylnaphthalene can promote the formation of ethylene.

and 2. a residence time distribution of a catalyst is controlled with the structure of m reaction zone subzones (the residence time distribution is similar to m serially-connected completely-mixed tank reactors), and thus a catalyst with a narrow coke content distribution can be obtained.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">(2) The present application can control the conversion and generation of coke species in a catalyst. On the one hand, inactive large-molecule coke species remaining in a regenerated catalyst are converted into small-molecule coke species; and on the other hand, a coke control raw material can also enter the catalyst to generate highly-active small-molecule coke species, and the small-molecule coke species are mainly polymethylbenzene and polymethylnaphthalene, which can improve the selectivity for ethylene.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">(3) With the method for on-line modification of a DMTO catalyst through a coke control reaction in the present application, a coke controlled catalyst with high coke content, narrow coke content distribution, and polymethylbenzene and polymethylnaphthalene as main coke species components can be obtained, that is, the regenerated catalyst with low selectivity for low-carbon olefins is converted into a coke controlled catalyst with high selectivity for low-carbon olefins.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">(4) The regenerated catalyst in the present application can be directly used in the process of preparing low-carbon olefins from an oxygen-containing compound without a coke control treatment, and in this case, the selectivity for low-carbon olefins in an obtained product gas is 80 wt % to 83 wt %. When the regenerated catalyst in the present application is subjected to a coke control treatment and then used in the process of preparing low-carbon olefins from an oxygen-containing compound, the selectivity for low-carbon olefins in an obtained product gas is 93 wt % to 96 wt %.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">(5) The methanol conversion reactor in the present application is a composite fluidized bed reactor including a fast fluidized bed zone and a bubbling fluidized bed zone. The fast fluidized bed zone is a reaction zone, which can obtain a high methanol flux, increase a methanol treatment capacity per unit volume of the device, and make a methanol weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) reach 5 h<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>to 2 h<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. The bubbling fluidized bed zone is a spent catalyst zone, which is configured to reduce a temperature of a spent catalyst, deliver a low-temperature spent catalyst to the reaction zone, increase a bed density of the reaction zone, and control a bed temperature of the reaction zone. When the apparent gas linear velocity is 0.5 m/s to 7.0 m/s, a corresponding bed density is 500 kg/m<sup>3 </sup>to 100 kg/m<sup>3</sup>.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">(6) The methanol conversion reactor in the present application adopts a structure in which the first gas-solid separation unit of the methanol conversion reactor is directly connected to the delivery pipe, which realizes the rapid separation of a low-carbon olefin-containing gas and a spent catalyst in the stream A, and avoids that low-carbon olefins further react under the action of the spent catalyst to generate hydrocarbon by-products with a large molecular weight.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0151" num="0150"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a DMTO device for preparing low-carbon olefins from an oxygen-containing compound according to an embodiment of the present application.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0152" num="0151">Reference numerals in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>:</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152"><b>1</b> represents a coke control reactor;
