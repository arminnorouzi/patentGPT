Early internal combustion (IC) engine designers like Gottfried Daimler and Rudolf Diesel adapted the steam expansion chamber to a combined combustion and expansion chamber, leaving hardware essentially unchanged. They added cooling systems to lower the temperatures generated by internal combustion to levels the ferrous components could withstand during the life of the engine. Generally cooling systems dissipate&#x2014;ie waste 25% to 50% of the fuel energy. A transformed twenty-first century embodiment of the reciprocating IC engine is overdue. The disclosure focuses on improved charge and thermal management in reciprocating engines that are to a degree thermally insulated and optionally do not have conventional air- or liquid-cooling systems.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is known that efficiency increases with the increase of the temperature differential of the combustion cycle. The hotter the combustion, the greater the efficiency, all other factors being equal. Engine systems are designed to withstand engine performance under peak load which, in most cases occurs for a small percentage of total operating time. At all other times the engine is running colder and therefore less efficiently. Today, almost all engines during most of their operating lifetime run at temperatures substantially below the peak temperatures they are designed for, and so at lower efficiency because of the lower temperature. To improve fuel economy and reduce CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions, an important first step would be to maintain engine temperature at all times close to the maximum temperature the engine can withstand, so that at all operating modes it is operating at optimum efficiency.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A second step would be to eliminate conventional cooling systems as far as possible. Such systems typically comprise a water jacket, pump, radiator and fan, or comprise a fan directing air over metal cooling fins or surfaces. The engine can be placed in a thermally insulated enclosure, to establish average combustion temperatures higher than previously possible. Great financial and other advantages accrue by eliminating the cost, mass, bulk, and unreliability of conventional cooling systems. Their failure is the most frequent cause of engine breakdown. In less-cooled or un-cooled engines, the exhaust is much hotter&#x2014;ie containing a greater portion of the fuel energy&#x2014;and more work can be derived from it, through some form of exhaust energy recovery system or compounding, for further gains in efficiency. Turbine, steam or Stirling engines may be used to extract work from the hot exhaust gas; as can systems for converting heat directly into electrical energy.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Running at higher temperatures would improve efficiency, since it is dependent on the difference in temperature between ambient air (which is constant) and that at combustion. The resulting hotter exhaust gases will generally be easier to cleanse. Less-cooled or uncooled engines could be thermally, acoustically and vibrationally insulated to virtually any degree, making them more environmentally and socially acceptable. They preferably run at constant-speed and -load. Of the calorific value of the fuel, a greater amount will be spent on pushing a piston, but nearly all the remainder will now be in the hot exhaust gas, where much of it is recoverable. With uncooled engines, average temperatures could be so high that the main piston and cylinder components would likely have to be of special high-temperature metal alloys or of ceramic material.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONS</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The inventions comprise commercial long-life reciprocating internal combustion (IC) engines having reduced or no cooling, mounted in thermally insulating enclosures or casings. Because of the characteristics of most insulating materials, the enclosures will usually function also as acoustic insulation. Principal engine components are generally made of high-temperature alloys and/or of ceramic materials. In selected embodiments an electrical generator is coupled to the engine within the enclosure to form a gen-set. Disclosed are frames linking piston/cylinder assemblies to power take-off devices including crankshafts and reciprocating or rotating electrical generators. The frames and the structures they support are so mounted as to permit independent movement within and relative to the enclosure. A preferred layout comprises a reciprocating component located between two toroidal working volumes in a cylinder surrounded by an exhaust processing volume, with charge air or gas passing through the interior of the reciprocating component. In many embodiments, the number of moving parts per cylinder, and the number of cylinders required for a desired output, are greatly reduced, leading to improved power-to-weight and power-to-bulk ratios. The inventions further comprise using high-temperature and optionally high-pressure exhaust to power another engine, such as a turbine, steam or Stirling engine. New configurations of pistons, cylinders and cylinder heads are disclosed, as are ways of mounting the engine-containing enclosures in items of equipment requiring an IC engine for operation.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="2">Clarifications</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Where charge gas is mentioned, it encompasses air or air mixed with other fluids including fuel, gases other than air including hydrogen, ammonia, hydrogen peroxide, nitric oxide.

The features can be embodied in any suitable and convenient material. Where diagrams or embodiments are described, these are always by way of example and/or illustration of the principles of the invention. The Figures herein show selected embodiments of the invention and are presented as means of enabling the proper understanding of the inventions, which may be embodied in any appropriate and convenient manner, including those not recited or illustrated here. For example, any type of piston or valve may be used in any engine and the engine portions may be assembled in any manner. The various features and embodiments of the invention may be used in any appropriate combination or arrangement. A feature described in one embodiment or may be incorporated in any other embodiment, even if not specifically described or illustrated in said other embodiment. It is considered that many of the separate features of this complete disclosure comprise independent inventions. Where appropriate, two or more of the separate inventions can be combined, joined or integrated in any manner.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Less-cooled or uncooled engines generally mean engines without a traditional forced-air or circulating fluid system and will hereinafter for convenience be collectively referred to as &#x2018;uncooled engines&#x2019;. Uncooled engines may have some secondary cooling of either charge (wherein the temperature of the charge is reduced before it enters the combustion chamber) or for cooling of selected engine sub-systems, such as a fuel pump or compressor. The features herein have been described mainly in relation to internal combustion engines, although many are suited to and may be applied to any type of combustion engine, including for example Stirling and steam engines and, where appropriate, to any type of compressor or pump or turbine engine. The word &#x201c;engine&#x201d; is used in its widest possible meaning and, where appropriate, is meant to include pump and/or compressor. The disclosures principally relate to pistons reciprocating in cylinders to define fluid working chambers. Generally, the piston has been described as powered by the expansion of fluid to drive some device or mechanism. Wherever appropriate, the piston may equally be driven by some device or mechanism to compress or pump a fluid. The chambers are often referred to as combustion chambers. Wherever the construction disclosed may be applicable to pumps and/or compressors, then the chambers described as for combustion may also be for compression and/or pumping of fluids. Where the terms &#x201c;working chambers&#x201d; or fluid working chambers&#x201d; are used, they refer to chambers which can be combustion chambers, pumping chambers or compression chambers. The word fluid is used herein to mean any appropriate substance, including fuel and charge air or gas. Where the word &#x201c;fuel&#x201d; is used in relation to combustion or working chambers, in embodiments or applications where the chambers are not combustion chambers the &#x201c;fuel&#x201d; can be any suitable fluid. The term &#x201c;partial vacuum&#x201d; means any degree of vacuum, since a perfect vacuum is not realistically obtainable in the embodiments disclosed herein. In the embodiments described by way of example, components have variously been described as attached together, bolted together, bonded together, fused together. The different elements and components of the invention may be attached to one another or fastened together by any convenient or appropriate means, including those referred to in the description of embodiments. Generally in this disclosure, like numbered parts have similar characteristics and/or functions. All the diagrams are for purposes of illustrating the features of the invention and are schematic. The components are shown at no particular scale relative to one another. Where the phrase &#x201c;as disclosed herein&#x201d; is used, it means as disclosed anywhere in this entire patent-related document, including all of the text, the claims, and all the Figures.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the following text and recital of claims, &#x201c;filamentary material&#x201d;, where disposed in a housing or container of some kind, is defined as portions of interconnected or abutting or closely spaced material which allow the passage of fluid therethrough and induce turbulence and mixing by changing the directions of travel of portions of fluid relative to each other. By interconnected or abutting or closely spaced is meant not only integral or continuous, but also intermittent, intermeshing or inter-fitting, while not necessarily touching. The above definition is applied both to material within a housing or container as a whole, and also to portions of that material in any fluid processing volume, or portions of such volume. By &#x201c;ceramic&#x201d; is meant baked, fired or pressed non-metallic material that is generally mineral, ie ceramic in the widest sense, encompassing materials such as glass, glass ceramic, shrunken or re-crystallized glass or ceramic, etc., and refers to the base or matrix material, irrespective of whether other materials are present as additives or reinforcement.

By &#x201c;electric motor/generator&#x201d; is meant an electrical device which can be either a motor or a generator, or a device which can function as both at different times. &#x201c;Stoichiometric&#x201d;, where used in reference to air or gas/fuel mixtures in combustion engines, is used as is common in engineering language, and can indicate that quantity of fuel whose carbon will combine with all the oxygen in the charge under ideal conditions, leaving neither carbon nor oxygen in the exhaust. Where reference is made to an item being &#x201c;mounted about&#x201d; a second item, this is intended to mean that the first item can be physically associated with the second item in any way, including mounted in, mounted on, attached to, and connected to the second item, including by some intermediary means, such a strut.

It is probable that liquids cannot be used to separate piston and cylinder in an uncooled engine; today's conventional oils would quickly boil away. One alternative is to use a gas bearing (known technology but so far not used in piston IC engines) which uses a film of gas to separate components. Such a film of gas is already present in in nearly all of today's engines in the form of blow-by, a tube-shaped gas flow from a high-pressure zone in the combustion chamber, past the piston and piston rings, to a low-pressure zone, usually the crankcase volume. In most embodiments having a conventional crank/conrod layout, the gas flow will not prevent the piston impacting the cylinder during the sizable twisting and side loads imparted to the piston when the crank is around 90&#xb0; and 270&#xb0; of rotation. The combustion chamber surfaces optionally include small depressions or grooves to effect a slowing down of the blow-by gases, using any established techniques including labyrinth sealing. They are shown schematically at <b>5</b><i>a </i>only in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> but can be incorporated in any of the combustion chamber surfaces of the engines of the invention. In many embodiments, such side loads have to be taken up outside the piston/cylinder assembly by means including doubled conrods, rollers or sleeve bearings, and other devices as outlined herein.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">By way of example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a two-stroke engine, having a cylinder head <b>4</b><i>a </i>not integral with the cylinder <b>4</b> (as it is in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>4</b> to <b>6</b></figref>), but separate, as in most engines today. Such an arrangement could be considered for lightly stressed engines. Generally, the much higher combustion chamber pressures and temperatures of uncooled engines will make the provision of a long-life cylinder head gasket difficult In this embodiment the &#x201c;double con-rod&#x201d; linkage of some large marine engines is used. The first &#x2018;conrod&#x2019; is a rigid extension <b>21</b> of the piston <b>5</b> slidably mounted in one or more sleeve bearings <b>23</b> terminating in bearing <b>22</b>, to which the second &#x2018;real&#x2019; conrod <b>24</b> linked, its other end terminating in big end bearing <b>25</b> mounted on the crankshaft.

In some embodiments, especially those with high compression ratios, the sum of the heat that represents the parasitic losses plus the heat generated by combustion may raise average temperatures to a level higher than the piston/cylinder materials can withstand for the planned engine life, and/or so high that unacceptable levels of NOx are generated. Lowering the compression ratio will permit more of the parasitic losses' heat to be taken up/absorbed by the charge gas. To prevent all of the parasitic losses being absorbed by the charge gas, the interior of the casing can be divided into separate gas-flow zones or plenums. In one embodiment, the charge gas goes directly into the combustion chamber, without out being passed over any other heat sources. In another embodiment, if there is a charge gas compression device and it is not cooled by a separate gas flow, the compression device's parasitic losses expressed as heat can be transferred to the compressed charge. The charge gas will therefore become hotter for two reasons: a) it has been compressed and b) it has absorbed the waste heat from the device. Charge gas that been heated by sub-systems' parasitic losses can, as noted, be i) wholly or partly directed to the combustion chamber or ii) it can be discharged to ambient air, or iii) it could be directed to the exhaust heat energy recovery system, to cool the exhaust gas or for any other purpose. In many embodiments one or more of the foregoing three alternatives will be incorporated.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> shows by way of example a schematic sectional plan view, drawn to no particular scale, of an enclosure <b>1</b><i>a </i>optionally comprising an outer structural layer <b>1</b> and an inner layer of thermal insulation <b>2</b>, having grilles <b>12</b> for admitting ambient air and/charge gas, optionally with filters behind (not shown) and removable access panels <b>1</b><i>a </i>for access to sub-systems. A fuel line in is shown at <b>57</b>; it could enter the enclosure at any convenient location. Exhaust gas leaves the enclosure la via an optional exhaust gas diffuser <b>110</b> of any convenient configuration and construction. Within the enclosure various volumes of gas at differing temperatures and pressure are separated by barriers <b>111</b> indicated by a double line filled with dashes. A cylinder/piston assembly <b>112</b> drives a crankshaft/power take-off assembly <b>113</b> via a drawbar <b>114</b> mounted in sleeve bearings <b>23</b>. In one embodiment the barriers <b>111</b> run up against the structures or frame (not shown) supporting the sleeve bearings. Exhaust leaves the piston/cylinder assembly via passages partly at high level <b>116</b> to be fed into an exhaust gas heat energy recovery system (EHERS) <b>39</b>, from where it goes to exhaust emissions control system <b>19</b>, and then exits the casing via diffuser <b>110</b>. In alternative embodiments (not shown), the exhaust gas first goes to the emissions processing system and from there to the exhaust heat energy recovery system and then to ambient air via the diffuser. In another alternative embodiment not shown the diffuser may be substantially within the casing or may be housed in an exterior recess in the enclosure. Ambient air or charge gas is supplied via fan or impeller or compressor <b>117</b> to a volume or plenum <b>121</b> containing a fuel lift pump <b>118</b>, a fuel high-pressure pump <b>119</b> and an electronic control/monitoring complex <b>120</b>, optionally including a computer (not shown).

In alternative embodiment not shown there is only one generator/starter motor linked to one end of the crankshaft assembly. In another embodiment not shown there is no crankshaft assembly and the drawbar <b>114</b> drives a reciprocating generator/starter motor. Fan or impeller or compressor <b>128</b> provides cooling air to plenum <b>128</b><i>a </i>housing the crankshaft/power take off assembly <b>113</b>.

The piston/cylinder assembly, the crankshaft assembly, electric generator(s) or the reciprocating generator, as well as the various subsystems can be arranged in any convenient position and relationship in the enclosure. Separate plenums have been shown for the majority of the components. In other embodiments, they can be combined and separated in any way. The ambient air or charge gas intakes have all been shown in one side of the enclosure, a convenient arrangement should the enclosure with engine be a snap-in unit, but the intakes can be provided in any part of the enclosure.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">There are many possible ways of connecting a conrod or drawbar to the piston. One such is shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, not drawn to any particular scale. It shows a cylinder assembly consisting of two parts (connecting linkage not shown), each having a cylinder portion <b>4</b> and an integral head portion <b>4</b><i>a, </i>enclosing a piston assembly. The piston assembly is similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, having a piston portion <b>30</b> with fixed extensions <b>31</b> which penetrate the head <b>4</b><i>a </i>during portion of the operating cycle. Loads are transferred from the piston assembly via an attached drawbar <b>37</b> which is linked to a crankshaft <b>110</b> via a conrod <b>24</b> having big end bearing <b>111</b> and small end bearing <b>112</b>. The drawbar is optionally hollow to provide a passage for cooling gas. In uncooled engines, the average temperature throughout the operating cycle of the principal piston/cylinder components <b>4</b>, <b>4</b><i>a, </i><b>30</b> and <b>31</b> is likely to be in the 800&#xb0; C. to 1,200&#xb0; C. range. In this embodiment the frame linking the cylinder portions to the crankshaft comprises a cylinder or tube <b>113</b> into which locator endplates <b>115</b> are attached, optionally by being threaded into the interior of the tube ends. At least one secondary structural frame <b>114</b> is attached to an and locator plate. The tube <b>113</b> and secondary frame <b>114</b> are of any suitable material including high-strength metals or metal alloys. The locator end plates <b>115</b> support the sleeve bearings <b>23</b> which align the piston assembly in the cylinder assembly. At least the tubular portion of the flame system is directly or indirectly attached to the enclosure by flexible and/or compressible mountings <b>11</b>, to permit the frame system to move independently of the enclosure.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Optional piston rings are shown at <b>8</b>. Above the head portions of the cylinder are relatively incompressible thermally insulting plates <b>139</b>, preferably made of a ceramic material such as zirconia, with a fuel delivery device <b>120</b>, such as an injector, housed in head <b>4</b><i>a. </i>Only two are indicated for each combustion chamber, but it could have more. Because the chamber is of toroidal farm, the best and quickest fuel delivery would be accomplished if optionally multiple fuel delivery devices were provided for each combustion chamber. Incompressible structural spacer elements of any material, configuration and composition are indicated by arrows <b>140</b> and save to separate the locator plates <b>115</b> from the insulating plates <b>139</b>. In an alternative embodiment the spacers <b>140</b> am compressible elements of any kind, including such as springs. Where them is no crankshaft and the piston assembly is connected to a reciprocating generator, the springs optionally function as a stroke lengthener, increasing compression ratio with increasing engine speed. The piston <b>30</b> reciprocates in the two-part cylinder <b>4</b> (the structure connecting the halves not are not shown). When the piston assembly is at or near BDC, the gap between the end of the piston extension <b>31</b> and the underside of the head <b>4</b><i>a </i>forms the intake port <b>15</b>, painting gas to flow into the combustion chamber <b>39</b>. At the same time, exhaust port(s) at <b>17</b> are exposed to allow exhaust gas to flow into to a circumferential exhaust processing volume <b>29</b> enclosed by insulation <b>30</b> and optionally containing filamentary material <b>34</b><i>a. </i>In an alternative embodiment, shown in the lower half of the diagram, the insulation is spaced from the interior of the tube wall by any means to permit gas to circulate between the end plates. If the assembly shown is located in a plenum <b>33</b> containing compressed charge, as indicated schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, compressed charge gas will flow through holes <b>116</b> in the locator plates <b>115</b> into the secondary plenum <b>33</b><i>a </i>and from there flow into the combustion chambers <b>39</b> via the intake polls <b>15</b> when the ports are open. In an alternative embodiment, illustrated at the right-hand end locater plate <b>117</b>, the piston/cylinder assembly is in another plenum <b>123</b> which does net contain compressed charge. Instead compressed charge is provided via passages <b>118</b> and holes <b>119</b> in end plate <b>117</b> to create a separate plenum <b>33</b><i>b </i>limited to the space between the end locator plates. Exhaust leaves the exhaust processing volume <b>34</b> by at least one aperture <b>121</b> communicating with a passage <b>117</b><i>a </i>leading either an EHERS or in an exhaust emissions treatment system. The flaming structure <b>113</b> and <b>115</b> is directly or indirectly mounted within the enclosure (not shown) by flexible and/compressible means indicated schematically at <b>11</b>, to permit movement relative to the enclosure. The drawbar comprises a metal tube <b>37</b> of any suitable material, including titanium and nickel-chrome alloys, screw-threaded into the small end bearing support structure <b>122</b><i>a, </i>while the other aid is optionally screw-threaded into the reciprocation portion of an electrical generator <b>126</b>. Optionally drawbar <b>37</b> is hollow and the interior of the drawbar is cooled by gas pumped in, shown here by way of example via supply <b>124</b> and connector <b>125</b> to flow in direction <b>126</b><i>a </i>and exit via passages <b>127</b> in the small end bearing <b>112</b> housing <b>122</b><i>a. </i>Optionally, the interior of the piston assembly <b>30</b> and <b>31</b> is lined with insulating material <b>128</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">One embodiment of a connection between piston and drawbar is described more fully in enlarged detail <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b> to <b>20</b></figref>. The drawbar <b>37</b> has a threaded portions <b>37</b><i>a </i>onto which end pieces are mounted. By way of example one such end piece is a structural colander <b>129</b> as illustrated schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> attached to the drawbar as shown in greater detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b> and <b>19</b></figref>. The colander is of any suitable material, including that of the drawbar. The colander <b>129</b> has apertures <b>130</b> permitting the flow of gas to and from the volume <b>128</b><i>a </i>between the drawbar <b>37</b> and insulation <b>128</b> and is attached to a threaded zone <b>37</b><i>a </i>on the drawbar. The colander is mounted on a collar <b>131</b> of high temperature rigid insulating material, such as ceramic. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> the collar <b>131</b> has a toe for accurate location in a recess in the piston extension <b>31</b>, permitting the greater part of the collar to be clear of the piston extension to forth an gas gap <b>133</b>. In an alternative embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, the collar <b>131</b> has no toe. In another alternative embodiment, the end piece such as the colander is not threaded on to the drawbar, instead a nut <b>133</b> is threaded onto the drawbar to retain the end piece/colander in position. Optionally, a cup-shaped shroud <b>134</b> of any suitable material is attached to the locator plate <b>115</b> and/or sleeve bearing its internal diameter just fractionally larger than the external diameter of the piston extension <b>31</b>. During path of the piston assembly towards TDC/BDC, it will enter the lip of the shroud to compress the gas therein and push it through the apertures <b>130</b> in the structural colander <b>129</b> and cause it to flow through the cylindrically shaped gap or passage <b>128</b><i>a </i>between the exterior of the drawbar and insulation <b>128</b> in direction <b>135</b>. In a preferred embodiment there is a shroud at only one side of the drawbar, to effect gas movement consistently in one direction. In another embodiment, there are two shrouds, one on each locator plate. In a further embodiment, means other than screw threading are used to attach colander <b>129</b> and/or nut <b>133</b> to the drawbar.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">To build some of the engines of the invention, the two parts of the cylinder must be assembled around the piston and be properly aligned. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b> and <b>22</b></figref> show by way of example one way of accomplishing this. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref> shows vertical sections through the cylinder assembly taken at B and C, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref> is a horizontal section through the cylinder taken at A. Cylinder heads <b>4</b><i>a </i>are accurately nested between ridges on or in depressions in insulator plates <b>139</b> on completion of assembly. A piston <b>30</b> with extensions <b>31</b> is shown at BDC in dashed outline. A shaped and holed cage or collar <b>140</b> of any suitable material including that of the cylinders <b>4</b> connects and aligns the cylinder halves around the piston assembly. Optionally a compressible interlayer <b>141</b> of any suitable material is placed between the cage or collar and the cylinder portions, to accommodate varying rates of thermal expansion during engine warm-up. The gage comprises stiffening struts <b>142</b> connecting upper and lower bands <b>143</b>. The cylinder portions are notched at <b>144</b> and rest or bear on the ends of the bands <b>143</b>. Openings between the upper and lower bands define the exhaust ports <b>145</b>. In an alternative embodiment shown by way of example on the right side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>, the starts <b>146</b> have inward projection <b>147</b> which support and separate the two cylinder halves. Here four struts are shown. In alternative embodiments there are any number of struts.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>20</b></figref> ambient air circulates within the enclosure. In other embodiment some or all of the air contains other fluids, including fuel. In further embodiments, ambient air is replaced by other fuels, including when the engines of the invention are adapted to be used as pumps. In the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, the exhaust ports are shown radially outward of the intake ports. In other embodiments, the position of the ports is reversed.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The engines of the invention optionally have exhaust gases directed to any exhaust gas heat energy recovery system, of which the currently most common version includes a turbine, usually linked to a generator. The engine designer has a number of parameters to consider&#x2014;including exhaust emissions control&#x2014;before. determining an appropriate overall fuel-air mixture ratio. Whatever that is (it could be stoichiometric), all the fuel is usually burnt in the combustion chamber(s). In an alternative embodiment, where the exhaust heat energy recovery system includes a turbine, only part of the fuel required for a desired overall fuel-air mixture ratio is burnt in the combustion chamber, leaving excess air in the exhaust gas being feed into the turbine. The fuel remaining in the exhaust is supplied to and burnt in the turbine, optionally or alternatively with other fuel, to prove extra work on the turbine shaft, resulting in the overall fuel-air mixture ratio being as determined. A practical option would be to place the exhaust emission control system downstream of the turbine. The power from the turbine is optionally transferred to a linked electrical generator (not shown).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In a high-performance uncooled engine, exhaust can leave the port at temperatures between 1,000&#xb0; C. and 1,300&#xb0; C. If some of the air heated by the parasitic losses is mixed with the exhaust before it enters an EHERS, optionally using a turbine, temperatures will be lowered and there will be available oxygen for any fuel to be burnt in the EHERS. In a preferred embodiment fuel for a turbine in the EHERS can be supplied in the conventional way by using some form of combustor or injector. In an alternative embodiment, the reciprocating stage is provided with more fuel than can be completely combusted in the chamber due to provision of a too rich mixture or due to the speed the engine is run at (not giving time for all the fuel to combust in the combustion chamber), leaving the unburnt fuel in the exhaust gas. If the exhaust gas is then mixed with or diluted by air heated by parasitic losses, then the fuel will combine with available oxygen and combust in the EHERS. Such an arrangement would constitute a compound internal combustion engine or genset.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">It is proposed to briefly describe those materials which are in general suitable for the high temperature and/or mechanical requirements of the pumps, compressors and IC engines of the invention, and to also describe materials particularly suitable to the filamentary material in particular. Alternatively, material other than described can be used. If the reciprocating device is a pump or compressor, any suitable material may be used, including those mentioned here in connection with other applications and those presently used for pumps and compressors. The invention in any of its embodiments may be made of any suitable material, including those not mentioned here and those which will be devised, discovered or developed in the future. Among the material suitable for use in engines are the high-temperature alloys known as &#x201c;super alloys,&#x201d; usually alloys based on nickel, chrome and/or cobalt, with the addition of hardening elements including titanium, aluminum and refractory metals such as tantalum, tungsten, niobium and molybdenum. These super alloys tend to font stable oxide films at temperatures of over 700&#xb0; C., giving good corrosion protection at ambient temperatures of around 1100&#xb0; C. Examples include the Nimonic and Iconel range of alloys, with melting temperatures in the 1300&#xb0; C. to 1500&#xb0; C. range. At colder temperatures of up to 1000&#xb0; C. and perhaps higher, certain special stainless steels may also be used. All may be reinforced with ceramic, carbon or metal fibers such as molybdenum, beryllium, tungsten or tungsten plated cobalt, optionally surface activated with palladium chloride or any other appropriate coating or film. In addition, and especially where reinforcement capable of oxidizing is not properly protected by the matrix, the metal may be face hardened. Non-metal fibers or whiskers (often fibers grown as single crystals) such as sapphire-aluminum oxide, alumina, asbestos, graphite, boron or betides and other ceramics or glasses may also act as reinforcing materials, as can certain flexible ceramic fibers. Materials, including those used as filamentary matter, may be coated with ceramic by vapor deposition techniques. Ceramics materials are especially suited to the manufacture of pumps or compressors which process corrosive materials, and of engine piston and cylinder assemblies, as well as engine or reactor volume housings, inter-members and opening linings, because of their generally lower thermal conductivity and ability to withstand high temperatures. Suitable materials include ceramics such as alumina, alumina-silicate, magnetite, cordierite, olivine, fosterite, graphite, silicon nitride, some carbides such as silicon carbide; glass ceramics including such as lithium aluminum silicate, cordierite glass ceramic, &#x201c;shrunken&#x201d; glasses such as borosilicate and composites such as sialones, refractory borides, boron carbide, boron silicide, boron nitride, etc. If thermal conductivity is desired, beryllium oxide and silicon carbide may be used. These ceramics or glasses may be fiber or whisker reinforced with much the same material as metals, including carbon fiber, boron fiber, with alumina fibers constituting a practical reinforcement, especially in a high-alumina matrix (the expansion coefficients are the same). It is the very high alumina content ceramics which today might be considered overall the most suited and most available to be used in the invention generally. The ceramic or glass used in the invention may be surface hardened or treated in certain applications, as can metals and often using the same or similar materials, including the metal borides such as of titanium, zirconium and chromium, silicon, etc. Where silicon nitride or other non-oxide ceramics are used in high-performance or long-life engines, or pumps or compressors processing corrosive materials, the surfaces exposed to the worked fluid may be coated with an oxide such as silica, to prevent the base materials surface forming oxides over time and possibly degrading. The filamentary material in the reaction volumes may be made of metals, preferably smoothed and rounded to avoid undue corrosion, or of ceramics or glasses. Other materials which may be particularly suitable are boron filaments, either of pure boron or compounds or composites such as boron-silica, boron carbide, boron-tungsten, titanium diboride tungsten, etc. The filamentary material, especially if ceramic, may easily and conveniently be in the form of wool or fibers, and many ceramic wool or blanket type materials are today manufactured commercially, equally of alumina-silicate, and could readily be adapted to the invention. Such ceramic wool could also be used as a jointing material either alone or as a matrix for a more elastomeric material such as a polymer resin. The material may either be such to have catalytic effect, as in the case of many metals and some ceramics such as alumina, or a surface having catalytic effect may be mounted or coated on a base material, such as ceramic. High temperature lubricants may be necessary for some moving parts, and may be applied either as a liquid or as material coated onto or doped into the surface of a component. They may comprise conventional oil products, or less usual materials such as boron nitride, graphite, silicone fluids and greases, molybdenum compounds, etc.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What I claim is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
