The device has its origins in the Middle East and Near East regions. A typical hookah <b>10</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, includes a water reservoir <b>12</b>. A plug, cap or gasket <b>14</b> (either of which is referred to herein as a &#x201c;cap&#x201d; for illustrative purposes). The cap caps the reservoir. A stem <b>16</b> penetrates the cap such that a first end <b>18</b> of the stem is external of the reservoir whereas a second end <b>20</b> of the stem opposite the first end is within the reservoir. At least one hose <b>22</b> with optionally a mouthpiece (now shown) also penetrates the cap. To use the hookah, the reservoir is partially filled with water <b>25</b> leaving a head space <b>26</b> within the reservoir free of water while submerging the second end <b>20</b> of the stem <b>18</b> within the water. Each hose <b>22</b> extends within the head space <b>26</b> of the reservoir above the water. A tobacco bowl <b>28</b> is connected to the first end <b>18</b> of the stem. Specifically, the tobacco bowl <b>28</b> includes an opening <b>30</b> extending to its lower end for receiving the first end <b>18</b> of the stem. The tobacco bowl defines a conduit <b>32</b> extending from the opening <b>30</b> to interior of the bowl. Tobacco <b>31</b> to be smoked is placed within a tobacco support <b>34</b> defined within the bowl external of the conduit. A perforated coal plate <b>36</b> is mounted over the bowl.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Hookah tobacco, if often referred to as &#x201c;massell.&#x201d; Massell is a mixture of tobacco, molasses, and often a flavor or fruit extract, The molasses and fruit extract add a substantial amount of moisture to the massell that is missing in conventional tobacco. This added moisture makes massell more sensitive to the elements relative to conventional tobacco. To smoke the hookah, the massell or tobacco is placed within the tobacco support <b>34</b> of the bowl. The coal plate <b>36</b> is then mounted on top of the bowl covering the massell. Typically, there is a space between the upper surface of the massell and the coal plate as it is often desirable that the coal does not contact the massell. Lit coals <b>37</b> are placed on top of the coal plate. The heat from the coals ignites the massell. Smoke generated by the ignited massell travels through the conduit and the first end of the stem and exits in the water through the second end of the stem. The water cooled the smoke exits the reservoir through each hose <b>22</b> and corresponding mouth piece as the user inhales through the mouth piece.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">With existing hookahs, as the coals burn down they provide less heat and thus, lower the quality of the smoke. As a result, the coals need to be replaced often.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In an example embodiment a tobacco bowl includes a first member having a tobacco receptacle for receiving tobacco, a second member over the first member, and a coal plate for supporting a coal.

The hookah bowl in an exemplary embodiment has a lower member <b>112</b> and an upper member <b>114</b>. The lower member has a section for interfacing with a hookah stem (<b>16</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). In the shown exemplary embodiment, the section for interfacing with the hookah stem is an opening <b>116</b> for receiving the stem, as for example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. In another example embodiment, the section can be an annular member extending from the lower portion of the lower member that is received within the stem or that receives the stem <b>16</b> of the hookah. A conduit <b>118</b> is formed inside the lower member defining a receptacle <b>120</b> around the conduit and surrounded by a peripheral wall <b>121</b> for receiving the tobacco (e.g., massell), as for example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. The conduit extends from the opening <b>116</b>. The upper member may optionally include a cover <b>122</b> having a vent opening <b>124</b> for covering a top opening <b>125</b> of the upper member. The cover is removable providing access to a coal plate <b>126</b>. The coal plate <b>126</b> is supported on one or more inner peripheral projections <b>128</b> extending radially within the interior of the upper member <b>114</b>. In an example embodiment, a single peripheral projection <b>128</b> extends along a majority or the entire periphery of the interion of the upper member, as for example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. The peripheral projection supports the coal plate <b>122</b>, as for example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>5</b></figref>. The coal plate is plate preferably made of metal and perforated for supporting the coals used to ignite the massell. In an example embodiment, the upper member is couplable with the lower member such that a vertical distance <b>144</b> of the coal plate from a base <b>130</b> of the receptacle <b>120</b> may be varied.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In an example embodiment, the lower member <b>112</b> includes an annular lip <b>132</b> defining a surface <b>133</b> extending along a generally sinusoidal path defining a plurality of peaks <b>134</b> and valleys <b>136</b>, as for example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>6</b></figref>. The upper member <b>114</b> also includes an annular lip <b>138</b> complementary to the lower member annular lip also defining a surface <b>139</b> extending along a sinusoidal path forming peaks <b>140</b> and valleys <b>142</b> such that the peaks of the lower member lip may be received in the valleys of the upper member lip and the peaks in the upper member lip may be received in the valleys of the lower member lip, as for example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The upper member is mated over the lower member such that the upper member annular lip <b>138</b> rests on the lower member annular lip <b>132</b>. Rotating the upper member relative to the lower member causes the lip of the upper member to ride on the lip of the lower member along the sinusoidal path of the lower lip. In this regard, as the peaks of the upper member annular lip slide up on the peaks of the annular lip of the lower member, the upper member rises relative to the lower member as for example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> such that the distance <b>144</b> between the base <b>130</b> of the tobacco receptacle <b>120</b> and the coal plate <b>126</b>, as for example the upper surface <b>146</b> of the coal plate increases. Similarly, as the as the peaks of the upper member annular lip slide down into the valleys of the annular lip of the lower member, the upper member lowers relative to the lower member, as for example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. In this regard, by rotating the upper member relative to the lower member, the vertical distance of the coal plate and the tobacco receptacle base can be varied. In use, a smoker, may rotate the upper member relative to the lower member to reduce the distance between the coal plate and the receptacle and thus, the distance between the coals and the tobacco as the coals burn and wears out. In this regard as the heat generated by the coals decreases the coals are brought closer to the tobacco, such that the heat to which the tobacco is exposed is not reduced as much as if the distance between the coals and the tobacco was kept the same. During a smoking session, a user may rotate the upper member relative to the lower member at multiple intervals each time decreasing the distance between the coal plate and thus, the coals and the tobacco so as to continuously keeping the heat experienced by the tobacco relative constant and the coals burn out. Keeping the heat to which the tobacco is exposed to constant provides for a better smoking experience.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The amount of variance in the distance between the base <b>130</b> of the receptacle <b>120</b> and the coal plate <b>126</b> is a function of the depth of the valleys and/or the height of the peaks in each member.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In an example embodiment, the upper member is rested on the lower member and is removable from the lower member by lifting. When a cap <b>122</b> is provided it caps the second member above the coal plate, such that the cap will extend over the coals.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In other example embodiments instead of a sinusoidal path, the lips may follow a saw tooth path. In another example embodiment, the upper member is threaded to the lower member such that as the upper member is unthreaded from the lower member the distance of the coal plate from the receptacle <b>120</b> is increased. In any of the aforementioned exemplary embodiments, the upper member can rise relative to the lower member by at least 8 mm. In another exemplary embodiment, the upper member can rise relative to the lower member by at least 10 mm. In this regard, when the coals are freshly lit, the upper member is adjusted (e.g. rotated relative to the lower member) so as to increase the distance of the coal plate relative to the receptacle, as for example to the maximum distance <b>144</b>, as for example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref> (e.g. an extended position). Once the coals wear by burning down, the coals can be brought closer to the tobacco as for example by further rotating the upper member relative to the lower member to reduce the distance between the receptacle and the coal plate up to the minimum distance <b>144</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> (e.g. a retracted position).</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In a further example embodiment, the lower member <b>112</b> may be formed with an inner reservoir <b>150</b>, surrounding the conduit <b>118</b>, as for example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. The opening forms an inlet allowing a user to fill the reservoir <b>150</b> with a coolant, such as water, or other fluids that can serve as coolants. The coolant serves to further cool the burning of the tobacco and provide for a smoother smoke. The coolant may be removed from the reservoir through the inlet <b>152</b>. In other example embodiments and inlet and separate outlet are provided. In a further example embodiment, instead of inlet/outlet <b>152</b> an inlet <b>154</b> which may also serve as the outlet is formed through a bottom of the lower member <b>112</b>. A cap <b>158</b> is provided to cap the inlet <b>154</b>. In another example embodiment, instead of an inlet and or outlet, the lower member <b>112</b> may be formed as at two piece member comprising an upper portions including the receptacle <b>120</b> that mates (as for example via threading) with a lower portion that defines the reservoir <b>150</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">While in the shown example embodiment, the tobacco bowl has a generally spherical outer shape, in other example embodiments, the tobacco bowl may have other outer shapes. Moreover the annular lips <b>132</b>, <b>138</b> or the sinusoidal surfaces <b>133</b>, <b>139</b> may are not formed extending to the outer surfaces of the upper and lower members <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> as shown but may be formed in internal members that interact with each other for changing the distance between the coal plate and the base of the tobacco receptacle.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In an example embodiment, the upper member may include depressions or openings <b>155</b> for receiving tool, as for example, a pin or rod for lifting the upper member from the lower member, especially when the upper member is heated.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In an exemplary embodiment, the tobacco bowl is made from concreter or ceramic material that allows the outer surface of the tobacco bowl to remain cool to the touch allowing the user to adjust the location of the upper member relative to the lower member. In other example embodiments, the tobacco bowl may be made from other materials, such as silicone, that allow the outer surfaces of the tobacco bowl to be cool to the touch.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">While this invention has been described in detail with particular references to exemplary embodiments thereof, the exemplary embodiments described herein are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the scope of the invention to the exact forms disclosed.
