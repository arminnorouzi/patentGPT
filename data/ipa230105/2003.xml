The invention further relates to such an electric bicycle, in particular a pedelec.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">For some time now, electric bicycles, in particular pedelecs, have been equipped with operating devices, such an operating device usually serving to signal a state of the electric bicycle to a rider of the electric bicycle. Often, however, such conventional operating devices can only visualize a single state of the electric bicycle. Also, the clarity of the visualization of such a state of the electric bicycle by means of conventional control/regulation devices is often problematic.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is therefore an object of the present invention to show new ways for operating devices as well as for electric bicycles with such an operating device, which in particular take into account the aforementioned problem.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">This problem is solved by the subject-matter of the independent claim(s). Preferred embodiments are the subject matter of the dependent patent claim(s).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, the basic idea of the invention is to equip an operating device for an electric bicycle with a light unit comprising at least one electric light element which can be activated individually by means of a control/regulation device of the operating device in such a way that a light code can be generated by means of the control/regulation device, by means of which a momentary state of the electric bicycle can be visualized for its rider.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Advantageously, the at least one current state of the electric bicycle can be visualized for its rider in a particularly clear manner by means of such a light code. It goes without saying that the rider must recognize the illuminated code and decipher its meaning. At the same time, the illuminated code makes it possible to visualize various characteristics or gradations of such a momentary state for the rider.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">An operating device according to the invention for an electric bicycle, in particular for a pedelec, comprises a control/regulation device. The operating device can be a man-machine interface, which is also familiar to a person skilled in the art under the designation &#x201c;man-machine interface&#x201d;. The operating device comprises a light unit which comprises at least one electrical light element for emitting light, which is electrically connected to the control/regulation device in such a way that each light element can be activated separately by means of the control/regulation device for emitting light. In this case, the control/regulation device can be used to generate a light code, in particular an animated light code, with active or/and inactive light elements of the light unit, by means of which at least one current state of the electric bicycle can be visualized for its rider. As already explained above, a particularly clear visualization of the at least one momentary state of the electric bicycle can thus be realized.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to a preferred embodiment the lighting unit which comprises at least two electrical lighting elements for emitting light which can be activated separately by means of the control/regulation device for emitting the light.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Expediently, the light unit is configured in the form of a strip and comprises a plurality of light elements arranged next to one another in a row. This makes it possible to further increase the clarity of the visualization. In addition, the service device with such a lighting unit is particularly narrow, which simplifies its accommodation on a frame of the electric bicycle.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a preferred further development of the operating device, the control/regulation device can be connected to a bus system, in particular to a field bus, of the electric bicycle, so that the control/regulation device can communicate in a data-transmitting manner via the bus system with further components of the electric bicycle connected to the bus system. In this case, a (first) momentary state corresponds to a momentary operating state of at least one of the components of the electric bicycle connected to the bus system. Advantageously, information about the current operating state of the components connected to the bus system can thus be supplied to the rider by means of the visualization, so that the rider can adapt his riding behavior to it.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a further advantageous further development of the operating device, the latter comprises a data transmission device for wireless communication with an electronic device, in particular one that can be carried by the rider, which is electrically connected to the control/regulation device, so that the control/regulation device can communicate with the electronic device by means of the data transmission device. In this case, a (second) instantaneous state corresponds to an instantaneous operating state of the electronic device. Advantageously, sensor technology installed in the electronic device can thus be used without sensor technology of the same function having to be installed in the electric bicycle itself.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The data transmission device could be configured in such a way that it supports &#x201c;Blue-tooth-Low-Energy&#x201d; as the communication standard for wireless data transmission communication with the electronic device. This communication standard is also supported by most electronic devices available on the market.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to a further preferred further development of the operating device, the same comprises an inertial measuring device which is electrically connected to the control/regulation device, so that the control/regulation device can access measurement data generated by the inertial measuring device, a (third) instantaneous state being determined by this measurement data. Advantageously, information about the measurement data can thus be supplied to the rider by the visualization.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In a further advantageous further development of the operating device, it is provided that the operating device comprises an input unit that can be actuated by the rider, which preferably has an electromechanical button, which is electrically or wirelessly connected to the control/regulation device. In this case, the input unit can be used to select which of at least two instantaneous states of the electric bicycle is visualized by means of the illuminated code. The rider can therefore advantageously obtain particularly precise information about an overall state, which is composed of the momentary states, by having the individual momentary states visualized specifically one after the other by means of the illuminated code.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to a further advantageous further development of the operating device, the same comprises an electronic memory, in particular a flash memory, which is electrically connected to the control/regulation device so that the control/regulation device can access the electronic memory by means of read or write access. Information can thus be prestored on the electronic memory, which the control/regulation device can use in determining the current state of the electric bicycle.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to a further preferred further development of the control/regulation device, the control/regulation device is capable of machine learning, whereby learned information can be written to the electronic memory by means of the control/regulation device. In this way, information pre-stored on the control/regulation device, which can be used by the control/regulation device in determining the momentary state of the electric bicycle, can be successively made more precise automatically.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Expediently, each light element is configured to selectively emit light of one of at least two colors when active. In this case, the color or brightness of the light emitted by the respective luminous element can be selected by means of the control/regulation device. The light code thus receives an additional coding level in the form of a color coding or brightness.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In a further preferred further development of the operating device, the latter may comprise an additional lighting element which is set apart from the lighting unit and is electrically connected to the control/regulation device in such a way that it could be activated separately by means of the control/regulation device, the additional lighting element or the light emitted by it being part of the light code. In this way, the illuminated code can be provided with yet another additional coding level.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to a further advantageous further development of the operating device, the light unit extends along an extension direction along which the light elements of the row are lined up, in particular without gaps between them, the input unit being arranged along the extension direction in alignment with the light unit. This permits a particularly clear visualization of the at least one state of the electric bicycle.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In a further preferred further development of the operating device, it is provided that the operating device comprises a housing, in particular with or made of plastic, the housing being at least partially receivable in a recess of a tube, preferably of a top tube, of a frame of the electric bicycle, in particular with a flange section of the housing resting on the tube. Such a control/regulation device can be particularly securely fastened to the frame of the electric bicycle.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The invention also relates to an electric bicycle, in particular a pedelec, with a control/regulation device according to the invention as described above. The advantages of the operating device according to the invention already mentioned are also transferred to the electric bicycle according to the invention. The electric bicycle comprises an electric drive, which is drive-connected to a wheel of the electric bicycle, and an electric storage device for supplying the electric drive with electric power. The control unit is electrically connected to the electric drive and/or the electric accumulator, in particular by means of a bus system of the electric bicycle. A current status of the electric bicycle, which can be visualized by means of the illuminated code for a rider of the electric bicycle, corresponds to a current operating state of the electric drive and/or the electric accumulator.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In an advantageous further development of the electric bicycle, the same comprises a handlebar which has a vibration device by means of which a haptic vibration signal or acoustic signal can be supplied to the rider of the electric bicycle. The vibration device is connected in a data-transmitting manner to the control/regulation device of the operating device, in particular by means of the bus system, so that the rider can be supplied with information, in particular about at least one state of the electric bicycle, by means of the vibration signal in addition to the illuminated code. Thus, the rider can advantageously be provided with information about the state of the electric bicycle even if current traffic conditions prevent the rider from looking at the operating device.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Further important features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the sub-claims, from the drawings and from the accompanying figure description based on the drawings.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">It is understood that the above features and those to be explained below can be used not only in the combination indicated in each case, but also in other combinations or on their own, without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Preferred examples of embodiments of the invention are shown in the drawings and are explained in more detail in the following description, wherein the same reference signs refer to identical or similar or functionally identical components.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The following are shown schematically:</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an example of a functional diagram of an electric bicycle according to the invention with an example of an operating device according to the invention,</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows, in perspective, a detail of the electric bicycle of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>,</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a bird's-eye view of the operating device of the electric bicycle of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, which is in a first momentary state,</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a plan view of the operating device of the electric bicycle of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>3</b></figref>, which is in a second momentary state.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> schematically shows a functional diagram of an example of an electric bicycle <b>2</b> according to the invention, which comprises an operating device <b>1</b> according to the invention, which is also shown as an example.

Such a component K can be an electrical storage device B of the electric bicycle <b>2</b>, in which case the first momentary state can be a charging process of the electrical storage device B.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">According to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the operating device <b>1</b> comprises, for example, a data transmission device <b>10</b> for wireless communication with an electronic device D. The electronic device D may be carried by the rider of the electric bicycle <b>2</b>. The electronic device D may be a smartphone or a smartwatch. The data transmission device <b>10</b> is electrically connected to the control/regulation device <b>3</b>, so that the control/regulation device <b>3</b> can communicate wirelessly with the electronic device D in a data-transmitting manner by means of the data transmission device <b>10</b>. In this case, a second instantaneous state, which can be visualized by means of the light code <b>6</b>, corresponds to an instantaneous operating state of the electronic device D. For example, recourse can be made to sensor technology installed in the electronic device D, the sensor data of which can indirectly describe the second instantaneous state of the electric bicycle <b>2</b>. For example, the device may comprise a GPS sensor by means of which position data can be determined that at least indirectly also reflect the position of the electric bicycle <b>2</b>. Consequently, the second instantaneous state of the electric bicycle <b>2</b> may be determined by the position of the electric bicycle <b>2</b> on a virtual map or, for example, by an instantaneous distance of the electric bicycle <b>2</b> to a predetermined destination with a known position. The data transmission device <b>1</b> is configured to support &#x201c;Bluetooth-Low-Energy&#x201d; as a communication standard for data-transmitting communication with the electronic device D.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">It can also be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> that the control/regulation device <b>1</b> comprises an inertial measurement device <b>11</b>. The inertial measurement device <b>11</b> may comprise a gyro sensor. The inertial measurement device <b>11</b> may comprise at least one acceleration sensor. The inertial measurement device <b>11</b> may comprise at least one rotation rate sensor. The inertial measurement device <b>11</b> may form or be part of an inertial navigation system. The inertial measurement device <b>11</b> is electrically connected to the control/regulation device <b>3</b> in such a way that the control/regulation device <b>3</b> can access measurement data generated by the inertial measurement device <b>11</b>. In this case, a third instantaneous state, which can be visualized by means of the light code <b>6</b>, is determined by the measurement data. The third instantaneous state of the electric bicycle <b>2</b> can therefore be, for example, an instantaneous acceleration or an instantaneous speed of the electric bicycle <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">It further follows from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> that the operating device <b>1</b> comprises an input unit <b>12</b> which can be operated by the rider of the electric bicycle <b>2</b>.

The input unit <b>12</b> is electrically connected to the control/regulation device <b>3</b>. By means of the input unit <b>12</b>, the rider can select which of at least two instantaneous states of the electric bicycle <b>2</b> is visualized or is to be visualized by means of the illuminated code <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">According to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the operating device <b>1</b> further comprises an electronic memory <b>14</b>. The electronic memory <b>14</b> may comprise a flash memory F or may be a flash memory F. The electronic memory <b>14</b> is electrically connected to the input unit <b>12</b>. The electronic memory <b>14</b> is electrically connected to the control/regulation device <b>3</b>, so that the control/regulation device <b>3</b> can access the electronic memory <b>14</b> by means of read or write access. For example, the control/regulation device <b>3</b> is capable of machine learning, whereby learned information can be written to the electronic memory <b>14</b> by the control/regulation device <b>3</b>. Thus, the control/regulation device <b>3</b> can derive and store measures based on an evaluation of past states of the electric bicycle <b>2</b>, as a result of which measures the visualization of the illuminated code <b>6</b> can be automatically adjusted. For example, by evaluating past states of the electric bicycle <b>2</b>, the control/regulation device <b>3</b> can learn under which conditions the electric storage unit B of the electric bicycle empties particularly quickly and then, by automatically adapting the visualization of the illuminated code <b>6</b>, signal to the rider of the electric bicycle <b>2</b> how he should behave in order to avert said conditions and thus to be able to make the best possible use of a range of the electric storage unit B. However, a variety of further examples of machine learning processes of the control/regulation device <b>3</b> are also conceivable.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows the control/regulation device <b>1</b> of the electric bicycle <b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> in a bird's-eye view image sequence.
