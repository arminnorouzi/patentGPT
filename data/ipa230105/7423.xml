A set of filters is applied to the input audio signals to obtain the plurality of output audio signals which are output to the array of loudspeakers. The present disclosure relates primarily to ways of determining those filters.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">A method of generating audio signals for the array of loudspeakers is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">At step S<b>100</b>, a plurality of input audio signals are received. A respective one of the plurality of input audio signals is to be reproduced, by the array, at each of a plurality of control points in an acoustic environment, e.g., a first input audio signal is to be reproduced at a first control point, and a second input audio signal is to be reproduced at a second control point and a third control point. Each of the plurality of control points is associated with a respective one of a plurality of loudspeaker groups, e.g., the first control point is associated with a first loudspeaker group and the second and third control points are associated with a second loudspeaker group.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">At step S<b>110</b>, an estimate of a position of each of the plurality of control points is received, e.g., from a position sensor.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">At step S<b>120</b>, each of the loudspeakers in the array is assigned to at least one of the plurality of loudspeaker groups, e.g., a first, second and third loudspeaker may be assigned to the first loudspeaker group, and the third, a fourth and a fifth loudspeaker may be assigned to the second loudspeaker group. The assigning may be using the received estimate of the position of each of the plurality of control points.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">As will be explained in more detail, the assigning of a particular loudspeaker to a particular loudspeaker group is based on a relative position of the particular loudspeaker with respect to one or more of the at least one control points associated with the particular loudspeaker group. For example, the assigning of the third loudspeaker to a particular loudspeaker group may be based on a relative position of the third loudspeaker with respect to 1) the first control point (the control point associated with the first loudspeaker group) and 2) the second and/or third control points (the control points associated with the second loudspeaker group); if the third loudspeaker is closer to the first control point than to the second and/or third control points, the third loudspeaker may be assigned to the first loudspeaker group.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">At step S<b>130</b>, a set of filters may be determined based on the assigning of loudspeakers to groups. The manner in which the set of filters is determined is described in detail below.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">At step S<b>140</b>, a respective output audio signal for each of the loudspeakers in the array is determined by applying the set of filters to the plurality of input audio signals. The output audio signal for a particular loudspeaker is generated according to the at least one loudspeaker group to which the particular loudspeaker is assigned.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The set of filters may be applied in the frequency domain. In this case, a transform, such as a fast Fourier transform (FFT), is applied to the input audio signals, the filters are applied, and an inverse transform is then applied to obtain the output audio signals.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">At step S<b>150</b>, the output audio signals may be output to the loudspeaker array.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Steps S<b>100</b> to S<b>150</b> may be repeated with another plurality of input audio signals. These steps may be repeated in real time.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As steps S<b>100</b> to S<b>150</b> are repeated, the set of filters may remain the same, in which case step S<b>130</b> need not be repeated, or may change. Similarly, if the position of each of the plurality of control points is known not to, or is assumed not to, change for a particular amount of time, then steps S<b>110</b> to S<b>130</b> need not be repeated for that particular amount of time.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As one example, steps S<b>110</b>, S<b>120</b> and S<b>130</b> can be performed once, during an initialisation phase, and need not be repeated thereafter. For example, the estimates of the positions of each of the plurality of control points may be based on a model rather than being received from a position sensor, and the group assignment of step S<b>120</b> and/or the set of filters of step S<b>130</b> may be pre-computed.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">A method of determining a set of filters may be performed using steps S<b>110</b> to S<b>130</b>. By performing such a method, the set of filters can be pre-computed, for example, when programming a device to perform the method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.

More specifically, the disclosure encompasses systems to perform sound-field control and control the sound field at two or more different points in space. This can be used to create personal virtual acoustic images through a plurality of loudspeakers and the use of cross-talk cancellation or beamforming with minimum latency (by controlling the sound pressure at the two ears of the listener) or for multi-zone audio reproduction (two or more different signals delivered two or more different zones in space).</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Practical Problem to be Solved</heading><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Consider the case when we want to use an array of L loudspeakers, to control the reproduced sound pressure at two or more points in space and deliver an independent signal to each control point. This is achieved by creating a signal processing apparatus that takes the two or more inputs signals d<sub>1</sub>, d<sub>2</sub>, . . . and generates L loudspeaker signals. The signal processing apparatus includes one or multiple bank of filters. These filters may be non-causal, or may include delays that, in general, affect the input-output latency, hereafter succinctly referred to as latency. The present disclosure proposes a strategy to minimise the latency of the signal processing apparatus.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">It is shown below that, in the general case, the control filters are non-causal IIR filters. They can be approximated as causal FIR filters by truncation and by applying a large modelling delay. This, however, comes at the cost of a significant system latency.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">It is shown below that the lack of causality of the control filter is caused by the fact that the determinant of the matrix to be inverted for the filter computation is not minimum phase. The present disclosure devises a strategy to ensure the determinant is causal.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Technical Solutions</heading><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Creating audio signal processing strategies to perform sound-field control has been the focus of the industry and academia for many years. The motivation is to accurately control sound radiation from a set of speakers to achieve a desired sound-field reproduction pattern to yield a particular sound effect. Such effects are for example: to create a perceived direction of sound propagation, to create zones of differentiated acoustic pressure inside an environment for delivery of independent sound content (also known as sound zoning or personal audio) or to accurately control sound pressure at the listeners ears to deliver 3D sound, commonly known as cross-talk cancellation (CTC). The approach of the present disclosure can be used to achieve all these effects.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Sound-field control audio reproduction systems require solving an electro-acoustic problem that is based on the inversion of the electro-acoustic path between loudspeakers and the listener's ears. The solution of such problem yields a set of electrical or, in the field of this disclosure, digital filters that applied to the loudspeaker input signals yield a given sound propagation pattern. Previous art for creating digital filters for sound-field control require the digital filter to have certain time and frequency constraints. Considering an audio reproduction system using just two loudspeakers, the first constraint is to control the norm of the digital filters so that these do not produce audible colouration and artefacts and, furthermore, do not excessively boost the loudspeakers with the risk of damaging them. In order to solve such problem, the most common solution is the use of Tychonov regularisation. Although this technique may seem good to control the filter energy usage, the use of Tychonov regularisation introduces the need of applying a modelling delay to the filters time series. Depending on the application, the added modelling delay may not be desirable, as the total system latency of the digital filters is dependent on the filter length. Techniques exist that can minimise latency for systems using just two loudspeakers, however the latency problem cannot be easily avoided if more than two loudspeakers are employed in an array, even if no regularisation is used.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Sound-field control systems using more than two loudspeakers have been shown to be desirable, as they minimise the effect of room reflections and also provide a better acoustic control over the whole audio-frequency range. The use of more than two loudspeakers, however, requires the introduction of a modelling delay. Previous techniques have shown that the modelling delay can be minimised if the electro-acoustic problem is solved following a time-domain approach rather than a frequency-domain approach. In practice, time-domain based techniques require the calculation of very large inverse matrices, which is not possible in the context of real-time adaptive systems that require to constantly calculate and adapt the digital control filters according to the instantaneous position of the pressure control points. Therefore, new techniques that allow for the minimisation of the filter processing latency with loudspeaker arrays are required.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The approach of the present disclosure, Technology 3, introduces a strategy to satisfy such needs. By splitting the process between the loudspeaker array filters it is possible to minimise the filter latency to &#x201c;zero&#x201d; latency in the case of a symmetric listener or to &#x201c;quasi-zero&#x201d; latency for the case when listeners are not place symmetrically with respect to a loudspeaker array. The approach of the present disclosure is generalised with respect to all loudspeaker array control techniques (Technology 1 and non-Technology 1).</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">Theoretical Definition of Problem</heading><p id="p-0057" num="0056">As explained below, the novel signal processing strategy disclosed in this document is based on splitting the loudspeakers into two or more groups. Each group of loudspeakers is associated to one control point. The system takes M signals as input, each of which is supposed to be delivered to a given control point, but not to the others (for example, signal d<sub>1 </sub>is expected to be delivered to the control point at x<sub>1 </sub>and not to at x<sub>2</sub>, x<sub>3 </sub>etc.). If the system is fed with only one of the M signals, say d<sub>1</sub>, while d<sub>2</sub>=d<sub>3</sub>= . . . =0, the signal processing apparatus will be such that the first group of loudspeakers will create a sound beam to deliver the signal d<sub>1 </sub>to control point x<sub>1</sub>, whilst the second set of loudspeakers will create a sound beam to cancel any leakage of signal d<sub>1 </sub>at control point x<sub>2</sub>, the third set of loudspeakers will create a sound beam to cancel the leakage of signal d<sub>1 </sub>to control point x<sub>3</sub>, and so on. As explained below, if the two or more groups of loudspeakers are chosen wisely, the method ensures that all digital filters are causal or require a very short modelling delay to become causal. This minimises the input-output latency of the system.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">On the contrary, it is shown below that when the number of loudspeakers is equal or larger than 3 the digital filter computed with a conventional approach (i.e. without the method disclosed here) will, in general, be non-causal. This means that the output of the filters depends, in theory, on both past and future values of the input. These filters can be approximated as causal FIR filters, but at the cost of introducing a long modelling delay and therefore increasing the system latency.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In what follows, we first introduce the geometry and variables needed to study this problem. We will then demonstrate with numerical examples that the control filters of implementations common in the state of the art are non-causal and show that this is caused by the fact that the determinant of the matrix to be inverted is not minimum-phase and non-causal. We will then disclose our strategy to subdivide the loudspeaker into groups and demonstrate, again with numerical examples, that this approach allows for the determinant of the matrix to be minimum phase and therefore for the design of causal control filters (if a small modelling delay is applied). For completeness, a mathematical proof is provided of the (lack of) causality of the filters in the simple case of 2 control points and free-field transfer functions.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Consider a system with a reference geometry as reported in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.

They can be approximated by causal filters by applying a modelling delay to the elements of H (and by truncating the filters in the time domain, or equivalently by applying a frequency sampling approach), but this comes at the cost of significantly increasing the system latency.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0062">To illustrate this effect, let's consider a simple set-up consisting of an array of a plurality of loudspeakers and 2 control points located at the ear of a listener, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.

The bottom of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows the loudspeaker array filters, computed with equation 2 and no modelling delay (T=0). In this case, it can be clearly observed that these control filters are non-causal, as a clear &#x201c;pre-ringing&#x201d; is present. A closer analysis reveals that the filters are (as it will be shown later) non-causal IIR filters. The common strategy to overcome this issue is to apply a modelling delay of N<sub>FFT</sub>/2, but this will of course have a significant effect on the latency of the system. In any case, since the control filters are non-causal IIR, the lack of causality could never be completely compensated by a modelling delay. An objective of the approach of the present disclosure is therefore to eliminate the non-causal pre-ringing in the filters.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">Explanation of Non-Causality</heading><p id="p-0068" num="0063">Equation 2 can be rewritten as</p><p id="p-0069" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mtable>  <mtr>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mi>H</mi>     <mo>=</mo>     <mrow>      <msup>       <mi>e</mi>       <mrow>        <mrow>         <mo>-</mo>         <mi>j</mi>        </mrow>        <mo>&#x2062;</mo>        <mi>&#x3c9;</mi>        <mo>&#x2062;</mo>        <mi>T</mi>       </mrow>      </msup>      <mo>&#x2062;</mo>      <msup>       <mi>G</mi>       <mi>H</mi>      </msup>      <mo>&#x2062;</mo>      <mrow>       <mi>adj</mi>       <mo>&#x2061;</mo>       <mo>(</mo>       <mrow>        <msup>         <mi>GG</mi>         <mi>H</mi>        </msup>        <mo>+</mo>        <mi>A</mi>       </mrow>       <mo>)</mo>      </mrow>      <mo>&#x2062;</mo>      <mfrac>       <mn>1</mn>       <mrow>        <mi>det</mi>        <mo>&#x2061;</mo>        <mo>(</mo>        <mrow>         <msup>          <mi>GG</mi>          <mi>H</mi>         </msup>         <mo>+</mo>         <mi>A</mi>        </mrow>        <mo>)</mo>       </mrow>      </mfrac>     </mrow>    </mrow>   </mtd>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mo>(</mo>     <mn>3</mn>     <mo>)</mo>    </mrow>   </mtd>  </mtr> </mtable></math></maths></p><p id="p-0070" num="0064">Each of the terms of this equation can be studied independently.
