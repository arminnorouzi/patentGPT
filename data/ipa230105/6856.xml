The devices within a user's home thus become part of an Internet-of-Things (IoT) environment. Devices within the IoT environment can exchange data with each other, and with a user. A user may also need to take an action in response to data received from an IoT device. In cases where a media device, such as a television, tablet, or mobile device, is part of a user's IoT environment, notifications from other IoT devices, and the user's need to respond, may interfere with the user's ability to watch media assets.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Accordingly, systems and methods are described herein for controlling playback and/or recording of media assets at a media device based on the state of a secondary device. Specifically, while displaying a media asset, a media device receives a signal from the secondary device indicating a change of state of the secondary device, e.g., an IoT device such as a microwave, a laundry machine, the oven, and/or the like. The media device causes the display of a notification of the signal, e.g., in the form of a message widget having an interactive or selectable element providing options for the user to perform an action, and the user can interact with the notification. If the user interacts with the notification for more than a threshold amount of time, the media device may begin recording the media asset. Once the user has finished interacting with the notification, the media device may stop recording and the user can see content that he or she may have missed by reviewing the recorded portion of the media asset. The helps ensure that the user does not miss too much content of a streaming media asset while the user needs to shift his or her attention away from the media asset to take care of the second device, e.g., to turn off the oven, etc.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In some aspects, the media device receives a signal indicative of a state change of a secondary device from a first state to a second state. For example, a smart oven sends a signal indicating an amount of time left on a timer set of the oven. In some cases, the signal may include audio and/or video data. For example, a smart doorbell sends a signal indicating the someone has rung the bell, and transmits audio and video of the person who rung the bell.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The media device generates for display a notification of the signal. For example, the media device may generate an overlay for display over the media asset. The overlay may include an identification of the secondary device and a status of the secondary device corresponding to the current state of the secondary device. For example, the overlay may identify an oven and the amount of time remaining on a timer set on the oven, or may identify a doorbell and indicate that someone has rung the bell.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The media device receives input from a user input device to interact with the displayed notification. For example, where the media device is a tablet or mobile device, the user may interact with the notification using a touchscreen interface. If the media device is a set-top box, the user may interact with the notification using a remote control. In some embodiments, the user input device may be another IoT device or connected device, such as the user's mobile device, Amazon Echo, or Google Home.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In response to receiving the input, the media device stores a first time of receipt of the user input and determines, after a threshold amount of time, whether the secondary device is still in the second state. For example, the media device may receive user input to interact with the notification at 7:05:00 and records that time. After, for example, ten seconds, at a second time of 7:05:10, the media device determines if the smart oven is still reporting the time remaining on a timer, or if someone is still waiting outside the door after ringing the smart doorbell. If so, the media device buffers the media asset from at least the second time.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some embodiments, the media device may pause playback of the media asset in response to receiving the user input to interact with the notification. For example, if a smart doorbell reports that someone has rung the bell, the media device may pause playback of the media asset in order to allow the user to hear what the person at the door is saying.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, when the media device determines that the secondary device is no longer in the second state, the media device generates options for display relating to the playback of the media asset. If the media device has recorded a portion of the media asset, an option to restart playback of the media asset from the second time is generated. If the media device has also paused playback of the media asset, an option to resume playback of the media asset at the current live point in the media asset is also generated.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, the media device determines whether the secondary device is still in the second state by monitoring transmissions from the user input device and determining if a transmission is addressed to the secondary device. For example, the media device may detect data packets from the user input device and access a header of each packet to identify the destination of the packet. If any packet is addressed to the secondary device, the media device determines that the user is still interacting with the secondary device and that the secondary device is still in the second state.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, the media device establishes a connection with the secondary device and with the user input device. For example, the media device may act as an IoT controller device and create a network including the media device, the secondary device, and the user input device. The media device receives the signal from the secondary device and the user input from the user input device via the established connections. The media device may, in some embodiments, create a direct connection between the secondary device and the user input device by bridging the established connections. The media device then relays data between the secondary device and the user input device via the direct connection.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, the media device receives, from the secondary device, audio and/or video data associated with the second state of the secondary device. For example, the secondary device may be a smart doorbell, which may transmit audio and video captured from a microphone and camera of the smart doorbell to the media device. The media device then outputs the received audio and/or video data.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The above and other objects and advantages of the disclosure will be apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like reference characters refer to like parts throughout, and in which:</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a generalized embodiment of a media device receiving a signal from a secondary device indicating a change of state of the secondary device in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a block diagram representing a media device in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a flowchart representing a process for controlling playback or recording of a media asset in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a flowchart representing a process for determining a secondary device is still in a particular state in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure; and</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a flowchart representing a process for establishing connections between a media device and a secondary device and between a media device and a user input device in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Systems and methods are described herein for controlling playback and/or recording of media assets at a media device based on the state of a secondary device.

Media device <b>100</b> may be a smartphone or other mobile device, a tablet, a personal computer, a smart TV, a set-top box, an integrated receiver decoder (IRD) for handling satellite television, a digital storage device, a digital media receiver (DMR), a digital media adapter (DMA), a streaming media device, a DVD player, a DVD recorder, a connected DVD, a local media server, a BLU-RAY player, a BLU-RAY recorder, a WebTV box, a personal computer television (PC/TV), a PC media server, a PC media center, a handheld computer, a stationary telephone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a portable video player, a portable music player, a portable gaming machine, or any other device suitable for output of media assets. Secondary device <b>102</b> may be any device within the user's network capable of outputting a status signal or capturing audio or video input and transmitting the status signal or captured audio or video to another device in the network. For example, media device <b>100</b> may be a stereo system (e.g., Sonos) and secondary device <b>102</b> may be a user's smartphone which captures audio input from the user and transmits the audio to the stereo system. Other examples include a &#x201c;smart&#x201d; kitchen appliance transmitting audio of a timer notification to a set-top box or stereo system, a smoke alarm transmitting a siren or klaxon sound (along with verbal instructions such as evacuation routes), a smart doorbell transmitting audio and/or video of someone at the door, a motion detector transmitting a signal to a security camera to begin recording, and a parent transmitting a voice instruction from one device to a child using a second device. These examples are not limiting, and are provided for illustrative purposes only. For the purpose of this application, the example of a smart doorbell is used herein. The secondary device <b>102</b> transmits a signal <b>104</b> to the media device <b>100</b> indicating a state change of the secondary device. For example, when someone rings the doorbell, the smart doorbell <b>102</b> transmits a signal <b>104</b> to the media device <b>100</b> indicating that the state of the doorbell has changed from idle to active. The signal <b>104</b> may also include an identification of the doorbell <b>102</b>, and may optionally include audio and/or video data captured by a microphone and/or camera of the doorbell <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a block diagram of a media device in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure. Media device <b>100</b> includes control circuitry <b>200</b>. Control circuitry <b>200</b> may be based on any suitable processing circuitry and comprises control circuits and memory circuits which may be disposed on a single integrated circuit, or may be discrete components. As referred to herein, processing circuitry should be understood to mean circuitry based on one or more microprocessors, microcontrollers, digital signal processors, programmable logic devices, field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), etc., and may include a multi-core processor (e.g., dual-core, quad-core, hexa-core, or any suitable number of cores) or supercomputer. In some embodiments, processing circuitry may be distributed across multiple separate processors or processing units, for example, multiple of the same type of processing units (e.g., two Intel Core i7 processors) or multiple different processors (e.g., an Intel Core i5 processor and an Intel Core i7 processor). Some control circuits may be implemented in hardware, firmware, or software. Media device <b>100</b> may receive <b>202</b> a media asset at a playback buffer <b>204</b>. The media asset may be a live broadcast, a streaming media asset, a locally stored media asset, or may be received from any suitable source using any suitable method or protocol for transferring media data.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">As it is received at the playback buffer <b>204</b>, media data of the media asset is processed and audio and video signals are generated and transmitted <b>206</b> to a media output <b>208</b>, which in turn transmits <b>210</b> the audio and video signals to an integrated display (e.g., a touchscreen display panel of a tablet) or an external output device (e.g., a television). Playback buffer <b>204</b> may comprise video-generating circuitry and tuning circuitry, such as one or more analog tuners, one or more MPEG-2 decoders or other digital decoding circuitry, high-definition tuners, or any other suitable tuning or video circuits or combinations of such circuits. Encoding circuitry (e.g., for converting over-the-air, analog, or digital signals to MPEG signals for storage) may also be provided.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">While outputting <b>210</b> the audio and video signals of the media asset, the media device <b>100</b> receives, at linked device communications controller <b>212</b>, signal <b>104</b> from secondary device <b>102</b>. Linked device communications controller <b>212</b> may include an Ethernet card, a wireless (e.g., IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n) modem for communications with other equipment, a Bluetooth transceiver, or any other suitable communications circuitry. Such communications may involve the Internet or any other suitable communications networks or paths. In addition, linked device communications controller <b>212</b> may include circuitry that enables peer-to-peer communication of user equipment devices, or communication of user equipment devices in locations remote from each other.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In response to receiving signal <b>104</b>, control circuitry <b>200</b> (e.g., using linked device communications controller <b>212</b>) generates for display a notification <b>106</b> of the signal <b>104</b>. For example, the media device may generate an overlay for display over a currently playing media asset. The notification <b>106</b> may include an identification of the secondary device <b>102</b> and a status of the secondary device <b>102</b> corresponding to the current state of the secondary device <b>102</b>. For example, the notification may identify an oven and the amount of time remaining on a timer set on the oven, or may identify a doorbell and indicate that someone has rung the bell. Linked device communications controller <b>212</b> transmits <b>214</b> the generated notification <b>106</b> to media output <b>208</b> for output.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some embodiments, the signal <b>106</b> may comprise an audio component. For example, the signal may be a spoken message. In addition to outputting <b>210</b> notification <b>106</b> as an overlay, control circuitry <b>200</b> (e.g., using media output <b>208</b>) may output the audio component. In order to allow the user to hear the audio component of the signal <b>106</b>, control circuitry <b>200</b> (e.g., using media output <b>208</b>) may mute an audio component of the media asset. Alternatively, control circuitry <b>200</b> (e.g., using media output <b>208</b>) may blend the audio component of signal <b>106</b> with an audio component of the media asset, balancing volume levels of both audio components so that the audio component of the signal <b>106</b> is audible to, and comprehensible by, the user.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The media device <b>100</b> receives, e.g., at the linked device communications controller <b>212</b>, input <b>216</b> from a user input device to interact with the displayed notification <b>106</b>. For example, where the media device <b>100</b> is a tablet or mobile device, the user may interact with notification <b>106</b> using a touchscreen interface that is integrated into the media device <b>100</b> and communicates with control circuitry <b>200</b> of the media device <b>100</b> via the linked device communications controller <b>212</b>. If the media device <b>100</b> is a set-top box, the user may interact with notification <b>106</b> using a remote control that communicates with control circuitry <b>200</b> of media device <b>100</b> via the linked device communications controller <b>212</b>. In some embodiments, the user input device may be another IoT device or connected device, such as the user's mobile device, Amazon Echo, or Google Home, which communicates with control circuitry <b>200</b> of the media device <b>100</b> via linked device communications controller <b>212</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In response to receiving the input <b>216</b>, control circuitry <b>200</b> stores a first time of receipt of the user input in a memory <b>220</b>, which may be part of linked device communications controller <b>212</b>, or may be a separate component of control circuitry <b>200</b>. Memory may be an electronic storage device. As referred to herein, the phrase &#x201c;electronic storage device&#x201d; or &#x201c;storage device&#x201d; should be understood to mean any device for storing electronic data, computer software, or firmware, such as random-access memory, read-only memory, hard drives, optical drives, digital video disc (DVD) recorders, compact disc (CD) recorders, BLU-RAY disc (BD) recorders, BLU-RAY 3D disc recorders, digital video recorders (DVR, sometimes called a personal video recorder, or PVR), solid state devices, quantum storage devices, gaming consoles, gaming media, or any other suitable fixed or removable storage devices, and/or any combination of the same. Control circuitry <b>200</b> determines, after a threshold amount of time, whether the secondary device <b>102</b> is still in the second state. For example, the media device <b>100</b> may receive user input <b>216</b> to interact with notification <b>106</b> at 7:05:00 and stores that time. The threshold amount of time may be, for example, ten seconds. Control circuitry <b>200</b> may instantiate a timer process to count the threshold amount of time beginning at the stored time. Alternatively, control circuitry <b>200</b> may periodically compare a current time to the stored time to determine if the threshold amount of time has elapsed. If, at a second time of 7:05:10, the threshold amount of time after the stored time, control circuitry <b>200</b> determines that the secondary device <b>102</b> is still in the second state (i.e., someone is still waiting outside the door after ringing a smart doorbell), control circuitry <b>200</b> (e.g., using linked device communications controller <b>212</b>) transmits a command <b>218</b> to playback buffer <b>204</b> to begin buffering the media asset.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments, the media device <b>100</b> may pause playback of the media asset in response to receiving the user input to interact with the notification. For example, if a smart doorbell reports that someone has rung the bell, control circuitry <b>200</b> (e.g., using linked device communications controller <b>212</b>) may transmit <b>218</b> a command to playback buffer <b>204</b> to pause playback of the media asset in order to allow the user to hear what the person at the door is saying.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">When control circuitry <b>200</b> (e.g., using linked device communications controller <b>212</b>) determines that the secondary device is no longer in the second state, control circuitry <b>200</b> may automatically resume playback of the media asset at the current playback position, or at a playback position corresponding to the time the user input <b>216</b> was received. In some embodiments, when control circuitry <b>200</b> (e.g., using linked device communications controller <b>212</b>) determines that the secondary device is no longer in the second state, linked device communications controller <b>212</b> generates options for display relating to the playback of the media asset and transmits <b>214</b> the generated options to media output <b>208</b> for display. If playback buffer <b>204</b> has recorded a portion of the media asset, an option to restart playback of the media asset from the second time is generated. If playback buffer <b>204</b> has also paused playback of the media asset, an option to resume playback of the media asset at the current live point in the media asset is also generated.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, linked device communications controller <b>212</b> determines whether the secondary device <b>102</b> is still in the second state by monitoring transmissions from the user input device and determining if a transmission is addressed to the secondary device <b>102</b>. For example, control circuitry <b>200</b> may detect (e.g., using linked device communications controller <b>212</b>) data packets from the user input device and access a header of each packet to identify the destination of the packet. If any packet is addressed to the secondary device <b>102</b>, control circuitry <b>200</b> determines that the user is still interacting with the secondary device <b>102</b> and, therefore, that the secondary device <b>102</b> is still in the second state.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some embodiments, control circuitry <b>200</b> (e.g., using linked device communications controller <b>212</b>) establishes a connection with the secondary device <b>102</b> and with the user input device. For example, the media device <b>100</b> may act as an IoT controller device and create a network including the media device <b>100</b>, the secondary device <b>102</b>, and the user input device. Linked device communications controller <b>212</b> receives the signal <b>104</b> from the secondary device <b>102</b> and the user input <b>216</b> from the user input device via the established connections. Linked device communications controller <b>212</b> may, in some embodiments, create a direct connection between the secondary device <b>102</b> and the user input device by bridging the established connections.

For example, the secondary device <b>102</b> may be a smart doorbell, which may transmit audio and video captured from a microphone and camera of the smart doorbell to the media device. Control circuitry <b>200</b> (e.g., using linked device communications controller <b>212</b>) transmits <b>214</b> the audio and/or video data received from the secondary device <b>102</b> to media output <b>208</b> for output.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a flowchart representing a process for controlling playback or recording of a media asset in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure.

For example, when someone rings the doorbell, the smart doorbell <b>102</b> transmits a signal <b>104</b> to the media device <b>100</b> indicating that the state of the doorbell has changed from idle to active. The signal <b>104</b> may also include an identification of the doorbell <b>102</b>, and may optionally include audio and/or video data captured by a microphone and/or camera of the doorbell <b>102</b>. The signal <b>104</b> is received by control circuitry <b>200</b> (e.g., using linked device communications controller <b>212</b>).</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">At <b>304</b>, control circuitry <b>200</b> (e.g., using linked device communications controller <b>212</b>) generates for display a notification <b>106</b> of the received signal <b>104</b>. For example, the media device may generate an overlay for display over a currently playing media asset. The notification <b>106</b> may include an identification of the secondary device <b>102</b> and a status of the secondary device <b>102</b> corresponding to the current state of the secondary device <b>102</b>. For example, the notification may identify an oven and the current amount of time remaining on a timer set on the oven, or may identify a doorbell and indicate that someone has rung the bell.

For example, control circuitry <b>200</b> may retrieve the current system time from a remote time server, from the source of the media asset, or from a local real-time clock. Control circuitry <b>200</b> may convert the current time to an integer value, such as UTC time code, representing the number of seconds that have passed since Jan. 1, 1970.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">At <b>308</b>, control circuitry <b>200</b> determines whether user input to interact with the notification <b>106</b> has been received. For example, where the media device <b>100</b> is a tablet or mobile device, the user may interact with notification <b>106</b> using a touchscreen interface that is integrated into the media device <b>100</b> and communicates with control circuitry <b>200</b> via the linked device communications controller <b>212</b>. Linked device communications controller <b>212</b> may determine whether the portion of the touchscreen where the user input was detected corresponds to the portion of the touchscreen in which notification <b>106</b> is displayed. If the media device <b>100</b> is a set-top box, the user may interact with notification <b>106</b> using a remote control which communicates with control circuitry <b>200</b> of media device <b>100</b> via the linked device communications controller <b>212</b>. Linked device communications controller <b>212</b> may determine whether input received from the remote control corresponds to interaction with notification <b>106</b> by determining which key or keys were pressed on the remote control. In some embodiments, the user input device may be another IoT device or connected device, such as the user's mobile device, Amazon Echo, or Google Home, which communicates with control circuitry <b>200</b> of the media device <b>100</b> via linked device communications controller <b>212</b>. Linked device communications controller <b>212</b> may process text or voice input from the connected device to determine if the input is for interacting with notification <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">If user input to interact with the notification <b>106</b> has not been received, then, at <b>310</b>, control circuitry <b>200</b> compares the difference between the current time and the time represented by the variable set at <b>306</b> to determine if a timeout threshold has been met. If the timeout threshold has not been met, then control circuitry <b>200</b> returns to step <b>308</b> to determine if input to interact with the notification has been received.

Again, control circuitry <b>200</b> may retrieve the current system time from a remote time server, from the source of the media asset, or from a local real-time clock. Control circuitry <b>200</b> may convert the current time to an integer value, such as UTC time code, representing the number of seconds that have passed since Jan. 1, 1970.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">At <b>316</b>, control circuitry <b>200</b> determines whether the secondary device <b>102</b> is still in the second state at a second time that is a threshold amount of time after the time of receipt of the input <b>216</b>. For example, control circuitry <b>200</b> may receive user input <b>216</b> to interact with notification <b>106</b> at 7:05:00 and stores that time. The threshold amount of time may be, for example, ten seconds. Control circuitry <b>200</b> may instantiate a timer process to count the threshold amount of time beginning at the stored time.
