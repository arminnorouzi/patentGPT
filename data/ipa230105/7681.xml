For example, the network can schedule the physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) transmission of a single time slot through downlink control information (DCI) and can also schedule PDSCH transmission of multiple time slots through DCI. The network can configure a DCI to schedule multiple PDSCH transmission resources by configuring specific parameters. When the network does not configure such a parameter, one DCI only schedules PDSCH in one time slot, and when the parameter is configured and has a value greater than 1, one DCI schedules PDSCH in multiple time slots.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">With the multi-slot scheduling or multi-slot transmission, the same transmission block is retransmitted multiple times in multiple time slots. This, on the one hand, can improve transmission reliability and reduce the overhead of scheduling signaling, but on the other hand, in the multi-slot transmission, the PDSCH in different time slots transmit the same transmission block, the same time-frequency resources are used for transmission in each time slot, so the position and the quantity of downlink time slot symbols in each time slot have to meet the requirements for transmitting the PDSCH, otherwise the time slot cannot be used for transmitting the PDSCH. In practice, this method of transmitting PDSCH in multiple time slots imposes strong requirements and restrictions on the structure of the time slot, which no longer meets the application requirements.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In view of this, a data transmission method, a terminal device, and a network device capable of supporting a flexible resource scheduling method are provided in the embodiments of the application.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In an embodiment of the application, a data transmission method, applied to a terminal device, is provided and includes steps as follows.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The terminal device obtains first indication information.
