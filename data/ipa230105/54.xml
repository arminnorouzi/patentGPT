No. 8,776,731 B1, issued Jul. 15, 2014, describes an odor detection training system for use in training an animal to detect a desired odor. The system includes a plurality of decoy training housings and a desired odor housing containing a desired training odor. The housings are each visually identical. The housings are in different locations and are configured to be supported by a fence at different heights. The housings are removably attached to the fence. The desired odor housing is configured to receive an odor source within an odor storage area and a reward within a reward storage area and comprises an odor retention zone adjacent to and in fluidic communication with the odor storage area. Additionally, a reward release system associated with the desired odor housing is remotely operable by the trainer to dispense the reward directly into the odor retention zone. The odor storage area is a cavity within the desired odor housing that is adjacent to and physically separated from the odor retention zone by a sliding door. The use of the sliding door facilitates easy placement of the odor source within the odor storage area and serves to visually and physically shield the animal from the odor source. To fluidically connect the odor retention zone to the odor storage area, the door contains many openings. The reward release system comprises a structure associated with the desired odor housing that is remotely operable to cooperate with the reward storage area to dispense the reward therein to the odor retention zone. The release system is a combination of a battery, receiver, relay, and magnetic lock. The receiver can be remotely operated by a remote control transmitter. In operation, the transmitter is actuated by the trainer to activate the receiver, thereby actuating the relay to control the magnetic interlock which interacts with a metal strip on a trap door to release the trap door and drop the reward into the odor retention zone. If two or more of the desired odor housings are used, the transmitter is configured to allow the trainer to select the desired odor housing that he/she wants to activate at the appropriate time.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">International Patent Publication No. WO 2019/115983 A1, filed on Nov. 15, 2018, discloses an odor training apparatus for training animals to detect odors.

When the device is in operation, the target scent containers can contain different target scent substances, but it is also possible that at least two target scent containers contain the same target scent substance. Each sensor can be designed in any manner as desired, for example, as a photoelectric sensor, an IR photoelectric sensor, a thermal sensor, a proximity sensor, an optical, acoustic, inductive or capacitive proximity sensor, an ultrasonic proximity sensor or a Hall sensor.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The coupling device can be designed in any manner as desired, for example such that it can adopt exactly one coupling state or at least one additional coupling state.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Within the context of the present disclosure, the term &#x201c;fluidically coupled&#x201d; refers to coupling via a fluid line. In one form, the fluid line comprises at least one pipe and/or at least one hose and/or at least one channel formed in a component and/or at least one through-hole.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Each coupling state can be designed in any manner as desired, for example such that in this state, according to a first option, exactly one target scent container is open and is fluidically coupled to exactly one or at least two scent openings, and/or that in this state, according to a second option, at least two target scent containers are open and are jointly fluidically coupled to exactly one or at least two scent openings, and/or that in this state, according to a third option, at least two target scent containers are open and each of these target scent containers is fluidically coupled to exactly one or at least two scent openings. According to the first option, as an example in this application, a target scent container Z1 is fluidically coupled exclusively to one scent opening &#xd6;1 or two scent openings &#xd6;1 and &#xd6;2. According to the second option, as an example in this application, two target scent containers Z1 and Z2 are jointly fluidically coupled exclusively to one scent opening &#xd6;1 or two scent openings &#xd6;1 and &#xd6;2, so that that Z1 is coupled to &#xd6;1 and also Z2 is coupled to &#xd6;1 or Z1 is coupled to &#xd6;1 and &#xd6;2 and also Z2 is coupled to &#xd6;1 and &#xd6;2. According to the third option, as an example in this application, a target scent container Z1 is fluidically coupled exclusively to one scent opening &#xd6;1 or two scent openings &#xd6;1 and &#xd6;2, and a target scent container Z2 is fluidically coupled exclusively to one scent opening &#xd6;3 or two scent openings &#xd6;3 and &#xd6;4, so that Z1 is coupled to &#xd6;1 and Z2 is coupled to &#xd6;3, or Z1 is coupled to &#xd6;1 and Z2 is coupled to &#xd6;3 and &#xd6;4, or Z1 is coupled to &#xd6;1 and &#xd6;2 and Z2 is coupled to &#xd6;3 and &#xd6;4.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In one form of the present disclosure, it is specified that the coupling device is designed such that it can assume at least two coupling states; the program comprises that the control device selects on of the coupling states at a predetermined first point in time, starts a first time measurement and activates the coupling device such that the coupling device assumes the selected coupling state; stops the first time measurement and simultaneously starts a second time measurement as soon as the control device receives the notification signal from one of the sensors associated with the at least one coupled target scent container; stops the second time measurement as soon as the control device no longer receives the notification signal from this sensor or as soon as a predetermined first period of time during which the control device has continuously received the notification signal from this sensor has elapsed; if the duration of the second time measurement exceeds a predetermined threshold or if the first time period has elapsed, activates the reward device at a predetermined second point in time after the second time measurement is stopped in such a manner that the reward device issues a predetermined reward.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Otherwise, that is, if the duration of the second time measurement does not exceed the threshold value or if the first time measurement has not elapsed, no reward is issued. The duration of the first time measurement indicates how long it took the animal to recognize the respective coupled target scent container or the target scent contained therein. The duration of the second time measurement indicates how long the animal has put its nose into the respective coupled scent opening. Exceeding the threshold serves as an indication that the animal has recognized the respective target scent. The threshold value can be selected in any manner as desired, for example, such that it is about 0.5 s, about 0.6 s, about 0.7 s, about 0.8 s, about 0.9 s, about 1.0 s, about 1.1 s, about 1.2 s, about 1.3 s, about 1.4 s, about 1.5 s, about 1.6 s, about 1.7 s, about 1.8 s, about 1.9 s, or about 2.0 s.
