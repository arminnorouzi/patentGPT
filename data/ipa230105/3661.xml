<b>100</b> used to carry out an illuminating method according to the present invention. The illuminating system <b>100</b> includes a light source subsystem <b>110</b>, a two-dimensional spectral radiance meter <b>120</b> and a processor <b>130</b>. The light source subsystem <b>110</b> includes plural light sources <b>111</b> used with replaceable filters, light guides <b>113</b> and a projector <b>115</b>. Light for illumination with desired wavelengths is generated by the plural light sources <b>111</b> used with replaceable filters and transmitted via the light guides <b>113</b> to the projector <b>115</b>, which illuminates an object <b>200</b> with the light for illumination. In general, a light source that emits light having the following features should be employed. The light has an average color rendering index (Ra) of 40 or greater, a color temperature in the range from 3000 K to 10000 K and a continuous spectrum in the wavelength range from 380 nanometers and 780 nanometers. A light source having the above-described features is referred to as a first light source. The first light source can be, for example, a xenon lamp, a metal halide lamp, a mercury lamp, a halogen lamp, a white LED (light-emitting diode) and the like. Each of the plural light sources <b>111</b> used with replaceable filters is a combination of the first light source and one of the replaceable filters. By way of example, each of the plural filters is designed to transmit light at a specific wavelength value, and the specific values are in 10-nanometer intervals. Thus, by appropriately selecting filters of the plural light sources <b>111</b> used with replaceable filters, the light source subsystem <b>110</b> functions as a variable spectrum light source. The object <b>200</b> is an object to be observed and the background. The two-dimensional spectral radiance meter <b>120</b> measures the spectral radiance of the object <b>200</b> under the predetermined conditions described later. The measured spectral radiance data of the object <b>200</b> are sent to the processor <b>130</b>, and light for illumination that emphasizes the contrast between the object to be observed and the background and that increases the visibility for an observer is determined by the processor <b>130</b>. The light for illumination thus determined is realized by the plural light sources <b>111</b> used with replaceable filters. A light source for the light for illumination for increasing the visibility thus realized is referred to as a second light source. In general, the second light source may be a light source separate from the first light source other than a combination of the first light source and filters.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">A system for determining a spectral distribution of light for illumination according to the present invention is used to determine the second light source and includes the first light source, the spectral radiance meter <b>120</b> and the processor <b>130</b>. The illuminating system <b>100</b> is a combination of the system for determining a spectral distribution of light for illumination described above and the second light source described above.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In the description given below, a xenon lamp is used as the first light source.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a flowchart for describing the method for illumination according to the first aspect of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In step S<b>1010</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a color matching function for an observer or that for a color sensor of a camera of a machine vision system and the like is determined.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">First, how to determine a color matching function for an observer will be described. Although individual differences in perception of color among observers can be ignored for white light such as sunlight and light of white LEDs, individual differences in perception of color among observers cannot be ignored for light for illumination the color of which has been adjusted by metamerism. Accordingly, it is desirable that a color matching function is determined for an individual observer to increase the visibility unique to the individual observer. However, when the visibility unique to an individual observer can be ignored, and the visibility of an average observer should be increased by emphasizing the contrast between an object to be observed and the background, the present step can be omitted, and a standard color matching function can be employed.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Next, how to determine a color matching function for a color sensor of a camera will be described. Since a color matching function for a color sensor of a camera is not available, a color matching function for a color sensor of a camera must be prepared.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">A color matching function is determined by a color matching experiment. For the color matching experiment, a light source for generating light of a single wavelength and a light source for generating light of a combination of RGB lights of reference color stimuli are prepared. As the above-described two light sources, the two sets of light source subsystems <b>110</b> can be employed. Two adjacent areas of a white screen is separately illuminated with light of a single wavelength and light of a combination of RGB lights of reference color stimuli respectively by each of the two light sources described above, and the intensity of radiation of each of the RGB lights is adjusted using image data taken by the camera such that colors of the two areas described above are regarded as identical with each other. Thus, values of metamerism for each wavelength are determined, and the color matching function is defined.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In step S<b>1020</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, using the color matching function obtained in step S<b>1010</b> or a standard color matching function, an xy chromaticity diagram is obtained.
