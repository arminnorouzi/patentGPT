id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an electrochemical cell, which comprises a housing, an electrochemical element arranged in an interior of the housing, and at least one cell terminal that comprises a terminal feed-through, which extends through a through-opening of the housing.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The electrochemical cell may be, in particular, an accumulator cell or a battery cell.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Lithium-ion battery cells are a key technology for propulsion concepts in electromobility.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to protect the electrochemical element, which contains the electrochemically active unit of the cell, for example a lithium-ion battery cell, from harmful environmental influences, the electrochemical unit is enclosed in a gas-tight manner with a cell housing.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the case of overcharging of the electrochemical cell, large amounts of gases can be released in the interior of the housing. The gases cannot escape through the closed cell housing, which leads to a drastic pressure increase in the housing of the electrochemical cell.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Furthermore, an overcharging of the electrochemical cell causes a self-reinforcing warming of the electrochemical cell, which can lead to an explosive ignition (thermal runaway).</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In order to reduce the safety risks associated with an overcharging of the electrochemical cell, an overcharge protection (overcharge safety device, OSD) is installed in the housing of such an electrochemical cell.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In particular in the case of electrochemical cells with a prismatic housing, a snap-over element (also synonymously referred to as a spring element) is often used as an overcharge safety device.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The snap-over element may, in particular, be welded into a housing cover of the housing of the electrochemical cell.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The snap-over element is deflected outwardly at a predetermined internal cell pressure and thereby establishes an electrically conductive connection between the housing cover and the cell terminal with a polarity opposite to the polarity of the housing cover, for example with the negative cell terminal.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The increased internal cell pressure arises due to electrochemical processes and due to the development of heat upon overcharging of the electrochemical cell. Because the housing lid is at the opposite electrical potential, for example at the potential of the positive cell terminal, the electrochemical cell is short circuited by the contact of the snap-over element with the cell terminal. The short circuit can, for example, trigger a fuse.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">After the fuse is triggered, there is no longer an electrical connection between the cell terminal, in the connecting conductor of which the fuse is arranged, and the electrochemical element in the interior of the housing of the electrochemical cell, such that the electrochemical cell cannot be charged further. This prevents further overcharging of the cell.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Because the snap-over element contacts the cell terminal associated with same only at a small point of contact and the snap-over element is typically made from a thin metal sheet in order to enable the snapping-over of the snap-over element, the current-carrying cross section of the contact between the triggered snap-over element and the associated cell terminal is small. This can result in a significant development of heat, which can lead to damage to the snap-over element. This can result in the fuse no longer being able to be triggered, such that the short circuit current path is interrupted and the electrochemical cell continues to be overcharged despite activation of the snap-over element and is brought into a critical state.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In order to prevent the snap-over element from being destroyed when the short circuit is triggered, it is known to arrange an additional current-limiting resistor between the further cell terminal, which is not associated with the snap-over element, for example the positive terminal, and the housing of the electrochemical cell. The terminal feed-through of the further cell terminal is not welded directly to the housing of the electrochemical device, but rather is guided through a through-opening in the housing of the electrochemical device in an electrically insulated manner. The current-limiting resistor is arranged on the outside of the housing of the electrochemical device between the further cell terminal on the one hand and the housing, for example a cover of the housing, of the electrochemical device on the other hand. When the snap-over element is triggered, the current thereby flows via the further cell terminal through the current-limiting resistor to the housing of the electrochemical device, thereby limiting the short circuit current when the spring element is triggered. This increases the operational safety of the cell, because as a result the current flowing to the housing in the normal operating state is limited and the risk of an electrical shock, for example when the housing of the electrochemical device is unintentionally contacted, is reduced.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">However, this known structure requires a multitude of components, in particular a resistance plate, the further cell terminal, seals, and insulation on the terminal feed-through.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">This multitude of components requires a corresponding number of process steps in the production of the assembly of terminal, current-limiting resistor, and housing of the electrochemical device. This leads to high production cycle times and production costs.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, an electrochemical cell of the kind stated at the outset is created, which is of simple construction and requires a low production expenditure but still reliably limits the short circuit current that occurs in the case of a non-regular operating state.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, provision is made in an electrochemical cell with the features of the preamble of claim <b>1</b> that the electrochemical cell comprises an electrically conductive sealing element, which seals the through-opening of the housing and electrically conductively connects the cell terminal to the housing.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In a preferred embodiment of the electrochemical cell in accordance with the invention, provision is made that the sealing element comprises a plastic material.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">For example, provision may be made that the sealing element comprises a thermoplastic material and/or a thermoset material.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, provision is made that the sealing element comprises a polypropylene material, a polybutylene terephthalate material, and/or an epoxy resin material.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The electrically conductive sealing element forms an ohmic resistance between the cell terminal and the housing, which is preferably at least 1&#xb7;10<sup>1</sup>&#x3a9; and/or preferably at most 1&#xb7;10<sup>7</sup>&#x3a9;.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The material of the electrically conductive sealing element has a specific electrical conductivity that is preferably at least 10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>S/m, particularly preferably more than 10<sup>&#x2212;2 </sup>S/m, and/or preferably at most 10<sup>3 </sup>S/m, particularly preferably less than 10<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>S/m.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">For producing the electrical conductivity of the sealing element, provision may be made that the sealing element comprises an electrically conductive additive.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Such an electrically conductive additive may comprise, e.g., metallic particles, an electrically conductive carbon modification (for example graphite, conductive soot, graphene, carbon nanotubes, carbon fibers, and/or carbon nano-onions), and/or an electrically conductive ceramic material (for example a nitride or a carbide).</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Alternatively or in addition to using a conductive additive as part of the sealing element, provision may be made that the sealing element comprises a plastic material made electrically conductive by doping.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">For example, provision may be made that the sealing element comprises a doped polyacetylene material, a doped polypyrrole material, a doped polyaniline material, a doped poly(p-phenylene) material, a doped polythiophene material, a doped poly-3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene, and/or a doped polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The sealing element is producible in a particularly simple manner if it is configured as an injection molded part or as a casting compound part.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The cell terminal on which the sealing element is arranged may be, in particular, a positive cell terminal (cathode) of the electrochemical cell.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, provision is made that the electrochemical cell comprises, in addition to the cell terminal on which the sealing element is arranged, a further cell terminal and a snap-over element, which brings the housing of the electrochemical cell into electrically conductive contact with the further cell terminal when a pressure in the interior of the housing of the electrochemical cell exceeds a threshold pressure value.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The housing of the electrochemical cell preferably comprises aluminum and/or a stainless steel material.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In particular, provision may be made that the housing of the electrochemical cell comprises aluminum as its main component or comprises a stainless steel material as its main component.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">A particularly simple structure for the cell terminal is achieved if the cell terminal comprises a bent sheet metal part.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Such a sheet metal part can be separated out, for example punched out or cut out&#x2014;e.g. by means of a laser&#x2014;from a metal sheet of a suitable starting material and then bent into the desired form.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The bent sheet metal part may have, for example, a substantially S-shaped or a substantially Z-shaped longitudinal section.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The starting material from which the sheet metal part is separated out may have a material transition, in particular between a first region that is made, e.g., primarily of aluminum, and a second region that is made, e.g., primarily of copper.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">These two regions of the starting material for the sheet metal part may be connected to one another, e.g., by overlap roll cladding.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">By using a bent sheet metal part as a constituent part of the cell terminal, the number of components required for the cell terminal and the expenditure for the production of the cell terminal can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Furthermore, provision may be made that the cell terminal comprises an elastically deformable region.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Forces acting on the sealing element or on the cell terminal, which are generated, e.g., by a movement of the electrochemical element of the electrochemical cell upon an impact load, can be absorbed by such an elastically deformable region without the sealing function of the sealing element being impaired.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Provision is preferably made that the elasticity of the elastically deformable region is based on a dimensional elasticity that is caused by the elastically deformable region comprising at least one bend, in particular at least two bends, particularly preferably at least three bends, for example at least four bends.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">It is particularly favorable if the bends of the elastically deformable region produce a wave shape of the elastically deformable region.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The present invention further relates to a method for producing an electrochemical cell, wherein the electrochemical cell comprises a housing, an

element of the electrochemical cell may be configured, in particular, as a cell coil impregnated in electrolyte.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0053">The electrochemical cell is preferably configured as a lithium-ion accumulator cell.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0054">In particular, provision may be made that the cell chemistry of the electrochemical cell is based on Li<sub>4</sub>Ti<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0055">The electrochemical cell in accordance with the invention is suited, in particular, for use in a module that comprises a plurality of electrochemical cells.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0056">Such a module may be used, for example, as an energy source for an electric vehicle, in particular an electric car.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0057">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, provision is made that a starting material from which the sealing element is made is injected or cast directly around the cell terminal and a region of the housing of the electrochemical cell.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0058">If the material of the sealing element is made by adding an electrically conductive additive to a plastic material, the electrical conductivity (and thus the degree of current limitation by the sealing element) can thereby be set in a targeted manner by the proportion of the electrically conductive additive in the material of the sealing element.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0059">If the sealing element is made of a plastic material made electrically conductive by doping, the electrical conductivity of the sealing element can thereby be set by the doping level of the plastic material.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0060">Upon triggering a snap-over element, the current flows from the terminal on which the sealing element is arranged, through the electrically conductive sealing element, to the housing of the electrochemical device. As a result of the lower electrical conductivity of the material of the sealing element in comparison to metals, this current is effectively limited. Damage to the snap-over element due to too high a short circuit current is hereby prevented. In addition, the operational safety of the electrochemical cell is increased, since the current is limited in the case of an unintentional contact of the housing of the electrochemical device and thus the risk of an electrical shock is reduced.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0061">If the sealing element is made of a thermoplastic material, the sealing element is preferably produced by injection molding.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0062">If the sealing element is made of a thermoset material, the sealing element is preferably produced by a casting process.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0063">In both cases, the number of components required for the structure of the electrochemical cell is reduced and the cycle times in the production of the electrochemical cell are reduced, which results in a reduction of costs.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0064">The electrically conductive sealing material performs two functions simultaneously, namely, for one, the sealing of the terminal feed-through of the cell terminal and, for another, the limitation of the electrical short circuit current that flows from the cell terminal to the housing of the electrochemical cell, for example when the snap-over element is triggered.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0065">Further features and advantages of the invention are subject matter of the subsequent description and the graphical representation of exemplary

denoted as a whole with <b>100</b>, comprises a housing <b>102</b>, which may be of one- or two-part configuration, an electrochemical element <b>104</b> arranged in the housing <b>102</b>, which is electrically conductively connected to a terminal feed-through <b>108</b> of a first cell terminal <b>110</b> by way of a first connecting conductor <b>106</b> and is electrically conductively connected to a terminal feed-through <b>114</b> of a second cell terminal <b>116</b> by way of a second connecting conductor <b>112</b>, and an electrical insulating element <b>118</b>, by means of which the terminal feed-through <b>114</b> of the second cell terminal <b>116</b> is electrically insulated from the housing <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0076">Furthermore, the electrochemical cell <b>100</b> comprises an electrically conductive sealing element <b>120</b>, which seals a through-opening <b>122</b> of the housing <b>102</b> of the electrochemical cell <b>100</b>, through which through-opening <b>122</b> the terminal feed-through <b>114</b> of the first cell terminal <b>110</b> extends from the outside space of the housing <b>102</b> into its interior <b>124</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0077">Furthermore, the sealing element <b>120</b> electrically conductively connects the first cell terminal <b>110</b> to the housing <b>102</b> of the electrochemical cell <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0078">The sealing element <b>120</b> comprises, for example, a plastic material and an electrically conductive additive.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0079">The plastic material may be, in particular, a thermoplastic material, for example a polypropylene material or a polybutylene terephthalate material.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0080">When using a thermoplastic material, the sealing element is preferably produced in situ on the through-opening <b>122</b> of the housing <b>102</b> by an injection molding operation.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0081">Alternatively hereto, provision may be made that the sealing element <b>120</b> comprises a thermosetting material, for example an epoxy resin material.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0082">In this case, the sealing element <b>120</b> is preferably produced in situ on the through-opening <b>122</b> of the housing <b>102</b> of the electrochemical cell <b>100</b> by a casting operation.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0083">The electrically conductive additive <b>126</b> contained in the sealing element <b>120</b> may comprise, for example, metallic particles, in particular aluminum particles, and/or a carbonaceous material, for example graphite and/or soot.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0084">The electrical conductivity of the sealing element <b>120</b> can be set in a targeted manner by the proportion of the conductive additive <b>126</b> in the material of the sealing element <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0085">If the proportion of the conductive additive <b>126</b> that is embedded in the plastic matrix <b>128</b> of the sealing element <b>120</b> in the material of the sealing element <b>120</b> is too low, as schematically depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, then no continuous electrically conductive percolation paths arise in the sealing element <b>120</b>, such that the sealing element <b>120</b> has no electrical conductivity.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0086">If the proportion of the conductive additive <b>126</b> in the material of the sealing element <b>120</b> is too high, as schematically depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, then the sealing element <b>120</b> has too low an electrical resistance to bring about a current limitation of the short circuit path between the first cell terminal <b>110</b> and the second cell terminal <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0087">The proportion of the conductive additive <b>126</b> in the material of the sealing element <b>120</b> is therefore, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, selected such that the sealing element <b>120</b> forms a desired ohmic contact resistance between the first cell terminal <b>110</b> and the housing <b>102</b> of the electrochemical cell <b>100</b> in the range of preferably about 1&#xb7;10<sup>1</sup>&#x3a9; to about 1&#xb7;10<sup>7</sup>&#x3a9;.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0088">The specific electrical conductivity of the material of the sealing element <b>120</b> is preferably at least 10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>S/m and preferably at most 10<sup>3 </sup>S/m.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0089">Alternatively to the use of a plastic material that itself is not conductive and an electrically conductive additive, the desired electrical conductivity of the sealing element <b>120</b> can also be produced by using a plastic material that itself is electrically conductive, in particular a plastic material made electrically conductive by doping.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0090">In particular, the sealing element <b>120</b> may be made, for example, from a doped polyacetylene material, from a doped polypyrrole material, from a doped polyaniline material, from a doped poly(p-phenylene) material, or from a doped polythiophene material.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0091">When using a plastic material made electrically conductive by doping, the conductivity of the sealing element <b>120</b> can be set by the doping level of the plastic material used.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0092">Furthermore, the electrochemical cell <b>100</b> comprises a snap-over element <b>130</b>, which is arranged opposite the second cell terminal <b>116</b> on the housing <b>102</b> of the electrochemical cell <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0093">In the normal operating state of the electrochemical cell <b>100</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the snap-over element <b>130</b> is in a rest state in which the snap-over element <b>130</b> projects into the interior <b>124</b> of the housing <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0094">When the pressure in the interior <b>124</b> of the housing <b>102</b> exceeds a threshold pressure value, the snap-over element <b>130</b> then transitions from this rest state into the working state depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> in which the snap-over element <b>130</b> projects into the outside space <b>132</b> of the housing <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0095">An increase in the pressure in the interior <b>124</b> of the housing <b>102</b> beyond the threshold pressure value is, in particular, caused by electrochemical processes and by the development of heat when the electrochemical cell <b>100</b> is overcharged.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0096">In the working state of the snap-over element <b>130</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, which corresponds to a short circuit state of the electrochemical cell <b>100</b>, the first cell terminal <b>110</b> and the second cell terminal <b>116</b> of the electrochemical cell <b>100</b> are electrically conductively connected to one another by way of the sealing element <b>120</b>, the housing cover <b>102</b>, and the snap-over element <b>130</b>, such that the electrochemical cell <b>100</b> is short circuited.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0097">Due to the short circuit between the first cell terminal <b>110</b> and the second cell terminal <b>116</b>, the electrochemical cell <b>100</b> is discharged in a controlled manner.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0098">The short circuit reduces the potential difference between the first cell terminal <b>110</b> and the second cell terminal <b>116</b>, which is detectable by means of a battery management system (BMS)&#x2014;which is not depicted&#x2014;to which the electrochemical cell <b>100</b> is connected.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0099">The BMS can cancel a charging operation on the electrochemical cell <b>100</b> or on all electrochemical cells <b>100</b> of a cell module of an electrochemical device upon detection of a short circuit of the electrochemical cell <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0100">Alternatively or in addition hereto, a warning message can be generated by the BMS, for example by means of suitable software, upon detection of a short circuit on the electrochemical cell <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0101">Then, for example, a charging operation on the electrochemical cell <b>100</b> can be manually canceled on the basis of such a warning message.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0102">Because the sealing element <b>120</b> has a sufficiently high current limiting resistance in the short circuit path of the electrochemical cell <b>100</b>, the short circuit current is limited by the housing <b>102</b> and the snap-over element <b>130</b>, such that damage to the snap-over element <b>130</b>, which would interrupt the short circuit current path, is excluded.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0103">This prevents the electrochemical cell <b>100</b> from being further overcharged and brought into a critical state.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0104">In a variant (not depicted) of the electrochemical cell <b>100</b>, a current flow interrupting device is provided, which, for example, comprises a fuse and interrupts the charging current that is applied to the electrochemical cell <b>100</b>, such that an overcharging of the electrochemical cell <b>100</b> is prevented in this case, too.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0105">Furthermore, the safety of the electrochemical cell <b>100</b> is increased by the current-limiting resistance of the sealing element <b>120</b>, since the current flowing is limited in the case of unintentional contact of the housing <b>102</b> of the electrochemical cell <b>100</b> and thus the risk of an electrical shock is reduced.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0106">The first cell terminal <b>110</b> on which the sealing element <b>120</b> is arranged may be a negative cell terminal or a positive cell terminal of the electrochemical cell <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0107">The second cell terminal <b>116</b>, adjacent to which the snap-over element <b>130</b> is arranged, has the respective opposite polarity to the first cell terminal <b>110</b>, and is thus configured as a positive cell terminal or as a negative cell terminal.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0108">If the first cell terminal <b>110</b> is a positive cell terminal and the second cell terminal <b>116</b> is a negative cell terminal, the housing <b>102</b> is preferably made primarily of aluminum.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0109">If the first cell terminal <b>110</b> is a negative cell terminal and the second cell terminal <b>116</b> is a positive cell terminal, the housing <b>102</b> is preferably made of a stainless steel material.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0110">A second embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> of an electrochemical cell <b>100</b> differs from the first embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>5</b></figref> in that the through-opening <b>122</b> of the housing <b>102</b> through which the terminal feed-through <b>114</b> of the first cell terminal <b>110</b> on which the sealing element <b>120</b> is arranged extends is bounded by a collar <b>134</b>.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0111">The collar <b>134</b> may be formed on the housing <b>102</b>, for example, by a deep drawing operation.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0112">The collar <b>134</b> on the through-opening <b>122</b> of the housing <b>102</b> may, in principle, project into the outside space <b>132</b> of the housing <b>102</b> or into the interior <b>124</b> of the housing <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0113">The collar <b>134</b> preferably projects into the interior <b>124</b> of the housing <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0114">The size of the sealing face between the sealing element <b>120</b> and the housing <b>102</b> of the electrochemical cell <b>100</b> is increased by the collar <b>134</b>, which improves the tightness of the seal created by the sealing element <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0115">In addition, the composite adhesion between the sealing element <b>120</b> and the housing <b>102</b> is improved by the presence of the collar <b>134</b>, in particular by the plastic material of the sealing element <b>120</b> shrinking onto the collar <b>134</b>.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0116">In all other respects, the second embodiment of an electrochemical cell <b>100</b>
