In one embodiment, the immune effector cells are genetically modified to express the antigen receptor. Such genetic modification may be effected ex vivo or in vitro and subsequently the immune effector cells may be administered to a subject in need of treatment, or may be effected in vivo in a subject in need of treatment. These methods are, in particular, useful for the treatment of solid cancers characterized by diseased cells expressing an antigen the antigen receptor is directed to. It is demonstrated herein that such antigen receptor-engineered immune effector cells, even when provided to a subject in sub-therapeutic amounts, are extremely effective in the treatment of cancer diseases, even those cancer diseases that are known to be difficult to treat with antigen receptor-engineered immune effector cells, such as solid tumors or cancers, if additionally target antigen for the antigen receptor is provided to the subject. In one embodiment, the immune effector cells by means of an antigen receptor such as T cell receptor (TCR) or chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) bind to the antigen or a procession product thereof when present on or presented in the context of MHC by cells of secondary lymphoid organs such as antigen presenting cells, in particular dendritic cells. The antigen receptor-engineered immune effector cells may be provided to a subject by administering the antigen receptor-engineered immune effector cells or by generating the antigen receptor-engineered immune effector cells in the subject. In one embodiment, the antigen receptor-engineered immune effector cells are generated in the subject treated. Such in vivo generation generally will only provide small amounts of antigen receptor-engineered immune effector cells in the subject. However, it is expected that these small amounts of antigen receptor-engineered immune effector cells will be therapeutically effective due to the strong stimulatory effect achieved by provision of target antigen for the antigen receptor. The target antigen for the antigen receptor may be provided to a subject by administering to the subject an antigen targeted by the antigen receptor, a polynucleotide encoding the antigen, or cells expressing the antigen. The antigen to which the antigen receptor is targeted may comprise a naturally occurring antigen or a variant thereof, or a fragment of the naturally occurring antigen or variant thereof. In one particularly preferred embodiment, the polynucleotide encoding the antigen is RNA. The methods and agents described herein are, in particular, useful for the treatment of diseases characterized by diseased cells expressing an antigen the antigen receptor or antigen receptor-engineered immune effector cells are directed to.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The immune system plays an important role in cancer, autoimmunity, allergy as well as in pathogen-associated diseases. T cells and NK cells are important mediators of anti-tumor immune responses. CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and NK cells can directly lyse tumor cells. CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, on the other hand, can mediate the influx of different immune subsets including CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and NK cells into the tumor. CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are able to license dendritic cells (DCs) for the priming of anti-tumor CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses and can act directly on tumor cells via IFN&#x3b3; mediated MHC upregulation and growth inhibition. CD8<sup>+</sup> as well as CD4<sup>+</sup> tumor specific T-cell responses can be induced via vaccination or by adoptive transfer of T cells.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Adoptive cell transfer (ACT) based immunotherapy can be broadly defined as a form of passive immunization with previously sensitized T cells that are transferred to non-immune recipients or to the autologous host after ex vivo expansion from low precursor frequencies to clinically relevant cell numbers. Cell types that have been used for ACT experiments are lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells (Mule, J. J. et al. (1984) Science 225, 1487-1489; Rosenberg, S. A. et al. (1985) N. Engl. J. Med. 313, 1485-1492), tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) (Rosenberg, S. A. et al. (1994) J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 86, 1159-1166), donor lymphocytes after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) as well as tumor-specific T cell lines or clones (Dudley, M. E. et al. (2001) J. Immunother. 24, 363-373; Yee, C. et al. (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 99, 16168-16173). An alternative approach is the adoptive transfer of autologous T cells reprogrammed to express a tumor-reactive immunoreceptor of defined specificity during short-time ex vivo culture followed by reinfusion into the patient (Kershaw M. H. et al. (2013) Nature Reviews Cancer 13 (8):525-41). This strategy makes ACT applicable to a variety of common malignancies even if tumor-reactive T cells are absent in the patient. For example, adoptive transfer of chimeric antigen receptor modified T cells (CART cells) is investigated in an extensive number of clinical trials worldwide. Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are a type of antigen-targeted receptor composed of intracellular T cell signaling domains fused to extracellular antigen-binding moieties, most commonly single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) from monoclonal antibodies. CARs directly recognize cell surface antigens, independent of MHC-mediated presentation, permitting the use of a single receptor construct specific for any given antigen in all patients. In general, CARs fuse antigen-recognition domains to the CD3&#x3b6; activation chain of the T cell receptor (TCR) complex and comprise secondary costimulatory signals in tandem with CD3, including intracellular domains from CD28 or a variety of TNF receptor family molecules such as 4-1BB (CD137) and OX40 (CD134). CARs dramatically improved antitumor efficacy, showing remarkable clinical efficacy especially in patients suffering from hematological malignancies (Hartmann, J. et al. EMBO Mol. Med. 9, 1183-1197 (2017)). Recently, two CAR T-cell therapies have received approval for the treatment of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (Kymriah&#xae;) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (Yescarta&#xae;) by the FDA and EMA (Zheng, P. et al. <i>Drug. Discov. Today </i>6, 1175-1182 (2018)). For solid tumors adoptive transfer of T cells, however, has shown limited efficacy so far and requires improvement (Newick, K. et al. <i>Annu. Rev. Med. </i>68, 139-152 (2017)).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Key challenges for the application of antigen receptor-engineered immune cells in solid cancers are, in particular, the non-persistence of transferred cells. Furthermore, the generation of large amounts of cells for adoptive cell transfer still remains a challenge and the number of cells which can be administered to a patient for adoptive cell transfer is generally limited. In addition, approaches for the transfer of large amounts of engineered T cells into a host pose the risk of severe adverse events. Therefore, it would be desirable to provide a limited amount of engineered immune effector cells such as T cells to a patient that can be expanded in the patient after they have proven to be safe.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Here we introduce a novel concept to overcome inefficient CAR T cell stimulation in vivo which is generally the case in solid cancer patients. We demonstrate that a nanoparticulate RNA vaccine designed for body-wide delivery of the CAR antigen into lymphoid compartments stimulates adoptively transferred CAR T cells. Presentation of the natively folded target on resident dendritic cells promotes robust cognate and selective expansion of CAR T cells. Consequently, improved engraftment of CAR T cells and regression of large tumors in difficult-to-treat mouse models is accomplished at sub-therapeutic CAR T cell doses. The vaccine approach described herein is expected to be particularly suitable in connection with therapies involving in vivo generation of antigen receptor-engineered immune effector cells which is expected to produce only small amounts of cells.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The methods provided herein allow to only provide small amounts of antigen receptor-engineered immune effector cells such as T cells to a patient, e.g., by in vivo generation of antigen receptor-engineered immune effector cells, and then expand the cells in vivo to result in therapeutic amounts. It is demonstrated herein that the approach described herein is even effective in the treatment of solid tumors or cancers.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention generally embraces the treatment of diseases by targeting cells such as diseased cells expressing an antigen such as a tumor antigen. The cells may express the antigen on the cell surface for recognition by a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) or in the context of MHC for recognition by a T cell receptor (TCR). The methods provide for the selective eradication of such cells expressing an antigen, thereby minimizing adverse effects to normal cells not expressing the antigen. Immune effector cells genetically modified to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) or a T cell receptor (TCR) targeting the cells through binding to the antigen (or a procession product thereof) are provided to a subject such as by administration of genetically modified immune effector cells to the subject or generation of genetically modified immune effector cells in the subject. A vaccine antigen (which may be the disease-associated antigen or a variant thereof (e.g. a peptide or protein comprising an epitope of the disease-associated antigen), nucleic acid coding therefor, or cells expressing the antigen are administered to provide (optionally following expression of the nucleic acid by appropriate target cells) antigen for immune effector cell stimulation, priming and/or expansion. Immune effector cells stimulated, primed and/or expanded in the patient are able to recognize and eradicate diseased cells expressing an antigen. In one embodiment, the immune effector cells are T cells. In one embodiment, the immune effector cells are directed against a tumor or cancer. In one embodiment, the target cell population or target tissue is tumor cells or tumor tissue, in particular of a solid tumor. In one embodiment, the target antigen is a tumor antigen.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The methods and agents described herein are, in particular, useful for the treatment of diseases characterized by diseased cells expressing an antigen the immune effector cells are directed to. In one embodiment, the immune effector cells by means of a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) have a binding specificity for vaccine antigen and disease-associated antigen when present on antigen presenting cells and diseased cells, respectively. In one embodiment, the immune effector cells by means of a T cell receptor (TCR) having a binding specificity for a procession product of vaccine antigen and disease-associated antigen when presented on antigen presenting cells and diseased cells, respectively. CARs are molecules that combine specificity for a desired antigen (e.g., tumor antigen) which preferably is antibody-based with a T cell receptor-activating intracellular domain to generate a chimeric protein that exhibits a specific cellular immune activity (e.g., a specific anti-tumor cellular immune activity). Preferably, a cell can be genetically modified to stably express an antigen receptor on its surface, conferring novel antigen specificity that may be MHC independent. In one embodiment, immune effector cells either from a subject to be treated or from a different subject are administered to the subject to be treated. The administered immune effector cells may be genetically modified ex vivo prior to administration or genetically modified in vivo in the subject following administration to express an antigen receptor described herein. In one embodiment, the immune effector cells are endogenous in a subject to be treated (thus, are not administered to the subject to be treated) and are genetically modified in vivo in the subject to express an antigen receptor described herein. Accordingly, immune effector cells may be genetically modified, ex vivo or in vivo, to express an antigen receptor. Thus, such genetic modification with antigen receptor may be effected in vitro and subsequently the immune effector cells administered to a subject in need of treatment or may be effected in vivo in a subject in need of treatment. Thus, in one aspect, the present invention generally embraces the treatment of diseases by targeting cells expressing an antigen such as diseased cells, in particular cancer cells expressing a tumor antigen. The target cells may express the antigen on the cell surface or may present a procession product of the antigen. In one embodiment, the antigen is a tumor-associated antigen and the disease is cancer. Such treatment provides for the selective eradication of cells that express an antigen, thereby minimizing adverse effects to normal cells not expressing the antigen. In one embodiment, vaccine antigen, polynucleotide coding therefor or cells expressing vaccine antigen are administered to provide (optionally following expression of the polynucleotide by appropriate target cells) antigen for stimulation, priming and/or expansion of immune effector cells genetically modified to express an antigen receptor, wherein the immune effector cells are targeted to the antigen or a procession product thereof and the immune response is an immune response to a target cell population or target tissue expressing the antigen.

The term &#x201c;protein&#x201d; or &#x201c;polypeptide&#x201d; refers to large peptides, in particular peptides having at least about 151 amino acids, but the terms &#x201c;peptide&#x201d;, &#x201c;protein&#x201d; and &#x201c;polypeptide&#x201d; are used herein usually as synonyms.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">A &#x201c;therapeutic protein&#x201d; has a positive or advantageous effect on a condition or disease state of a subject when provided to the subject in a therapeutically effective amount. In one embodiment, a therapeutic protein has curative or palliative properties and may be administered to ameliorate, relieve, alleviate, reverse, delay onset of or lessen the severity of one or more symptoms of a disease or disorder. A therapeutic protein may have prophylactic properties and may be used to delay the onset of a disease or to lessen the severity of such disease or pathological condition. The term &#x201c;therapeutic protein&#x201d; includes entire proteins or peptides, and can also refer to therapeutically active fragments thereof. It can also include therapeutically active variants of a protein. Examples of therapeutically active proteins include, but are not limited to, antigens for vaccination and cytokines.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">&#x201c;Fragment&#x201d;, with reference to an amino acid sequence (peptide or protein), relates to a part of an amino acid sequence, i.e. a sequence which represents the amino acid sequence shortened at the N-terminus and/or C-terminus. A fragment shortened at the C-terminus (N-terminal fragment) is obtainable e.g. by translation of a truncated open reading frame that lacks the 3&#x2032;-end of the open reading frame. A fragment shortened at the N-terminus (C-terminal fragment) is obtainable e.g. by translation of a truncated open reading frame that lacks the 5&#x2032;-end of the open reading frame, as long as the truncated open reading frame comprises a start codon that serves to initiate translation. A fragment of an amino acid sequence comprises e.g. at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90% of the amino acid residues from an amino acid sequence. A fragment of an amino acid sequence preferably comprises at least 6, in particular at least 8, at least 12, at least 15, at least 20, at least 30, at least 50, or at least 100 consecutive amino acids from an amino acid sequence.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">By &#x201c;variant&#x201d; or &#x201c;variant protein&#x201d; or &#x201c;variant polypeptide&#x201d; herein is meant a protein that differs from a wild type protein by virtue of at least one amino acid modification. The parent polypeptide may be a naturally occurring or wild type (WT) polypeptide, or may be a modified version of a wild type polypeptide. Preferably, the variant polypeptide has at least one amino acid modification compared to the parent polypeptide, e.g. from 1 to about 20 amino acid modifications, and preferably from 1 to about 10 or from 1 to about 5 amino acid modifications compared to the parent.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">By &#x201c;parent polypeptide&#x201d;, &#x201c;parent protein&#x201d;, &#x201c;precursor polypeptide&#x201d;, or &#x201c;precursor protein&#x201d; as used herein is meant an unmodified polypeptide that is subsequently modified to generate a variant.

A wild type protein or polypeptide has an amino acid sequence that has not been intentionally modified.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">For the purposes of the present disclosure, &#x201c;variants&#x201d; of an amino acid sequence (peptide, protein or polypeptide) comprise amino acid insertion variants, amino acid addition variants, amino acid deletion variants and/or amino acid substitution variants. The term &#x201c;variant&#x201d; includes all splice variants, posttranslationally modified variants, conformations, isoforms and species homologs, in particular those which are naturally expressed by cells. The term &#x201c;variant&#x201d; includes, in particular, fragments of an amino acid sequence.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Amino acid insertion variants comprise insertions of single or two or more amino acids in a particular amino acid sequence. In the case of amino acid sequence variants having an insertion, one or more amino acid residues are inserted into a particular site in an amino acid sequence, although random insertion with appropriate screening of the resulting product is also possible. Amino acid addition variants comprise amino- and/or carboxy-terminal fusions of one or more amino acids, such as 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 20, 30, 50, or more amino acids. Amino acid deletion variants are characterized by the removal of one or more amino acids from the sequence, such as by removal of 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 20, 30, 50, or more amino acids. The deletions may be in any position of the protein. Amino acid deletion variants that comprise the deletion at the N-terminal and/or C-terminal end of the protein are also called N-terminal and/or C-terminal truncation variants. Amino acid substitution variants are characterized by at least one residue in the sequence being removed and another residue being inserted in its place. Preference is given to the modifications being in positions in the amino acid sequence which are not conserved between homologous proteins or peptides and/or to replacing amino acids with other ones having similar properties. Preferably, amino acid changes in peptide and protein variants are conservative amino acid changes, i.e., substitutions of similarly charged or uncharged amino acids. A conservative amino acid change involves substitution of one of a family of amino acids which are related in their side chains. Naturally occurring amino acids are generally divided into four families: acidic (aspartate, glutamate), basic (lysine, arginine, histidine), non-polar (alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine, tryptophan), and uncharged polar (glycine, asparagine, glutamine, cysteine, serine, threonine, tyrosine) amino acids. Phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine are sometimes classified jointly as aromatic amino acids. In one embodiment, conservative amino acid substitutions include substitutions within the following groups:</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">glycine, alanine;</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">valine, isoleucine, leucine;</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">aspartic acid, glutamic acid;</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">asparagine, glutamine;</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">serine, threonine;</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">lysine, arginine; and</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">phenylalanine, tyrosine.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Preferably the degree of similarity, preferably identity between a given amino acid sequence and an amino acid sequence which is a variant of said given amino acid sequence will be at least about 60%, 65%, 70%, 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99%. The degree of similarity or identity is given preferably for an amino acid region which is at least about 10%, at least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90% or about 100% of the entire length of the reference amino acid sequence. For example, if the reference amino acid sequence consists of 200 amino acids, the degree of similarity or identity is given preferably for at least about 20, at least about 40, at least about 60, at least about 80, at least about 100, at least about 120, at least about 140, at least about 160, at least about 180, or about 200 amino acids, preferably continuous amino acids. In preferred embodiments, the degree of similarity or identity is given for the entire length of the reference amino acid sequence. The alignment for determining sequence similarity, preferably sequence identity can be done with art known tools, preferably using the best sequence alignment, for example, using Align, using standard settings, preferably EMBOSS::needle, Matrix: Blosum62, Gap Open 10.0, Gap Extend 0.5.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">&#x201c;Sequence similarity&#x201d; indicates the percentage of amino acids that either are identical or that represent conservative amino acid substitutions. &#x201c;Sequence identity&#x201d; between two amino acid sequences indicates the percentage of amino acids that are identical between the sequences.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The term &#x201c;percentage identity&#x201d; is intended to denote a percentage of amino acid residues which are identical between the two sequences to be compared, obtained after the best alignment, this percentage being purely statistical and the differences between the two sequences being distributed randomly and over their entire length. Sequence comparisons between two amino acid sequences are conventionally carried out by comparing these sequences after having aligned them optimally, said comparison being carried out by segment or by &#x201c;window of comparison&#x201d; in order to identify and compare local regions of sequence similarity. The optimal alignment of the sequences for comparison may be produced, besides manually, by means of the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman, 1981, Ads App. Math. 2, 482, by means of the local homology algorithm of Neddleman and Wunsch, 1970, J. Mol. Biol. 48, 443, by means of the similarity search method of Pearson and Lipman, 1988, Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 85, 2444, or by means of computer programs which use these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, BLAST P, BLAST N and TFASTA in Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science Drive, Madison, Wis.).</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The percentage identity is calculated by determining the number of identical positions between the two sequences being compared, dividing this number by the number of positions compared and multiplying the result obtained by 100 so as to obtain the percentage identity between these two sequences.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Homologous amino acid sequences exhibit according to the disclosure at least 40%, in particular at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90% and preferably at least 95%, at least 98 or at least 99% identity of the amino acid residues.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The amino acid sequence variants described herein may readily be prepared by the skilled person, for example, by recombinant DNA manipulation. The manipulation of DNA sequences for preparing peptides or proteins having substitutions, additions, insertions or deletions, is described in detail in Sambrook et al. (1989), for example. Furthermore, the peptides and amino acid variants described herein may be readily prepared with the aid of known peptide synthesis techniques such as, for example, by solid phase synthesis and similar methods.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In one embodiment, a fragment or variant of an amino acid sequence (peptide or protein) is preferably a &#x201c;functional fragment&#x201d; or &#x201c;functional variant&#x201d;. The term &#x201c;functional fragment&#x201d; or &#x201c;functional variant&#x201d; of an amino acid sequence relates to any fragment or variant exhibiting one or more functional properties identical or similar to those of the amino acid sequence from which it is derived, i.e., it is functionally equivalent. With respect to antigens, one particular function is one or more immunostimulating activities displayed by the amino acid sequence from which the fragment or variant is derived and/or binding to the receptor(s) the amino acid sequence from which the fragment or variant is derived binds to. The term &#x201c;functional fragment&#x201d; or &#x201c;functional variant&#x201d;, as used herein, in particular refers to a variant molecule or sequence that comprises an amino acid sequence that is altered by one or more amino acids compared to the amino acid sequence of the parent molecule or sequence and that is still capable of fulfilling one or more of the functions of the parent molecule or sequence, e.g., binding to a target molecule. In one embodiment, the modifications in the amino acid sequence of the parent molecule or sequence do not significantly affect or alter the binding characteristics of the molecule or sequence. In different embodiments, binding of the functional fragment or functional variant may be reduced but still significantly present, e.g., binding of the functional variant may be at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, or at least 90% of the parent molecule or sequence. However, in other embodiments, binding of the functional fragment or functional variant may be enhanced compared to the parent molecule or sequence.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">An amino acid sequence (peptide, protein or polypeptide) &#x201c;derived from&#x201d; a designated amino acid sequence (peptide, protein or polypeptide) refers to the origin of the first amino acid sequence. Preferably, the amino acid sequence which is derived from a particular amino acid sequence has an amino acid sequence that is identical, essentially identical or homologous to that particular sequence or a fragment thereof. Amino acid sequences derived from a particular amino acid sequence may be variants of that particular sequence or a fragment thereof. For example, it will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the antigens suitable for use herein may be altered such that they vary in sequence from the naturally occurring or native sequences from which they were derived, while retaining the desirable activity of the native sequences.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">As used herein, an &#x201c;instructional material&#x201d; or &#x201c;instructions&#x201d; includes a publication, a recording, a diagram, or any other medium of expression which can be used to communicate the usefulness of the compositions and methods of the invention. The instructional material of the kit of the invention may, for example, be affixed to a container which contains the compositions of the invention or be shipped together with a container which contains the compositions. Alternatively, the instructional material may be shipped separately from the container with the intention that the instructional material and the compositions be used cooperatively by the recipient.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">&#x201c;Isolated&#x201d; means altered or removed from the natural state. For example, a nucleic acid or a peptide naturally present in a living animal is not &#x201c;isolated&#x201d;, but the same nucleic acid or peptide partially or completely separated from the coexisting materials of its natural state is &#x201c;isolated&#x201d;. An isolated nucleic acid or protein can exist in substantially purified form, or can exist in a non-native environment such as, for example, a host cell.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The term &#x201c;recombinant&#x201d; in the context of the present invention means &#x201c;made through genetic engineering&#x201d;. Preferably, a &#x201c;recombinant object&#x201d; such as a recombinant cell in the context of the present invention is not occurring naturally.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">The term &#x201c;naturally occurring&#x201d; as used herein refers to the fact that an object can be found in nature. For example, a peptide or nucleic acid that is present in an organism (including viruses) and can be isolated from a source in nature and which has not been intentionally modified by man in the laboratory is naturally occurring.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">A &#x201c;lentivirus&#x201d; as used herein refers to a genus of the Retroviridae family. Lentiviruses are unique among the retroviruses in being able to infect non-dividing cells; they can deliver a significant amount of genetic information into the DNA of the host cell, so they are one of the most efficient methods of a gene delivery vector. HIV, SIV, and FIV are all examples of lentiviruses. Vectors derived from lentiviruses offer the means to achieve significant levels of gene transfer in vivo.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">By the term &#x201c;specifically binds&#x201d;, as used herein, is meant a molecule such as an antibody or CAR which recognizes a specific antigen, but does not substantially recognize or bind other molecules in a sample or in a subject. For example, an antibody that specifically binds to an antigen from one species may also bind to that antigen from one or more other species. But, such cross-species reactivity does not itself alter the classification of an antibody as specific. In another example, an antibody that specifically binds to an antigen may also bind to different allelic forms of the antigen. However, such cross reactivity does not itself alter the classification of an antibody as specific. In some instances, the terms &#x201c;specific binding&#x201d; or &#x201c;specifically binding&#x201d;, can be used in reference to the interaction of an antibody, a protein, or a peptide with a second chemical species, to mean that the interaction is dependent upon the presence of a particular structure (e.g., an antigenic determinant or epitope) on the chemical species; for example, an antibody recognizes and binds to a specific protein structure rather than to proteins generally. If an antibody is specific for epitope &#x201c;A&#x201d;, the presence of a molecule containing epitope A (or free, unlabeled A), in a reaction containing labeled &#x201c;A&#x201d; and the antibody, will reduce the amount of labeled A bound to the antibody.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">The term &#x201c;genetic modification&#x201d; includes the transfection of cells with nucleic acid. The term &#x201c;transfection&#x201d; relates to the introduction of nucleic acids, in particular RNA, into a cell. For purposes of the present invention, the term &#x201c;transfection&#x201d; also includes the introduction of a nucleic acid into a cell or the uptake of a nucleic acid by such cell, wherein the cell may be present in a subject, e.g., a patient. Thus, according to the present invention, a cell for transfection of a nucleic acid described herein can be present in vitro or in vivo, e.g. the cell can form part of an organ, a tissue and/or an organism of a patient. According to the invention, transfection can be transient or stable. For some applications of transfection, it is sufficient if the transfected genetic material is only transiently expressed. RNA can be transfected into cells to transiently express its coded protein. Since the nucleic acid introduced in the transfection process is usually not integrated into the nuclear genome, the foreign nucleic acid will be diluted through mitosis or degraded. Cells allowing episomal amplification of nucleic acids greatly reduce the rate of dilution. If it is desired that the transfected nucleic acid actually remains in the genome of the cell and its daughter cells, a stable transfection must occur. Such stable transfection can be achieved by using virus-based systems or transposon-based systems for transfection. Generally, cells that are genetically modified to express an antigen receptor are stably transfected with nucleic acid encoding the antigen receptor, while, generally, nucleic acid encoding antigen is transiently transfected into cells.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Immune Effector Cells</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">The cells used in connection with the present invention and into which nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) encoding antigen receptors may be introduced include, in particular, immune effector cells such as cells with lytic potential, in particular lymphoid cells, and are preferably T cells, in particular cytotoxic lymphocytes, preferably selected from cytotoxic T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells. Upon activation, each of these cytotoxic lymphocytes triggers the destruction of target cells. For example, cytotoxic T cells trigger the destruction of target cells by either or both of the following means. First, upon activation T cells release cytotoxins such as perforin, granzymes, and granulysin. Perforin and granulysin create pores in the target cell, and granzymes enter the cell and trigger a caspase cascade in the cytoplasm that induces apoptosis (programmed cell death) of the cell. Second, apoptosis can be induced via Fas-Fas ligand interaction between the T cells and target cells. The cells used in connection with the present invention will preferably be autologous cells, although heterologous cells or allogenic cells can be used.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">The term &#x201c;effector functions&#x201d; in the context of the present invention includes any functions mediated by components of the immune system that result, for example, in the killing of diseased cells such as tumor cells, or in the inhibition of tumor growth and/or inhibition of tumor development, including inhibition of tumor dissemination and metastasis. Preferably, the effector functions in the context of the present invention are T cell mediated effector functions. Such functions comprise in the case of a helper T cell (CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell) the release of cytokines and/or the activation of CD8<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes (CTLs) and/or B cells, and in the case of CTL the elimination of cells, i.e., cells characterized by expression of an antigen, for example, via apoptosis or perforin-mediated cell lysis, production of cytokines such as IFN-&#x3b3; and TNF-&#x3b1;, and specific cytolytic killing of antigen expressing target cells.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">The term &#x201c;immune effector cell&#x201d; or &#x201c;immunoreactive cell&#x201d; in the context of the present invention relates to a cell which exerts effector functions during an immune reaction. An &#x201c;immune effector cell&#x201d; in one embodiment is capable of binding an antigen such as an antigen presented in the context of MHC on a cell or expressed on the surface of a cell and mediating an immune response. For example, immune effector cells comprise T cells (cytotoxic T cells, helper T cells, tumor infiltrating T cells), B cells, natural killer cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells. Preferably, in the context of the present invention, &#x201c;immune effector cells&#x201d; are T cells, preferably CD4<sup>+</sup> and/or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. According to the invention, the term &#x201c;immune effector cell&#x201d; also includes a cell which can mature into an immune cell (such as T cell, in particular T helper cell, or cytolytic T cell) with suitable stimulation. Immune effector cells comprise CD34<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic stem cells, immature and mature T cells and immature and mature B cells. The differentiation of T cell precursors into a cytolytic T cell, when exposed to an antigen, is similar to clonal selection of the immune system.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Preferably, an &#x201c;immune effector cell&#x201d; recognizes an antigen with some degree of specificity, in particular if presented in the context of MHC or present on the surface of diseased cells such as cancer cells.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Preferably, said recognition enables the cell that recognizes an antigen to be responsive or reactive. If the cell is a helper T cell (CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell) such responsiveness or reactivity may involve the release of cytokines and/or the activation of CD8<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes (CTLs) and/or B cells. If the cell is a CTL such responsiveness or reactivity may involve the elimination of cells, i.e., cells characterized by expression of an antigen, for example, via apoptosis or perforin-mediated cell lysis. According to the invention, CTL responsiveness may include sustained calcium flux, cell division, production of cytokines such as IFN-&#x3b3; and INF-&#x3b1;, up-regulation of activation markers such as CD44 and CD69, and specific cytolytic killing of antigen expressing target cells. CTL responsiveness may also be determined using an artificial reporter that accurately indicates CTL responsiveness. Such CTL that recognizes an antigen and are responsive or reactive are also termed &#x201c;antigen-responsive CTL&#x201d; herein.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">In one embodiment, the immune effector cells are CAR-expressing immune effector cells. In one embodiment, the immune effector cells are TCR-expressing immune effector cells.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">The immune effector cells to be used according to the invention may express an endogenous antigen receptor such as T cell receptor or B cell receptor or may lack expression of an endogenous antigen receptor.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">A &#x201c;lymphoid cell&#x201d; is a cell which, optionally after suitable modification, e.g. after transfer of an antigen receptor such as a TCR or a CAR, is capable of producing an immune response such as a cellular immune response, or a precursor cell of such cell, and includes lymphocytes, preferably T lymphocytes, lymphoblasts, and plasma cells. A lymphoid cell may be an immune effector cell as described herein. A preferred lymphoid cell is a T cell which can be modified to express an antigen receptor on the cell surface. In one embodiment, the lymphoid cell lacks endogenous expression of a T cell receptor.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">The terms &#x201c;T cell&#x201d; and &#x201c;T lymphocyte&#x201d; are used interchangeably herein and include T helper cells (CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells) and cytotoxic T cells (CTLs, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells) which comprise cytolytic T cells. The term &#x201c;antigen-specific T cell&#x201d; or similar terms relate to a T cell which recognizes the antigen to which the T cell is targeted and preferably exerts effector functions of T cells. T cells are considered to be specific for antigen if the cells kill target cells expressing an antigen. T cell specificity may be evaluated using any of a variety of standard techniques, for example, within a chromium release assay or proliferation assay. Alternatively, synthesis of lymphokines (such as interferon-&#x3b3;) can be measured.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">T cells belong to a group of white blood cells known as lymphocytes, and play a central role in cell-mediated immunity. They can be distinguished from other lymphocyte types, such as B cells and natural killer cells by the presence of a special receptor on their cell surface called T cell receptors (TCR). The thymus is the principal organ responsible for the maturation of T cells. Several different subsets of T cells have been discovered, each with a distinct function.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">T helper cells assist other white blood cells in immunologic processes, including maturation of B cells into plasma cells and activation of cytotoxic T cells and macrophages, among other functions. These cells are also known as CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells because they express the CD4 glycoprotein on their surface. Helper T cells become activated when they are presented with peptide antigens by MHC class II molecules that are expressed on the surface of antigen presenting cells (APCs). Once activated, they divide rapidly and secrete small proteins called cytokines that regulate or assist in the active immune response.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">Cytotoxic T cells destroy virally infected cells and tumor cells, and are also implicated in transplant rejection. These cells are also known as CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells since they express the CD8 glycoprotein on their surface. These cells recognize their targets by binding to antigen associated with MHC class I, which is present on the surface of nearly every cell of the body.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">&#x201c;Regulatory T cells&#x201d; or &#x201c;Tregs&#x201d; are a subpopulation of T cells that modulate the immune system, maintain tolerance to self-antigens, and prevent autoimmune disease. Tregs are immunosuppressive and generally suppress or downregulate induction and proliferation of effector T cells. Tregs express the biomarkers CD4, FoxP3, and CD25.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">As used herein, the term &#x201c;na&#xef;ve T cell&#x201d; refers to mature T cells that, unlike activated or memory T cells, have not encountered their cognate antigen within the periphery. Na&#xef;ve T cells are commonly characterized by the surface expression of L-selectin (CD62L), the absence of the activation markers CD25, CD44 or CD69 and the absence of the memory CD45RO isoform.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">As used herein, the term &#x201c;memory T cells&#x201d; refers to a subgroup or subpopulation of T cells that have previously encountered and responded to their cognate antigen. At a second encounter with the antigen, memory T cells can reproduce to mount a faster and stronger immune response than the first time the immune system responded to the antigen. Memory T cells may be either CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> and usually express CD45RO.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">According to the invention, the term &#x201c;T cell&#x201d; also includes a cell which can mature into a T cell with suitable stimulation.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">A majority of T cells have a T cell receptor (TCR) existing as a complex of several proteins. The actual T cell receptor is composed of two separate peptide chains, which are produced from the independent T cell receptor alpha and beta (TCR&#x3b1; and TCR&#x3b2;) genes and are called &#x3b1;- and &#x3b2;-TCR chains. &#x3b3;&#x3b4; T cells (gamma delta T cells) represent a small subset of T cells that possess a distinct T cell receptor (TCR) on their surface. However, in &#x3b3;&#x3b4; T cells, the TCR is made up of one &#x3b3;-chain and one &#x3b4;-chain. This group of T cells is much less common (2% of total T cells) than the &#x3b1;&#x3b2; T cells.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">All T cells originate from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow. Hematopoietic progenitors derived from hematopoietic stem cells populate the thymus and expand by cell division to generate a large population of immature thymocytes. The earliest thymocytes express neither CD4 nor CD8, and are therefore classed as double-negative (CD4<sup>&#x2212;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x2212;</sup>) cells. As they progress through their development they become double-positive thymocytes (CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup>), and finally mature to single-positive (CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>&#x2212;</sup> or CD4<sup>&#x2212;</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup>) thymocytes that are then released from the thymus to peripheral tissues.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">T cells may generally be prepared in vitro or ex vivo, using standard procedures. For example, T cells may be isolated from bone marrow, peripheral blood or a fraction of bone marrow or peripheral blood of a mammal, such as a patient, using a commercially available cell separation system. Alternatively, T cells may be derived from related or unrelated humans, non-human animals, cell lines or cultures. A sample comprising T cells may, for example, be peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">As used herein, the term &#x201c;NK cell&#x201d; or &#x201c;Natural Killer cell&#x201d; refers to a subset of peripheral blood lymphocytes defined by the expression of CD56 or CD16 and the absence of the T cell receptor. As provided herein, the NK cell can also be differentiated from a stem cell or progenitor cell.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">Nucleic Acids</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">The term &#x201c;polynucleotide&#x201d; or &#x201c;nucleic acid&#x201d;, as used herein, is intended to include DNA and RNA such as genomic DNA, cDNA, mRNA, recombinantly produced and chemically synthesized molecules.

Said vectors include expression as well as cloning vectors. Expression vectors comprise plasmids as well as viral vectors and generally contain a desired coding sequence and appropriate DNA sequences necessary for the expression of the operably linked coding sequence in a particular host organism (e.g., bacteria, yeast, plant, insect, or mammal) or in in vitro expression systems. Cloning vectors are generally used to engineer and amplify a certain desired DNA fragment and may lack functional sequences needed for expression of the desired DNA fragments.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">In one embodiment of all aspects of the invention, nucleic acid such as nucleic acid encoding an antigen receptor or nucleic acid encoding a vaccine antigen is expressed in cells of the subject treated to provide the antigen receptor or vaccine antigen.

One particularly preferred cytokine is IL2.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0157">Cytokines are a category of small proteins (&#x2dc;5-20 kDa) that are important in cell signaling. Their release has an effect on the behavior of cells around them. Cytokines are involved in autocrine signaling, paracrine signaling and endocrine signaling as immunomodulating agents. Cytokines include chemokines, interferons, interleukins, lymphokines, and tumour necrosis factors but generally not hormones or growth factors (despite some overlap in the terminology). Cytokines are produced by a broad range of cells, including immune cells like macrophages, B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes and mast cells, as well as endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and various stromal cells. A given cytokine may be produced by more than one type of cell. Cytokines act through receptors, and are especially important in the immune system; cytokines modulate the balance between humoral and cell-based immune responses, and they regulate the maturation, growth, and responsiveness of particular cell populations. Some cytokines enhance or inhibit the action of other cytokines in complex ways.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0158">IL2</p><p id="p-0167" num="0159">Interleukin-2 (IL2) is a cytokine that induces proliferation of antigen-activated T cells and stimulates natural killer (NK) cells. The biological activity of IL2 is mediated through a multi-subunit IL2 receptor complex (IL2R) of three polypeptide subunits that span the cell membrane: p55 (IL2R&#x3b1;, the alpha subunit, also known as CD25 in humans), p75 (IL2R&#x3b2;, the beta subunit, also known as CD122 in humans) and p64 (IL2R&#x3b3;, the gamma subunit, also known as CD132 in humans). T cell response to IL2 depends on a variety of factors, including: (1) the concentration of IL2; (2) the number of IL2R molecules on the cell surface; and (3) the number of IL2R occupied by IL2 (i.e., the affinity of the binding interaction between IL2 and IL2R (Smith, &#x201c;Cell Growth Signal Transduction is Quantal&#x201d; In Receptor Activation by Antigens, Cytokines, Hormones, and Growth Factors 766:263-271, 1995)). The IL2:IL2R complex is internalized upon ligand binding and the different components undergo differential sorting. When administered as an intravenous (i.v.) bolus, IL2 has a rapid systemic clearance (an initial clearance phase with a half-life of 12.9 minutes followed by a slower clearance phase with a half-life of 85 minutes) (Konrad et al., Cancer Res. 50:2009-2017, 1990).</p><p id="p-0168" num="0160">In eukaryotic cells human IL2 is synthesized as a precursor polypeptide of 153 amino acids, from which 20 amino acids are removed to generate mature secreted IL2.

The resulting molecule, hereafter referred to as &#x201c;extended-pharmacokinetic (PK) cytokine,&#x201d; has a prolonged circulation half-life relative to free cytokine. The prolonged circulation half-life of extended-PK cytokine permits in vivo serum cytokine concentrations to be maintained within a therapeutic range, potentially leading to the enhanced activation of many types of immune cells, including T cells. Because of its favorable pharmacokinetic profile, extended-PK cytokine can be dosed less frequently and for longer periods of time when compared with unmodified cytokine.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0164">As used herein, &#x201c;half-life&#x201d; refers to the time taken for the serum or plasma concentration of a compound such as a peptide or protein to reduce by 50%, in vivo, for example due to degradation and/or clearance or sequestration by natural mechanisms. An extended-PK cytokine such as an extended-PK interleukin (IL) suitable for use herein is stabilized in vivo and its half-life increased by, e.g., fusion to serum albumin (e.g., HSA or MSA), which resist degradation and/or clearance or sequestration. The half-life can be determined in any manner known per se, such as by pharmacokinetic analysis. Suitable techniques will be clear to the person skilled in the art, and may for example generally involve the steps of suitably administering a suitable dose of the amino acid sequence or compound to a subject; collecting blood samples or other samples from said subject at regular intervals; determining the level or concentration of the amino acid sequence or compound in said blood sample; and calculating, from (a plot of) the data thus obtained, the time until the level or concentration of the amino acid sequence or compound has been reduced by 50% compared to the initial level upon dosing.

Transmembrane regions of particular use in this invention may be derived from (i.e. comprise at least the transmembrane region(s) of) the alpha, beta or zeta chain of the T cell receptor, CD28, CD3 epsilon, CD45, CD4, CD5, CD8, CD9, CD16, CD22, CD33, CD37, CD64, CD80, CD86, CD134, CD137, CD154. Alternatively the transmembrane domain may be synthetic, in which case it will comprise predominantly hydrophobic residues such as leucine and valine. Preferably a triplet of phenylalanine, tryptophan and valine will be found at each end of a synthetic transmembrane domain.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0198">In some instances, the CAR of the invention comprises a hinge domain which forms the linkage between the transmembrane domain and the extracellular domain.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0199">The cytoplasmic domain or otherwise the intracellular signaling domain of the CAR is responsible for activation of at least one of the normal effector functions of the immune cell in which the CAR has been placed in. The term &#x201c;effector function&#x201d; refers to a specialized function of a cell. Effector function of a T cell, for example, may be cytolytic activity or helper activity including the secretion of cytokines. Thus the term &#x201c;intracellular signaling domain&#x201d; refers to the portion of a protein which transduces the effector function signal and directs the cell to perform a specialized function. While usually the entire intracellular signaling domain can be employed, in many cases it is not necessary to use the entire chain. To the extent that a truncated portion of the intracellular signaling domain is used, such truncated portion may be used in place of the intact chain as long as it transduces the effector function signal. The term intracellular signaling domain is thus meant to include any truncated portion of the intracellular signaling domain sufficient to transduce the effector function signal.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0200">It is known that signals generated through the TCR alone are insufficient for full activation of the T cell and that a secondary or co-stimulatory signal is also required. Thus, T cell activation can be said to be mediated by two distinct classes of cytoplasmic signaling sequence: those that initiate antigen-dependent primary activation through the TCR (primary cytoplasmic signaling sequences) and those that act in an antigen-independent manner to provide a secondary or co-stimulatory signal (secondary cytoplasmic signaling sequences).</p><p id="p-0209" num="0201">In one embodiment, the CAR comprises a primary cytoplasmic signaling sequence derived from CD3-zeta. Further, the cytoplasmic domain of the CAR may comprise the CD3-zeta signaling domain combined with a costimulatory signaling region.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0202">The identity of the co-stimulation domain is limited only in that it has the ability to enhance cellular proliferation and survival upon binding of the targeted moiety by the CAR. Suitable co-stimulation domains include CD28, CD137 (4-1BB), a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily, CD134 (OX40), a member of the TNFR-superfamily of receptors, and CD278 (ICOS), a CD28-superfamily co-stimulatory molecule expressed on activated T cells. The skilled person will understand that sequence variants of these noted co-stimulation domains can be used without adversely impacting the invention, where the variants have the same or similar activity as the domain on which they are modeled. Such variants will have at least about 80% sequence identity to the amino acid sequence of the domain from which they are derived. In some embodiments of the invention, the CAR constructs comprise two co-stimulation domains. While the particular combinations include all possible variations of the four noted domains, specific examples include CD28+CD137 (4-1BB) and CD28+CD134 (OX40).</p><p id="p-0211" num="0203">The cytoplasmic signaling sequences within the cytoplasmic signaling portion of the CAR may be linked to each other in a random or specified order. Optionally, a short oligo- or polypeptide linker, preferably between 2 and 10 amino acids in length may form the linkage. A glycine-serine doublet provides a particularly suitable linker.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0204">In one embodiment, the CAR comprises a signal peptide which directs the nascent protein into the endoplasmic reticulum. In one embodiment, the signal peptide precedes the antigen binding domain. In one embodiment, the signal peptide is derived from an immunoglobulin such as IgG.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0205">A CAR may comprise the above domains, together in the form of a fusion protein. Such fusion proteins will generally comprise an antigen binding domain, one or more co-stimulation domains, and a signaling sequence, linked in a N-terminal to C-terminal direction. However, the CARs of the present invention are not limited to this arrangement and other arrangements are acceptable and include a binding domain, a signaling domain, and one or more co-stimulation domains. It will be understood that because the binding domain must be free to bind antigen, the placement of the binding domain in the fusion protein will generally be such that display of the region on the exterior of the cell is achieved. In the same manner, because the co-stimulation and signaling domains serve to induce activity and proliferation of the cytotoxic lymphocytes, the fusion protein will generally display these two domains in the interior of the cell.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0206">In one embodiment, a CAR molecule comprises:</p><p id="p-0215" num="0207">i) a target antigen (e.g., CLDN6 or CLDN18.2) binding domain;</p><p id="p-0216" num="0208">ii) a transmembrane domain; and</p><p id="p-0217" num="0209">iii) an intracellular domain that comprises a 4-1BB costimulatory domain, and a CD3-zeta signaling domain.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0210">In one embodiment, the antigen binding domain comprises an scFv.

Each heavy chain is comprised of a heavy chain variable region (abbreviated herein as VH) and a heavy chain constant region. Each light chain is comprised of a light chain variable region (abbreviated herein as VL) and a light chain constant region. The VH and VL regions can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability, termed complementarity determining regions (CDR), interspersed with regions that are more conserved, termed framework regions (FR). Each VH and VL is composed of three CDRs and four FRs, arranged from amino-terminus to carboxy-terminus in the following order: FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4. The variable regions of the heavy and light chains contain a binding domain that interacts with an antigen. The constant regions of the antibodies may mediate the binding of the immunoglobulin to host tissues or factors, including various cells of the immune system (e.g., effector cells) and the first component (Clq) of the classical complement system. An antibody binds, preferably specifically binds with an antigen. Antibodies can be intact immunoglobulins derived from natural sources or from recombinant sources and can be immunoreactive portions or fragments of intact immunoglobulins. Antibodies are typically tetramers of immunoglobulin molecules. The antibodies in the present invention may exist in a variety of forms including, for example, polyclonal antibodies, monoclonal antibodies, Fv, Fab and F(ab&#x2032;)2, as well as single chain antibodies and humanized antibodies (Harlow et al., 1999, In: Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, NY; Harlow et al., 1989, in: Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.; Houston et al., 1988, Proc.

The five members included in this class of proteins are IgA, IgG, IgM, IgD, and IgE. IgA is the primary antibody that is present in body secretions, such as saliva, tears, breast milk, gastrointestinal secretions and mucus secretions of the respiratory and genitourinary tracts. IgG is the most common circulating antibody. IgM is the main immunoglobulin produced in the primary immune response in most subjects. It is the most efficient immunoglobulin in agglutination, complement fixation, and other antibody responses, and is important in defense against bacteria and viruses. IgD is the immunoglobulin that has no known antibody function, but may serve as an antigen receptor. IgE is the immunoglobulin that mediates immediate hypersensitivity by causing release of mediators from mast cells and basophils upon exposure to allergen.</p><p id="p-0226" num="0218">The term &#x201c;antibody fragment&#x201d; refers to a portion of an intact antibody and typically comprises the antigenic determining variable regions of an intact antibody.</p><p id="p-0227" num="0219">Examples of antibody fragments include, but are not limited to, Fab, Fab&#x2032;, F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2</sub>, and Fv fragments, linear antibodies, scFv antibodies, and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.</p><p id="p-0228" num="0220">An &#x201c;antibody heavy chain&#x201d;, as used herein, refers to the larger of the two types of polypeptide chains present in antibody molecules in their naturally occurring conformations.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0221">An &#x201c;antibody light chain&#x201d;, as used herein, refers to the smaller of the two types of polypeptide chains present in antibody molecules in their naturally occurring conformations, K and A light chains refer to the two major antibody light chain isotypes.</p><p id="p-0230" num="0222">According to the disclosure, a CAR which when present on a T cell recognizes an antigen such as on the surface of antigen presenting cells or diseased cells such as cancer cells, such that the T cell is stimulated, and/or expanded or exerts effector functions as described above.</p><p id="p-0231" num="0223">Genetic Modification of Immune Effector Cells</p><p id="p-0232" num="0224">A variety of methods may be used to introduce antigen receptors such as CAR constructs into cells such as T cells to produce cells genetically modified to express the antigen receptors. Such methods including non-viral-based DNA transfection, non-viral-based RNA transfection, e.g., mRNA transfection, transposon-based systems, and viral-based systems. Non-viral-based DNA transfection has low risk of insertional mutagenesis. Transposon-based systems can integrate transgenes more efficiently than plasmids that do not contain an integrating element. Viral-based systems include the use of y-retroviruses and lentiviral vectors. y-Retroviruses are relatively easy to produce, efficiently and permanently transduce T cells, and have preliminarily proven safe from an integration standpoint in primary human T cells. Lentiviral vectors also efficiently and permanently transduce T cells but are more expensive to manufacture. They are also potentially safer than retrovirus based systems.</p><p id="p-0233" num="0225">In one embodiment of all aspects of the invention, T cells or T cell progenitors are transfected either ex vivo or in vivo with nucleic acid encoding the antigen receptor. In one embodiment, a combination of ex vivo and in vivo transfection may be used. In one embodiment of all aspects of the invention, the T cells or T cell progenitors are from the subject to be treated. In one embodiment of all aspects of the invention, the T cells or T cell progenitors are from a subject which is different to the subject to be treated.</p><p id="p-0234" num="0226">CAR T cells may be produced in vivo, and therefore nearly instantaneously, using nanoparticles targeted to T cells. For example, poly(&#x3b2;-amino ester)-based nanoparticles may be coupled to anti-CD3e F(ab) fragments for binding to CD3 on T cells. Upon binding to T cells, these nanoparticles are endocytosed. Their contents, for example plasmid DNA encoding an anti-tumor antigen CAR, may be directed to the T cell nucleus due to the inclusion of peptides containing microtubule-associated sequences (MTAS) and nuclear localization signals (NLSs). The inclusion of transposons flanking the CAR gene expression cassette and a separate plasmid encoding a hyperactive transposase, may allow for the efficient integration of the CAR vector into chromosomes. Such system that allows for the in vivo production of CART cells following nanoparticle infusion is described in Smith et al. (2017) Nat. Nanotechnol. 12:813-820.</p><p id="p-0235" num="0227">Furthermore, CD19-CAR T cells can be generated directly in vivo using the lentiviral vector CD8-LV specifically targeting human CD8<sup>+</sup> cells (Pfeiffer A. et al., EMBO Mol.

For example, existing T cell receptors (TCR) may be knocked out, while knocking in the CAR and placing it under the dynamic regulatory control of the endogenous promoter that would otherwise moderate TCR expression; c.f., e.g., Eyquem et al.

In one embodiment, the present disclosure does not envision the removal of cells from a patient. In the latter case all steps of genetic modification of cells are performed in vivo.</p><p id="p-0240" num="0232">The term &#x201c;autologous&#x201d; is used to describe anything that is derived from the same subject. For example, &#x201c;autologous transplant&#x201d; refers to a transplant of tissue or organs derived from the same subject. Such procedures are advantageous because they overcome the immunological barrier which otherwise results in rejection.</p><p id="p-0241" num="0233">The term &#x201c;allogeneic&#x201d; is used to describe anything that is derived from different individuals of the same species.

In one embodiment, after systemic administration of the nucleic acid encoding the cognate antigen molecule, no or essentially no expression of the nucleic acid encoding the cognate antigen molecule in lung and/or liver occurs. In one embodiment, after systemic administration of the nucleic acid encoding the cognate antigen molecule, expression of the nucleic acid encoding the cognate antigen molecule in spleen is at least 5-fold the amount of expression in lung.</p><p id="p-0247" num="0239">A peptide and protein antigen which is provided to a subject according to the invention (either by administering the peptide and protein antigen, a nucleic acid, in particular RNA, encoding the peptide and protein antigen or cells expressing the peptide and protein antigen), i.e., a vaccine antigen, preferably results in stimulation, priming and/or expansion of immune effector cells in the subject being administered the peptide or protein antigen, nucleic acid or cells. Said stimulated, primed and/or expanded immune effector cells are preferably directed against a target antigen, in particular a target antigen expressed by diseased cells, tissues and/or organs, i.e., a disease-associated antigen. Thus, a vaccine antigen may comprise the disease-associated antigen, or a fragment or variant thereof. In one embodiment, such fragment or variant is immunologically equivalent to the disease-associated antigen. In the context of the present disclosure, the term &#x201c;fragment of an antigen&#x201d; or &#x201c;variant of an antigen&#x201d; means an agent which results in stimulation, priming and/or expansion of immune effector cells which stimulated, primed and/or expanded immune effector cells target the antigen, i.e. a disease-associated antigen, in particular when presented by diseased cells, tissues and/or organs. Thus, the vaccine antigen may correspond to or may comprise the disease-associated antigen, may correspond to or may comprise a fragment of the disease-associated antigen or may correspond to or may comprise an antigen which is homologous to the disease-associated antigen or a fragment thereof. If the vaccine antigen comprises a fragment of the disease-associated antigen or an amino acid sequence which is homologous to a fragment of the disease-associated antigen said fragment or amino acid sequence may comprise an epitope of the disease-associated antigen to which the antigen receptor of the immune effector cells is targeted or a sequence which is homologous to an epitope of the disease-associated antigen.

In the context of the present disclosure, the term &#x201c;immunologically equivalent&#x201d; is preferably used with respect to the immunological effects or properties of antigens or antigen variants used for immunization. For example, an amino acid sequence is immunologically equivalent to a reference amino acid sequence if said amino acid sequence when exposed to the immune system of a subject such as T cells binding to the reference amino acid sequence or cells expressing the reference amino acid sequence induces an immune reaction having a specificity of reacting with the reference amino acid sequence.

In one embodiment, an antigen is presented or present on the surface of cells of the immune system such as antigen presenting cells like dendritic cells or macrophages. An antigen or a procession product thereof such as a T cell epitope is in one embodiment bound by an antigen receptor. Accordingly, an antigen or a procession product thereof may react specifically with immune effector cells such as T-lymphocytes (T cells). In one embodiment, an antigen is a disease-associated antigen, such as a tumor antigen, a viral antigen, or a bacterial antigen and an epitope is derived from such antigen.</p><p id="p-0254" num="0246">The term &#x201c;disease-associated antigen&#x201d; is used in its broadest sense to refer to any antigen associated with a disease.

An antigen is expressed on the surface of cells if it is located at the surface of said cells and is accessible to binding by e.g. antigen-specific antibodies added to the cells. In one embodiment, an antigen expressed on the surface of cells is an integral membrane protein having an extracellular portion recognized by a CAR.</p><p id="p-0260" num="0252">The term &#x201c;extracellular portion&#x201d; or &#x201c;exodomain&#x201d; in the context of the present invention refers to a part of a molecule such as a protein that is facing the extracellular space of a cell and preferably is accessible from the outside of said cell, e.g., by binding molecules such as antibodies located outside the cell. Preferably, the term refers to one or more extracellular loops or domains or a fragment thereof.</p><p id="p-0261" num="0253">The term &#x201c;epitope&#x201d; refers to a part or fragment of a molecule such as an antigen that is recognized by the immune system. For example, the epitope may be recognized by T cells, B cells or antibodies. An epitope of an antigen may include a continuous or discontinuous portion of the antigen and may be between about 5 and about 100, such as between about 5 and about 50, more preferably between about 8 and about 30, most preferably between about 10 and about 25 amino acids in length, for example, the epitope may be preferably 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, or 25 amino acids in length.

The term &#x201c;major histocompatibility complex&#x201d; and the abbreviation &#x201c;MHC&#x201d; includes MHC class I and MHC class II molecules and relates to a complex of genes which is present in all vertebrates. MHC proteins or molecules are important for signaling between lymphocytes and antigen presenting cells or diseased cells in immune reactions, wherein the MHC proteins or molecules bind peptide epitopes and present them for recognition by T cell receptors on T cells. The proteins encoded by the MHC are expressed on the surface of cells, and display both self-antigens (peptide fragments from the cell itself) and non-self-antigens (e.g., fragments of invading microorganisms) to a T cell. In the case of class I MHC/peptide complexes, the binding peptides are typically about 8 to about 10 amino acids long although longer or shorter peptides may be effective. In the case of class II MHC/peptide complexes, the binding peptides are typically about 10 to about 25 amino acids long and are in particular about 13 to about 18 amino acids long, whereas longer and shorter peptides may be effective.</p><p id="p-0263" num="0255">In one embodiment, the target antigen is a tumor antigen and the vaccine antigen or a fragment thereof (e.g., an epitope) is derived from the tumor antigen. The tumor antigen may be a &#x201c;standard&#x201d; antigen, which is generally known to be expressed in various cancers. The tumor antigen may also be a &#x201c;neo-antigen&#x201d;, which is specific to an individual's tumor and has not been previously recognized by the immune system. A neo-antigen or neo-epitope may result from one or more cancer-specific mutations in the genome of cancer cells resulting in amino acid changes. If the tumor antigen is a neo-antigen, the vaccine antigen preferably comprises an epitope or a fragment of said neo-antigen comprising one or more amino acid changes.</p><p id="p-0264" num="0256">Cancer mutations vary with each individual. Thus, cancer mutations that encode novel epitopes (neo-epitopes) represent attractive targets in the development of vaccine compositions and immunotherapies. The efficacy of tumor immunotherapy relies on the selection of cancer-specific antigens and epitopes capable of inducing a potent immune response within a host. RNA can be used to deliver patient-specific tumor epitopes to a patient. Dendritic cells (DCs) residing in the spleen represent antigen-presenting cells of particular interest for RNA expression of immunogenic epitopes or antigens such as tumor epitopes. The use of multiple epitopes has been shown to promote therapeutic efficacy in tumor vaccine compositions. Rapid sequencing of the tumor mutanome may provide multiple epitopes for individualized vaccines which can be encoded by RNA described herein, e.g., as a single polypeptide wherein the epitopes are optionally separated by linkers. In certain embodiments of the present disclosure, the RNA encodes at least one epitope, at least two epitopes, at least three epitopes, at least four epitopes, at least five epitopes, at least six epitopes, at least seven epitopes, at least eight epitopes, at least nine epitopes, or at least ten epitopes.

In the context of the embodiments of the present invention, the antigen is preferably present on the surface of a cell, preferably an antigen presenting cell. Recognition of the antigen on the surface of a diseased cell may result in an immune reaction against the antigen (or cell expressing the antigen).</p><p id="p-0268" num="0260">In one embodiment of all aspects of the invention, an antigen is expressed in a diseased cell such as a cancer cell. In one embodiment, an antigen is expressed on the surface of a diseased cell such as a cancer cell. In one embodiment, an antigen receptor is a CAR which binds to an extracellular domain or to an epitope in an extracellular domain of an antigen. In one embodiment, a CAR binds to native epitopes of an antigen present on the surface of living cells. In one embodiment, binding of a CAR when expressed by T cells and/or present on T cells to an antigen present on cells such as antigen presenting cells results in stimulation, priming and/or expansion of said T cells. In one embodiment, binding of a CAR when expressed by T cells and/or present on T cells to an antigen present on diseased cells such as cancer cells results in cytolysis and/or apoptosis of the diseased cells, wherein said T cells preferably release cytotoxic factors, e.g. perforins and granzymes.</p><p id="p-0269" num="0261">Chemotherapy</p><p id="p-0270" num="0262">In certain embodiments, additional treatments may be administered to a patient in combination with the treatments described herein. Such additional treatments includes classical cancer therapy, e.g., radiation therapy, surgery, hyperthermia therapy and/or chemotherapy.</p><p id="p-0271" num="0263">Chemotherapy is a type of cancer treatment that uses one or more anti-cancer drugs (chemotherapeutic agents), usually as part of a standardized chemotherapy regimen. The term chemotherapy has come to connote non-specific usage of intracellular poisons to inhibit mitosis. The connotation excludes more selective agents that block extracellular signals (signal transduction). The development of therapies with specific molecular or genetic targets, which inhibit growth-promoting signals from classic endocrine hormones (primarily estrogens for breast cancer and androgens for prostate cancer) are now called hormonal therapies. By contrast, other inhibitions of growth-signals like those associated with receptor tyrosine kinases are referred to as targeted therapy.</p><p id="p-0272" num="0264">Importantly, the use of drugs (whether chemotherapy, hormonal therapy or targeted therapy) constitutes systemic therapy for cancer in that they are introduced into the blood stream and are therefore in principle able to address cancer at any anatomic location in the body. Systemic therapy is often used in conjunction with other modalities that constitute local therapy (i.e. treatments whose efficacy is confined to the anatomic area where they are applied) for cancer such as radiation therapy, surgery or hyperthermia therapy.</p><p id="p-0273" num="0265">Traditional chemotherapeutic agents are cytotoxic by means of interfering with cell division (mitosis) but cancer cells vary widely in their susceptibility to these agents. To a large extent, chemotherapy can be thought of as a way to damage or stress cells, which may then lead to cell death if apoptosis is initiated.</p><p id="p-0274" num="0266">Chemotherapeutic agents include alkylating agents, antimetabolites, anti-microtubule agents, topoisomerase inhibitors, and cytotoxic antibiotics.</p><p id="p-0275" num="0267">Alkylating agents have the ability to alkylate many molecules, including proteins, RNA and DNA. The subtypes of alkylating agents are the nitrogen mustards, nitrosoureas, tetrazines, aziridines, cisplatins and derivatives, and non-classical alkylating agents. Nitrogen mustards include mechlorethamine, cyclophosphamide, melphalan, chlorambucil, ifosfamide and busulfan. Nitrosoureas include N-Nitroso-N-methylurea (MNU), carmustine (BCNU), lomustine (CCNU) and semustine (MeCCNU), fotemustine and streptozotocin. Tetrazines include dacarbazine, mitozolomide and temozolomide. Aziridines include thiotepa, mytomycin and diaziquone (AZQ). Cisplatin and derivatives include cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin. They impair cell function by forming covalent bonds with the amino, carboxyl, sulfhydryl, and phosphate groups in biologically important molecules. Non-classical alkylating agents include procarbazine and hexamethylmelamine. In one particularly preferred embodiment, the alkylating agent is cyclophosphamide.</p><p id="p-0276" num="0268">Anti-metabolites are a group of molecules that impede DNA and RNA synthesis. Many of them have a similar structure to the building blocks of DNA and RNA. Anti-metabolites resemble either nucleobases or nucleosides, but have altered chemical groups. These drugs exert their effect by either blocking the enzymes required for DNA synthesis or becoming incorporated into DNA or RNA. Subtypes of the anti-metabolites are the anti-folates, fluoropyrimidines, deoxynucleoside analogues and thiopurines. The anti-folates include methotrexate and pemetrexed. The fluoropyrimidines include fluorouracil and capecitabine. The deoxynucleoside analogues include cytarabine, gemcitabine, decitabine, azacitidine, fludarabine, nelarabine, cladribine, clofarabine, and pentostatin. The thiopurines include thioguanine and mercaptopurine.</p><p id="p-0277" num="0269">Anti-microtubule agents block cell division by preventing microtubule function. The <i>vinca </i>alkaloids prevent the formation of the microtubules, whereas the taxanes prevent the microtubule disassembly. <i>Vinca </i>alkaloids include vinorelbine, vindesine, and vinflunine. Taxanes include docetaxel (Taxotere) and paclitaxel (Taxol).</p><p id="p-0278" num="0270">Topoisomerase inhibitors are drugs that affect the activity of two enzymes: topoisomerase I and topoisomerase II and include irinotecan, topotecan, camptothecin, etoposide, doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, teniposide, novobiocin, merbarone, and aclarubicin.</p><p id="p-0279" num="0271">The cytotoxic antibiotics are a varied group of drugs that have various mechanisms of action. The common theme that they share in their chemotherapy indication is that they interrupt cell division. The most important subgroup is the anthracyclines (e.g., doxorubicin, daunorubicin, epirubicin, idarubicin pirarubicin, and aclarubicin) and the bleomycins; other prominent examples include mitomycin C, mitoxantrone, and actinomycin.</p><p id="p-0280" num="0272">In one embodiment, prior to administration of immune effector cells, a lymphodepleting treatment may be applied, e.g., by administering cyclophosphamide and fludarabine.

This comprises slowing down the progress of the disease and, in particular, interrupting or reversing the progress of the disease. The desired reaction in a treatment of a disease may also be delay of the onset or a prevention of the onset of said disease or said condition. An effective amount of the compositions described herein will depend on the condition to be treated, the severeness of the disease, the individual parameters of the patient, including age, physiological condition, size and weight, the duration of treatment, the type of an accompanying therapy (if present), the specific route of administration and similar factors. Accordingly, the doses administered of the compositions described herein may depend on various of such parameters. In the case that a reaction in a patient is insufficient with an initial dose, higher doses (or effectively higher doses achieved by a different, more localized route of administration) may be used.</p><p id="p-0327" num="0319">The term &#x201c;sub-therapeutic amount&#x201d; typically refers to a less than standard therapeutic amount of a pharmaceutical agent, meaning that the amount required for the desired effect is lower than when the pharmaceutical agent is used alone.

Furthermore, some therapeutic approaches comprise repetitive administration of CAR T cells in a short time period (e.g. less than 4 weeks) to improve safety by dose escalation and/or to maintain the number of effective T cells in the patient. This leads to even higher &#x201c;accumulated doses&#x201d; within such time periods. Thus, a &#x201c;sub-therapeutic amount&#x201d; of immune effector cells genetically modified to express an antigen receptor is an amount of such cells per initial dose and/or accumulated dose over a time period of at least 2 days, at least 3 days, at least 4 days, at least 5 days, at least 6 days, at least 7 days, at least 14 days, at least 21 days, at least 28 days or even longer of 10<sup>8 </sup>or less, 10<sup>7 </sup>or less, 10<sup>6 </sup>or less, 10<sup>5 </sup>or less, 10<sup>4 </sup>or less, 10<sup>3 </sup>or less or even lower.

Macrophages which are activated by inflammation, immune cytokines or microbial products nonspecifically engulf and kill foreign pathogens within the macrophage by hydrolytic and oxidative attack resulting in degradation of the pathogen. Peptides from degraded proteins are displayed on the macrophage cell surface where they can be recognized by T cells, and they can directly interact with antibodies on the B cell surface, resulting in T and B cell activation and further stimulation of the immune response. Macrophages belong to the class of antigen presenting cells. In one embodiment, the macrophages are splenic macrophages.</p><p id="p-0354" num="0346">The term &#x201c;dendritic cell&#x201d; (DC) refers to another subtype of phagocytic cells belonging to the class of antigen presenting cells. In one embodiment, dendritic cells are derived from hematopoietic bone marrow progenitor cells. These progenitor cells initially transform into immature dendritic cells. These immature cells are characterized by high phagocytic activity and low T cell activation potential. Immature dendritic cells constantly sample the surrounding environment for pathogens such as viruses and bacteria. Once they have come into contact with a presentable antigen, they become activated into mature dendritic cells and begin to migrate to the spleen or to the lymph node. Immature dendritic cells phagocytose pathogens and degrade their proteins into small pieces and upon maturation present those fragments at their cell surface using MHC molecules. Simultaneously, they upregulate cell-surface receptors that act as co-receptors in T cell activation such as CD80, CD86, and CD40 greatly enhancing their ability to activate T cells. They also upregulate CCR7, a chemotactic receptor that induces the dendritic cell to travel through the blood stream to the spleen or through the lymphatic system to a lymph node. Here they act as antigen-presenting cells and activate helper T cells and killer T cells as well as B cells by presenting them antigens, alongside non-antigen specific co-stimulatory signals. Thus, dendritic cells can actively induce a T cell- or B cell-related immune response. In one embodiment, the dendritic cells are splenic dendritic cells.</p><p id="p-0355" num="0347">The term &#x201c;antigen presenting cell&#x201d; (APC) is a cell of a variety of cells capable of displaying, acquiring, and/or presenting at least one antigen or antigenic fragment on (or at) its cell surface.

S. et al., The New England journal of medicine 377, 2531-2544 (2017); Maude S. L. et al., The New England journal of medicine 378, 439-448 (2018)). In patients with solid tumors, however, the efficacy of CAR T-cell therapy remains disappointing (Scarfo I. et al., Journal for immunotherapy of cancer 5, 28 (2017)). One key hurdle is the scarcity of cell surface targets with high, cancer-specific expression to allow for efficient tumor eradication and low risk of off-tumor/on-target toxicity (Morgan R. A. et al., Mol. Ther. 18, 843-851 (2010); Lamers C. H. et al., Molecular therapy: the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy 21, 904-912 (2013); Richman S. A. et al., Cancer immunology research 6, 36-46 (2018)). We and others have recently reported cancer-associated expression of claudin (CLDN) 6, a tetraspanin membrane protein that is involved in tight junction formation (Turksen K. et al., Dev. Dyn. 222, 292-300 (2001)). To evaluate the suitability of CLDN6 as a target for CAR T-cell therapy we profiled its expression in a comprehensive set of tissues. In mice, CLDN6 has been reported to be developmentally regulated (Turksen K., Journal of cell science 117, 2435-2447 (2004)). By immunohistochemical (IHC) staining we found CLDN6 to be broadly expressed in fetal organs, but prenatally downregulated, resulting in lack of expression in most organs of adult mice (data not shown). In human, CLDN6 transcript levels were high in fetal tissues derived from stomach, pancreas, lung and kidney, but undetectable in the corresponding adult tissue samples (data not shown). In over 160 non-cancerous healthy human samples from more than 50 adult tissue types analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR, CLDN6 transcript expression was ruled out (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>). Concordantly, CLDN6 protein was not detectable in any of the &#x3e;40 tested adult human normal tissue types assessed by IHC staining (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>). In line with previous studies (Ushiku T. et al., Histopathology 61(6):1043-56 (2012); Micke P. et al., International journal of cancer 135, 2206-2214 (2014)), high CLDN6 transcript levels were frequent in various human solid cancers such as testicular, ovarian, uterine and lung adenocarcinoma (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>). IHC staining showed membrane expression of CLDN6 protein in these human cancers that was high and homogenous in many of the tested specimens (data not shown).</p><p id="p-0420" num="0412">These findings indicate exquisitely tight and complete silencing of CLDN6 in human, though not in mouse, and qualify CLDN6 as a strictly oncofetal cell surface antigen with an ideal expression profile for CAR T-cell targeting (June C. H., Science (New York, N.Y.). 359, 1361-1365 (2018)). We designed a 2<sup>nd </sup>generation CLDN6-CAR with a 4-1BB costimulatory domain. For the receptor domain we engineered a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) with exquisite specificity and high binding affinity to CLDN6 in the nanomolar range (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>).</p><p id="p-0421" num="0413">First, we characterized CLDN6-CAR-engineered human T cells in vitro. CLDN6<sup>neg </sup>COLO-699N lung carcinoma cells were transfected with escalated amounts of CLDN6 RNA and assessed for killing by CAR T cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref>). We observed highly sensitive recognition and lysis of CLDN6-transfected target cells by the CLDN6-CAR even at the lowest target expression level.</p><p id="p-0422" num="0414">In a similar experimental setting, we evaluated the CLDN6-CAR for cross-recognition of CLDN3, CLDN4 and CLDN9, the most closely related claudin family members, that in contrast to CLDN6 are expressed in toxicity-relevant normal tissues. The homology between the CAR-targeted first extracellular loop of CLDN6 and the corresponding amino acid sequences of these claudins is 81%, 85%, and 98%, respectively, bearing the risk of cross-reactivity and off-target toxicity of the CAR. Exclusively CLDN6-transfected target cells, but not those transfected with the related claudins, were killed demonstrating precise targeting by CLDN6-CAR T cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>E</figref>).</p><p id="p-0423" num="0415">To measure cognate immune activation we co-cultured CLDN6-CAR T cells with human tumor cell lines.

CLDN6-CAR T cells were able to efficiently clear CLDN6<sup>pos </sup>PA-1 ovarian carcinoma spheroids and to kill repetitively upon re-challenge (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>G</figref>). Deletion of CLDN6 by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genetic knock-out (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>G</figref> top) completely abrogated CAR T-cell recognition of PA-1, further confirming high potency and target-specificity of CLDN6-CAR T cells.</p><p id="p-0424" num="0416">Next, we studied in vivo anti-tumor activity of human CLDN6-CAR T cells in mice xenografted subcutaneously with human tumor cell lines. Of note, the binding affinity of CLDN6-CAR T cells to murine CLDN6 is 15-fold lower than to human CLDN6 and whereas human CLDN6 is strictly confined to the embryonic stage, murine CLND6 is expressed in some post-embryonic somatic tissues. NSG mice with large OV90 tumors (mean volume 168 mm<sup>3</sup>) underwent ACT with a single dose of human CLDN6-CAR T cells or control cells. Notably, all CLDN6-CAR T cell-treated mice experienced complete tumor regression within 2 weeks, while in the control group tumors progressed rapidly (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>H</figref>).

L. et al., Science translational medicine 7, 303ra139 (2015)). In hematological malignancies CAR T cells are directed against lineage antigens of B cells and encounter their targets on the host's normal and malignant B cells. These act as antigen-presenting cells (APCs) providing strong proliferation signals and promote persistence of CAR T cells (Kalos M. et al., Science translational medicine 3, 95ra73 (2011); Porter D. L. et al., Science translational medicine 7, 303ra139 (2015)).</p><p id="p-0426" num="0418">In contrast, the frequency of CAR T cells against solid tumors typically declines rapidly (Gargett T. et al., Molecular therapy: the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy 24, 1135-1149 (2016); Feng K. et al., Life sciences 59, 468-479 (2016); O'Rourke D. M. et al., Science translational medicine 9(399) (2017)) due to the impaired accessibility of tumor cells within solid lesions and the absence of proliferation signals when CAR T cells encounter their target in the context of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. We hypothesized that expression of the CAR target in its native conformation on the surface of professional APCs in lymphoid tissues would render it accessible for cognate CAR T-cell stimulation in an optimal immune-activating environment.</p><p id="p-0427" num="0419">Recently, we introduced intravenously administered liposomal antigen-encoding RNA (RNA-LPX) to stimulate tumor-associated T cells in the natural repertoire of cancer patients (Kranz L.

This nanoparticulate vaccine delivers antigen to APCs in the spleen, lymph nodes and bone marrow, and concomitantly initiates a Toll-like receptor-dependent type-I IFN-driven immune-stimulatory program, promoting priming and strong expansion of antigen specific T cells.</p><p id="p-0428" num="0420">To test whether this approach could be adapted to act as a CAR T-cell Amplifying RNA Vaccine (short, CARVac), we conducted a series of experiments.</p><p id="p-0429" num="0421">First, we tested, if CLDN6 can be natively displayed on dendritic cells (DCs) and does stimulate CLDN6-CAR T cells in vitro.

The resulting expression of CLDN6 on DCs induced stimulation, cytokine secretion and proliferation of co-cultured CLDN6-CAR T cells in a dose-dependent manner (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> upper panel). When BALB/c mice were injected intravenously (i.v.) with CLDN6-LPX, CLDN6 surface expression was detected on splenic DCs and macrophages, but not on lymphocytes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>) confirming in vivo delivery of the CAR antigen exclusively to APCs.

CLDN18.2 is expressed in various high-medical need tumors, such as gastro-esophageal and pancreatic cancers (Wall S. et al., International journal of cancer 134, 731-739 (2014); Rohde C. et al., Japanese journal of clinical oncology 49, 870-876 (2019); Sahin U. et al., Clin. Cancer Res. 14, 7624-7634 (2008)). Both in human and mice, its expression in normal tissues is restricted to tight junctions of differentiated cells of the gastric mucosa, in which it is shielded. Only upon cancer-associated perturbation of the tight junction architecture, the CLDN18.2 antibody binding epitope becomes exposed (Sahin U. et al., Clinical cancer research: an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research 14, 7624-7634 (2008)). We engineered a CLDN18.2-CAR by substituting the CLDN6-specific scFv with an anti-CLDN18.2 scFv which exhibits specific binding with similar affinity to both human and mouse CLDN18.2. CLDN18.2-CAR T cells were shown to exert similar functional features as observed for the CLDN6-CAR, including strictly antigen-specific activation and killing of tumor cells in vitro (data not shown), and complete rejection of advanced CLDN18.2<sup>pos </sup>tumors in vivo (data not shown). CLDN18.2-CAR T cells co-cultured with CLDN18.2-LPX treated DCs showed cognate activation and proliferation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, B lower panels).</p><p id="p-0432" num="0424">Next, we studied the in vivo performance of the CARVac concept in a series of mouse experiments.

In vivo bioluminescence imaging revealed that a single i.v. dose of CLDN6-LPX induced a profound expansion of circulating CLDN6-CAR T cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>). The expansion correlated with the RNA-LPX dose level and was substantial at even the lowest dose of 0.625 &#x3bc;g RNA-LPX. Quantitative and phenotypic analysis of peripheral blood T cells in treated animals confirmed increased frequencies of Thy1.1<sup>+</sup> CART cells exhibiting an activated phenotype (KLRG1<sup>hi</sup>, CD62L<sup>low</sup>), whereas endogenous T cells were not affected at any dose after RNA-LPX treatment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0433" num="0425">The CAR T-cell numbers peaked 3-4 days after RNA-LPX vaccination followed by a decline, mimicking the dynamics of a physiological response of antigen-specific T cells to stimulation, with an initial expansion and subsequent retraction phase (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>).</p><p id="p-0434" num="0426">In another experiment, groups of mice received different dose levels of CLDN6-CAR T cells, starting as low as 10<sup>3 </sup>cells/mouse, and were either left untreated or received a CLDN6-LPX regimen shortly after ACT.

Notably, in mice treated according to the CARVac concept, CAR T cells were expanded irrespective of the starting dose. Actually, CLDN6-LPX mediated expansion of only 10<sup>3 </sup>CAR T cells resulted in detectable frequencies in peripheral blood (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> right). Almost the entire adoptively transferred CAR T-cell population underwent activation and proliferation by RNA-LPX as indicated by transient upregulation of Ki67 on the majority of transferred T cells (data not shown). The RNA-LPX expanded CLDN6-CAR T cells were fully functional. As compared to CAR T cells isolated from unvaccinated mice, they produced higher levels of IFN&#x3b3; (data not shown) and exerted significantly higher and strictly antigen-dependent cytolytic activity upon ex vivo co-culture with CLDN6<sup>pos </sup>tumor cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref>).</p><p id="p-0435" num="0427">The low-dose CAR T-cell groups benefited more from repetitive RNA-LPX treatment as indicated by increased expansion.

The first CLDN6-LPX exposure rapidly amplified CAR T cells over two orders of magnitude, subsequent weekly treatment maintained CART cells at a high level resulting in a frequency of more than 15% of total peripheral blood lymphocytes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>E</figref> left, middle). In the longer CLDN6-LPX treatment pauses, the blood CAR T-cell frequency declined. CAR T-cell numbers did not drop to the baseline level of engraftment in unvaccinated animals, but stabilized at a ten-fold higher frequency. After each treatment-free interval CLDN6-CAR T cells could be robustly re-expanded by CLDN6-LPX, indicating memory formation of CAR T cells.

To explore the risk of CRS in conjunction with the CARVac concept, we analyzed IFN&#x3b3;, IL6 and TNF&#x3b1; serum concentrations in gently pre-conditioned CLDN6-CAR T cell-engrafted mice after exposure to CLDN6-LPX. Remarkably, except of an early mild and transient elevation of IFN&#x3b3;, no relevant inclines of pro-inflammatory cytokines were observed (data not shown) and treated mice were of normal appearance displaying regular weight gain over time (data not shown).</p><p id="p-0438" num="0430">As repeated application of RNA-LPX and strong expansion of cytotoxic T-cell effectors might bear the risk of depletion of APCs in the lymphoid tissues, we analyzed the spleens of treated mice as the organ with the highest RNA-LPX exposure. Spleens of mice exposed to single or repetitive doses of RNA-LPX did not display any pathological alterations in spleen architecture or in appearance of red and white pulp (data not shown). Flow cytometry of the cellular composition of spleen at different time points after repetitive RNA-LPX treatment showed mild and transient reductions of CD11c<sup>+</sup> DC and F4/80<sup>+</sup> macrophage populations and no quantitative changes in T-cell, B-cell and NK-cell populations (data not shown). No changes were noted in the cellular distribution of APC subsets in spleen tissue sections from corresponding time points (data not shown).</p><p id="p-0439" num="0431">Finally, we studied the impact of RNA-LPX on the therapeutic efficacy of CAR T cells in tumor bearing mice. Lymphodepleted C57BL/6 mice with large CLDN6<sup>pos </sup>LL/2-LLc1 Lewis lung tumors (mean tumor volume 209 mm<sup>3</sup>) underwent ACT with a sub-therapeutic dose of mouse CLDN6-CAR T cells followed by a single injection of CLDN6-LPX or control. Tumor control by CLDN6-CAR T cells alone was incomplete and tumor growth was only delayed. In contrast, mice receiving CART cells complemented with CLDN6-LPX application experienced complete rejection of large tumors, with a significantly higher median survival (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>). We reproduced these findings in BALB/c mice with CLDN18.2<sup>pos </sup>CT26 colon carcinomas (mean tumor volume 78 mm<sup>3</sup>) for CLDN18.2 CART cells in conjunction with a single administration of CLDN18.2-LPX, further supporting the applicability of improving the anti-tumor effect of CART cells with the CARVac concept (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0440" num="0432">For evaluation of the CARVac concept for human CAR T cells, we used the CLDN6<sup>pos </sup>OV90 xenograft tumor model in NSG mice. In pilot experiments, we confirmed that NSG mice are capable of splenic uptake of RNA (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>) and of promoting specific expansion of human CAR T cells upon repetitive RNA-LPX administration (data not shown). NSG mice bearing advanced CLDN6<sup>pos </sup>OV90 tumors received a sub-therapeutic dose of 1&#xd7;10<sup>5 </sup>CLDN6-CAR<sup>+</sup> T cells followed by repetitive CLDN6-LPX or control treatment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref>). The advanced tumors were completely rejected in CLDN6-LPX treated mice, while they rapidly progressed in the control group engrafted with the same CAR T-cell dose (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref>, left). Effective tumor control correlated with a high frequency of CAR T cells in the peripheral blood, proving their efficient in vivo expansion and improved persistence upon CLDN6-LPX vaccination (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref>, right). As with CLDN6-CAR T cells, these findings were reproduced for human CLDN18.2-CAR T cells in conjunction with CLDN18.2-LPX in a NSG mice xenograft model (data not shown).</p><p id="p-0441" num="0433">In summary, our study establishes two key findings.</p><p id="p-0442" num="0434">For one, our data support CLDN6 as an oncofetal cell surface antigen that is suitable for CAR T-cell targeting. In humans, the CLDN6 gene is strictly silenced in healthy adult tissues but aberrantly activated in various solid tumors of high medical need, resulting in expression of high protein levels. This, together with the feasibility of engineering a CLDN6-directed CAR of high sensitivity, precise specificity and strong potency against this surface molecule, proposes it as an ideal novel target for CAR T-cell therapy of solid cancers. Tumors without homogenous CLDN6 expression bear the risk of outgrowth of antigen loss variants. However, CLDN6 CAR T cells are strongly activated IFN&#x3b3;-secreting effectors and hence, their antitumor activity is thought to drive inflammatory remodeling of the suppressive tumor microenvironment and release of endogenous tumor antigens, which together shall promote antigen-spread and counteract the rapid outgrowth of antigen loss variants (Sampson J. H. et al., Clinical cancer research: an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research 20, 972-984 (2014)).</p><p id="p-0443" num="0435">Second, we present the CARVac concept as an approach to improve the anti-tumor efficacy of CAR T cells. The CAR antigen is displayed in its native conformation on the surface of APCs residing in lymphoid compartments, which is the ideal setting for co-stimulation and potent expansion of T cells. Of note, it is likely that the same APCs concurrently process and present CLDN6 on MHC molecules, which may result in priming and activation of endogenous CLDN6-specific T cells. Recently, different approaches have been explored for antigen-specific expansion of CAR T cells (Berger C. et al., Cancer immunology research 3, 206-216 (2015); Slaney C. Y. et al., Clinical cancer research: an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research 23, 2478-2490 (2017); Tanaka M. et al., Clinical cancer research: an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research 23, 3499-3509 (2017); Ma L. et al., Science (New York, N.Y.) 365, 162-168 (2019); Wang X. et al., Clinical cancer research: an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research 21, 2993-3002 (2015)). The CARVac approach presented here combines various distinctive features. One of the advantages of the CARVac format is that single-stranded RNA as a natural TLR-ligand combines delivery of the antigen and adjuvanticity in one molecule. Importantly, the approach does not require a re-engineering of the CAR scaffold or adaptation of T cell transduction protocols, nor depends on the cumbersome identification and characterization of peptide ligands as vaccine mimotopes. Nanoparticulate RNA-LPX is fast and inexpensive to produce for any protein-based antigen. A clinical grade manufacturing process is in place.</p><p id="p-0444" num="0436">In ongoing clinical trials the RNA-LPX vaccine platform is used for the purpose of induction of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses against a spectrum of different tumor antigens (NCT02410733, NCT02316457, NCT03815058) with early clinical data supporting the lymphoid targeting and execution of the intended mode-of-action in humans. With RNA a matched high-affinity vaccine can be generated right away and manufactured in GMP-grade for essentially any existing CAR including those directed against conformational epitopes, thus providing a truly universally applicable approach.</p><p id="p-0445" num="0437">Our data establish the feasibility and safety of single as well as repetitive administration of CARVac for tunable expansion of engineered T cells. RNA-LPX stimulated CAR T cells are superior over non-stimulated ones with regard to cytokine response and cytolytic activity upon antigen recognition. They form memory T cells and persist at higher frequencies. The CARVac approach not only improves the engraftment of transferred CAR T cells but also enables therapeutic tumor control at lower CAR T-cell doses (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>E</figref>).</p><p id="p-0446" num="0438">The expansion, retraction and re-stimulation kinetics of CAR T cells mediated by RNA-LPX mimic the physiological process T cells undergo upon antigen-specific priming and boosting. That the magnitude of CAR T-cell expansion depends on RNA-LPX dose, allows control of the levels of circulating CART cells, and titration of CAR T-cell frequencies within an optimal therapeutic window.</p><p id="p-0447" num="0439">In addition to lack of suitable targets and fast decline of CAR T cells in the circulation, other barriers for efficacy of CAR T cells in human solid cancer exist, including tumor antigen heterogeneity, impaired T-cell trafficking and extravasation to tumor sites, exhaustion and an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Accomplishing to maintain optimally stimulated CAR T cells within a therapeutic window may provide a good foundation for overcoming those constraints as well.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">Example 3: RNA-LPX Mediated Vaccination is Also Applicable for In Vivo Expansion and Enrichment of TCR-Modified T Cells</heading><p id="p-0448" num="0440">The clinical success of adoptively transferred tumor reactive T cell therapy has been also positively correlated with the persistence of those cells in vivo (Robbins et al. (2004) J Immunol. 173(12):7125-30, Huang et al. (2005) 28(3):258-67). Beside CAR T cells expansion, we analyzed whether in situ antigen exposure could also enhance the persistence of adoptively transferred TCR-modified T cells in vivo. Therefore, luciferase co-expressing OT1-TCR transduced murine T cells were adoptively transferred into mildly irritated (2.5 Gy) mice followed by repetitive administration of RNA-LPX encoding either or a control antigen. Expansion and enrichment of the OT1-TCR transduced T cell population were sequentially monitored by bioluminescence imaging (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>) and flow cytometry. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> B).</p><p id="p-0449" num="0441">OT1-TCR-modified T cells are able to expand in vivo after repetitive vaccination with liposomally formulated TCR antigen. OT1-TCR-modified T cells bioluminescence signals decreased over time in the control group while antigen specific restimulated OT1 TCR T cells bioluminescence signal enriched after every Oval-RNA-LPX treatment <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>. In accordance to bioluminescence data, flow cytometric analysis of GFP-expressing OT1-TCR T cells resulted in an enrichment of transferred OT1-TCR T cells (GFP acts as marker for transferred OT1-TCR expressing T cells) in peripheral blood during repetitive stimulation. In contrast to control-RNA-LPX treated group where the mean fluorescence of GFP-expressing cells in mice remained constant (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> B). These data demonstrate that RNA-LPX technology also supports adequate TCR-modified T cell activation by providing natural co-stimulation in situ, which can lead to similarly enrichment of TCR-modified T cells in vivo.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-sequence-list-doc id="SEQLST-1"><sequence-list file="US20230000962A1-20230105-S00001.XML" carriers="internal-electronic" seq-file-type="ST.25"/></us-sequence-list-doc><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00001" cdx-file="US20230000962A1-20230105-C00001.CDX" mol-file="US20230000962A1-20230105-C00001.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00002" cdx-file="US20230000962A1-20230105-C00002.CDX" mol-file="US20230000962A1-20230105-C00002.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00003" cdx-file="US20230000962A1-20230105-C00003.CDX" mol-file="US20230000962A1-20230105-C00003.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00004" cdx-file="US20230000962A1-20230105-C00004.CDX" mol-file="US20230000962A1-20230105-C00004.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00005" cdx-file="US20230000962A1-20230105-C00005.CDX" mol-file="US20230000962A1-20230105-C00005.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00006" cdx-file="US20230000962A1-20230105-C00006.CDX" mol-file="US20230000962A1-20230105-C00006.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00007" cdx-file="US20230000962A1-20230105-C00007.CDX" mol-file="US20230000962A1-20230105-C00007.MOL"/><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
