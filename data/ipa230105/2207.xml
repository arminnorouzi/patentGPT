More specifically, in the sterile filling system, first, a molded container is supplied to the sterile filling system. Next, an aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution, which serves as a sterilant, is sprayed onto the container in the sterile filling system. After that, the sterilant is dried so that the container is sterilized. Next, the container is aseptically filled with a content. There is also another method for filling a sterilized container with a sterilized content in a sterile environment. In the other method, a small amount of sterilant is applied dropwise to an inner surface of the container when the container is molded. Next, the mouth of the container is sealed, and the inner surface of the container is sterilized with vapor of the sterilant (hydrogen peroxide) that is vaporized. Then, the sterilized container is supplied to the sterile filling system. After that, the outer surface of the container is sterilized in the sterile filling system, and then the mouth is opened and the container is aseptically filled with a content.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">To produce a product by filling a container with a content and closing the container with a cap in the sterile filling system, it is necessary to sterilize the cap as well as the container. Patent Documents 1 to 5 describe examples of a cap sterilization device for sterilizing a cap.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, it may be difficult to reduce the size of the cap sterilization device according to the related art. When the size of the cap sterilization device is large, there is a possibility that the capital investment costs and the costs of chemical agents used for sterilization, thermal energy, or cleaning water will be increased. Therefore, it is desirable to reduce the size of the cap sterilization device.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">PRIOR ART REFERENCES</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Documents</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0005">Patent Document 1: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 6-293319</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0006">Patent Document 2: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2011-11811</li>    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0007">Patent Document 3: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2012-500759</li>    <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0008">Patent Document 4: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2017-214107</li>    <li id="ul0001-0005" num="0009">Patent Document 5: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2018-122927</li></ul></p><p id="p-0007" num="0010">The present disclosure has been made in consideration of the above-described circumstances, and an object of the present disclosure is to provide a cap sterilization device and a content filling system that can be reduced in size.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0011">A cap sterilization device according to an embodiment includes a sterilant spraying chamber in which a sterilant is sprayed onto a cap; and an air-rinsing chamber in which the cap onto which the sterilant has been sprayed in the sterilant spraying chamber is subjected to air-rinsing.

The bottles <b>30</b> may be produced by performing biaxial stretching blow molding on preforms formed by injection molding of a synthetic resin material. The material of the bottles <b>30</b> is preferably a thermoplastic resin, in particular, polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), or polyethylene naphthalate (PEN). The containers may each be composed of glass, a can, paper, a pouch, or a composite container thereof. In the present embodiment, it is assumed that the containers are bottles made of a synthetic resin.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0031">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the content filling system <b>10</b> includes a bottle supplying unit <b>21</b>, a bottle sterilization device <b>11</b>, an air-rinsing device <b>14</b>, a sterile-water-rinsing device <b>15</b>, a filling device (filler) <b>20</b>, and a cap attaching device (capper, a closing-and-capping machine) <b>16</b>, and a product bottle carry-out unit <b>22</b>.

The content is sterilized by being heated, for example, in advance and then cooled to a room temperature of 3&#xb0; C. or more and 40&#xb0; C. or less before being introduced into the bottles <b>30</b>. The content with which the bottles <b>30</b> are filled by the filling device <b>20</b> may be, for example, a beverage, such as a tea-based beverage or a milk-based beverage.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0038">The cap attaching device <b>16</b> closes the bottles <b>30</b> that have been filled with the content by the filling device <b>20</b> by attaching caps <b>33</b> to the mouths of the bottles <b>30</b>. The cap attaching device <b>16</b> closes the mouths of the bottles <b>30</b> with the caps <b>33</b> to seal the bottles <b>30</b> and prevent entrance of external air and microbes into the bottles <b>30</b>. The cap attaching device <b>16</b> attaches the caps <b>33</b> to the mouths of the bottles <b>30</b> filled with the content while rotating (revolving) the bottles <b>30</b>.

The caps <b>33</b> may be general bottle caps, but may also be composite bottle caps or sport bottle caps.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0049">The cap sterilization device <b>50</b> further includes a conveyance guide <b>70</b> along which the caps <b>33</b> that have passed the inspection are conveyed to the sterilant spraying chamber <b>52</b>. The conveyance guide <b>70</b> causes the caps <b>33</b> to be conveyed in a line. The conveyance guide <b>70</b> may include, for example, a plurality of rails. In such a case, a space small enough to prevent the caps <b>33</b> from falling is formed in a region surrounded by the rails, and the caps <b>33</b> are conveyed through this space. This conveyance guide <b>70</b> is inclined with respect to a horizontal plane HS so that the caps <b>33</b> are conveyed from the introduction chamber <b>51</b> toward the sterilant spraying chamber <b>52</b> by their own weight. Since the conveyance guide <b>70</b> is provided, the caps <b>33</b> can be conveyed from the cap inspection device <b>58</b> to the sterilant spraying chamber <b>52</b> at a high speed. The conveyance guide <b>70</b> is provided with a first stopper <b>71</b>, which is capable of being opened and closed, at a location inside the introduction chamber <b>51</b>. When the first stopper <b>71</b> is opened, the caps <b>33</b> are conveyed to a sterilant spraying wheel <b>74</b> described below.

In such a case, a space small enough to prevent the caps <b>33</b> from falling is formed in a region surrounded by the rails, and the caps <b>33</b> are conveyed through this space. The conveying chute <b>72</b> is provided with a second stopper <b>73</b> that is capable of being opened and closed. In the present embodiment, the second stopper <b>73</b> is provided on the conveying chute <b>72</b> at a location outside the cleaning chamber <b>54</b>. When the second stopper <b>73</b> is opened, the caps <b>33</b> are conveyed to the cap attaching device <b>16</b> along the conveying chute <b>72</b>. When the second stopper <b>73</b> is closed, the caps <b>33</b> accumulate at this position. The second stopper <b>73</b> is preferably positioned so that the conveying chute <b>72</b> is capable of accommodating all of the caps <b>33</b> in the introduction chamber <b>51</b>, the sterilant spraying chamber <b>52</b>, the air-rinsing chamber <b>53</b>, and the cleaning chamber <b>54</b> when the second stopper <b>73</b> is closed.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0051">The conveying chute <b>72</b> is inclined with respect to the horizontal plane HS. An inclination angle &#x3b1; by which the conveying chute <b>72</b> is inclined with respect to the horizontal plane HS is preferably 10&#xb0; or more and 90&#xb0; or less, and more preferably 20&#xb0; or more and 90&#xb0; or less. When the inclination angle &#x3b1; of the conveying chute <b>72</b> is 10&#xb0; or more, the caps <b>33</b> can be easily conveyed by their own weight. More specifically, even when the ability of the caps <b>33</b> to be conveyed by their own weight is reduced due to reduction in weight, if the inclination angle &#x3b1; of the conveying chute <b>72</b> is 10&#xb0; or more, the caps <b>33</b> can be conveyed by their own weight without using propulsion air or the like for conveying the caps <b>33</b> downstream. Therefore, energy can be saved. Since the caps <b>33</b> are conveyed along the conveying chute <b>72</b> after being sterilized, if propulsion air is used to convey the caps <b>33</b> downstream, the propulsion air needs to be sterile. In the present embodiment, the caps <b>33</b> can be conveyed by their own weight without using propulsion air or the like for conveying the caps <b>33</b> downstream. Therefore, the costs for sterilizing the caps <b>33</b> can be significantly reduced.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0052">The structures of the chambers <b>51</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>53</b>, and <b>54</b> will now be described in more detail.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0053">The introduction chamber <b>51</b> introduces the caps <b>33</b> received from the cap inspection device <b>58</b> into the sterilant spraying chamber <b>52</b>. The introduction chamber <b>51</b> is disposed on a side of the sterilant spraying chamber <b>52</b> and the air-rinsing chamber <b>53</b>. A first hot air supplier <b>80</b><i>a </i>supplies sterile hot air to the introduction chamber <b>51</b>. The sterile hot air supplied from the first hot air supplier <b>80</b><i>a </i>is blown against the caps <b>33</b> conveyed by the conveyance guide <b>70</b>. In this case, the sterile hot air is blown against the caps <b>33</b> from the upstream side toward the downstream side in the conveying direction of the caps <b>33</b>. When the sterile hot air is blown against the caps <b>33</b> from the upstream side toward the downstream side in the conveying direction of the caps <b>33</b>, the conveyance of the caps <b>33</b> can be improved. Therefore, the caps <b>33</b> can be reliably conveyed downstream. The temperature of the sterile hot air is, for example, 40&#xb0; C. or more and 170&#xb0; C. or less. Accordingly, the temperature in the introduction chamber <b>51</b> is maintained at, for example, 30&#xb0; C. or more and 80&#xb0; C. or less. Therefore, condensation of the sterilant in the introduction chamber <b>51</b> is suppressed, and variations in the level of sterilization between the caps <b>33</b> due to the sterilant remaining on the caps <b>33</b> in the form of liquid can be prevented.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0054">An exhaust pipe <b>51</b>A is connected to the introduction chamber <b>51</b>.

The exhaust pipe <b>51</b>A is connected to a blower (not illustrated) that sucks gas from the exhaust pipe <b>51</b>A. A scrubber (not illustrated) that processes a sterilant component in the gas is connected to the blower. The pressure in the introduction chamber <b>51</b> is maintained at a positive pressure (for example, 0 Pa or more and 200 Pa or less. As a result, the sterilant is prevented from flowing excessively into the introduction chamber <b>51</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0055">In the sterilant spraying chamber <b>52</b>, the sterilant is sprayed toward the caps <b>33</b> supplied by the conveyance guide <b>70</b>.

The pressure in the sterilant spraying chamber <b>52</b> is maintained at a positive pressure (for example, &#x2212;20 Pa or more and 50 Pa or less). Accordingly, the sterilant is prevented from flowing excessively out of the sterilant spraying chamber <b>52</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0056">The sterilant spraying chamber <b>52</b> has a bottom surface that is inclined with respect to a horizontal plane. More specifically, the bottom surface of the sterilant spraying chamber <b>52</b> is inclined downward toward the introduction chamber <b>51</b>. A drain pipe <b>52</b>A is connected to the bottom surface of the sterilant spraying chamber <b>52</b>. Accordingly, liquid droplets generated in the sterilant spraying chamber <b>52</b> due to, for example, condensation and waste liquid can be discharged to the outside of the sterilant spraying chamber <b>52</b> through the drain pipe <b>52</b>A. The drain pipe <b>52</b>A is curved in an S-shape at an intermediate position thereof, and the waste liquid (sterilant (aqueous hydrogen peroxide, peracetic acid)) is accumulated in the S-shaped portion. Thus, a water seal mechanism is provided to separate a sterile area and a non-sterile area from each other. The liquid that constitutes the water seal mechanism may be sterile water. Alternatively, the water seal mechanism may be omitted, and the drain pipe <b>52</b>A may be provided with a valve that separates the sterile area and the non-sterile area from each other.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0057">The sterilant spraying wheel <b>74</b>, which conveys the caps <b>33</b> while rotating the caps <b>33</b>, is disposed in the sterilant spraying chamber <b>52</b>.

The sterilant spraying wheel <b>74</b> includes a star wheel (not illustrated) positioned at the center and a plurality of rails (not illustrated) disposed around the star wheel. The star wheel has cuts (not illustrated) for receiving the caps <b>33</b>. Each of the rails serves to prevent the caps <b>33</b> from falling. The caps <b>33</b> are conveyed when the star wheel is driven, and are rotated (revolved) while being guided by the rails.

In this case, the width of the air-rinsing chamber <b>53</b> may be about twice the diameter of the air-rinsing wheel <b>75</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0072">Sterile hot air is blown against the inner and outer surfaces of the caps <b>33</b> while the caps <b>33</b> are successively conveyed by the air-rinsing wheels <b>75</b> in the air-rinsing chamber <b>53</b>. The sterile hot air is introduced into the air-rinsing chamber <b>53</b> from second hot air suppliers <b>80</b><i>b</i>. In this case, the sterile hot air is blown against the caps <b>33</b> that pass through the air-rinsing wheels <b>75</b>. In the present embodiment, each of the second to fifth air-rinsing wheels <b>75</b><i>b </i>to <b>75</b><i>e </i>is provided with one second hot air supplier <b>80</b><i>b</i>. Thus, the second hot air suppliers <b>80</b><i>b </i>are configured to blow the sterile hot air against the caps <b>33</b> conveyed by the second to fifth air-rinsing wheels <b>75</b><i>b </i>to <b>75</b><i>e</i>. The sterile hot air is not blown against the caps <b>33</b> conveyed by the first air-rinsing wheel <b>75</b><i>a</i>. The high-concentration sterilant (aqueous hydrogen peroxide) that has adhered to the caps <b>33</b> by condensation is retained on the caps <b>33</b> for a certain time on the first air-rinsing wheel <b>75</b><i>a</i>. Thus, the effect of sterilization by the sterilant can be increased. A retention time for which the sterilant that has adhered to the caps <b>33</b> by condensation is retained on the caps <b>33</b> is preferably 0.5 seconds or more and 5 seconds or less. When the retention time is 0.5 seconds or more, the effect of sterilization by the sterilant can be effectively increased. When the retention time is 5 seconds or less, an increase in the size of the first air-rinsing wheel <b>75</b><i>a </i>can be suppressed. Accordingly, an increase in the size of the air-rinsing chamber <b>53</b> and the cap sterilization device <b>50</b> can be suppressed. In addition, when the retention time is 5 seconds or less, a conveyance time for which the caps <b>33</b> are conveyed in the air-rinsing chamber <b>53</b> can be reduced. Therefore, a sterilization time for sterilizing the caps <b>33</b> in the cap sterilization device <b>50</b> can be reduced. The sterile hot air may also be blown against the caps <b>33</b> conveyed by the first air-rinsing wheel <b>75</b><i>a</i>. Also in such a case, the high-concentration sterilant (aqueous hydrogen peroxide) that has adhered to the caps <b>33</b> by condensation is retained on the caps <b>33</b> for a certain time in a section from the sterilant spraying devices <b>81</b>A and/or <b>81</b>B to the position at which air-rinsing is started. Thus, the effect of sterilization by the sterilant can be increased.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0073">The temperature of the sterile hot air is, for example, 80&#xb0; C. or more and 170&#xb0; C. or less, preferably 90&#xb0; C. or more and 120&#xb0; C. or less. The flow rate of the sterile hot air is, for example, 5 m<sup>3</sup>/min or more and 20 m<sup>3</sup>/min or less. The time for which the sterile hot air is blown is 1 second or more and 20 seconds or less, preferably 3 seconds or more and 14 seconds or less. When the sterile hot air is blown against the caps <b>33</b>, the temperature of the caps <b>33</b> is increased to 40&#xb0; C. or more, preferably 50&#xb0; C. or more. Thus, the sterilant that has adhered to the caps <b>33</b> is removed. The sterile hot air may contain a small amount of sterilant component, such as hydrogen peroxide.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0074">A pipe <b>84</b> is provided to extend along the second to fifth air-rinsing wheels <b>75</b><i>b </i>to <b>75</b><i>e</i>. The sterile hot air is supplied to the pipe <b>84</b>. The pipe <b>84</b> is disposed to face the caps <b>33</b> that are conveyed. In the present embodiment, the pipe <b>84</b> meanders in the direction of movement of the caps <b>33</b> in front view. The caps <b>33</b> move through the pipe <b>84</b> while the sterile hot air is blown thereagainst.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0075">In the cleaning chamber <b>54</b>, the caps <b>33</b> that have been subjected to air-rinsing in the air-rinsing chamber <b>53</b> are cleaned. The cleaning chamber <b>54</b> is disposed above the protruding portion <b>53</b><i>a </i>of the air-rinsing chamber <b>53</b>. Accordingly, the size of the cap sterilization device <b>50</b> can be reduced. The caps <b>33</b> are conveyed along the conveying chute <b>72</b> in the cleaning chamber <b>54</b>. While the caps <b>33</b> are being conveyed, first, a cleaning nozzle <b>85</b> sprays sterile water against the inner and outer surfaces of the caps <b>33</b>. Accordingly, even when foreign matter has adhered to the caps <b>33</b>, the foreign matter can be reliably removed. In addition, the caps <b>33</b> that have been heated by the sterile hot air can be cooled. Next, an air blow nozzle <b>86</b> blows sterile air against the inner and outer surfaces of the caps <b>33</b> to remove the sterile water. Even after the sterile air is blown against the caps <b>33</b>, a small amount of sterile water remains on the caps <b>33</b>. Accordingly, while the caps <b>33</b> are being conveyed along the conveying chute <b>72</b>, appropriate lubrication is provided between the caps <b>33</b> and the conveying chute <b>72</b> to suppress an increase in the temperature of the caps <b>33</b> due to heat of friction between the conveying chute <b>72</b> and the caps <b>33</b>. Since an increase in the temperature of the caps <b>33</b> is suppressed, the caps <b>33</b> can be reliably attached by the cap attaching device <b>16</b>. The pressure in the cleaning chamber <b>54</b> is maintained at a positive pressure (for example, 5 Pa or more and 200 Pa or less). The pressure in the cleaning chamber <b>54</b> is lower than the pressure in a chamber (not illustrated) of the cap attaching device <b>16</b>. Accordingly, the atmosphere including the sterilant is prevented from flowing out toward the cap attaching device <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0076">The cleaning chamber <b>54</b> has a bottom surface that is inclined with respect to a horizontal plane. More specifically, the bottom surface of the cleaning chamber <b>54</b> is inclined downward in the direction in which the protruding portion <b>53</b><i>a </i>projects (leftward in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). A drain pipe <b>54</b>A is connected to the bottom surface of the cleaning chamber <b>54</b>. Accordingly, liquid droplets generated in the cleaning chamber <b>54</b> can be discharged to the outside of the cleaning chamber <b>54</b> through the drain pipe <b>54</b>A. The drain pipe <b>54</b>A is curved in an S-shape at an intermediate position thereof, and waste liquid (sterile water) is accumulated in the S-shaped portion. Thus, a water seal mechanism is provided to separate a sterile area and a non-sterile area from each other. Alternatively, the water seal mechanism may be omitted, and the drain pipe <b>54</b>A may be provided with a valve that separates the sterile area and the non-sterile area from each other. In the present embodiment, it is not necessary that the cleaning chamber <b>54</b> be provided. The caps <b>33</b> may be cleaned on the conveying chute <b>72</b> in a region outside the chambers <b>53</b> and <b>54</b> of the cap sterilization device <b>50</b>. This is appropriate because droplets of the sterile water do not adhere to the air-rinsing wheels <b>75</b>, and the interior the air-rinsing chamber <b>53</b> can be maintained in a dry state.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0077">The cap attaching device <b>16</b> is disposed downstream of the conveying chute <b>72</b> of the cap sterilization device <b>50</b>. To convey the caps <b>33</b> to the cap attaching device <b>16</b> along the conveying chute <b>72</b>, the inclination angle &#x3b1; of the conveying chute <b>72</b> with respect to the horizontal plane HS is preferably greater than or equal to a predetermined value. To increase the inclination angle &#x3b1; of the conveying chute <b>72</b> with respect to the horizontal plane HS, the height of the air-rinsing wheel <b>75</b> to which the conveying chute <b>72</b> is connected (fifth air-rinsing wheel <b>75</b><i>e</i>) needs to be increased.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0078">In the present embodiment, the air-rinsing chamber <b>53</b> is disposed vertically above the sterilant spraying chamber <b>52</b>. Therefore, the height of the air-rinsing wheel <b>75</b> to which the conveying chute <b>72</b> is connected can be increased. Accordingly, the inclination angle &#x3b1; of the conveying chute <b>72</b> with respect to the horizontal plane HS can be increased. As a result, the size of the cap sterilization device <b>50</b> and the content filling system <b>10</b> can be reduced while reduction in the conveyance of the caps <b>33</b> along the conveying chute <b>72</b> is suppressed. In addition, since the inclination angle &#x3b1; of the conveying chute <b>72</b> with respect to the horizontal plane HS can be increased, the caps <b>33</b> can be conveyed by their own weight without using propulsion air (sterile air) for conveying the caps <b>33</b> downstream. Therefore, the costs for sterilizing the caps <b>33</b> can be significantly reduced.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0079">Throughout the cap sterilization device <b>50</b>, the conveyance rate of the caps <b>33</b> is 100 cpm or more and 1500 cpm or less, preferably 500 cpm or more and 1000 cpm or less. According to the cap sterilization device <b>50</b> of the present embodiment, the caps <b>33</b> can be reliably sterilized even when the caps <b>33</b> are conveyed at such a high rate. Here, cpm (caps per minute) is the number of caps <b>33</b> that passes a certain position in one minute. When a filling rate at which each bottle <b>30</b> is filled is low, such as when the bottles <b>30</b> are large (with an inner capacity of 1 L of more), the conveyance rate of the caps <b>33</b> can be reduced from the above-described rate in accordance with the filling rate. In such a case, conditions (temperature, flow rate, etc.) under which the hot air is supplied to the introduction chamber <b>51</b> and the air-rinsing chamber <b>53</b> may be adjusted to prevent an increase in the temperature of the caps <b>33</b>.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">(Content Filling Method)</heading><p id="p-0077" num="0080">A content filling method using the above-described content filling system <b>10</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) will now be described.

Next, the bottles <b>30</b> are conveyed to the sterile-water-rinsing device <b>15</b> by another one of the conveying wheels <b>12</b>. The sterile-water-rinsing device <b>15</b> performs cleaning using sterile water at 15&#xb0; C. or more and 85&#xb0; C. or less. More specifically, the sterile water at 15&#xb0; C. or more and 85&#xb0; C. or less is introduced into the bottles <b>30</b> at a flow rate of 5 L/min or more and 15 L/min or less. At this time, preferably, the bottles <b>30</b> are inverted, and the sterile water is introduced into the bottles <b>30</b> from the mouths that face downward. The sterile water flows out of the bottles <b>30</b> through the mouths.

Therefore, the number of cleaning nozzles (not illustrated) provided inside and/or outside the cover <b>83</b> to clean the cover <b>83</b> and other components can be reduced. When the number of cleaning nozzles in the sterilant spraying chamber <b>52</b> is reduced as described above, the risk that the beverage, for example, will enter the cleaning nozzles or spaces between the cleaning nozzles and other devices can be reduced. Therefore, for example, the sterilant spraying chamber <b>52</b> can be easily cleaned when the type of the beverage to be filled is changed. As a result, the cleanability of the sterilant spraying chamber <b>52</b> can be significantly increased. When the number of cleaning nozzles disposed in the cover <b>83</b> is reduced, the cap sterilization device <b>50</b> can be simplified, and the cost thereof can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0107">In the above-described modification, the partition wall <b>63</b> has the openings <b>63</b><i>a </i>through which the air-rinsing chamber <b>53</b> and the sterilant spraying chamber <b>52</b> communicate with each other, and the drain pipe <b>53</b>A is not connected to the bottom surface of the air-rinsing chamber <b>53</b>. However, the configuration is not limited to this. For example, although not illustrated, a drain pipe may be connected to the bottom surface of the air-rinsing chamber <b>53</b>, and the liquid present in the air-rinsing chamber <b>53</b> may be supplied to the sterilant spraying chamber <b>52</b> through the drain pipe.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0108"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a schematic front view (view corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) of a cap sterilization device <b>50</b> according to a modification (second modification) of the present embodiment. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, unlike the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>6</b></figref>, a total of three air-rinsing wheels <b>75</b> are provided in the air-rinsing chamber <b>53</b>. More specifically, a first air-rinsing wheel <b>75</b><i>a</i>, which receives the caps <b>33</b> from the sterilant spraying wheel <b>74</b>, and second and third air-rinsing wheels <b>75</b><i>b </i>and <b>75</b><i>c</i>, which are disposed downstream of the first air-rinsing wheel <b>75</b><i>a</i>, are provided in the air-rinsing chamber <b>53</b>. In addition, the conveying chute <b>72</b> is connected to the third air-rinsing wheel <b>75</b><i>c. </i></p><p id="p-0106" num="0109">In this modification, the size of the third air-rinsing wheel <b>75</b><i>c </i>is greater than the size of the first air-rinsing wheel <b>75</b><i>a </i>and the second air-rinsing wheel <b>75</b><i>b</i>. The first air-rinsing wheel <b>75</b><i>a </i>and the second air-rinsing wheel <b>75</b><i>b </i>have the same size. However, the first air-rinsing wheel <b>75</b><i>a </i>and the second air-rinsing wheel <b>75</b><i>b </i>are not limited to this. For example, the size of the second air-rinsing wheel <b>75</b><i>b </i>may be greater than the size of the first air-rinsing wheel <b>75</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0107" num="0110">According to this modification, the size of the third air-rinsing wheel <b>75</b><i>c </i>is greater than the size of the first air-rinsing wheel <b>75</b><i>a </i>and the second air-rinsing wheel <b>75</b><i>b</i>. Accordingly, the height of the third air-rinsing wheel <b>75</b><i>c </i>to which the above-described conveying chute <b>72</b> is connected can be easily increased. Therefore, the inclination angle &#x3b1; of the conveying chute <b>72</b> with respect to the horizontal plane HS can be more easily increased. In addition, since the number of air-rinsing wheels <b>75</b> can be reduced, the size of the cap sterilization device <b>50</b> can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0111"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a schematic front view (view corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) of a cap sterilization device <b>50</b> according to a modification (third modification) of the present embodiment. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, unlike the second modification illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the cap sterilization device <b>50</b> is disposed vertically above the cap attaching device <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0112">As described above, in the present embodiment, the rotation center axes La to Le of the air-rinsing wheels <b>75</b><i>a </i>to <b>75</b><i>e </i>are arranged in a staggered pattern in front view. Therefore, the width (dimension in the left-right direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) of the air-rinsing chamber <b>53</b> can be reduced, and the size of the cap sterilization device <b>50</b> can also be reduced. Accordingly, as in this modification, the cap sterilization device <b>50</b> can be disposed vertically above the cap attaching device <b>16</b>. When the cap sterilization device <b>50</b> is disposed vertically above the cap attaching device <b>16</b>, the inclination angle &#x3b1; of the conveying chute <b>72</b> with respect to the horizontal plane HS can be further increased. In addition, for example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, a portion of the conveying chute <b>72</b> can be easily disposed to extend in a direction perpendicular to the horizontal plane HS. In this case, the caps <b>33</b> can be conveyed in a direction perpendicular to the horizontal plane HS. Therefore, the caps <b>33</b> can be reliably conveyed by their own weight without using propulsion air (sterile air) or the like for conveying the caps <b>33</b> downstream.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0113">The components of the above-described embodiment and modifications may be applied in combination with each other as necessary.
