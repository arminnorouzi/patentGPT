id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to methods and systems for indoor location.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">With the fast growth of ubiquitous computing, the rapid advances in mobile devices, and the availability of wireless communication, wireless indoor positioning systems have become very popular in recent years. However, the indoor location market has been slow to grow due to existing limitations with smartphone and WiFi infrastructure resulting in a need for highly customized solutions and professional services engagements. Current indoor location techniques are cost-prohibitive and the results often do not meet the location fidelity required to be useful. In addition, current indoor techniques are incapable of delivering services reliably and accurately, such as navigation, just-in-time messaging, and on-demand services. Accurate indoor location is especially required when delivering Enhanced 911 services (E911) mandated by governments for network providers to support the identification of a person's location indoors at the time a 911 call is placed. Generally, E911 services employ some form of radiolocation from the cellular network and location coordinates based on a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver built into the mobile device itself to determine the location of a mobile device. However, these two techniques do not function well indoors, and therefore the E911 location reported to emergency responders is only accurate to a point. For example, in the United States, nationwide service providers must achieve 50-meter horizontal location accuracy or provide a dispatchable location for 70 percent of all wireless 911 calls by the year 2021. Accordingly, the E911 location generally comprises an address and perhaps a general description of the mobile device's location. Also, if a call is dropped before the location details are provided, emergency response teams are effectively blind, particularly in large public spaces like a shopping mall, real estate tower, or museum.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Radio frequency (RF) fingerprinting-based techniques for localization are a promising approach for ubiquitous positioning systems, particularly indoors. However, the accuracy and stability of WiFi-based localization is a major barrier to the growth of the indoor location market beyond basic analytics and occupancy trend analysis. For example, some major corporations have made significant investments in both their tech and on-campus services to support employees with accessibility needs, however wayfinding continues to elude them because accuracy within feet, not metres, has been a non-starter to-date.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In other implementations, location fingerprinting is used, and entails representing a single floorplan into a 2D grid and having a person visit each grid cell and record the absolute signal strengths from all anchor devices in that grid to obtain cell fingerprints. However, this method is not only time-consuming, costly and inefficient, but it is also not accurate, and therefore cannot be relied upon. However, absolute signal strengths are unstable since signal strength is impacted by various factors, such as distance, obstacles, or placing a mobile device in one's pocket, etc. As a result, absolute strengths are not a reliable predictor of distance e.g. placing a mobile device one's pocket has the equivalent effect of placing the mobile device at a distance farther away from the anchor device, and so that act can severely distort the true distance of the mobile device from an anchor device. Furthermore, each cell's fingerprinting becomes less reliable as time progresses, because environmental changes greatly influence electromagnetic wave propagation through the space, such as the number of people, temperature, humidity, furniture, other electronic devices, etc.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to support use cases that require higher accuracy and stability of location data, specialized sensors such as optical occupancy sensors would need to be deployed. This has tremendous impact on cost, as these sensors require far higher density and additional infrastructure. As cost and accuracy are key purchase decision factors for customers across commercial real estate, retail food services and corporate office space, the return on investment in current indoor location solutions is difficult for most buyers to rationalize because of the limited use case available with lower cost, WiFi-based solution.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is an object of the present disclosure to mitigate or obviate at least one of the above-mentioned disadvantages.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one of its aspects, there is provided a computer-implemented method for precision hyperbolic location fingerprinting, the method comprising, at a computing system, the steps of:</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">(a) receiving measured RSSI values associated with a plurality of fixedly- positioned sensor devices, wherein the plurality of fixedly-positioned sensor devices are stationary in known locations in a 2D environment and caused to transit radio signals to each other and measure characteristics of the received radio signals;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">(b) generating a raw RSSI fingerprint for each sensor device based on the measured RSSI values;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">(c) generating a log-ratio RSSI fingerprint between a pair of sensor devices;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">(d) normalizing the raw RSSI fingerprint and normalizing the log-ratio RSSI fingerprint;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">(e) combining the raw RSSI fingerprint and the log-ratio RSSI fingerprint to form a fusion RSSI fingerprint;

and enables support for use cases requiring higher accuracy and stability (such as wayfinding or real-time desk occupancy) using WiFi sensors that are associated with lower costs and have far wider coverage. By finding unique fingerprints of RF signals received at different locations within a predefined area beforehand, whenever a similar fingerprint is subsequently seen again, the localization system is able to infer a user's current location.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0030">In addition, precision hyperbolic location fingerprinting (HLF) exploits already existing public infrastructure, which results in advantages such as cost efficiency, operational practicability, and pervasive availability. For example, these methods are applicable to commercial WiFi access points to enable high accuracy localization at scale. Another benefit of accurate HLF is the ability to provide indoor wayfinding and/or navigation, not just to help people find their way around a building, but to support people with accessibility needs.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0031">The HLF techniques employ algorithm that enable a ratio-based localization, rather than absolute signal strengths, which overcome stability issues related to client signal strength variations inherent to localization strategies based on absolute signal strength, such as in prior art trilateration methods. Accordingly, distance can be reasonably inferred using signal strength ratios rather than absolute signal strength measurements. Using the measured signal characteristics associated with the sensor devices, cell fingerprints can be predicted, thus eliminating the onerous requirement of a manual site survey to establish required cell fingerprints. The overall accuracy of the location prediction is improved through dynamic and near real time re-calibration of the cell fingerprints to accommodate changing electromagnetic conditions that influence wave propagation through an indoor space.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a top-level component architecture diagram of a system for implementing precision hyperbolic location fingerprinting;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a flowchart outlining exemplary steps for implementing precision hyperbolic location fingerprinting; and</p><p id="p-0029" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows an exemplary computing system for executing estimation methods for precision hyperbolic location fingerprinting.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0030" num="0035">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> there is shown a top-level component architecture diagram of a system for implementing precision hyperbolic location fingerprinting (HLF) for cell-based localization, i.e. locations are represented as cells, as shown generally by reference numeral <b>10</b>. Sensor devices <b>14</b><i>n</i>, such as sensor devices <b>14</b><i>a </i>(K), <b>14</b><i>b </i>(L), <b>14</b><i>c </i>(M), and <b>14</b><i>d </i>(N) are fixedly-positioned in known locations in an environment, such that sensor devices <b>14</b><i>n </i>are stationary, and are associated with fixed geo-coordinates that remain unchanged with time. As an example, the environment may be a building floor, and so the floor plan may be converted into a grid represented by area A (2D), and the locations of sensor devices <b>14</b><i>n </i>are indicated on the grid. The predictive HLF method surveys an area (A) <b>12</b> by predicting cell fingerprints using control signals sent/received by a plurality of sensor devices <b>14</b><i>a </i>(K), <b>14</b><i>b </i>(L), <b>14</b><i>c </i>(M), and <b>14</b><i>d </i>(N), in a sensor network <b>16</b>, positioned within an environment, such as, area <b>12</b>, rather than using prior art methods which entail physically surveying the space. For indoor spaces, a cell may correspond to a room or a part of it, or a section of a hallway. Accordingly, area A comprises a finite set of cells {a<sub>1</sub>, . . . , a<sub>n</sub>} covered by the sensor network <b>16</b> system. Sensor devices <b>14</b><i>n </i>survey area A and collect samples comprising a set of same-time same-place observations, one for each sensor device <b>14</b><i>n</i>, and a set of samples collected within the same cell form a fingerprint. System <b>10</b> estimates positions by recognizing position-related patterns in measurements, and encodes patterns in a radio map based on the fingerprints, and the radio map contains a mapping for each encoded pattern to a position.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0036">Accordingly, each sensor device <b>14</b><i>n </i>transmits control signals to other sensors <b>14</b><i>n</i>, and via network <b>18</b> to server computer <b>20</b>, such that server computer <b>20</b> receives the individual control signals from each of sensor devices <b>14</b><i>a </i>(K), <b>14</b><i>b </i>(L), <b>14</b><i>c </i>(M), and <b>14</b><i>d </i>(N), and server computer <b>20</b> predict values within the remaining unknown cells using estimations methods. For example, the estimation method used for predicting locations from a radio map and currently measured network characteristics is deterministic i.e. estimate location by considering measurements only by their value. Accordingly, a model may be built using a classification method based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) or any other machine learning (ML) algorithms for fingerprint-based indoor localization, based on the signal strength received from sensor devices <b>14</b><i>n</i>. These predictions are refreshed periodically at predetermined intervals e.g. every 5s, to accommodate for changes in the 3-D spatial volume <b>12</b> and maintain accuracy. System <b>10</b> thus provides a simpler deployment strategy and a more relevant fingerprint over the long term. Additionally, the techniques are applicable to a 3D grid, leveraging the availability of sensor network <b>16</b> across multiple floors in a building.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows flowchart <b>100</b> outlining exemplary steps for implementing stable and accurate indoor localization based on predictive hyperbolic location fingerprinting. In step <b>102</b>, devices <b>14</b><i>n </i>are fixedly-positioned in known locations in an environment, such that sensor devices <b>14</b><i>n </i>are stationary. As an example, the environment may be a building floor, and so the floor plan may be converted into a grid represented by area A, and the locations of sensor devices <b>14</b><i>n </i>are indicated on the grid. Next, sensor device <b>14</b><i>a </i>is caused to transmit radio signals which are received by sensor device <b>14</b><i>b </i>(L), and in turn, sensor device <b>14</b><i>b </i>transmits radio signals which are received by sensor device <b>14</b><i>a </i>(K), step <b>104</b>. Depending on the environment of 3D-spatial volume <b>12</b>, the radio waves between sensor device <b>14</b><i>a </i>(K) and sensor device <b>14</b><i>b </i>(L) propagate in a very different manner in the near-field and in the far-field. The Friis transmission equation characterises the receiver at sensor device <b>14</b><i>b </i>(L) and transmitter at sensor device <b>14</b><i>a </i>(K) theoretical power-distance relationship, assuming a certain receive and transmit antenna gain, as well as a certain separation between these antennas, as the following:</p><p id="p-0033" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mfrac>   <msub>    <mi>P</mi>    <mi>r</mi>   </msub>   <msub>    <mi>P</mi>    <mi>t</mi>   </msub>  </mfrac>  <mo>=</mo>  <mrow>   <msub>    <mi>G</mi>    <mi>t</mi>   </msub>   <mo>&#x2062;</mo>   <msup>    <mrow>     <msub>      <mi>G</mi>      <mi>r</mi>     </msub>     <mo>(</mo>     <mfrac>      <mi>&#x3bb;</mi>      <mrow>       <mn>4</mn>       <mo>&#x2062;</mo>       <mi>&#x3c0;</mi>       <mo>&#x2062;</mo>       <mi>R</mi>      </mrow>     </mfrac>     <mo>)</mo>    </mrow>    <mn>2</mn>   </msup>  </mrow> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0034" num="0000">where Pr is the power at the receiving antenna; Pt is the output power of transmitting antenna; Gt and Gr represent the gain of the transmitting antenna and receiving antenna, respectively and &#x3bb; is the wavelength, while R is the distance between the antennas. Accordingly, to derive a valid equation of sensor device <b>14</b><i>a </i>(K), <b>14</b><i>b </i>(L), the technical details of the radios, such as transmission power, transmit antenna gain, receiving antenna gain etc. would be required. However, even if the radio modules from the same manufacturer, deriving those values is challenging, time consuming and can not be performed in near-real time. Therefore, in one implementation a Friis equation for each sensor device <b>14</b><i>n </i>is generated dynamically without requiring the technical details of each of the radios associated with sensor device <b>14</b><i>a </i>(K) or <b>14</b><i>b </i>(L). Using simple regression, a simplified version of the Friis equation is generated:</p><p id="p-0035" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>L=&#x2212;</i>10nlog(<i>d</i>)+<i>A </i><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0036" num="0000">where A is the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) value at a 1-metre distance; n is the path-loss exponent; d is the distance in metres; and L is the distance between the transmitting device e.g. sensor device <b>14</b><i>a </i>(K) and receiving device, e.g. sensor device <b>14</b><i>b </i>(L), in metres.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0038">The RSSI value is measured at each sensor device <b>14</b><i>n</i>, and transmitted to server computer <b>20</b> for storage in fingerprint database <b>22</b>, such that each RSSI measurement is associated with each sensor device <b>14</b><i>n </i>an cell identity (a<sub>1 </sub>. . . a<sub>n</sub>).

In order to improve fingerprint prediction in an area, a new anchor <b>14</b><i>n </i>is deployed in the area, and configured to be part of the sensor network <b>16</b>, and each <b>14</b><i>a </i>(K), <b>14</b><i>b </i>(L), <b>14</b><i>c </i>(M), or <b>14</b><i>d </i>(N) starts pairing with the newly added anchor device <b>14</b><i>n </i>and starts calibrating automatically, step <b>108</b>. For each cell a<sub>1 </sub>. . . a<sub>n</sub>, the fingerprint is predicted based on the path loss formulas generated in the previous step <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0041">In prior art methods WiFi RSSI fingerprints are collected manually by walking around an indoor space and creating a database of fingerprint paired with their location ground truth. Even after manual fingerprint collection, the biggest challenge is the fact that fingerprint gets stale over time. In contrast, in this exemplary implementation, RSSI fingerprints are automatically predicted based on the formulas generated in step <b>106</b>, without any manual means or human intervention. In step, <b>110</b>, these predictions are refreshed periodically at predetermined intervals e.g. every 5 s, to accommodate for changes in the 3-D spatial volume <b>12</b> and thus maintain accuracy and currency of the fingerprints.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0042">Generally, raw RSSI fingerprints yield reasonably satisfactory results in line-of-sight scenarios between anchors devices <b>14</b><i>a </i>(K), <b>14</b><i>b </i>(L), <b>14</b><i>c </i>(M), and <b>14</b><i>d </i>(N), however, implementations using raw RSSI fingerprints are prone to failure when presented with relatively low signal strengths. There are several reasons that can be attributed to such low signal strengths, such as inequalities in hardware, firmware and lack of standardization, including noise, obstacles, multipath and fading phenomena. For example, in some instances there may be differences of &#x2212;30 dBm in the same location.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0043">In step <b>112</b>, a log-ratio RSSI fingerprint, which is also known as hyperbolic location fingerprinting (HLF), is determined to overcome the signal strength problem. Accordingly, each imprint of a fingerprint is the signal-strength ratio between a pair of anchor devices e.g. <b>14</b><i>a </i>(K) and <b>14</b><i>b </i>(L), instead of an absolute signal strength, and the position estimates are found as the intersection of a number of hyperbolas each describing the ratio difference between unique pairs of anchor devices e.g. <b>14</b><i>a </i>(K) and <b>14</b><i>b </i>(L). Table 2 shows exemplary raw RSSI fingerprints for each of sensor devices <b>14</b><i>n </i>in area A, and the hyperbolic fingerprints generated by normalized log ratio RSSI fingerprints of pairs of sensor devices <b>14</b><i>n</i>.
