No. 62/941,062 filed Nov. 27, 2019, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety herein.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications"

the priming and expansion of T lymphocytes (T cells) holds the promise of effective treatment of cancer and infectious diseases. Current clinical uses of adoptive transfer therapy in patients with cancer and viral infections regularly involves the infusion of T cells that have been stimulated, cloned and expanded for many weeks in vitro on autologous dendritic cells (DC), virally infected B cells, and/or allogeneic feeder cells. However, adoptive T cell immunotherapy clinical trials routinely require billions of cells per patient. In order to produce these quantities of cells, T cells must be subjected to many fold expansion in vitro, requiring up to 40 population doublings. Furthermore, for optimal engraftment potential and possible therapeutic benefit at the time of re-infusion, it is important to ensure that the expanded T cells remain functional and are not senescent or exhausted.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Methods of expanding T cell clones and/or lines for adoptive immunotherapy have proven to have certain drawbacks. The standard culture of pure CD8<sup>+</sup> cells is limited by apoptosis, diminution of biological function and/or proliferation, and obtaining a sufficient number of cells to be useful has been particularly difficult. Indeed, it is possible that such T cells that are currently infused into patients, may have a limited replicative capacity, and therefore, could not stably engraft to provide long-term protection from disease. Furthermore, the various techniques available for expanding human T cells have relied primarily on the use of accessory cells (i.e. cells that support or promote T cell survival and proliferation such as PBMCs, DCs, B cells, monocytes, etc.) and/or exogenous growth factors, such as interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-7, and IL-15. The requirement for accessory cells presents a significant problem for long-term culture systems because these cells are relatively short-lived. Therefore, in a long-term culture system, APCs must be continually obtained and replenished. The necessity for a renewable supply of accessory cells is problematic for treatment of immunodeficiencies in which accessory cells are affected. Likewise the need for exogenous mixtures of cytokines to support expansion and function of cultured T cells adds considerably to the costs, especially when stable sources of GMP-grade materials are required.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Thus, there exists a need to provide ways to stimulate T cells to combat various acute and chronic diseases and to promulgate sufficient numbers of therapeutic T cells for adoptive immunotherapy. The present invention addresses this need.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">As described herein, the present invention relates to

Activation can also be associated with induced cytokine production, and detectable effector functions. The term &#x201c;activated T cells&#x201d; refers to, among other things, T cells that are undergoing cell division.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0204">As used herein, to &#x201c;alleviate&#x201d; a disease means reducing the severity of one or more symptoms of the disease.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0205">The term &#x201c;antibody,&#x201d; as used herein, refers to an immunoglobulin molecule which specifically binds with an antigen. Antibodies can be intact immunoglobulins derived from natural sources or from recombinant sources and can be immunoreactive portions of intact immunoglobulins. Antibodies are typically tetramers of immunoglobulin molecules. Tetramers may be naturally occurring or reconstructed from single chain antibodies or antibody fragments. Antibodies also include dimers that may be naturally occurring or constructed from single chain antibodies or antibody fragments. The antibodies in the present invention may exist in a variety of forms including, for example, polyclonal antibodies, monoclonal antibodies, Fv, Fab and F(ab&#x2032;)2, as well as single chain antibodies (scFv), humanized antibodies, and human antibodies (Harlow et al., 1999, In: Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, NY; Harlow et al., 1989, In: Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.; Houston et al., 1988, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:5879-5883; Bird et al., 1988, Science 242:423-426).</p><p id="p-0138" num="0206">The term &#x201c;antibody fragment&#x201d; refers to a portion of an intact antibody and refers to the antigenic determining variable regions of an intact antibody. Examples of antibody fragments include, but are not limited to, Fab, Fab&#x2032;, F(ab&#x2032;)2, and Fv fragments, linear antibodies, scFv antibodies, single-domain antibodies, such as camelid antibodies (Riechmann, 1999, Journal of Immunological Methods 231:25-38), composed of either a VL or a VH domain which exhibit sufficient affinity for the target, and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments. The antibody fragment also includes a human antibody or a humanized antibody or a portion of a human antibody or a humanized antibody.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0207">An &#x201c;antibody heavy chain,&#x201d; as used herein, refers to the larger of the two types of polypeptide chains present in all antibody molecules in their naturally occurring conformations.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0208">An &#x201c;antibody light chain,&#x201d; as used herein, refers to the smaller of the two types of polypeptide chains present in all antibody molecules in their naturally occurring conformations. &#x3ba; and &#x3bb; light chains refer to the two major antibody light chain isotypes.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0209">By the term &#x201c;synthetic antibody&#x201d; as used herein, is meant an antibody which is generated using recombinant DNA technology, such as, for example, an antibody expressed by a bacteriophage as described herein. The term should also be construed to mean an antibody which has been generated by the synthesis of a DNA molecule encoding the antibody and which DNA molecule expresses an antibody protein, or an amino acid sequence specifying the antibody, wherein the DNA or amino acid sequence has been obtained using synthetic DNA or amino acid sequence technology which is available and well known in the art.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0210">&#x201c;Humanized&#x201d; and &#x201c;chimeric&#x201d; forms of non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies are immunoglobulins, immunoglobulin chains or fragments thereof (such as Fv, Fab, Fab&#x2032;, F(ab)<sub>2 </sub>or other antigen-binding subsequences of antibodies) which contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. For the most part, humanized and chimeric antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a complementary-determining region (CDR) of the recipient are replaced by residues from a CDR of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat or rabbit having the desired specificity, affinity, and capacity. In some instances, Fv framework region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized and chimeric antibodies can comprise residues which are found neither in the recipient antibody nor in the imported CDR or framework sequences. These modifications are made to further refine and optimize antibody performance. In general, the humanized and chimeric antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized and chimeric antibody optimally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. The World Health Organization (WHO) International Nonproprietary Name (INN) Expert Group has defined requirements for non-human derived antibodies to be considered &#x201c;humanized&#x201d;. According to guidelines, comparison of a candidate antibody to human sequences should be done through the International Immunogenetics Information System&#xae; (IMGT&#xae;) DomainGapAlign tool (www.imgt.org). This tool interrogates the IMGT&#xae; database of antibody germline variable region genes where the alignment score is made only against germline sequence variable region exons, thus omitting part of CDR3 and the J region from the analysis. For an antibody to be &#x201c;humanized&#x201d;, in addition to being &#x201c;closer to human than to other species&#x201d;, the top &#x201c;hit&#x201d; should be human and the identity to human sequences must be at least 85%, otherwise the antibody would be designated as &#x201c;chimeric&#x201d;.

Biol., 2: 593-596, 1992.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0211">The term &#x201c;antigen&#x201d; as used herein is defined as a molecule that provokes an immune response. This immune response may involve either antibody production, or the activation of specific immunologically-competent cells, or both. The skilled artisan will understand that any macromolecule, including virtually all proteins or peptides, can serve as an antigen.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0212">Furthermore, antigens can be derived from recombinant or genomic DNA. A skilled artisan will understand that any DNA, which comprises a nucleotide sequences or a partial nucleotide sequence encoding a protein that elicits an immune response therefore encodes an &#x201c;antigen&#x201d; as that term is used herein. Furthermore, one skilled in the art will understand that an antigen need not be encoded solely by a full length nucleotide sequence of a gene. It is readily apparent that the present invention includes, but is not limited to, the use of partial nucleotide sequences of more than one gene and that these nucleotide sequences are arranged in various combinations to elicit the desired immune response. Moreover, a skilled artisan will understand that an antigen need not be encoded by a &#x201c;gene&#x201d; at all. It is readily apparent that an antigen can be generated synthesized or can be derived from a biological sample. Such a biological sample can include, but is not limited to a tissue sample, a tumor sample, a cell or a biological fluid.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0213">As used herein, the term &#x201c;autologous&#x201d; is meant to refer to any material derived from the same individual to which it is later to be re-introduced into the individual.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0214">&#x201c;Co-stimulatory ligand&#x201d;, as the term is used herein, includes a molecule on an antigen presenting cell (e.g., an aAPC, dendritic cell, B cell, and the like) that specifically binds a cognate co-stimulatory molecule on a T cell, thereby providing a signal which, in addition to the primary signal provided by, for instance, binding of a TCR/CD3 complex with an MHC molecule loaded with peptide, mediates a T cell response, including, but not limited to, proliferation, activation, differentiation, and the like. A co-stimulatory ligand can include, but is not limited to, CD7, B7-1 (CD80), B7-2 (CD86), PD-L1, PD-L2, 4-1BBL, OX40L, inducible costimulatory ligand (ICOS-L), intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM), CD30L, CD40, CD70, CD83, HLA-G, MICA, MICB, HVEM, lymphotoxin beta receptor, 3/TR6, ILT3, ILT4, HVEM, an agonist or antibody that binds Toll ligand receptor and a ligand that specifically binds with B7-H3.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0215">A &#x201c;co-stimulatory molecule&#x201d; refers to the cognate binding partner on a T cell that specifically binds with a co-stimulatory ligand, thereby mediating a co-stimulatory response by the T cell, such as, but not limited to, proliferation. Co-stimulatory molecules include, but are not limited to CD86, 4-1BBL, BTLA and a Toll ligand receptor.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0216">A &#x201c;disease&#x201d; is a state of health of an animal wherein the animal cannot maintain homeostasis, and wherein if the disease is not ameliorated then the animal's health continues to deteriorate. In contrast, a &#x201c;disorder&#x201d; in an animal is a state of health in which the animal is able to maintain homeostasis, but in which the animal's state of health is less favorable than it would be in the absence of the disorder. Left untreated, a disorder does not necessarily cause a further decrease in the animal's state of health.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0217">&#x201c;Effective amount&#x201d; or &#x201c;therapeutically effective amount&#x201d; are used interchangeably herein, and refer to an amount of a compound, formulation, material, or composition, as described herein effective to achieve a particular biological result or provides a therapeutic or prophylactic benefit. Such results may include, but are not limited to an amount that when administered to a mammal, causes a detectable level of immune suppression or tolerance compared to the immune response detected in the absence of the composition of the invention. The immune response can be readily assessed by a plethora of art-recognized methods. The skilled artisan would understand that the amount of the composition administered herein varies and can be readily determined based on a number of factors such as the disease or condition being treated, the age and health and physical condition of the mammal being treated, the severity of the disease, the particular compound being administered, and the like.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0218">&#x201c;Encoding&#x201d; refers to the inherent property of specific sequences of nucleotides in a polynucleotide, such as a gene, a cDNA, or an mRNA, to serve as templates for synthesis of other polymers and macromolecules in biological processes having either a defined sequence of nucleotides (i.e., rRNA, tRNA and mRNA) or a defined sequence of amino acids and the biological properties resulting therefrom. Thus, a gene encodes a protein if transcription and translation of mRNA corresponding to that gene produces the protein in a cell or other biological system. Both the coding strand, the nucleotide sequence of which is identical to the mRNA sequence and is usually provided in sequence listings, and the non-coding strand, used as the template for transcription of a gene or cDNA, can be referred to as encoding the protein or other product of that gene or cDNA.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0219">As used herein &#x201c;endogenous&#x201d; refers to any material from or produced inside an organism, cell, tissue or system.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0220">The term &#x201c;epitope&#x201d; as used herein is defined as a small chemical molecule on an antigen that can elicit an immune response, inducing B and/or T cell responses. An antigen can have one or more epitopes. Most antigens have many epitopes; i.e., they are multivalent. In general, an epitope is roughly about 10 amino acids and/or sugars in size. Preferably, the epitope is about 4-18 amino acids, more preferably about 5-16 amino acids, and even more most preferably 6-14 amino acids, more preferably about 7-12, and most preferably about 8-10 amino acids. One skilled in the art understands that generally the overall three-dimensional structure, rather than the specific linear sequence of the molecule, is the main criterion of antigenic specificity and therefore distinguishes one epitope from another. Based on the present disclosure, a peptide used in the present invention can be an epitope.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0221">As used herein, the term &#x201c;exogenous&#x201d; refers to any material introduced from or produced outside an organism, cell, tissue or system.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0222">The term &#x201c;expand&#x201d; as used herein refers to increasing in number, as in an increase in the number of T cells. In one embodiment, the T cells that are expanded ex vivo increase in number relative to the number originally present in the culture. In another embodiment, the T cells that are expanded ex vivo increase in number relative to other cell types in the culture. The term &#x201c;ex vivo,&#x201d; as used herein, refers to cells that have been removed from a living organism, (e.g., a human) and propagated outside the organism (e.g., in a culture dish, test tube, or bioreactor).</p><p id="p-0155" num="0223">The term &#x201c;expression&#x201d; as used herein is defined as the transcription and/or translation of a particular nucleotide sequence driven by its promoter.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0224">&#x201c;Expression vector&#x201d; refers to a vector comprising a recombinant polynucleotide comprising expression control sequences operatively linked to a nucleotide sequence to be expressed. An expression vector comprises sufficient cis-acting elements for expression; other elements for expression can be supplied by the host cell or in an in vitro expression system. Expression vectors include all those known in the art, such as cosmids, plasmids (e.g., naked or contained in liposomes) and viruses (e.g., Sendai viruses, lentiviruses, retroviruses, adenoviruses, and adeno-associated viruses) that incorporate the recombinant polynucleotide.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0225">&#x201c;Identity&#x201d; as used herein refers to the subunit sequence identity between two polymeric molecules particularly between two amino acid molecules, such as, between two polypeptide molecules. When two amino acid sequences have the same residues at the same positions; e.g., if a position in each of two polypeptide molecules is occupied by an arginine, then they are identical at that position. The identity or extent to which two amino acid sequences have the same residues at the same positions in an alignment is often expressed as a percentage. The identity between two amino acid sequences is a direct function of the number of matching or identical positions; e.g., if half (e.g., five positions in a polymer ten amino acids in length) of the positions in two sequences are identical, the two sequences are 50% identical; if 90% of the positions (e.g., 9 of 10), are matched or identical, the two amino acids sequences are 90% identical.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0226">The term &#x201c;immune response&#x201d; as used herein is defined as a cellular response to an antigen that occurs when lymphocytes identify antigenic molecules as foreign and induce the formation of antibodies and/or activate lymphocytes to remove the antigen.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0227">The term &#x201c;immunosuppressive&#x201d; is used herein to refer to reducing overall immune response.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0228">&#x201c;Isolated&#x201d; means altered or removed from the natural state. For example, a nucleic acid or a peptide naturally present in a living animal is not &#x201c;isolated,&#x201d; but the same nucleic acid or peptide partially or completely separated from the coexisting materials of its natural state is &#x201c;isolated.&#x201d; An isolated nucleic acid or protein can exist in substantially purified form, or can exist in a non-native environment such as, for example, a host cell.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0229">A &#x201c;lentivirus&#x201d; as used herein refers to a genus of the Retroviridae family. Lentiviruses are unique among the retroviruses in being able to infect non-dividing cells; they can deliver a significant amount of genetic information into the DNA of the host cell, so they are one of the most efficient methods of a gene delivery vector. HIV, SIV, and FIV are all examples of lentiviruses. Vectors derived from lentiviruses offer the means to achieve significant levels of gene transfer in vivo.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0230">By the term &#x201c;modified&#x201d; as used herein, is meant a changed state or structure of a molecule or cell of the invention. Molecules may be modified in many ways, including chemically, structurally, and functionally. Cells may be modified through the introduction of nucleic acids.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0231">By the term &#x201c;modulating,&#x201d; as used herein, is meant mediating a detectable increase or decrease in the level of a response in a subject compared with the level of a response in the subject in the absence of a treatment or compound, and/or compared with the level of a response in an otherwise identical but untreated subject. The term encompasses perturbing and/or affecting a native signal or response thereby mediating a beneficial therapeutic response in a subject, preferably, a human.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0232">In the context of the present invention, the following abbreviations for the commonly occurring nucleic acid bases are used. &#x201c;A&#x201d; refers to adenosine, &#x201c;C&#x201d; refers to cytosine, &#x201c;G&#x201d; refers to guanosine, &#x201c;T&#x201d; refers to thymidine, and &#x201c;U&#x201d; refers to uridine.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0233">The term &#x201c;oligonucleotide&#x201d; typically refers to short polynucleotides. It will be understood that when a nucleotide sequence is represented by a DNA sequence (i.e., A, T, C, G), this also includes an RNA sequence (i.e., A, U, C, G) in which &#x201c;U&#x201d; replaces &#x201c;T.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0166" num="0234">Unless otherwise specified, a &#x201c;nucleotide sequence encoding an amino acid sequence&#x201d; includes all nucleotide sequences that are degenerate versions of each other and that encode the same amino acid sequence. The phrase nucleotide sequence that encodes a protein or an RNA may also include introns to the extent that the nucleotide sequence encoding the protein may in some version contain an intron(s).</p><p id="p-0167" num="0235">&#x201c;Parenteral&#x201d; administration of an immunogenic composition includes, e.g., subcutaneous (s.c.), intravenous (i.v.), intramuscular (i.m.), or intrasternal injection, or infusion techniques.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0236">The term &#x201c;polynucleotide&#x201d; as used herein is defined as a chain of nucleotides. Furthermore, nucleic acids are polymers of nucleotides. Thus, nucleic acids and polynucleotides as used herein are interchangeable. One skilled in the art has the general knowledge that nucleic acids are polynucleotides, which can be hydrolyzed into the monomeric &#x201c;nucleotides.&#x201d; The monomeric nucleotides can be hydrolyzed into nucleosides. As used herein polynucleotides include, but are not limited to, all nucleic acid sequences which are obtained by any means available in the art, including, without limitation, recombinant means, i.e., the cloning of nucleic acid sequences from a recombinant library or a cell genome, using ordinary cloning technology and PCR, and the like, and by synthetic means.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0237">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;peptide,&#x201d; &#x201c;polypeptide,&#x201d; and &#x201c;protein&#x201d; are used interchangeably, and refer to a compound comprised of amino acid residues covalently linked by peptide bonds. A protein or peptide must contain at least two amino acids, and no limitation is placed on the maximum number of amino acids that can comprise a protein's or peptide's sequence. Polypeptides include any peptide or protein comprising two or more amino acids joined to each other by peptide bonds. As used herein, the term refers to both short chains, which also commonly are referred to in the art as peptides, oligopeptides and oligomers, for example, and to longer chains, which generally are referred to in the art as proteins, of which there are many types. &#x201c;Polypeptides&#x201d; include, for example, biologically active fragments, substantially homologous polypeptides, oligopeptides, homodimers, heterodimers, variants of polypeptides, modified polypeptides, derivatives, analogs, fusion proteins, among others. The polypeptides include natural peptides, recombinant peptides, synthetic peptides, or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0238">By the term &#x201c;specifically binds,&#x201d; as used herein with respect to an antibody, is meant an antibody which recognizes a specific antigen, but does not substantially recognize or bind other molecules in a sample. For example, an antibody that specifically binds to an antigen from one species may also bind to that antigen from one or more species. But, such cross-species reactivity does not itself alter the classification of an antibody as specific. In another example, an antibody that specifically binds to an antigen may also bind to different allelic forms of the antigen. However, such cross reactivity does not itself alter the classification of an antibody as specific. In some instances, the terms &#x201c;specific binding&#x201d; or &#x201c;specifically binding,&#x201d; can be used in reference to the interaction of an antibody, a protein, or a peptide with a second chemical species, to mean that the interaction is dependent upon the presence of a particular structure (e.g., an antigenic determinant or epitope) on the chemical species; for example, an antibody recognizes and binds to a specific protein structure rather than to proteins generally. If an antibody is specific for epitope &#x201c;A&#x201d;, the presence of a molecule containing epitope A (or free, unlabeled A), in a reaction containing labeled &#x201c;A&#x201d; and the antibody, will reduce the amount of labeled A bound to the antibody.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0239">By the term &#x201c;stimulation,&#x201d; is meant a primary response induced by binding of a stimulatory molecule (e.g., a TCR/CD3 complex) with its cognate ligand thereby mediating a signal transduction event, such as, but not limited to, signal transduction via the TCR/CD3 complex. Stimulation can mediate altered expression of certain molecules, such as downregulation of TGF-beta, and/or reorganization of cytoskeletal structures, and the like.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0240">A &#x201c;stimulatory molecule,&#x201d; as the term is used herein, means a molecule on a T cell that specifically binds with a cognate stimulatory ligand present on an antigen presenting cell.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0241">A &#x201c;stimulatory ligand,&#x201d; as used herein, means a ligand that when present on an antigen presenting cell (e.g., an aAPC, a dendritic cell, a B-cell, and the like) can specifically bind with a cognate binding partner (referred to herein as a &#x201c;stimulatory molecule&#x201d;) on a T cell, thereby mediating a primary response by the T cell, including, but not limited to, activation, initiation of an immune response, proliferation, and the like. Stimulatory ligands are well-known in the art and encompass, inter alia, an MEW Class I molecule loaded with a peptide, an anti-CD3 antibody, a superagonist anti-CD28 antibody, and a superagonist anti-CD2 antibody.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0242">The term &#x201c;subject&#x201d; is intended to include living organisms in which an immune response can be elicited (e.g., mammals). A &#x201c;subject&#x201d; or &#x201c;patient,&#x201d; as used therein, may be a human or non-human mammal. Non-human mammals include, for example, livestock and pets, such as ovine, bovine, porcine, canine, feline and murine mammals. Preferably, the subject is human.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0243">A &#x201c;target site&#x201d; or &#x201c;target sequence&#x201d; refers to a nucleic acid sequence that defines a portion of a nucleic acid to which a binding molecule may specifically bind under conditions sufficient for binding to occur. In some embodiments, a target sequence refers to a genomic nucleic acid sequence that defines a portion of a nucleic acid to which a binding molecule may specifically bind under conditions sufficient for binding to occur.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0244">As used herein, the term &#x201c;T cell receptor&#x201d; or &#x201c;TCR&#x201d; refers to a complex of membrane proteins that participate in the activation of T cells in response to the presentation of antigen. The TCR is responsible for recognizing antigens bound to major histocompatibility complex molecules. TCR is composed of a heterodimer of an alpha (&#x3b1;) and beta (&#x3b2;) chain, although in some cells the TCR consists of gamma and delta (&#x3b3;/&#x3b4;) chains. TCRs may exist in alpha/beta and gamma/delta forms, which are structurally similar but have distinct anatomical locations and functions. Each chain is composed of two extracellular domains, a variable and constant domain. In some embodiments, the TCR may be modified on any cell comprising a TCR, including, for example, a helper T cell, a cytotoxic T cell, a memory T cell, regulatory T cell, natural killer T cell, and gamma delta T cell.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0245">The term &#x201c;therapeutic&#x201d; as used herein means a treatment and/or prophylaxis.

A &#x201c;transfected&#x201d; or &#x201c;transformed&#x201d; or &#x201c;transduced&#x201d; cell is one which has been transfected, transformed or transduced with exogenous nucleic acid. The cell includes the primary subject cell and its progeny.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0247">To &#x201c;treat&#x201d; a disease as the term is used herein, means to reduce the frequency or severity of at least one sign or symptom of a disease or disorder experienced by a subject.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0248">A &#x201c;vector&#x201d; is a composition of matter which comprises an isolated nucleic acid and which can be used to deliver the isolated nucleic acid to the interior of a cell. Numerous vectors are known in the art including, but not limited to, linear polynucleotides, polynucleotides associated with ionic or amphiphilic compounds, plasmids, and viruses. Thus, the term &#x201c;vector&#x201d; includes an autonomously replicating plasmid or a virus. The term should also be construed to include non-plasmid and non-viral compounds which facilitate transfer of nucleic acid into cells, such as, for example, polylysine compounds, liposomes, and the like. Examples of viral vectors include, but are not limited to, Sendai viral vectors, adenoviral vectors, adeno-associated virus vectors, retroviral vectors, lentiviral vectors, and the like.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0249">Ranges: throughout this disclosure, various aspects of the invention can be presented in a range format. It should be understood that the description in range format is merely for convenience and brevity and should not be construed as an inflexible limitation on the scope of the invention. Accordingly, the description of a range should be considered to have specifically disclosed all the possible subranges as well as individual numerical values within that range. For example, description of a range such as from 1 to 6 should be considered to have specifically disclosed subranges such as from 1 to 3, from 1 to 4, from 1 to 5, from 2 to 4, from 2 to 6, from 3 to 6 etc., as well as individual numbers within that range, for example, 1, 2, 2.7, 3, 4, 5, 5.3, and 6.

In certain embodiments, the chimeric receptor is specific for human CD3 and/or non-human primate (e.g. <i>Macaca fascicularis </i>and/or <i>Macaca mulatta</i>) CD3. In certain embodiments, the aAPCs are based on the human erythromyeloid cell line K562. In certain embodiments, the aAPCs express stimulatory and/or co-stimulatory molecules, and/or secrete cytokines. The invention also provides methods and compositions for the expansion of T cell subsets, and especially regulatory T cells (Tregs) from both humans and non-human primates. Activation and expansion occurs more efficiently than commonly used methods, with the aAPCs endogenously expressing chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), and/or co-stimulatory molecules, and/or growth-supporting cytokines that would otherwise need to be provided from exogenous sources during preparation steps prior to use. The following provides description of the methods and various considerations necessary to practice the invention.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0251">One aspect of the invention described herein relates to an aAPC engineered to comprise a chimeric receptor that binds specifically to CD3. The chimeric receptor comprises an antigen binding domain specific for CD3 and a transmembrane domain. The aAPC can optionally comprise an intracellular domain and/or hinge domain. In certain embodiments, the aAPC comprises at least one co-stimulatory molecule, and/or secretes at least one growth-promoting cytokine.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0252">An antigen presenting cell (APC) is a cell which displays an antigen complexed with a major histocompatibility complex (WIC) on its surface. The T cell receptor (TCR) complex expressed by T cells will recognize the antigen/WIC complex, which results in the activation of the T cell. The role of an APC is to continuously process antigens and present them to T cells. Non-limiting examples of common, naturally occurring APCs include macrophages, B cells, and dendritic cells.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0253">APCs are essential for the immune system to mount an effective adaptive immune response; the function of both cytotoxic and helper T cells requires the recognition of antigens presented by APCs. Antigen presentation determines the specificity of adaptive immunity and contributes to the immune response against intracellular and extracellular pathogens. APCs additionally play an important role in priming the immune system to recognize transformed cells, e.g., a malignant cell or tumor.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">Antigen Binding Domain</heading><p id="p-0187" num="0254">The present invention encompasses artificial antigen presenting cells (aAPCs) comprising a chimeric receptor molecule comprising an antigen binding domain having specificity for CD3 (e.g. human CD3 and/or non-human primate CD3). The antigen binding domain is the extracellular region of the chimeric receptor that binds to a specific target antigen (e.g. CD3). In certain embodiments, the antigen biding domain is specific for human CD3 and non-human primate CD3 (e.g. CD3 from <i>Macaca fascicularis </i>and/or <i>Macaca mulatta</i>).</p><p id="p-0188" num="0255">The antigen binding domain can include any domain that binds to the antigen and may include, but is not limited to, a monoclonal antibody, a polyclonal antibody, a synthetic antibody, a human antibody, a humanized antibody, a non-human antibody, and any fragment thereof. Thus, in one embodiment, the antigen binding domain portion comprises a mammalian antibody or a fragment thereof. In some embodiments, the antigen binding domain is selected from the group consisting of an antibody, an antigen binding fragment (Fab), and a single-chain variable fragment (scFv).</p><p id="p-0189" num="0256">As used herein, the term &#x201c;single-chain variable fragment&#x201d; or &#x201c;scFv&#x201d; is a fusion protein of the variable regions of the heavy (VH) and light chains (VL) of an immunoglobulin (e.g., mouse or human) covalently linked to form a VH::VL heterodimer. The heavy (VH) and light chains (VL) are either joined directly or joined by a peptide-encoding linker or spacer, which connects the N-terminus of the VH with the C-terminus of the VL, or the C-terminus of the VH with the N-terminus of the VL. In some embodiments, the antigen binding domain (e.g., CD3 binding domain) comprises an scFv having the configuration from N-terminus to C-terminus, VH-linker-VL. In some embodiments, the antigen binding domain (e.g., CD3 binding domain) comprises an scFv having the configuration from N-terminus to C-terminus, VL-linker-VH. Those of skill in the art would be able to select the appropriate configuration for use in the present invention.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0257">The linker is usually rich in glycine for flexibility, as well as serine or threonine for solubility. The linker can link the heavy chain variable region and the light chain variable region of the extracellular antigen-binding domain.

Various linker sequences are known in the art, including, without limitation, glycine serine (GS) linkers such as (GS)n, (GSGGS)n (SEQ ID NO: 27), (GGGS)n (SEQ ID NO: 28), and (GGGGS)n (SEQ ID NO: 29), where n represents an integer of at least 1. Exemplary linker sequences can comprise amino acid sequences including, without limitation, GGSG (SEQ ID NO: 30), GGSGG (SEQ ID NO: 31), GSGSG (SEQ ID NO: 32), GSGGG (SEQ ID NO: 33), GGGSG (SEQ ID NO: 34), GSSSG (SEQ ID NO: 35), GGGGS (SEQ ID NO: 36), GGGGSGGGGSGGGGS (SEQ ID NO: 37) and the like. Those of skill in the art would be able to select the appropriate linker sequence for use in the present invention. In one embodiment, an antigen binding domain (e.g., CD3 binding domain) of the present invention comprises a heavy chain variable region (VH) and a light chain variable region (VL), wherein the VH and VL is separated by the linker sequence having the amino acid sequence GGGGSGGGGSGGGGS (SEQ ID NO: 37), which may be encoded by the nucleic acid sequence ggtggcggtggctcgggcggtggtgggtcgggt ggcggcggatct (SEQ ID NO: 38).</p><p id="p-0191" num="0258">Despite removal of the constant regions and the introduction of a linker, scFv proteins retain the specificity of the original immunoglobulin.

The transmembrane domain is for insertion into a cell membrane, e.g. the aAPC cell membrane. In some embodiments, the transmembrane domain is interposed between the antigen binding domain and the intracellular domain of a chimeric receptor.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0271">In certain embodiments, the transmembrane domain is naturally associated with one or more of the domains in the chimeric receptor. In some instances, the transmembrane domain can be selected or modified by amino acid substitution to avoid binding of such domains to the transmembrane domains of the same or different surface membrane proteins to minimize interactions with other members of the receptor complex.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0272">The transmembrane domain may be derived either from a natural or from a synthetic source. Where the source is natural, the domain may be derived from any membrane-bound or transmembrane protein, e.g., a Type I transmembrane protein. Where the source is synthetic, the transmembrane domain may be any artificial sequence that facilitates insertion of the CAR into a cell membrane, e.g., an artificial hydrophobic sequence. Examples of the transmembrane regions of particular use in this invention include, without limitation, transmembrane domains derived from (i.e. comprise at least the transmembrane region(s) of) the alpha, beta or zeta chain of the T-cell receptor, CD28, CD3 epsilon, CD45, CD4, CD5, CD7, CD8, CD9, CD16, CD22, CD33, CD37, CD64, CD80, CD86, CD134 (OX-40), CD137 (4-1BB), CD154 (CD40L), Toll-like receptor 1 (TLR1), TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9.

Preferably a triplet of phenylalanine, tryptophan and valine will be found at each end of a synthetic transmembrane domain.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0273">In certain embodiments, the transmembrane domain is a CD8 transmembrane domain. In certain embodiments, the transmembrane domain comprises the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 22.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0274">The transmembrane domains described herein can be combined with any of the antigen binding domains described herein, any of the intracellular domains described herein, or any of the other domains described herein that may be included in a chimeric receptor.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0275">In some embodiments, the transmembrane domain further comprises a hinge region. A subject chimeric receptor of the present invention may also include an hinge region. The hinge region of the chimeric receptor is a hydrophilic region which is located between the antigen binding domain and the transmembrane domain. In some embodiments, this domain facilitates proper protein folding for the chimeric receptor. The hinge region is an optional component for the chimeric receptor. The hinge region may include a domain selected from Fc fragments of antibodies, hinge regions of antibodies, CH2 regions of antibodies, CH3 regions of antibodies, artificial hinge sequences or combinations thereof. Examples of hinge regions include, without limitation, a CD8a hinge, artificial hinges made of polypeptides which may be as small as, three glycines (Gly), as well as CH1 and CH3 domains of IgGs (such as human IgG4).</p><p id="p-0209" num="0276">In some embodiments, a subject chimeric receptor of the present disclosure includes a hinge region that connects the antigen binding domain with the transmembrane domain, which, in turn, connects to the intracellular domain. The hinge region is preferably capable of supporting the antigen binding domain to recognize and bind to the target antigen on the target cells (see, e.g., Hudecek et al., Cancer Immunol. Res. (2015) 3(2): 125-135). In some embodiments, the hinge region is a flexible domain, thus allowing the antigen binding domain to have a structure to optimally recognize the specific structure and density of the target antigens on a cell such as tumor cell (Hudecek et al., supra). The flexibility of the hinge region permits the hinge region to adopt many different conformations.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0277">In some embodiments, the hinge region is an immunoglobulin heavy chain hinge region.

Glycine and glycine-serine polymers can be used; both Gly and Ser are relatively unstructured, and therefore can serve as a neutral tether between components. Glycine polymers can be used; glycine accesses significantly more phi-psi space than even alanine, and is much less restricted than residues with longer side chains (see, e.g., Scheraga, Rev. Computational. Chem. (1992) 2: 73-142). Exemplary hinge regions can comprise amino acid sequences including, but not limited to, GGSG (SEQ ID NO: 30), GGSGG (SEQ ID NO: 31), GSGSG (SEQ ID NO: 32), GSGGG (SEQ ID NO: 33), GGGSG (SEQ ID NO: 34), GSSSG (SEQ ID NO: 35), and the like.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0281">In some embodiments, the hinge region is an immunoglobulin heavy chain hinge region.

The methods comprise contacting the T cell with any of the artificial presenting cells (aAPCs) disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0255" num="0321">As demonstrated elsewhere herein, contacting a T cell with an aAPC comprising a chimeric receptor specific for CD3, and optionally, a costimulatory ligand that specifically binds a cognate costimulatory molecule expressed on the T cell surface, stimulates the T cell and induces T cell proliferation such that large numbers of specific T cells can be readily produced. The aAPC expands the T cell &#x201c;specifically&#x201d; in that only the T cells expressing the particular costimulatory molecule are expanded by the aAPC. Thus, where the T cell to be expanded is present in a mixture of cells, some or most of which do not express the costimulatory molecule, only the T cell of interest will be induced to proliferate and expand in cell number. The T cell can be further purified using a wide variety of cell separation and purification techniques, such as those known in the art and/or described elsewhere herein.</p><p id="p-0256" num="0322">As would be appreciated by the skilled artisan, based upon the disclosure provided herein, the T cell of interest need not be identified or isolated prior to expansion using the aAPC. This is because the aAPC is selective and will only expand the T cell(s) expressing the cognate costimulatory molecule.</p><p id="p-0257" num="0323">Preferably, expansion of certain T cells is achieved by using several aAPCs or a single aAPC, expressing various molecules, including, but not limited to, an antigen, a cytokine, a costimulatory ligand, and an antibody ligand that specifically binds with the costimulatory molecule present on the T cell. As disclosed elsewhere herein, the aAPC can comprise a nucleic acid encoding CD32 and/or CD64 such that the CD32 and/or the CD64 expressed on the aAPC surface can be &#x201c;loaded&#x201d; with any antibody desired so long as they bind CD32 and/or CD64, which are Fc&#x3b3; receptors.

The method comprises contacting a population of T cells comprising at least one T cell expressing the known co-stimulatory molecule with an aAPC comprising a lentivirus encoding a ligand of the co-stimulatory molecule. As disclosed elsewhere herein, where an aAPC expresses at least one co-stimulatory ligand that specifically binds with a co-stimulatory molecule on a T cell, binding of the co-stimulatory molecule with its cognate co-stimulatory ligand induces proliferation of the T cell. Thus, the T cell of interest is induced to proliferate without having to first purify the cell from the population of cells. Also, this method provides a rapid assay for determining whether any cells in the population are expressing a particular costimulatory molecule of interest, since contacting the cells with the aAPC will induce proliferation and detection of the growing cells thereby identifying that a T cell expressing a costimulatory molecule of interest was present in the sample. In this way, any T cell of interest where at least one costimulatory molecule on the surface of the cell is known, can be expanded and isolated.</p><p id="p-0259" num="0325">The invention includes a method for specifically expanding a T cell population subset. More particularly, the method comprises contacting a population of T cells comprising at least one T cell of a subset of interest with an aAPC capable of expanding that T cell, or at least an aAPC expressing at least one costimulatory ligand that specifically binds with a cognate costimulatory molecule on the surface of the T cell. As demonstrated previously elsewhere herein, binding of the co-stimulatory molecule with its binding partner co-stimulatory ligand induces proliferation of the T cell, thereby specifically expanding a T cell population subset. One skilled in the art would understand, based upon the disclosure provided herein, that T cell subsets include T helper (T<sub>H1 </sub>and T<sub>H2</sub>) CD4 expressing, cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) (Tc1 or Tc2) T regulatory (T<sub>REG</sub>), T<sub>C/S</sub>, na&#xef;ve, memory, central memory, effector memory, and &#x3b3;&#x3b4;T cells.

In certain embodiments, the non-human primate is <i>Macaca fascicularis</i>. the non-human primate is <i>Macaca mulatta. </i></p><p id="p-0261" num="0327">In one aspect, the invention provides a method for stimulating and expanding a human and/or non-human primate regulatory T cell (Treg). The method comprises contacting the Treg with an artificial antigen presenting cell (aAPC), wherein the aAPC comprises a chimeric receptor molecule comprising an antigen binding domain having specificity for human CD3 and a non-human primate CD3, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain. The antigen binding domain comprises a heavy chain variable region comprising three heavy chain complementarity determining regions (HCDRs) and a light chain variable region comprising three light chain complementarity determining regions (LCDRs).

In some embodiments, the aAPC membrane vesicles are generated by disrupting the aAPCs of the invention in such a way as to result in vesicles that retain functional cell-surface proteins expressed by the aAPCs, thereby retaining the vesicles ability to stimulate T cells and support expansion of T cell cultures. Such aAPC-derived vesicle compositions offer several advantages over co-culture with fully intact aAPC cells including, but not limited to, obviating the need for inactivation of the aAPCs through treatments such as cytotoxic chemicals, irradiation, or the like that may negatively affect the cultured T cells; optimizing the production of large-scale cultures due to the aAPC membrane vesicles not being metabolically active or requiring removal from the resulting population of expanded T cells; and enabling the more efficient transduction of the expanding T cells with viral vectors, including lentiviral vectors, due to significantly reduced interaction between the viral particles and the aAPC membrane vesicles.</p><p id="p-0263" num="0329">In some embodiments, the aAPC membrane vesicles are generated by the disruption of the aAPC cells. A number of methods of cell disruption are well-known in the art including, but not limited to, mechanical homogenization such as with a handheld or motorized device, ultrasonic homogenization, pressure homogenization, temperature treatments comprising repeated cycles of freezing and thawing, osmotic lysis in hypotonic solutions, chemical lysis including the use of various detergents or solvents, nitrogen cavitation, among others. The skilled artisan would recognize which method of disruption would be most applicable to specific applications of generating membrane vesicles, including aAPC vesicles. In some embodiments, the method of disruption of aAPCs is nitrogen cavitation. This method involves placing a culture of aAPCs in a pressure vessel, often called a &#x201c;bomb&#x201d;, and equilibrating the cells at high pressure under a nitrogen-rich atmosphere, thereby resulting in increased nitrogen and other gasses dissolved in the cytoplasm of the cells. The sudden exposure of the cells to atmospheric pressure results in nitrogen bubbles forming in the cytoplasm of the cells, which results in cell lysis. Pressure and release time can be varied to result in differing degrees of cell lysis and preservation of cellular, membrane, protein, and organelle structures. For example, relatively low pressures will disrupt the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum only, while high pressures will result in the disruption of the nucleus and other organelles including lysosomes and mitochondria. In some embodiments, the pressure vessel, often called a &#x201c;bomb&#x201d;, consists of a thick stainless steel or similar metal casing that is capable of withstanding high pressure, with an inlet for delivery of nitrogen gas from a tank and an outlet port with an adjustable discharge valve. The skilled artisan would recognize the precise conditions of nitrogen cavitation sufficient to produce the aAPC membrane vesicles of the invention and their use in the methods of the invention.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">Pharmaceutical Compositions</heading><p id="p-0264" num="0330">The invention encompasses the preparation and use of pharmaceutical compositions comprising an aAPC of the invention as an active ingredient.

In these studies, anti-CD3/CD28 coated beads were used as a positive control. Unstimulated T cells alone were used as a negative control. The aAPC clones that resulted in the greatest T cell expansion were those that expressed both the OKT3 CAR and CD86, verifying the ability of these cells to provide both signal 1 and 2 to T cells, which is required for optimal activation. Stimulation with the K562-based aAPCs was more efficient than with commercially-available microbead preparations which are coated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="1">Example 2: Development of an aAPC Capable of Expanding Both Human and Primate T Cells</heading><p id="p-0288" num="0354">While OKT3-based aAPCs are capable of expanding human T cells, a need existed for an aAPC that was capable of expanding T cells of both human and non-human primate origins. In order to select an antibody with the highest possible affinity for both species, a number of already-constructed Bi-specific T-cell Engager (BiTE) molecules were screened (see PCT/EP2009/062795). These molecules were specific for melanoma chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan (MCSP) and CD3 of both human and cynomolgus monkey origin (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, reproduced by way of background from PCT application PCT/EP2009/062795).

As a control, OKT3-CAR based a APCs were used for comparison. Consistent with the cross-species specificity of the F12Q antibody, F12Q-CAR based aAPCs efficiently promoted the expansion of T cells from all three species (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>). Similarly, only human T cells expanded after stimulation with OKT3-CAR expressing aAPCs. In both studies, expansion was determined by assessing the fold increase in the number of cells.

In addition to saving time and labor in a process which has become increasingly important as CAR-based immunotherapies develop into more common clinical treatments, anti-CD3 CARs also eliminate the constant expense of sourcing and testing anti-CD3 antibodies.</p><p id="p-0293" num="0359">The use of exogenous cytokines such as IL-7 and IL-15 in T cell cultures promotes optimal expansion and maintenance of effector functions, even after multiple rounds of in vitro stimulation. Similar to the use of anti-CD3 CARs, the modification of aAPC to secrete IL-7 and IL-15 provides the benefits of these factors without the need to supplement cultures with purified preparations. K562 OKT3-CAR expressing aAPCs were transduced to secrete IL-7 with a construct that also expresses the red fluorescent protein (RFP) mCherry as a trackable marker. Cells were then further engineered to secrete a heterocomplex of IL-15 linked to the IL-15R alpha chain (sushi domain) via a linker.

As such, traditional T cell culture protocols often include treatments of stimulator cells that arrest their growth, including irradiation or treatment with mitomycin C. This step is also key in the production of T cells for immunotherapy, as it minimizes the amount of purification would need to be done to the culture to remove non-T cells prior to infusion into patients. APC4.1 and APC5.1 aAPCs were irradiated prior to use in T cell expansion co-cultures. After 7 days, the cultures were assessed for remaining aAPC cells by staining cells with the viability dye 7-AAD and assessing for mCherry expression (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>).

To assess whether CD4+ Treg expanded using the aAPC of the current invention, Treg sorted from non-human primate (cynomolgus macaques) peripheral blood were stimulated on with irradiated K562.F12Q.64.86 cells with IL-2.

For example, the aAPC-derived vesicles would be less able to interact with the viral particles, thus preventing the aAPC portion of the culture mixture from absorbing significant amounts of virus. Likewise, aAPC-derived vesicles obviate the need for inactivation of the aAPCs through treatments such as cytotoxic chemicals, irradiation, or the like that may negatively affect the cultured T cells. Further, aAPC vesicles are not metabolically active and do not require subsequent purification procedures to remove them from the resulting population of expanded T cells. While many methods of cell disruption are known in the art and would be appropriate for the generation of aAPC-derived vesicles or nanoparticles, the method of nitrogen cavitation offers several advantages in that the method is simple and requires minimal cell manipulation and no chemical detergents. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b>A</figref> illustrates two examples of nitrogen cavitation pressure vessels (also known as &#x201c;bombs&#x201d;). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b>B</figref> illustrates a sample workflow of the generation of aAPC-derived membrane vesicles. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b></figref> illustrates a series of studies in which APC5.1 cells of the current invention were used to create vesicle preparations using nitrogen cavitation. The graph illustrates the mean size of the particles resulting from the procedure. These preparations of APC5.1-derived vesicles were then incubated with human donor T cells for nine days. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b></figref> illustrates that CD86 and CD64 molecules originating from the vesicle preparations was observed to be present on the surface of the T cells, indicating successful interaction between the cells and vesicles. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>34</b> and <b>35</b></figref> illustrate the ability of aAPC-derived vesicles to induce the proliferation of T cells in vitro. Anti-CD3/anti-CD28 coated beads were used as a comparison, as one of the most commonly used methods for expanding T cells. Both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells exhibited equivalent or better proliferation as compared to beads at various concentrations of vesicles ranging from 3.125 &#x3bc;l to 50 &#x3bc;l. Similar studies were also conducted to observe whether aAPC-derived vesicle stimulation of T cells could also support the concurrent viral transduction of T cells using a lentiviral vector bearing a GFP-expressing construct (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>36</b></figref>). Similar to the proliferation data, aAPC-derived vesicle expanded T cells demonstrated robust expression of GFP at levels comparable to bead-stimulated T cells at a number of concentrations. In all, these data suggested the utility of aAPC-derived vesicles as a method of efficient expansion of T cells comparable to anti-CD3/anti-CD28 microbeads (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG.
