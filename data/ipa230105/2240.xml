In recent years, lithium-ion battery ternary materials have developed rapidly, and the development of high-quality high-nickel and low-cobalt ternary precursors and cathode materials has become a hot spot. In the market, hydroxide precursors are generally used as raw materials and sintered into cathode materials while the research on carbonate ternary precursors and their cathode materials is relatively few. At present, the reported carbonate precursors have the problems of insufficient particle uniformity, uneven particle size distribution, and poor fluidity, which causes the failure of continuous production of carbonate precursors. However, in most of the existing processes, ammonium bicarbonate is used as a precipitant to synthesize the carbonate precursor. This scheme is feasible for common ternary precursors and cathode material systems, but it often fails to achieve good results for high-nickel products, the morphology, particle size, and particle size distribution cannot be well controlled, and there are environmental protection problems related to ammonia-containing wastewater treatment.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">At the same time, for cathode materials, high-temperature calcination and oxidation in the process of preparing high-nickel ternary cathode materials are usually prone to cause the mixing of part of Ni divalent metal ions and lithium ions, which easily causes local structure collapse and instability during the cycle, resulting in the decrease of specific capacity and poor circulation of the final materials. In general, 750&#xb0; C. and a pure oxygen atmosphere can enable the high-nickel materials to be completely transformed and crystallized, but the excessive temperature will aggravate cation mixing. </p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, how to reduce the calcination temperature of carbonate precursor materials, especially large grained materials, is a direction to improve the properties of materials.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present disclosure provides a carbonate precursor having a high-nickel and low-cobalt sandwich structure, a preparation method therefor and an application thereof.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure provides a carbonate precursor having a high-nickel and low-cobalt sandwich structure in an embodiment. The carbonate precursor includes an inner core and outer shell layer. The chemical formula of the material of the inner core is Ni<sub>x1</sub>Co<sub>y1</sub>Mn<sub>(1-x1-y1)</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, where x1 ranges from 0.75 to 0.92, such as 0.75, 0.76, 0.77, 0.78, 0.79, 0.80, 0.81, 0.82, 0.83, 0.84, 0.85, 0.86, 0.87, 0.88, 0.89, 0.90, 0.91, 0.92, etc., and y1 ranges from 0.01 to 0.15, such as 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 0.07, 0.08, 0.09, 0.1, 0.11, 0.12, 0.13, 0.14, 0.15, etc.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The outer shell layer covers at least a part of the outer surface of the inner core, and the chemical formula of the material of the outer shell layer is Ni<sub>x2</sub>Co<sub>y2</sub>Mn<sub>(1-x2-y2)</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, where x2 ranges from 0.7 to 0.92, such as 0.7, 0.72, 0.74, 0.76, 0.78, 0.80, 0.82, 0.84, 0.86, 0.88, 0.90, 0.92, etc., and y2 ranges from 0.01 to 0.15, such as 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 0.07, 0.08, 0.09, 0.1, 0.11, 0.12, 0.13, 0.14, 0.15, etc.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In an embodiment provided by the present disclosure, the carbonate precursor having a high-nickel and low-cobalt sandwich structure has the advantages of narrow particle size distribution, good fluidity, and excellent electrochemical performance, and may be stably produced in both an ammonia-free system and an ammonia-containing system, especially in the ammonia-free system, that is, no ammonia-containing wastewater is produced, which is environmentally friendly. Compared with a precursor material having a solid structure, when the precursor material having a sandwich structure is sintered with lithium ions, since the outer shell layer is thin, lithium ions can more easily penetrate through the shell into the sandwich and then reach the inner core, which makes the sintering of lithium ions easier, and the same sintering effect can be achieved even if the sintering temperature is appropriately reduced. That is, the precursor having a sandwich structure can achieve the complete transformation and crystallization of the high-nickel material at a relatively low temperature, which avoids the problem that the local structure of the high-nickel material collapses in the cycle process due to the mixing of cations in the high-temperature calcination process, and the residual alkali(s) becomes less, so that the prepared cathode material has a relatively high specific capacity and  excellent cycle performance and electrochemical performance. The outer shell layer has a composition with a slightly low nickel content because such a low-nickel material is more stable and less likely to react with an electrolyte and affect the battery performance. The nickel content of the inner core is slightly higher because the outer surface of the inner core is covered with the outer shell layer and thus cannot be in contact with the electrolyte.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The &#x201c;sandwich structure&#x201d; described in an embodiment of the present disclosure refers to a cavity structure existing between the inner core and the outer shell layer covering the outer surface of the inner core.

The carbonate precursor includes an inner core and outer shell layer covering at least a part of the outer surface of the inner core, where the chemical formula of the material of the inner core is Ni<sub>x1</sub>Co<sub>y1</sub>Mn<sub>(1-x1-y1)</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, where x1 ranges from 0.75 to 0.92 and y1 ranges from 0.01 to 0.15, and the chemical formula of the material of the outer shell layer is Ni<sub>x2</sub>Co<sub>y2</sub>Mn<sub>(1-x2-y2)</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, where x2 ranges from 0.7 to 0.92 and y2 ranges from 0.01 to 0.15. The carbonate precursor having a sandwich structure has the advantages of narrow particle size distribution, good fluidity, and excellent electrochemical performance, and may be stably produced in both an ammonia-free system and an ammonia-containing system, especially in the ammonia-free system, that is, no ammonia-containing wastewater is produced, which is environmentally friendly. Compared with a precursor material having a solid structure, when the precursor material having a sandwich structure is sintered with lithium ions, since the outer shell layer is thin, lithium ions can more easily penetrate through the shell into the sandwich and then reach the inner core, which makes the sintering of lithium ions easier, and the same sintering effect can be achieved even if the sintering temperature is appropriately reduced. That  is, the precursor having a sandwich structure can achieve the complete transformation and crystallization of the high-nickel material at a relatively low temperature, which avoids the problem that the local structure of the high-nickel material collapses in the cycle process due to the mixing of cations in the high-temperature calcination process, and the residual alkali(s) becomes less, so that the prepared cathode material has a relatively high specific capacity and excellent cycle performance and electrochemical performance. The outer shell layer has a composition with a slightly low nickel content because such a low-nickel material is more stable and less likely to react with an electrolyte and affect the battery performance. The nickel content of the inner core is slightly higher because the outer surface of the inner core is covered with the outer shell layer and thus cannot be in contact with the electrolyte. The precursor has a particle size of 8 &#x3bc;m to 15 &#x3bc;m, and due to the existence of the sandwich structure, the particle size cannot be guaranteed to be below 8 &#x3bc;m, and if the particle size exceeds 15 &#x3bc;m, the permeability effect of the sandwich may become weak or the particles are fragile because the sandwich is too thick, which degrades the quality of the precursor.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In an embodiment, the present disclosure provides a method for preparing the preceding carbonate precursor having a high-nickel and low-cobalt sandwich structure.
