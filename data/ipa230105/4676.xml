These businesses include retailers, who maintain data concerning their own customers, as well as third-party data providers, who may maintain data about a large number of consumers in a given geographic region. Businesses who maintain data about consumers are subject to a growing number of data privacy laws, regulations, and rules in various jurisdictions, including, for example, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). All of these laws, regulations, and rules will be referred to herein generally as &#x201c;privacy laws.&#x201d; The businesses who maintain these data processing systems must ensure that their technology enables them to comply with the privacy laws that are applicable to them.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">One of the privacy law requirements applicable in many jurisdictions is the technological ability to restrict processing of personal data upon the request of the person who is the subject of the data. This is commonly referred to as allowing for &#x201c;opting out&#x201d; or &#x201c;opt-out&#x201d; for the use of this data. Under the GDPR, the businesses with consumer data are each considered a &#x201c;data controller,&#x201d; which is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data. The term &#x201c;joint controllers&#x201d; is used to describe a situation in which two or more controllers jointly determine the purposes and means of processing. A &#x201c;data processor&#x201d; is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller. An example of a data processor is a data services provider (DSP) who receives consumer data from a retailer and provides processing on behalf of the retailer as part of a campaign of providing targeted messages. A &#x201c;data subject&#x201d; is an identified or identifiable natural person, such as a consumer.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The GDPR includes a &#x201c;right of restriction,&#x201d; which means that a data subject can request restriction of processing of data about that data subject. When a restriction request is received, the controller cannot transfer the data to a data processor for processing and may not itself process the data. This right of restriction will generally be considered as one form of &#x201c;opting out&#x201d; herein. The controller must be able to process the opt out requests within its data processing system, and thus must implement and maintain hardware and software technology for this purpose. A common strategy is to maintain an opt-out list. In an example, a data subject may contact a controller, provide contact information such as an email address, and tell the controller to stop sending the data subject targeted messages. The controller then adds the data subject's email address to its opt-out list. This opt-out list is forwarded to the data processor that works with the controller so that the data processor may similarly avoid any targeted messages that would otherwise reach this data subject. Thereafter, when the data processor processes data for that controller, directed messages to the data subject's email address will be suppressed, that is, not sent.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Opt-out lists as just described are workable in an environment in which there is only one controller, but problems arise when multiple controllers wish to engage in a joint campaign of targeted messaging. For example, one may suppose that an airline, a car rental company, and a hotel chain wish to engage in a joint campaign. They may wish to offer a discount to those consumers who use all three of these companies' services when booking a trip. Each company will wish to contribute its own customer data to make the campaign effective, and may wish to employ a data services provider (DSP) to process the data and generate information for online messaging. Because the companies may have different but complementary information about the same consumers, combining their data will allow them to better formulate a targeted message offer that will be of interest to such consumers.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the joint campaign scenario just described, the airline, car rental company, and hotel chain are each data controllers, and the DSP is a data processor. Each will have its own opt-out list associated with its own customers. But the data from each of the three data controllers will often be in different formats. For example, the airline may have a frequent flier program, which is keyed by name, address, and an internal customer number. The rental car company might use name and email address data. The hotel may use name and telephone number data. When processing data for this multi-controller workflow, the DSP would want to use the combined properties of the three data sets to enhance the targeted messages presented to a given data subject. But the DSP must also respect the opt-out requests made by consumers to each of the three data controllers. It may be that a data subject has opted out with respect to one or two of the three data controllers, but has not opted out with respect to all three of them. If the DSP chose a single opt-out list to work with, it would not be honoring the opt-out requests of any consumers who had opted out with respect to one of the other data controllers. As a result, the campaign would not comply with the data subject opt-out requests and may, depending upon the jurisdiction, be out of compliance with applicable privacy laws. The DSP also cannot simply merge the opt-out lists, because the data is kept in different formats and different identifiers are used to distinguish between the companies' respective customers. The DSP could process data separately for each of the data controllers and use each data controller's opt-out list when processing its data separately, but then the synergy of combining the complementary data from the multiple controllers would be lost, and the campaign would thus be less effective.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It may be understood that this same technical problem as described above is presented when any two or more data controllers wish to engage in a joint campaign. Another example of where this problem arises is when a company uses data collected by another company, whereby both the data seller and data purchaser are in the role of data controllers. Still another example is multiple companies sharing responsibility for collecting and maintaining a commingled dataset, in which all contributors would be considered data controllers. The prior art systems for processing opt-outs would not provide compliance with privacy laws such as the GDPR in any of these situations. What is desired then is an improved data processing system and method that would technically facilitate full compliance with opt-out requests while still allowing for a joint campaign involving multiple data controllers and other joint uses of data.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">References mentioned in this background section are not admitted to be prior art with respect to the present invention.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention is directed to a system and method for processing a multiple data controller workflow, whereby data subject opt-outs are fully honored but the synergy of the combined data may still be achieved for purposes of improving the effectiveness of a campaign. The DSP performs data resolution processing against the data from each data controller. Using the results of the resolution processing, opt-out lists that are in different formats and may track different sorts of data may all be used for the joint campaign. Even though data is being pulled from multiple controllers and is processed together in a multi-controller workflow, metadata is added to the data so that the source data controller is tracked throughout the processing by the DSP. The data is then combined at the end, resulting in a master opt-out list. If a data subject has opted out with respect to any controller in the multiple data controller workflow, then the opt-out is applied to the joint campaign even though one of the controller's data may not strictly be covered by the data subject's opt-out request. The invention thereby fulfills the intent of the data subject by applying the opt-out directive to data collected by each controller. The combined opt-out only applies, however, to the multiple data controller workflow, such that individual data controller workflows would still retain data subject records, potentially lacking an opt-out request from the data subject.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In various implementations of the present invention, a number of advantages are offered by this approach. The DSP is able to isolate the data from multiple data controllers from each other, and thereby maintains confidentiality for all controllers with respect to other controllers. No company that is participating in the joint enterprise needs to divulge any of its customer data to another company. This serves both to protect the privacy of the data subjects and also allows the controllers to comply with privacy laws and their own stated privacy policies. It thus encourages controllers to engage in multiple controller campaigns with the assurance that their data is protected, thereby improving the results of the campaign and providing their customers with offers that will more likely be attractive to them.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Another advantage of the approach according to certain implementations of the invention is that by applying identity resolution to the opt-out process, the likelihood that the data subject's actual wishes will be honored is improved. For example, suppose that a data subject has multiple email addresses that are known to the DSP, but only gives one of those email addresses in an opt-out request to one of the data controllers involved with the joint campaign. The resolution process will allow the DSP to apply an opt-out against all of those email addresses, not just the one provided to the data controller when the data subject made the opt-out request. The system and method thus may go beyond the strict requirements of the applicable privacy laws, but comes closer to honoring the actual intent of the data subject, and thus reduces the risk that the data subject will be angered by receiving a message during the joint campaign when the data subject thought that his or her opt-out request should have prevented that message. This is beneficial for the data controllers involved in the joint campaign as well, since they do not risk losing a customer due to anger at being targeted in the joint campaign when the customer expected not to receive such messaging.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Another advantage of certain implementations of the present invention is that when data controllers transmit data to the DSP, the ingestion process replaces all identifiable personal information with anonymous identifiers. For example, if the input data contained &#x201c;John Doe, j.doe@mail.com,&#x201d; this might be replaced with &#x201c;f572d396fae9206628714fb2ce00f72e94f2258f.&#x201d; The DSP may protect the data with security measures, but pseudonymization of this sort provides a further layer of defense against data breaches. Even if the data were breached by malicious actors, such actors would be unable to re-associate any anonymous identifier with the original name and email address. This protects the actual identifiable information (names, addresses, etc.), and it protects the relationship between other data (purchase history, product references, etc.) and any particular individual.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Another advantage of certain implementations of the present invention is that, just as the data controllers are isolated from each other during the multi-controller processing, the DSP also isolates the data controllers from online message delivery platforms. When a person interacts with a website, that website might use a login or other identity to establish an on-line &#x201c;session.&#x201d; For example, when someone logs into a Facebook account, Facebook knows the identity associated with that session's activity. When reporting message activity from the website, the DSP may anonymize the records to dissociate the activity (e.g., clicking on a banner message) from specific individuals. Data controllers can receive aggregate reports to measure the effectiveness of their targeted messaging, but data controllers cannot associate specific website activity to specific data subjects. Again, this feature serves to further protect the privacy of individual consumers.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">These and other features, objects and advantages of the present invention will become better understood from a consideration of the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments in conjunction with the drawings as described following:</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a data flow diagram depicting a method according to an implementation of the invention.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an architectural diagram of a hardware and software computing system for implementing the method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> according to an implementation of the invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Before the present invention is described in further detail, it should be understood that the invention is not limited to the particular embodiments described in any section of the specification, and that the terms used in describing the particular embodiments are for the purpose of describing those particular embodiments only, and are not intended to be limiting, since the scope of the present invention will be limited only by the claims.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">A method according to an implementation of the present invention may be described with reference to the data flow diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Data controllers maintain records for data subjects as controller data subject records <b>10</b>. Typically, data subjects are customers (or potential customers). The number of such records may be quite large, with some companies maintaining records for millions of customers. The records include customer details, such as contact information, purchase history, buying preferences, demographic information, etc. Companies (data controllers) are interested in maintaining existing customers, gaining the confidence of new customers, and improving targeting effectiveness. Thus, companies gather information they believe will help this effort. To make the data effective for online targeted messaging, the customer records must be converted to a format that can be used by destination programmatic messaging platform or platforms <b>32</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Separate from data subject records <b>10</b>, a data controller maintains controller opt-out records <b>12</b>. These controller opt-out records <b>12</b> are maintained, as explained above, in order to comply with applicable privacy laws and to comply with the data controller's own stated privacy policies. When a data subject contacts a controller directing that controller to restrict processing in some way, the controller adds the subject's request to the opt-out records. The controller periodically transmits those controller opt-out records <b>12</b> to data processors, thus propagating the subject's request to other entities that might have access to the subject's data for purposes of managing a campaign. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, controller opt-out records <b>12</b> refers to the opt-out records sent to the data processor from one or more data controllers.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">When the data services provider (DSP) receives controller data subject records <b>10</b> from a data controller, it first pseudonymizes the records at pseudonymization step <b>16</b>. This means replacing any personally identifying information with anonymous identifiers. Further, the records are augmented with metadata, adding an identifier or tag corresponding to the data controller that supplied the records. The result of this step is a new data set, data subject records+metadata records <b>24</b>. For example, a record sent from car rental company Drive-Rite with &#x201c;John Doe, j.doe@mail.com&#x201d; might have the name and email replaced with &#x201c;f572d396fae9206628714fb2ce00f72e94f2258f&#x201d;, and a metadata tag added to note Drive-Rite as the data controller.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The anonymous identifiers are obtained through identity resolution processing step <b>22</b>. Identity resolution step <b>22</b> eliminates minor differences in the identifying information. Thus, if one controller has &#x201c;John Doe&#x201d; and another has &#x201c;John Q. Doe&#x201d;, both with the same email address, identity resolution <b>22</b> likely will return the same anonymous identifier for both records. This standardization ensures that the same anonymous identifier will be generated for the same consumer on a consistent basis. In one example, the anonymous identifier may be generated by applying a hashing algorithm. Any tiny difference in the input character strings to a hashing algorithm will result in a different anonymous identifier, so the standardization at identity resolution step <b>22</b> ensures that like consumers have like anonymous identifiers regardless of the data controller supplying the data. In this way, complementary data from different data controllers in a multi-controller environment may be used together to improve the results of the campaign.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">After substitution of personally identifiable data with anonymous identifiers occurs, there is no permanent account of the correspondence between the original identifying data (John Doe, j.doe@mail.com) and the anonymous data (&#x201c;f572d396fae9206628714fb2ce00f72e94f2258f&#x201d;). This translation thus blocks re-identification in both directions. Entities in the online world, such as destination programmatic messaging platforms <b>32</b>, cannot associate the anonymous identifier with a known person. Likewise, the original data controller cannot connect a known person with online activity. Two-way pseudonymization in certain implementations of the present invention thus protects a data subject's information from unethical data use.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The DSP relies on data controllers to forward opt-out data in the form of controller opt-out records <b>12</b> in addition to controller data subject records <b>10</b>. That is, regular controller data subject (customer) records <b>10</b> include identifying information and properties (purchase history, preferences, survey results, etc.). In contrast, controller opt-out records <b>12</b> include only identifying information, telling the DSP to place a given data subject (or subjects) on the controller-specific suppression list. When processing data from the controller, the DSP suppresses all records associated with any subject in the suppression list, as will be more fully set forth below.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">It will be understood that records for the same data subject must be coordinated through identity resolution step <b>22</b>, not only for matching anonymous identifiers but also to make the complementary data useful together. The controllers can use different identifying information (names, email, phone, address, etc.), with possible variations in content and spelling, but the effectiveness of the joint campaign relies on resolving the differences. Identity resolution step <b>22</b> creates a common understanding of data subject identities. After the pseudonymization process, all the original identifying information has been resolved, common identities have been determined, and the same anonymous identifiers have been assigned to matching records. The matching identifiers can be found in apply opt-outs step <b>26</b> for source identifiers, or in map identifiers to destination step <b>28</b> for destination identifiers, as more fully explained below. Each dataset remains distinct; the datasets themselves are not merged. But the anonymous identifiers have been chosen from a common framework, and that allows correlation of subject records across datasets from multiple data controllers. The shared framework for anonymous identifiers allows the opt-out processing to use a data subject's opt-out request, originally directed to any data controller and forwarded to the data processor, for the aggregate dataset. Any data subject's opt-out request, to any controller in the workflow, is applied to all records in the workflow.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">To initiate a multi-controller workflow, multiple companies send data records to the DSP and mutually authorize the DSP to combine their data for distribution to programmatic messaging platforms. To protect privacy, the data are not shared among the controllers. Each controller retains sole possession of the original controller data subject records <b>10</b> submitted by that controller. Note that in some cases, one or more controllers might not actually contribute data to the workflow, depending on the type of multi-controller arrangement. The key point here is that multiple controllers are associated with the workflow, even though only one set of incoming controller data is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> for clarity.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Information from multiple controllers is combined to build combined dataset step <b>20</b>. Without exchanging data, each controller benefits from the information contributed by the other controllers. For example, if one controller knows a customer likes to travel in April, and another controller knows the same customer stays in resort hotels, the combined information might be used to offer special pricing on a tropical spring vacation. Traditionally, each controller would have access only to the data it had collected. Any use for online targeted messaging would operate with boundaries, separating one controller's information from another.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">When processing controller opt-out records <b>12</b>, the DSP cannot rely on the controller opt-out records <b>12</b> containing every identity known for a data subject. For example, a regular controller data subject record <b>10</b> from a controller might include name, email, phone, and customer number. That same controller might send controller opt-out records <b>12</b> that contain only the customer number. The DSP performs identity resolution step <b>22</b> not only on the controller data subject records <b>10</b> but also on the controller opt-out records <b>12</b>, using previous, full data subject records to associate the customer number with a data subject's name, email, and phone number. Each of these attributes is added to the suppression list maintained for the given data controller. When processing subsequent data records and applying opt-out suppression at opt-out service <b>14</b>, this identity resolution step <b>22</b> allows the DSP to recognize records for the data subject that might have only a phone number, without specifically requiring every record to contain the opt-out record identifiers. Thus, the opt-out suppression process of opt-out service <b>14</b> more completely represents the data subject's intent, without requiring full coordination between the data controller and data processor.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">After forming the joint dataset at build combined dataset step <b>20</b>, the DSP workflow applies opt-out suppression at apply opt-outs step <b>26</b>. Data processors must respect the opt-out directives from data subjects (even when the directives are received indirectly through a data controller). That means dropping any record that belongs to a data subject with an opt-out request as identified in controller opt-out records <b>12</b>. When processing data from a single data controller, this checking is straightforward. If a person opts out with Controller C, the controller forwards that request to the DSP and updates the opt-out suppression list maintained for Controller C. When the DSP processes data on behalf of Controller C, it applies that specific suppression list and drops any records for data subjects in the list.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Applying opt-outs for multiple controllers involves subtlety to respect data subject rights. The combined dataset might include records for a given data subject, some of which are covered by an explicit opt-out and others that are not covered. For example, John Doe might have opted out with Fly-Rite airlines but not with Stay-Rite hotels. (Perhaps Doe travels frequently by car, often books rooms with Stay-Rite, and appreciates the discount coupons he receives by email.) In a single-controller workflow, Stay-Rite could use Doe's data. The situation changes, however, with multiple controllers. The combined dataset includes records from all controllers for the workflow. Each data subject record is the union of all such records from any controller in the workflow. The DSP supports data subject rights by applying the union of all controllers to every record. Thus, if a data subject has opted out with any data controller, that opt-out applies to the entire dataset. When suppressing records for opt-out processing, the workflow extracts the data subject from each record, contacts the opt-out service <b>14</b>, and requests the status for all data controllers from the joint campaign request <b>18</b>. The record identifiers include both input and output. Thus, it is possible that destination identifiers, known only in map identifiers to destination step <b>28</b>, may be subject to an opt-out directive. If an opt-out request exists for any controller, the DSP's workflow drops the record.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The remaining records are then prepared for transmission to destination programmatic messaging platform <b>32</b> at deliver data step <b>30</b>. This involves another anonymous identifier translation. The anonymous identifiers stored in the data subject records+metadata records <b>24</b> are kept internal to the DSP. Ethical treatment of data subject data ensures the two-way privacy mentioned above: data controllers cannot associate data subject records with specific online activity, and online programmatic messaging platforms cannot associate online activity with specific data subject records. Thus, the internal anonymous identifiers are transformed, replacing them with new identifiers created specifically for the destination programmatic messaging platform <b>32</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">It may be understood from the above walkthrough of the method that the DSP dynamically synthesizes a joint dataset when necessary, using component datasets provided by individual data controllers. Each controller manages its own dataset(s), without the involvement of other controllers. Data subjects are identified in unique ways, and the semantics of data in each dataset are specific to each controller. No prior agreements or technical exchanges among the controllers are needed to initiate a multi-controller workflow. Instead, the controllers contact the DSP, describe the individual datasets to use, specify what data to synthesize, and define what destination targeted messaging platform should receive the delivery.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">When creating a combined dataset, the DSP dynamically synthesizes a joint controller relationship. Regardless of the data controller associated with each component dataset, and thus regardless of the data controller for individual records and subject properties, the joint controller set is created to cover the entirety of the processing workflow. The joint controller set is used for all data regulation compliance, including opt-out processing. Record suppression, which normally applies a single data controller, uses the joint controller set. All controllers are applied to all records, enforcing the data subject's intent for exercising his or her opt-out rights. In a typical joint controller arrangement according to the prior art, all controllers would agree on data formats and content. Data subject (customer) records would be shared, and all controllers would have physical and semantic access to the information. In particular, the identification of data subjects would be done in one way, affecting all records in the dataset. This invention, as described in the implementations set forth herein, includes technology that allows full separation among the component datasets without any sharing of data between joint controllers. It thus automates compliance with applicable privacy laws and various data controller and processor privacy policies.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Critically, a multi-controller workflow as described above would not be allowed under many privacy laws without a system to enforce data subject rights on the aggregate dataset. These privacy laws specifically require data controllers to enforce data subject opt-out requests. By its structure, an aggregate dataset is subject to the opt-out directives from all the data controllers. Without a mechanism to enforce subject rights across the aggregate dataset, that aggregate dataset would violate the privacy laws existing in a number of jurisdictions.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">A hardware and software system for implementing the method just described according to an implementation of the present invention may be described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. This system may be implemented as virtual &#x201c;compute engines&#x201d; (shown as hexagons in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) in a cloud computing environment. Likewise, each storage system (shown as cylinders in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) may be implemented as virtual components in a cloud computing environment. Each such component may be physically implemented as one or more subcomponents, conceivably implemented on thousands of processors within a particular cloud computing environment or across multiple such environments. Likewise, the firewall switches (shown as rectangles in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) may include one or many public and private network switches and routers.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Data controller systems <b>50</b> communicate with public cloud platform <b>52</b> through a firewall <b>54</b>. Although only two data controller systems <b>50</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, it is understood that the present invention in various implementations may be used with any number of data controller systems <b>50</b>. This architecture allows for the storage of controller data subject records <b>10</b> and controller opt-out records <b>12</b> (as also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) for use by the DSP within public cloud platform <b>52</b>. Public cloud platform <b>52</b> may communicate with data processor cloud platform <b>56</b> through firewalls <b>54</b>. For the processing performed by the DSP, processor data subject records <b>11</b> and processor opt-out records <b>13</b> are stored locally at data processor cloud platform <b>56</b>. Likewise, prepared data storage <b>60</b> may be used for storage of the final result of the system, including data to be delivered at deliver data step <b>30</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Three different compute engines may be used to perform the processing steps shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>: ingestion compute engine <b>62</b>, workflow compute engine <b>64</b>, and delivery compute engine <b>66</b>. The results from delivery compute engine <b>66</b> are routed through the firewall <b>54</b> of data processor cloud platform <b>56</b> to one or more destination platforms <b>32</b>. This is a single example, but it should be understood that in alternative implementations of the present invention the processing steps may be divided into more or fewer logical compute engines or physical compute engines, as required given a particular cloud or non-cloud computing environment.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In addition to technologically allowing for joint campaigns while maintaining automatic compliance with privacy laws, in these implementations the present invention reduces the associated computational cost of performing the required processing. As noted above, a campaign with three data controllers could be simulated by running three separate workflows. Each workflow would process a single dataset and apply the data controllers' required processing. These individual workflows incur overhead for scheduling, resource allocation, execution, monitoring, etc. If a single workflow costs 1&#xd7;W to compute, then three workflows would cost approximately 3&#xd7;W. But a joint campaign as described herein changes this computational cost structure significantly. All three datasets may be processed in parallel in a single workflow. Moreover, the processing to enforce data regulation can be done once on the combined controller set, adding virtually no incremental cost over a single controller. Again, if the cost of a single dataset's workflow is 1&#xd7;W, the cost of a joint campaign with three datasets in these implementations of the present invention is roughly 1&#xd7;(W+3i), where &#x201c;i&#x201d; represents the incremental cost. As a practical matter, it will be seen that 1&#xd7;(W+3i) will be much less than 3&#xd7;W. Suppose, for example, that the basic workflow cost is W=100, and the incremental cost of a joint campaign is i=5. That is, running the joint workflow adds 5% computing complexity for each dataset in the workflow. It will be seen then that the cost for three individual workflows is 3&#xd7;W=300, whereas the cost for a joint campaign is only 1&#xd7;(W+3i)=115. Thus, the invention in these implementations both improves functionality, allows for compliance with applicable privacy laws, and reduces aggregate computing costs, all at the same time. These computing cost savings increase as the number of participating controllers in the joint campaign increases, thus leading to even greater efficiency in campaigns with a larger number of controllers contributing data.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the implementations described herein and in various alternative implementations, the present invention may be implemented by any combination of hardware and software.
