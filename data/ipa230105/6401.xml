For example, F-type connectors include a connector member (also referred to as a PCB mount jack, a PCB mount plug, or simply a plug) and a receptacle member (also referred to as an enclosure mount jack, or simply a jack). G-type connectors are similar to F-type RF connectors, but feature slide-on/push-on capabilities to removably couple a connector member into a corresponding receptacle member.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Existing CATV nodes and amplifies, for example, utilize G-type and/or F-type RF connectors to provide a coaxial connector interface between the launch amplifier module and the weather tight enclosure. This coaxial connector interface allows for the modularity and ease of use that end-use customers require. These connectors have industry standard dimensions for the mating interface that dictates the external body diameter.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Such G-type and F-type connectors have historically worked well and provide a robust interface. However, as demand for higher current passing capability has risen over the years, the internal geometry of the connector has been adjusted/modified to include a larger conducting center pin diameter, for example. Likewise, and at the same time, the target frequency requirements have also increased from 550 MHz to present day production product of 1.2 GHz.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">As new voice and data products are being developed, and particularly high-definition products, CATV devices increasingly require connectors that can achieve frequencies greater than 1.2 Ghz.</p><?summary-of-invention

end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Existing connectors for use within CATV devices, such as the G-type and F-type connectors, struggle to exceed 1.2 Ghz service, let alone the future requirements of 3.0 Ghz service. This limitation is largely attributed to the physical geometry of G-type and F-type connectors that impact controlled characteristic impedance. For example, connector designers have remained within the external/outer dimensional standard of the G-type connector, and to achieve ever-greater frequencies, designers have increased the internal diameter of the G-type connector to an extent that that strength and structural integrity is sacrificed by virtue of the relatively thin body walls.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">End customers, namely cable TV and internet providers, already have thousands of existing CATV nodes and amplifiers installed in the field, and the removal and replacement of such CATV devices is impractical. Removal requires severing a node or amplifier out of the network (e.g., physically detaching the node/amplifier from the CATV network), which results in significant down time and expense. An aim of the present disclosure is to maintain the modularity of a removable CATV device, which has long been the advantage of the G-type connector interface.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">One aim of the present disclosure is therefore to avoid severing the coax connection to a CATV device housing/enclosure in order to maintain the hardline network coaxial cable connection. Likewise, requiring external modification of existing CATV device housings to accommodate coaxial connectors with enlarged, non-standard dimensions is impractical as this would require replacement of potentially thousands, or tens of thousands, of existing CATV enclosures to achieve production frequencies beyond 1.2 GHz.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Thus, the present disclosure is generally directed to an RF connector assembly that includes an increased outer diameter of the connector member relative to the equivalent G-type connector and an increased inner diameter of the receptable member relative to the equivalent G-type receptacle (also referred to herein as a seizure nut) to achieve higher current carrying capacity (e.g., 15 Amps (A) minimum continuous and 25 A for two hours) and target production frequency rates. Preferably, a connecter assembly consistent with the present disclosure can achieve production frequencies of at least 1.8 Ghz, and more preferably, 1.8-3.0 Gh. In one preferred example, this results in an RF connector assembly consistent with the present disclosure having a connector member with a mating section that includes an outer diameter of at least 10.70 mm, and more preferably 10.76&#xb1;0.01 mm, rather than the 9.4 mm diameter of the mating sections of existing G-type connectors. Likewise, an RF connector assembly consistent with the present disclosure has a receptacle member that provides a receptacle with an inner diameter equal to or less than the outer diameter of the mating section of the corresponding connector member to enable a friction/push fit.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Note, this disclosure has identified that increased dimensional changes for RF connector assemblies enables greater current carrying capacity and production performance in excess of 1.2 Ghz. However, the present disclosure has further identified that in some scenarios signal quality, such as return loss, can fall below acceptable power thresholds based on the dimensional changes negatively impacting impedance characteristics for the RF connector assembly. Thus, the present disclosure has identified that an RF connector assembly consistent with the present disclosure can utilize increased connector dimensions as well as specific materials and material configurations to achieve a functional impedance equivalent to a target impedance characteristic, e.g., 75 ohms. One such example configuration includes utilizing polymer materials such as polymethylpentene, polyoxymethylene (POM), and Polytetrafluoroethylene for the dielectric insulator (also referred to herein as simply an insulator) of the RF connector assembly and plastics for the dielectric constant. Alternatively, or in addition, such target impedance characteristics may be achieved by introducing structural changes to the insulator of the receptacle member such as air voids to adjust characteristic impedance, as will be discussed further below.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Accordingly, an RF connector assembly consistent with the present disclosure can achieve, for instance, 1.8-3.0 Ghz production performance while maintaining nominal signal power (e.g., return loss at or below &#x2212;25 dB, and more preferably at or below &#x2212;30 dB), as will be discussed in greater detail below with regard to the experimental results shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>-<b>10</b></figref>. In addition, an RF connector assembly consistent with the present disclosure can be advantageously used as a field upgrade for existing F-type and/or G-type connectors without necessarily requiring severing of a CATV node/amplifier from the CATV network to perform the upgrade, and without requiring modification of the external enclosure of the CATV node/amplifier to achieve production frequencies beyond 1.2 Ghz.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The term &#x201c;coupled&#x201d; as used herein refers to any connection, coupling, link or the like between elements. Such &#x201c;coupled&#x201d; elements are not necessarily directly connected to one another and may be separated by intermediate components.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The term substantially, as generally referred to herein, refers to a degree of precision within acceptable tolerance that accounts for and reflects minor real-world variation due to material composition, material defects, and/or limitations/peculiarities in manufacturing processes. Such variation may therefore be said to achieve largely, but not necessarily wholly, the stated/target characteristic. To provide one non-limiting numerical example to quantify &#x201c;substantially,&#x201d; such a modifier is intended to include minor variation that can cause a deviation of up to and including &#xb1;5% from a particular stated quality/characteristic unless otherwise provided by the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>2</b></figref> show an example CATV amplifier <b>100</b> for use in a CATV network, in accordance with aspects of the present disclosure. As shown, the CATV amplifier <b>100</b> includes a housing shown collectively as <b>102</b> and individual as first and second housing portions <b>102</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>102</b>-<b>2</b>. The housing <b>102</b> may also be referred to as an external enclosure, or simply an enclosure. The first and second housing portions <b>102</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>102</b>-<b>2</b> are preferably configured to couple together and form a cavity therebetween. Preferably, the first and second housing portions <b>102</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>102</b>-<b>2</b> are rotatably coupled to each other via hinges <b>103</b>. The first housing portion <b>102</b>-<b>1</b> is further preferably configured to fixedly/securely mount to a vertical surface such as a wall or other suitable location. Accordingly, the first housing portion <b>102</b>-<b>1</b> can remain fixed to the mounting location while the second housing portion <b>102</b>-<b>2</b> can rotate relative to the first housing portion <b>102</b>-<b>1</b> via hinges <b>103</b> to transition between an open configuration (such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) and closed configuration (not shown).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The housing <b>102</b> is preferably a weatherized enclosure that is configured to prevent ingress of water and dust. The housing <b>102</b> further preferably comprises a plastic such as an ultraviolet (UV) stabilized plastic, although other materials are within the scope of this disclosure. In one preferred example, the housing <b>102</b> comports with the CATV enclosure standard published as the IP68 standard.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The CATV amplifier <b>100</b> includes at least one CATV module disposed thereon. For example, and as shown, the CATV amplifier <b>100</b> includes two CATV modules, namely an amplifier module <b>104</b> disposed within the first housing portion <b>102</b>-<b>1</b> and a power supply module <b>106</b> disposed in the second housing portion <b>102</b>-<b>2</b>. The amplifier module <b>104</b> may also be referred to herein as an RF module.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Note, this disclosure is not necessarily limited in this regard and other CATV module types are within the scope of this disclosure such as modules that support node operations, e.g., hybrid fiber-coaxial (HFC) transceiver modules, and power conditioning/supply circuitry. Preferably, each of the first and second housing portions <b>102</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>102</b>-<b>2</b> include a different CATV module, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>2</b></figref>, and more preferably, the first housing portion <b>102</b>-<b>1</b> includes an RF module mounted therein, such as the amplifier module <b>104</b>, and the second housing portion <b>102</b>-<b>2</b> includes a power supply module mounted therein, such as the power supply module <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The power supply module <b>106</b> preferably comprises one or more components/circuits such as DC-DC step-down converters, rectifiers, filters and/or other power conditioning circuitry. More preferably, the power supply module <b>106</b> is configured to output a DC voltage in a range of 35 to 90 volts for use by the amplifier module <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Preferably, the amplifier module <b>104</b> remains coupled to the first housing portion <b>102</b>-<b>1</b> and the power supply module <b>106</b> remains coupled to the second housing portion <b>102</b>-<b>2</b> when the housing <b>102</b> is transitioned to an open configuration, e.g., when the first and second housing portions <b>102</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>102</b>-<b>2</b> are rotated away from each other via the hinges <b>103</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The housing <b>102</b> further preferably includes at least one coaxial seizure assembly, which may also be referred to herein as coaxial enclosure receptacles.
