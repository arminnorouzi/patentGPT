The invention also relates to plants, plant parts, plant seeds, plant cells, agricultural products, and methods related to event MON 87411 and provides nucleotide molecules that are unique to the event and were created in connection with the insertion of transgenic DNA into the genome of a <i>Zea mays </i>plant.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Corn (<i>Zea mays</i>) is an important crop in many areas of the world, and the methods of biotechnology have been applied to this crop in order to produce corn with desirable traits. The expression of an insect resistance or herbicide tolerance transgene in a plant can confer the desirable traits of insect resistance and/or herbicide tolerance on the plant, but expression of such transgenes may be influenced by many different factors including the orientation and composition of the cassettes driving expression of the individual genes transferred to the plant chromosome, and the chromosomal location and the genomic result of the transgene insertion. For example, there can be variation in the level and pattern of transgene expression among individual events that are otherwise identical except for the chromosomal insertion site of the transgene. There may also be undesirable phenotypic or agronomic differences between some events. Therefore, it is often necessary to produce and analyze a large number of individual plant transformation events in order to select an event having superior properties relative to the desirable trait and the optimal phenotypic and agricultural characteristics necessary to make it suitable for commercial purposes. Such selection often requires extensive molecular characterization as well as greenhouse and field trials with many events over multiple years, in multiple locations, and under a variety of conditions so that a significant amount of agronomic, phenotypic, and molecular data may be collected. The resulting data and observations must then be analyzed by teams of scientists and agronomists with the goal of selecting a commercially suitable event. Once selected, such an event may then be used for introgressing the desirable trait into other genetic backgrounds using plant breeding methods, and thus producing a number of different crop varieties that contain the desirable trait and are suitably adapted to specific local growing conditions.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">To make a transgenic plant containing a single transformation event, a portion of a recombinant DNA construct is transferred into the genome of a corn cell, and the corn cell is subsequently grown into a plant. A corn cell into which the event is initially transferred is regenerated to produce the R<sub>0 </sub>generation. The R<sub>0 </sub>plant and progeny plants from the R<sub>0 </sub>plant can be tested for any desired trait(s), but the effectiveness of the event can be impacted by cis and/or trans factors relative to the integration site in the transformation event. The phenotype conferred by the event can also be impacted by the size and design of the DNA construct, which can vary by the combination of genetic elements in an expression cassette, number of transgenes, number of expression cassettes, and configuration of such elements and such cassettes. Identifying an event with desirable traits can be further complicated by factors such as plant developmental, diurnal, temporal, or spatial patterns of transgene expression; or by extrinsic factors, e.g., environmental plant growth conditions, water availability, nitrogen availability, heat, or stress. Thus, the ability to obtain an event conferring a desirable set of phenotypic traits is not readily predictable.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The inventors have identified a transgenic corn event MON 87411 exhibiting superior properties and performance compared to existing transgenic corn plants and to new events constructed in parallel. The corn event MON 87411 contains three linked expression cassettes which collectively confer the traits of corn rootworm resistance and glyphosate herbicide tolerance to corn cells, corn tissues, corn seed and corn plants containing the transgenic event MON 87411. The corn event MON 87411 provides two modes of action against corn rootworm pest species (including <i>Diabrotica </i>spp., especially when the pest is <i>Diabrotica virgifera virgifera </i>(Western Corn Rootworm, WCR), <i>Diabrotica barberi </i>(Northern Corn Rootworm, NCR), <i>Diabrotica virgifera zeae </i>(Mexican Corn Rootworm, MCR), <i>Diabrotica balteata </i>(Brazilian Corn Rootworm (BZR) or Brazilian Corn Rootworm complex (BCR) consisting of <i>Diabrotica viridula </i>and <i>Diabrotica speciosa</i>), or <i>Diabrotica undecimpunctata howardii </i>(Southern Corn Rootworm, SCR)). Dual modes of action provide redundancy and reduces significantly the likelihood of the development of resistance to the pest control traits.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The event MON 87411 is characterized by specific unique DNA segments that are useful in detecting the presence of the event in a sample. A sample is intended to refer to a composition that is either substantially pure corn DNA or a composition that contains corn DNA. In either case, the sample is a biological sample, i.e., it contains biological materials, including but not limited to DNA obtained or derived from, either directly or indirectly, from the genome of corn event MON 87411. &#x201c;Directly&#x201d; refers to the ability of the skilled artisan to directly obtain DNA from the corn genome by fracturing corn cells (or by obtaining samples of corn that contain fractured corn cells) and exposing the genome DNA for the purposes of detection. &#x201c;Indirectly&#x201d; refers to the ability of the skilled artisan to obtain the target or specific reference DNA, i.e. a novel and unique junction segment described herein as being diagnostic for the presence of the event MON 87411 in a particular sample, by means other than by direct via fracturing of corn cells or obtaining a sample of corn that contains fractured corn cells. Such indirect means include but are not limited to amplification of a DNA segment that contains the DNA sequence targeted by a particular probe designed to bind with specificity to the target sequence, or amplification of a DNA segment that can be measured and characterized, i.e. measured by separation from other segments of DNA through some efficient matrix such as an agarose or acrylamide gel or the like, or characterized by direct sequence analysis of the amplicon or cloning of the amplicon into a vector and direct sequencing of the inserted amplicon present within such vector. Alternatively, a segment of DNA corresponding to the position within the corn chromosome at which the transgenic DNA was inserted into the corn chromosome and which can be used to define the event MON 87411, can be cloned by various means and then identified and characterized for its presence in a particular sample or in a particular corn genome. Such DNA segments are referred to as junction segments or sequences, and can be any length of inserted DNA and adjacent (flanking) corn chromosome DNA so long as the point of joining between the inserted DNA and the corn genome is included in the segment. SEQ ID NO:12 and SEQ ID NO:21 and the reverse complement of each of these are representative of such segments.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The specific sequences identified herein may be present uniquely in event MON 87411, or the construct comprised therein, and the identification of these sequences, whether by direct sequence analysis, by detecting probes bound to such sequences, or by observing the size and perhaps the composition of particular amplicons described herein, when present in a particular corn germplasm or genome and/or present in a particular biological sample containing corn DNA, are diagnostic for the presence of the event MON 87411, or the construct comprised therein, in such sample. It is known that the flanking genomic segments (i.e., the corn genome segments of DNA sequence adjacent to the inserted transgenic DNA) are subject to slight variability and as such, the limitation of at least 99% or greater identity is with reference to such anomalies or polymorphisms from corn genome to corn genome. Nucleotide segments that are completely complementary across their length in comparison to the particular diagnostic sequences referenced herein are intended to be within the scope of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The position of the nucleotide segments of the present invention relative to each other and within the corn genome are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> and the nucleotide sequence of each is illustrated as set forth in SEQ ID NO:1. Nucleotide segments that characterize the event MON 87411 and which are diagnostic for the presence of event MON 87411, or the construct comprised therein, in a sample include SEQ ID NO:1, SEQ ID NO:2, SEQ ID NO:3, SEQ ID NO:4, SEQ ID NO:5, SEQ ID NO:6, SEQ ID NO:7, SEQ ID NO:8, SEQ ID NO:9, SEQ ID NO:10, SEQ ID NO:12, SEQ ID NO:14, SEQ ID NO:16, SEQ ID NO:18, SEQ ID NO:19, SEQ ID NO:20, SEQ ID NO:21, SEQ ID NO:22, SEQ ID NO:23, SEQ ID NO:24, and SEQ ID NO:25; SEQ ID NO:41, SEQ ID NO:42, SEQ ID NO:43, SEQ ID NO:44, SEQ ID NO:45, SEQ ID NO:49, SEQ ID NO:50, SEQ ID NO:51, or SEQ ID NO:52. These presence of one, or two, or more of these nucleotide sequences in a sample, when such sample contains corn tissue and thus corn DNA, are diagnostic for the presence of the event MON 87411, or the construct comprised therein. It is intended by use of the word &#x201c;derived&#x201d;, that a particular DNA molecule is in the corn plant genome, or is capable of being detected in corn plant DNA. &#x201c;Capable of being detected&#x201d; refers to the ability of a particular DNA segment to be amplified and its size and or sequence characterized or elucidated by DNA sequence analysis, and can also refer to the ability of a probe to bind specifically to the particular DNA segment, i.e. the target DNA segment, and the subsequent ability to detect the binding of the probe to the target. The particular DNA segment or target DNA segment of the present invention is present within corn that contains the insertion event MON 87411.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">By reference to corn it is intended that corn cells, corn seed, corn plant parts and corn plants are within the scope of the present invention so long as each embodiment contains a detectable amount of DNA corresponding to any one, two, or more of the segments that are described herein as being diagnostic for the presence of the corn event MON 87411 DNA. Corn plant parts include cells; pollen; ovules pods; flowers and flower parts such as the cob, silk, and tassel; root tissue; stem tissue; and leaf tissue. Commodity products that are made from corn in which a detectable amount of the segments of DNA described herein as being diagnostic for the presence of the event MON 87411 are within the scope of the invention. Such commodity products may include whole or processed corn seeds, animal feed containing corn or corn by-products, corn oil, corn meal, corn flour, corn starch, corn flakes, corn bran, corn biomass and stover, and fuel products and fuel by-products when made from corn or corn plants and plant parts.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The DNA of corn event MON 87411 is typically present in each cell and in each chromosome of the corn plant, corn seed, and corn tissues containing the event. As the corn genome is transmitted to progeny in Mendelian fashion, if a corn plant were homozygous, each progeny corn plant and cell would contain the event DNA on each of the parental chromosomes generated to the progeny from the parent(s). However, if the corn genome containing the event MON 87411 DNA is a heterozygous or hybrid parent, then only fifty percent of the pollen and fifty percent of the ovules engaged in mating from hybrid parents will contain the corn event MON 87411 DNA, resulting in a mixed population of progeny that contain the event MON 87411 DNA, and the percentage of such progeny arising from such crosses with hybrids can range anywhere from about fifty to about seventy five percent having the event MON 87411 DNA transmitted to such progeny.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The DNA molecules of the present invention may be unique to the corn event MON 87411 inserted DNA or the two junctions between the transgenic inserted DNA and the corn genome DNA that is adjacent to either end of the inserted DNA. These molecules, when present in a particular sample analyzed by the methods described herein using the probes, primers and in some cases using DNA sequence analysis, may be diagnostic for the presence of an amount of event MON 87411 corn in that sample. Such DNA molecules unique to the corn event MON 87411 DNA can be identified and characterized in a number of ways, including by use of probe nucleic acid molecules designed to bind specifically to the unique DNA molecules followed by detection of the binding of such probes to the unique DNA, and by thermal amplification methods that use at least two different DNA molecules that act as probes but the sequence of such molecules may be somewhat less specific than the probes described above. The skilled artisan understands that contacting a particular target DNA with a probe or primer under appropriate hybridization conditions will result in the binding of the probe or primer to the targeted DNA segment.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The DNA molecules of the present invention that are target segments of DNA are capable of amplification and, when detected as one or more amplicons of the represented length obtained by amplification methods of a particular sample, may be diagnostic for the presence of event MON 87411, or the construct comprised therein, in such sample. Such DNA molecules or polynucleotide segments have the nucleotide sequences as set forth in each of, SEQ ID NO:1, SEQ ID NO:2, SEQ ID NO:3, SEQ ID NO:4, SEQ ID NO:5, SEQ ID NO:6, SEQ ID NO:7, SEQ ID NO:8, SEQ ID NO:9, SEQ ID NO:10, SEQ ID NO:12, SEQ ID NO:14, SEQ ID NO:16, SEQ ID NO:21, SEQ ID NO:25, SEQ ID NO:41, SEQ ID NO:42, SEQ ID NO:43, SEQ ID NO:44, SEQ ID NO:45, SEQ ID NO:49, SEQ ID NO:50, SEQ ID NO:51, and SEQ ID NO:52, and are further defined herein and in the examples below. Primer molecules and/or probes may be provided in kit form along with the necessary reagents, including controls, and packaged together with instructions for use.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Recombinant DNA molecules of the present invention are deemed to be within the scope of the present invention when present within or derived from a microorganism. A microorganism is intended to include any microscopic cell, whether prokaryote or eukaryote or otherwise that contains DNA within a genome or chromosome or an extra-chromosomal DNA structure more commonly referred to as a plasmid or vector. Microscopic organisms include bacteria (prokaryotes) and cells corresponding to higher life forms (eukaryotes) which are beneath the visual range of the average human, typically beneath fifty cubic microns and more generally beneath ten cubic microns. Bacteria are common microscopic microorganisms that more likely than not could contain a vector or plasmid that contains one or more or all of the novel DNA segments of the present invention, including each of the respective expression cassettes present as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1. Plant cells and particularly corn plant cells are within the scope of the invention when these contain any one, two, or more or all of the novel DNA segments of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Probes for use herein are typically characterized as DNA molecules or polynucleotide segments of sufficient length to function under stringent hybridization conditions as defined herein to bind with a particular target DNA segment, i.e., a unique segment of DNA present within and diagnostic for the presence of, event MON 87741 DNA in a sample. Such a probe can be designed to bind only to a single junction or other novel sequence present only in the corn event MON 87411 DNA, or to two or more such single junction segments. In any event, the detection of the binding of such a probe to a DNA molecule in a particular sample suspected of containing corn DNA is diagnostic for the presence of corn event MON 87411 in the sample.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Primers are typically provided as pairs of different oligonucleotides or polynucleotide segments for use in a thermal amplification reaction which amplifies a particular DNA target segment. Each primer in the pair is designed to bind to a rather specific segment of DNA within or near to a segment of DNA of interest for amplification. The primers bind in such way that these then act as localized regions of nucleic acid sequence polymerization resulting in the production of one or more amplicons (amplified target segments of DNA). In the present invention, use of primers designed to bind to unique segments of corn event MON 87411 DNA in a particular biological sample and that amplify particular amplicons containing one or more of the junction segments described herein, and the detection and or characterization of such amplicons upon completion or termination of the polymerase reaction, is diagnostic for the presence of the corn event MON 87411 in the particular sample. The skilled artisan is well familiar with this amplification method and no recitation of the specifics of amplification is necessary here.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Corn plants, corn plant cells, corn plant tissues and corn seed are insensitive to glyphosate herbicide applications due to expression of a glyphosate insensitive CP4 EPSPS enzyme from a rice Rcc3 promoter in an expression cassette at the 3&#x2032; distal end as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1. Such seed may be sown into a field. Several days after germination and the appearance of shoots, a weed controlling effective amount of glyphosate herbicide may be applied, which will eliminate substantially all of the weeds in the field but will allow for the continued growth and development of corn plants containing the corn event MON 87411 DNA. The plants are also resistant to infestation by corn rootworms of all known species of rootworm <i>Diabrotica</i>, including but not limited to <i>Diabrotica virgifera virgifera </i>(Western Corn Rootworm, WCR), <i>Diabrotica barberi </i>(Northern Corn Rootworm, NCR), <i>Diabrotica virgifera zeae </i>(Mexican Corn Rootworm, MCR), <i>Diabrotica balteata </i>(Brazilian Corn Rootworm (BZR) or Brazilian Corn Rootworm complex (BCR) consisting of <i>Diabrotica viridula </i>and <i>Diabrotica speciosa</i>), and <i>Diabrotica undecimpunctata howardii </i>(Southern Corn Rootworm, SCR). The resistance to <i>Diabrotica </i>species arises in connection with the expression of two different DNA segments that are operably and covalently linked within the inserted transgenic DNA: a dsRNA is transcribed from the expression cassette at the 5&#x2032; proximal end of the inserted transgenic DNA as set forth in SEQ ID NO:1 and as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> by the position of [G] SEQ ID NO:12, and targets for suppression an essential gene in corn rootworms; and a coleopteran toxic Cry3Bb protein is expressed from an expression cassette (approximately centered in SEQ ID NO:1 as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> by the position of [H] SEQ ID NO: 14) centered between the cassette expressing dsRNA [G] and the cassette at the 3&#x2032; distal end of the inserted transgenic DNA as set forth in SEQ ID NO:1 (a glyphosate tolerance expression cassette illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> by [I] SEQ ID NO:16). The dsRNA targets for suppression a yeast orthologous gene referred to as snf7 and is expressed from a CAMV e35S promoter, while the Cry3Bb protein is expressed from a <i>Zea mays </i>PIIG promoter. The dsRNA and the Cry3Bb protein are agents toxic to corn rootworm species.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The promoters driving expression of the dsRNA and Cry3Bb toxic agents are divergently positioned so that expression from each promoter of the respective toxic agent is away from a point centered between the two promoters, i.e., transcription of each expression cassette proceeds in opposite directions and does not converge. The glyphosate tolerance CP4 EPSPS expression cassette is downstream of, i.e. proximal to the 3&#x2032; end as set forth in SEQ ID NO:1 and 3&#x2032; distal to the cassette driving expression of the Cry3Bb protein. The cassettes driving expression of Cry3Bb and EPSPS produce their respective proteins using a tandem orientation of transcription, Cry3Bb upstream of the EPSPS, and transcribed in the same orientation, but each from their separate respective promoters. Leaving the dsRNA expression cassette and the glyphosate tolerance cassette intact and positioned at the distal ends of the DNA segment intended for insertion into the corn genome, other variant constructs were produced in which the orientation of the Cry3Bb cassette was inverted or reversed relative to the design present in the event MON 87411 DNA. These variant constructs utilized the <i>Zea mays </i>PIIG promoter or a rice Rcc3 promoter to drive expression of Cry3Bb.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Transgenic events containing only these variant constructs/orientations of the Cry3Bb expression cassette were compared to the event MON 87411 and to the currently available commercial events MON863 (containing only a Cry3Bb expression cassette), MON88017 (containing a Cry3Bb expression cassette operably linked to a CP4 EPSPS expression cassette), and DAS-59122-7 (containing three operably linked expression cassettes, two expressing in tandem the dual Bt toxin components Cry34 and Cry35 along with a gene conferring glufosinate tolerance). The results as illustrated below in the examples show that the event MON 87411 exhibited superior properties for root directed expression of the Cry3Bb protein and the plurality of transgenic events produced using the construct used for generating the event MON 87411 were each more likely than other events produced with other constructs to exhibit efficacious control of corn rootworms.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Corn plants of the present invention and parts thereof including seed, each containing the DNA corresponding to event MON 87411, are within the scope of the present invention. Such plants are resistant to corn rootworm infestation and are insensitive to applications of the herbicide glyphosate. Such plants include hybrids containing only one MON 87411 allele, i.e., a genome characterized as heterozygous with reference to the locus corresponding to the event MON 87411 DNA. Such hybrids are produced by breeding with desirable germplasm to insure hybrid vigor and other agriculturally desirable properties of corn. Hybrids may be produced by any number of methods but a preferred method takes advantage of a first inbred (homozygous) parent that contains the event MON 87411 specific allele on both chromosomes at the locus at which the event MON 87411 DNA is inserted, and breeding the first inbred together with a second inbred which does not contain the MON 87411 DNA. Both parental inbred varieties will have one or more advantageous properties desirable in the progeny seed, i.e. the hybrid seed.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">A transgenic property or allele conferring some additional trait to a plant containing the event MON 87411 DNA is particularly desirable. Such transgenic alleles include other transgenic events conferring corn rootworm resistance, including but not limited to events such as DAS-59122-7; MIR604; and 5307. Each of these events provides a supplemental corn rootworm toxic agent (DAS-59122-7 provides PS149B1 (Cry34/Cry35) exhibiting rootworm toxic properties and herbicide tolerance to glufosinate; MIR604 provides a modified Cry3Aa exhibiting rootworm toxic properties; event 5307 provides FR8a gene exhibiting rootworm toxic properties). Providing additional corn rootworm resistance traits such as these may decrease the likelihood of the development of resistance to any one of the corn rootworm toxic agents provided. Other desirable traits include yield and stress resistance or tolerance traits, nitrogen fixation traits, traits modulating the use of water, resistance to fungal infestation, resistance to herbicides such as dicamba (MON 87427), glufosinate, and the like, as well as resistance to lepidopteran infestations. Lepidopteran infestation resistance traits have been provided in the art and include the transgenic corn events (and respective lepidopteran active proteins) MON810 (Cry1Ab), MON 89034 (Cry1A.105 and Cry2Ab); TC1507 (Cry1Ac and Cry1Fa); DAS-06275-8 also known as TC-6275 (Cry1Fa and bar (providing glufosinate tolerance)); MIR162 (Vip3Aa), BT176 (Cry1Ab); and BT11 (Cry1Ab).</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">An alternative to providing any combination or all of these traits in a single plant, particularly the insect resistance traits corresponding to the event MON 87411 traits, the other listed corn rootworm resistance traits, or the lepidopteran resistance traits, would be to provide these in various combinations of seed blends, in which certain seed in the blend contain the MON 87411 traits and some combination of only the listed coleopteran resistance traits and act together below the ground to prevent infestations of corn rootworms, while other seed in the blend contain only the lepidopteran resistance traits and confer resistance to lepidopteran infestations of corn above the ground. In this way, the seed in the blend provide refuge for each other, i.e. the coleopteran protected seed and plants act as a refuge for the plants conferring lepidopteran resistance, and vice versa. Typically however, these traits would be provided in some trait combination or package in which the MON 87411 traits would be provided together in a single plant by breeding with one or more of the lepidopteran resistance traits to provide a complete package of pest resistance to the crop in the field, and a small percentage of the seed (perhaps between 1 and 20 percent or any number in between including 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, or 19 percent) would be traited only for herbicide tolerance and would lack any pest protection traits and would be planted into the field in a mix randomly with the pest resistance traited seed or as a structured (separate) stand of crops would act as a refuge both for the pests that attack corn plants above the ground and pests that attack corn plants below the ground.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In one aspect, the invention therefore provides a method of protecting a field of corn plants comprising cultivating a field of corn plants comprised of from about 50 to about 100 percent of corn plants comprising corn event MON 87411.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The construct inserted into the event MON 87411 provides particular advantages relative to the EPSPS expression cassette. First, the presence of this cassette provides for ease of selection of the transgenic events into which the construct has been inserted. Second, the cassette provides for control of weeds in a field into which seed corresponding to event MON 87411 have been planted. The field containing such MON 87411 plants can be sprayed with an effective amount of glyphosate to control the growth of weeks in the field that are susceptible to glyphosate.

The corn event MON 87411 contains three operably linked expression cassettes which collectively confer the traits of corn rootworm resistance and glyphosate herbicide tolerance to corn cells, corn tissues, corn seed and corn plants containing the transgenic event MON 87411. The corn event MON 87411 provides two modes of action against corn rootworm pest species (including <i>Diabrotica </i>spp., especially when the pest is <i>Diabrotica virgifera virgifera </i>(Western Corn Rootworm, WCR), <i>Diabrotica barberi </i>(Northern Corn Rootworm, NCR), <i>Diabrotica virgifera zeae </i>(Mexican Corn Rootworm, MCR), <i>Diabrotica balteata </i>(Brazilian Corn Rootworm (BZR) or Brazilian Corn Rootworm complex (BCR) consisting of <i>Diabrotica viridula </i>and <i>Diabrotica speciosa</i>), or <i>Diabrotica undecimpunctata howardii </i>(Southern Corn Rootworm, SCR)). Other transgenic corn events have been referenced in the art that provide various embodiments conferred singly, such as MON863 (conferring the trait of resistance to corn rootworms by expression of a Cry3Bb insecticidal toxin protein), or transgenic corn events providing two or more traits such as in corn event MON88017 (conferring the trait of resistance to corn rootworms by expression of a Cry3Bb insecticidal toxin protein and the trait of resistance to glyphosate herbicide by expression of a glyphosate insensitive EPSPS) and corn event DAS 59122-7 (conferring the trait of resistance to corn rootworms by expression of a binary <i>Bacillus thuringiensis </i>toxin PS149B1, also known as Cry34/Cry35, and the trait of tolerance to the herbicide glufosinate). Other art discloses the combination by breeding of the traits conferred by the corn events MON88017 or DAS 59122-7 with a transgenic corn event conferring the trait of corn rootworm resistance resulting from the expression of a dsRNA targeting for suppression a corn rootworm gene essential for the rootworms' survival (U.S. Pat. No. 7,943,819). Inherent in such combinations are the problems associated with the need for breeding these multiple traits located in multiple different loci and on multiple chromosomes within the corn genome together into a single corn plant and maintaining those traits as hybrids in dozens if not hundreds of different corn germplasm varieties. The solution for such problems would be to include combinations of these traits together in a single locus. The inventors herein provide one such solution to the problem in the form of the corn event MON 87411, which combines three covalently linked expression cassettes together in a single locus within the corn genome, these expression cassettes conferring the traits of corn rootworm resistance and glyphosate herbicide tolerance to the corn cells, corn tissues, corn seed and corn plants containing the transgenic event MON87411. Use of corn event MON 87411 provides major benefits to corn growers: a) protection from economic losses due to the corn rootworm larvae by providing two different corn rootworm resistance modes of action, and b) the ability to apply glyphosate containing agricultural herbicides to the corn crop for broad-spectrum weed control. Additionally, the transgenes encoding the corn rootworm and glyphosate tolerant traits are linked on the same DNA segment and occur at a single locus in the genome of MON 87411, providing for enhanced breeding efficiency and enables the use of molecular markers to track the transgene insert in the breeding populations and progeny thereof.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">The corn event MON 87411 was produced by an <i>Agrobacterium </i>mediated transformation process of an inbred corn line with the plasmid construct pMON120417. This plasmid construct contains the linked plant expression cassettes with the regulatory genetic elements necessary for expression in corn plant cells of a CP4 EPSPS protein, as well as a Cry3Bb protein and a dsRNA targeting for suppression an essential gene in the cells of corn rootworms when corn cells containing corn event MON 87411 are provided in the diet of such corn rootworms. Corn cells were regenerated into intact corn plants and individual plants were selected from the population of plants that showed integrity of the plant expression cassettes and resistance to glyphosate and corn rootworm larvae feeding damage. A corn plant that contains in its genome the linked plant expression cassettes present in corn event MON 87411 is an aspect of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">The plasmid DNA inserted into the genome of corn event MON 87411 was characterized by detailed molecular analyses. These analyses included: the insert number (number of integration sites within the corn genome), the copy number (the number of copies of the T-DNA within one locus), and the integrity of the transgenic inserted DNA. The plasmid construct containing the three linked expression cassettes inserted into the corn genome giving rise to the event MON 87411 contains multiple segments (junction sequences between elements used to build or construct the several expression cassettes) that are not known to appear naturally in the corn genome nor in other vectors or transgenic events of corn or otherwise (for example, sequences as set forth in SEQ ID NO:1, SEQ ID NO:2, SEQ ID NO:3, SEQ ID NO:4, SEQ ID NO:5, SEQ ID NO:6, SEQ ID NO:7, SEQ ID NO:8, SEQ ID NO:9, SEQ ID NO:10; SEQ ID NO:12, SEQ ID NO:14, SEQ ID NO:16, SEQ ID NO:21, SEQ ID NO:25, SEQ ID NO: 41, SEQ ID NO: 42, SEQ ID NO: 43, SEQ ID NO: 44, SEQ ID NO: 45, SEQ ID NO: 49, SEQ ID NO: 50, SEQ ID NO: 51, and SEQ ID NO: 52). In addition, the transformation event that gave rise to the inserted transgenic DNA in the event MON 87411 is characterized herein as an insertion into a single locus in the corn genome, resulting in two new loci or junction sequences between the inserted DNA and the corn genome DNA (additional junction sequences) that are of sufficient length to be unique only to a corn genome comprising event MON 87411. These junction sequences are useful for detecting the presence of the event MON 87411 DNA in corn cells, tissue, seed and plants or plant products (commodity products). DNA molecular probes and primer pairs are described herein that have been developed for use in identifying the presence of these various junction segments in biological samples containing or suspected of containing corn cells, seed, plant parts or plant tissue that contain the event MON 87411 DNA. The data show that event MON 87411 contains a single T-DNA insertion with one copy of the inserted transgenic DNA. No additional elements from the transformation vector pMON120714 other than portions of the <i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens </i>left and right border regions used for transgenic DNA transfer from the plant transformation plasmid to the corn genome have been identified in event MON 87411. Finally, thermal amplification producing specific amplicons diagnostic for the presence of such event MON 87411 DNA in a sample, and DNA sequence analyses were performed to determine the arbitrarily assigned 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; insert-to-plant genome junctions, confirm the organization of the elements within the insert, and determine the complete DNA sequence of the inserted transgene DNA in corn plant event MON 87411 (SEQ ID NO:1).</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Dozens of transgenic events were produced using the construct used to produce the transgenic event MON 87411, and different constructs were produced and used to produce many dozens of other transgenic corn events which were compared to the MON 87411 and similar events. These events were all tested for efficacy for controlling corn rootworms in diet bioassays in which the transgenic corn plant event tissues were provided in the diet of corn rootworm larvae. It was determined that the orientation of expression of the two different expression cassettes responsible for conferring the corn rootworm resistance traits to the various events was critical to the efficacy of the events in providing corn rootworm control when the corn event cells expressing these resistance traits were provided in the diet of the corn rootworm larvae. Two different promoters, CAMV e35S and Zm.PIIG, were observed to provide surprising and superior efficacy of corn events containing expression cassettes expressing the dsRNA corn rootworm protectant from the e35S promoter and the Cry3Bb corn rootworm toxic protein from an a Zm.PIIG promoter that was adjacent to and divergent from the e35S promoter. When these promoters were in this particular orientation significantly improved ratios of transgenic events exhibiting efficacy were obtained.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">Unless otherwise noted herein, terms are to be understood according to conventional usage by those of ordinary skill in the relevant art.

Corn plants transformed according to the methods and with the DNA construct disclosed herein are resistant to CRW and tolerant to applications of glyphosate herbicide. The linked agronomic traits provide ease in maintaining these traits together in a breeding population, and exhibit greater corn rootworm efficacy than plants containing only a single corn rootworm inhibition gene or that contain the same corn rootworm inhibition genes (Cry3Bb and dsRNA) that are combined as a breeding stack.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">A transgenic &#x201c;plant&#x201d; is produced by transformation of a plant cell with heterologous DNA, i.e., a polynucleic acid construct that includes a transgene of interest; regeneration of a population of plants resulting from the insertion of the transgene into the genome of the plant cell, and selection of a particular plant characterized by insertion into a particular genome location. The term &#x201c;event&#x201d; refers to the original transformant plant and progeny of the transformant that include the heterologous DNA. The term &#x201c;event&#x201d; also includes progeny produced by a sexual outcross between the event and another plant wherein the progeny includes the heterologous DNA. Even after repeated back-crossing to a recurrent parent, the inserted DNA and flanking genomic DNA from the transformed parent event is present in the progeny of the cross at the same chromosomal location. The term &#x201c;event&#x201d; also refers to DNA from the original transformant comprising the inserted DNA, and flanking genomic sequence immediately adjacent to the inserted DNA, that would be expected to be transferred to a progeny that receives the inserted DNA including the transgene of interest as the result of a sexual cross of one parental line that includes the inserted DNA (e.g., the original transformant and progeny resulting from selfing) and a parental line that does not contain the inserted DNA.

Such a probe is complementary to a strand of a target nucleic acid, in the case of the present invention, to a strand of genomic DNA from MON 87411 whether from a MON 87411 plant or from a sample that includes MON 87411 DNA. Probes according to the present invention include not only deoxyribonucleic or ribonucleic acids, but also polyamides and other probe materials that bind specifically to a target DNA sequence and can be used to detect the presence of that target DNA sequence.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">DNA primers are isolated polynucleic acids that are annealed to a complementary target DNA strand by nucleic acid hybridization to form a hybrid between the primer and the target DNA strand, then extended along the target DNA strand by a polymerase, e.g., a DNA polymerase. A DNA primer pair or a DNA primer set of the present invention refer to two DNA primers useful for amplification of a target nucleic acid sequence, e.g., by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or other conventional polynucleic acid amplification methods.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">DNA probes and DNA primers are generally 11 polynucleotides or more in length, often 18 polynucleotides or more, 24 polynucleotides or more, or 30 polynucleotides or more. Such probes and primers are selected to be of sufficient length to hybridize specifically to a target sequence under high stringency hybridization conditions. Preferably, probes and primers according to the present invention have complete sequence similarity with the target sequence, although probes differing from the target sequence that retain the ability to hybridize to target sequences may be designed by conventional methods.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">Primers and probes based on the flanking genomic DNA and insert sequences disclosed herein can be used to confirm (and, if necessary, to correct) the disclosed DNA sequences by conventional methods, e.g., by re-cloning and sequencing such DNA molecules.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">The nucleic acid probes and primers of the present invention hybridize under stringent conditions to a target DNA molecule. Any conventional nucleic acid hybridization or amplification method can be used to identify the presence of DNA from a transgenic plant in a sample. Polynucleic acid molecules, also referred to as nucleic acid segments, or fragments thereof are capable of specifically hybridizing to other nucleic acid molecules under certain circumstances. As used herein, two polynucleic acid molecules are said to be capable of specifically hybridizing to one another if the two molecules are capable of forming an anti-parallel, double-stranded nucleic acid structure. A nucleic acid molecule is said to be the &#x201c;complement&#x201d; of another nucleic acid molecule if they exhibit complete complementarity. As used herein, molecules are said to exhibit &#x201c;complete complementarity&#x201d; when every nucleotide of one of the molecules is complementary to a nucleotide of the other. Two molecules are said to be &#x201c;minimally complementary&#x201d; if they can hybridize to one another with sufficient stability to permit them to remain annealed to one another under at least conventional &#x201c;low-stringency&#x201d; conditions. Similarly, the molecules are said to be &#x201c;complementary&#x201d; if they can hybridize to one another with sufficient stability to permit them to remain annealed to one another under conventional &#x201c;high-stringency&#x201d; conditions. Conventional stringency conditions are described by Sambrook et al., 1989, and by Haymes et al., In: <i>Nucleic Acid Hybridization, A Practical Approach</i>, IRL Press, Washington, D.C. (1985), Departures from complete complementarity are therefore permissible, as long as such departures do not completely preclude the capacity of the molecules to form a double-stranded structure. In order for a nucleic acid molecule to serve as a primer or probe it need only be sufficiently complementary in sequence to be able to form a stable double-stranded structure under the particular solvent and salt concentrations employed.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">As used herein, a substantially homologous sequence is a nucleic acid sequence that will specifically hybridize to the complement of the nucleic acid sequence to which it is being compared under high stringency conditions. Appropriate stringency conditions that promote DNA hybridization, for example, 6.0&#xd7;sodium chloride/sodium citrate (SSC) at about 45&#xb0; C., followed by a wash of 2.0&#xd7;SSC at 50&#xb0; C., are known to those skilled in the art or can be found in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley &#x26; Sons, N.Y. (1989), 6.3.1-6.3.6. For example, the salt concentration in the wash step can be selected from a low stringency of about 2.0&#xd7;SSC at 50&#xb0; C. to a high stringency of about 0.2&#xd7;SSC at 50&#xb0; C. In addition, the temperature in the wash step can be increased from low stringency conditions at room temperature, about 22&#xb0; C., to high stringency conditions at about 65&#xb0; C. Both temperature and salt may be varied, or either the temperature or the salt concentration may be held constant while the other variable is changed.

For example, to determine whether a corn plant resulting from a sexual cross contains transgenic plant genomic DNA from a corn plant comprising MON 87411 of the present invention, DNA that is extracted from a corn plant tissue sample may be subjected to a polynucleic acid amplification method using a primer pair that includes a primer derived from a DNA sequence in the genome of a MON 87411 comprising plant adjacent to the insertion site of the inserted heterologous DNA (transgene DNA), and a second primer derived from the inserted heterologous DNA to produce an amplicon that is diagnostic for the presence of the MON 87411 plant DNA. The diagnostic amplicon is of a length and has a DNA sequence that is also diagnostic for the plant genomic DNA. The amplicon may range in length from the combined length of the primer pair plus one nucleotide base pair, preferably plus about fifty nucleotide base pairs, more preferably plus about two hundred-fifty nucleotide base pairs, and even more preferably plus about four hundred-fifty nucleotide base pairs or more. Alternatively, a primer pair can be derived from genomic sequence on both sides of the inserted heterologous DNA so as to produce an amplicon that includes the entire insert polynucleotide sequence (e.g., a forward primer isolated from the genomic portion of SEQ ID NO:1 and a reverse primer isolated from the genomic portion of SEQ ID NO:1 that amplifies a DNA molecule comprising the a junction sequence identified herein in the event MON 87411 genome). A member of a primer pair derived from the plant genomic sequence adjacent to the inserted transgenic DNA is located a distance from the inserted DNA sequence, this distance can range from one nucleotide base pair up to about twenty thousand nucleotide base pairs.

A pair of primers may be used with template DNA, such as a sample of corn genomic DNA, in a thermal amplification, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), to produce an amplicon, where the amplicon produced from such reaction would have a DNA sequence corresponding to sequence of the template DNA located between the two sites where the primers hybridized to the template. As used herein, an &#x201c;amplicon&#x201d; is a piece or fragment of DNA that has been synthesized using amplification techniques. An amplicon of the invention comprises at least one of the sequences provided as SEQ ID NO:21 or SEQ ID NO:25. A primer is typically designed to hybridize to a complementary target DNA strand to form a hybrid between the primer and the target DNA strand, and the presence of the primer is a point of recognition by a polymerase to begin extension of the primer (i.e., polymerization of additional nucleotides into a lengthening nucleotide molecule) using as a template the target DNA strand. Primer pairs, as used in the invention, are intended to refer to the use of two primers binding opposite strands of a double stranded nucleotide segment for the purpose of amplifying linearly the polynucleotide segment between the positions targeted for binding by the individual members of the primer pair, typically in a thermal amplification reaction or other conventional nucleic-acid amplification methods. A primer pair useful for this application should comprise a first DNA molecule and a second DNA molecule that is different from the first DNA molecule, and wherein both are each of sufficient length of contiguous nucleotides of a DNA sequence to function as DNA primers that, when used together in a thermal amplification reaction with template DNA derived from corn event MON 87411, to produce an amplicon diagnostic for corn event MON 87411 DNA in a sample.

In order for a nucleic acid molecule to serve as a primer or probe it need only be sufficiently complementary in sequence to be able to form a stable double-stranded structure under the particular solvent and salt concentrations employed. Any conventional nucleic acid hybridization or amplification method can be used to identify the presence of transgenic DNA from corn event MON 87411 in a sample. Probes and primers are generally at least about 11 nucleotides, at least about 18 nucleotides, at least about 24 nucleotides, or at least about 30 nucleotides or more in length. Such probes and primers hybridize specifically to a target DNA sequence under stringent hybridization conditions.

An example of such a microorganism is a transgenic plant cell. Microorganisms, such as a plant cell of the invention, are useful in many industrial applications, including but not limited to: (i) use as research tool for scientific inquiry or industrial research; (ii) use in culture for producing endogenous or recombinant carbohydrate, lipid, nucleic acid, or protein products or small molecules that may be used for subsequent scientific research or as industrial products; and (iii) use with modern plant tissue culture techniques to produce transgenic plants or plant tissue cultures that may then be used for agricultural research or production. The production and use of microorganisms such as transgenic plant cells utilizes modern microbiological techniques and human intervention to produce a man-made, unique microorganism. In this process, recombinant DNA is inserted into a plant cell's genome to create a transgenic plant cell that is separate and unique from naturally occurring plant cells. This transgenic plant cell can then be cultured much like bacteria and yeast cells using modern microbiology techniques and may exist in an undifferentiated, unicellular state. The transgenic plant cell's new or altered genetic composition and phenotype is a technical effect created by the integration of the heterologous DNA into the genome of the cell. Microorganisms of the invention, such as transgenic plant cells, include (i) methods of producing transgenic cells by integrating recombinant DNA into the genome of the cell and then using this cell to derive additional cells possessing the same heterologous DNA; (ii) methods of culturing cells that contain recombinant DNA using modern microbiology techniques; (iii) methods of producing and purifying endogenous or recombinant carbohydrate, lipid, nucleic acid, or protein products from cultured cells; and (iv) methods of using modern plant tissue culture techniques with transgenic plant cells to produce transgenic plants or transgenic plant tissue cultures.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">Plants of the invention may pass along the event DNA, including the transgene, to progeny.

Selfing of appropriate progeny can produce plants that are homozygous for both added, exogenous genes.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">Alternatively, progeny plants may be outcrossed, e.g., bred with another unrelated plant, to produce a varietal or a hybrid seed or plant. The other unrelated plant may be transgenic or nontransgenic. A varietal or hybrid seed or plant of the invention may thus be derived by crossing a first parent that lacks the specific and unique DNA of the corn event MON 87411 with a second parent comprising corn event MON 87411, resulting in a hybrid comprising the specific and unique DNA of the corn event MON 87411. Each parent can be a hybrid or an inbred/varietal, so long as the cross or breeding results in a plant or seed of the invention, i.e., a seed having at least one allele containing the DNA of corn event MON 87411 and/or a DNA molecule having at least one sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO:1, SEQ ID NO:2, SEQ ID NO:3, SEQ ID NO:4, SEQ ID NO:5, SEQ ID NO:6, SEQ ID NO:7, SEQ ID NO:8, SEQ ID NO:9, SEQ ID NO:10, SEQ ID NO:12, SEQ ID NO:14, SEQ ID NO:16, SEQ ID NO:21, SEQ ID NO:25; SEQ ID NO: 41, SEQ ID NO: 42, SEQ ID NO: 43, SEQ ID NO: 44, SEQ ID NO: 45, SEQ ID NO: 49, SEQ ID NO: 50, SEQ ID NO: 51, and SEQ ID NO: 52. Two different transgenic plants may thus be crossed to produce hybrid offspring that contain two independently segregating, added, exogenous genes. For example, the event MON 87411 corn containing resistance to corn rootworm infestations and glyphosate tolerance can be crossed with different transgenic corn plants to produce a hybrid or inbred plant having the characteristics of both transgenic parents. One example of this would be a cross of event MON 87411 containing resistance to corn rootworm infestations and glyphosate tolerance with a corn plant having one or more additional traits such as herbicide tolerance and/or insect control, resulting in a progeny plant or seed that is resistant to corn rootworm infestations and tolerant to glyphosate and has at least one or more additional traits. Back-crossing to a parental plant and out-crossing with a non-transgenic plant are also contemplated, as is vegetative propagation.

At least 8 R<sub>1 </sub>seeds produced by each of the 44 R<sub>0 </sub>plants were planted in soil and R<sub>1 </sub>plants were grown to produce R<sub>2 </sub>seed. A single R<sub>1 </sub>plant per event was selected to continue each line containing each separate event, and seed from the single R<sub>1 </sub>plant was bulked for subsequent testing by (a) self-fertilization (R<sub>3, 4, . . .

Following standard molecular biology laboratory practices, the parameters of either a standard PCR assay or a TaqMan&#xae; PCR assay were optimized with each set of primer pairs and probes (i.e. probes labeled with a fluorescent tag such as 6FAM&#x2122;) used to detect the presence of DNA derived from event MON 87411 in a sample (SQ27011, SQ9085, and/or PB3552, or SQ27066, SQ26977, and/or PB11300). Generally, the parameters which were optimized included primer and probe concentration, amount of template DNA, and PCR amplification cycling parameters. A control for the PCR reaction included primers (SQ20221 (SEQ ID NO:38) and SQ20222 (SEQ ID NO:40)) and/or probe (PB10065 (SEQ ID NO:39)) (probe labeled with a fluorescent tag such as VIC&#x2122;), which are specific for an internal control, single copy gene in the corn genome. One of skill in the art will know how to design other PCR primers specific for a single copy gene in the corn genome which can be used to amplify an amplicon to be used as an internal control probe, or as an internal control in a PCR assay (e.g. TaqMan&#xae;). DNA was extracted from leaf tissue for each of the following: [1] leaf sample to be analyzed; [2] negative control (non-transgenic corn DNA); [3] negative water control (no template); and [4] positive control MON 87411 DNA. Detection of the amplicons from a standard PCR assay would be visualization by DNA gel electrophoresis, and for a TaqMan&#xae; PCR assay by fluorescence detection.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0187">A zygosity assay is useful for determining if a plant comprising an event is homozygous for the event DNA; that is comprising the exogenous DNA in the same location on each chromosome of a chromosomal pair; or heterozygous for an event DNA, that is comprising the exogenous DNA on only one chromosome of a chromosomal pair; or is null for the event DNA, that is wildtype. The zygosity of a corn plant containing event MON 87411 can be determined by thermal amplification (PCR) or by endpoint TaqMan&#xae; methods. For example, for PCR amplification, the primer pair SQ27011 (SEQ ID NO:18) and SQ26977 (SEQ ID NO:22) hybridize within the genomic DNA flanking the event MON87411 insert. This primer pair will generate an amplicon which is 11323 nucleotides in length when DNA derived from event MON 87411 is present in the sample. This same primer pair will generate an amplicon which is only about 150 nucleotides long when corn DNA in the sample is not derived from event MON 87411. On DNA gel electrophoresis, a single band of 11323 bp is indicative that the DNA in the sample is from a homozygous MON 87411 event, a single band of about 150 bp is indicative that the DNA in the sample is not from a MON 87411 event, and the presence of both a band of 11323 bp and a band of about 150 bp is indicative that the DNA in the sample is from a corn plant heterozygous for MON 87411 event.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0188">A TaqMan&#xae; assay can be developed to determine the zygosity of a corn plant containing event MON 87411.

In a TaqMan&#xae;, or similar assay, a fluorescent signal only from the first probe is indicative of and diagnostic for a plant homozygous for event MON 87411; a fluorescent signal from both the first probe and second probe is indicative of and diagnostic for a plant heterozygous for event MON 87411; and a fluorescent signal only from the second probe is indicative of and diagnostic for a plant which is homozygous for the wildtype allele (i.e., is null for event MON 87411).</p><heading id="h-0015" level="1">Example 5</heading><p id="p-0197" num="0189">This example describes the superior protection of plant comprising event MON 87411 from corn rootworm damage when compared to current commercial products (MON 88017 and DAS-59122-7) and negative control plants.

In this trial the following event were evaluated: event MON 87411, an event from transformation with DNA vector #890 expressing only the dsRNA; MON 88017; DAS-59122-7; and negative control. For these high-pressure efficacy trials, the corn plants under evaluation were grown in pots in a green house. Extreme infestation pressure was achieved by sequential infestation of each potted plant with approximately 2,000 WCR eggs per pot at their V2 growth stage, and, at 4 additional times occurring at 1 to 1-1/2 week intervals with approximately 1,000 WCR eggs per pot per infestation for a total of approximately 6,000 WCR eggs added to each pot. Plant roots were removed, washed, and rated for RDR at their VT growth stage. The roots from all thirteen (N=13) negative control plants exhibited maximum root damage, or an absolute RDR of 3 RDR. These results illustrate that event MON 87411 is more superior to other corn events available for controlling corn rootworm (Table 9).</p><p id="p-0201" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00009" num="00009"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 9</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Root Damage Rating (RDR) under high corn rootworm infestation </entry></row><row><entry>pressure.

To determine adult corn rootworm beetle emergence from the soil of event MON 87411 plants grown in pots, 10 to 15 plants were germinated in pots containing soil infested with WCR eggs, similar to that described above. Throughout the growth period, each corn plant was covered with mesh bag to contain any emerging adult beetles.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0193">Counts of above ground adult beetles were made at 6, 12, and 18 weeks after plant emergence, and at the end of the trial the roots were evaluated for RDR.

The results were that significantly fewer beetles were observed to emerge from soils in which event MON 87411 plants were potted compared to the other corn rootworm protective transgenic events, illustrating the superior properties of event MON 87411 to protect against corn rootworm damage.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="1">Example 6</heading><p id="p-0204" num="0194">This example illustrates that the orientation of expression of two different promoters in a corn cell, each driving expression of a different corn rootworm toxic agent, can result in significantly improved ratios of transgenic events exhibiting efficacy when provided in the diet of corn rootworm larvae.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0195">Corn cells were transformed with one of four different plant transformation vectors, pMON120417, pMON120434, pMON120416, or pMON120419, and transgenic events were obtained that were regenerated into transgenic corn plants.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0196">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, all of the plant transformation vectors contain three expression cassettes 1, 2, and 3, bounded on one end by an <i>Agrobacterium </i>left border (LB), and at the opposite end by an <i>Agrobacterium </i>right border (RB).

The ratio of efficacious events generated from transformation using the vectors pMON120417 and pMON120416, compared to the ratio of efficacious events from the vectors pMON120416 and pMON120419, was significantly greater as shown by the data in Table 10. For example, for events generated from vector pMON120417 with the divergent promoter driven expression of the corn rootworm toxic components, 11 of 43 events, or almost 25% of the events exhibited rootworm efficacious control. In contrast, there were no efficacious events obtained for events generated from vector pMON120434 with the promoter driven expression in the tandem orientation of the corn rootworm toxic components. For events generated from vector pMON120416 with the divergent promoter driven expression of the corn rootworm toxic components, 17 of 27 events, or about 63% of the events exhibited rootworm efficacious control. In contrast, there only about 18.5% efficacious events obtained for events generated from vector pMON120419 with the promoter driven expression in the tandem orientation of the corn rootworm toxic components. These data demonstrate the significantly improved number of efficacious events, and improved ratios of transgenic events exhibiting efficacy, when transgenic corn plants are generated from a plant transformation vector with two different promoters each driving expression in divergent directions of two different corn rootworm toxic agents, and the transgenic corn plants are provided in the diet of corn rootworm larvae.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00010" num="00010"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 10</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Results showing the number of RO events and the number </entry></row><row><entry>efficacious events obtained from four plant transformation vectors.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="77pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="56pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="84pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>No. of RO</entry><entry># Efficacious</entry></row><row><entry>Construct</entry><entry>Events</entry><entry>events</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="77pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="56pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="84pt" align="char" char="."/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>pMON120417</entry><entry>43</entry><entry>11</entry></row><row><entry>pMON120434</entry><entry>8</entry><entry>0</entry></row><row><entry>pMON120416</entry><entry>27</entry><entry>17</entry></row><row><entry>pMON120419</entry><entry>43</entry><entry>8</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><heading id="h-0017" level="1">Example 7</heading><p id="p-0211" num="0200">To produce corn plants or plant parts thereof which comprise enhanced agronomic, insecticidal, or herbicidal properties, corn plants containing event MON 87411 can be crossed with corn plants containing potentially any other corn event or combination thereof and phenotypes evaluated to determine the resulting properties of the progeny plants.
