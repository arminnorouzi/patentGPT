article.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0002">Electronic components such as processors and power modules, batteries for electric vehicles, and the like are accompanied by heat generation during use. In order to protect such a component from heat, a means that efficiently dissipates the generated heat is required. A thermally conductive material (may also be referred to as thermal dissipation material) called a thermal interface material (TIM) is a material provided between a heat source and a thermal dissipation member such as a heat sink, and the thermally conductive material reduces the heat resistance between the heat source and the thermal dissipation member and promotes thermal conduction from the heat source. Since the heat generated from the heat source is efficiently conducted to a cooling member via the TIM, the heat is easily dissipated from the thermal dissipation member.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0003">Regarding the thermally conductive material, a large number of liquid materials are known, and they are also referred to as thermal dissipation greases or thermally conductive greases. For example, in Patent Literature 1, a thermally conductive grease composition containing predetermined amounts of a liquid hydrocarbon oil and/or a fluorinated hydrocarbon oil and a thermally conductive inorganic filler is disclosed. Furthermore, in Patent Literature 2, a thermally conductive grease containing a specific phenyl ether-based base oil, a specific phenol-based oxidation inhibitor, and an inorganic powder filler is disclosed.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0004">Patent Literature 1: Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 11-246885</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0005">Patent Literature 2: Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2011-111517</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0006">When a liquid thermally conductive grease is used, liquid dripping or a pump-out phenomenon in which the grease is pushed out from between the members due to deformation of the member on which the thermally conductive grease is applied, may occur. Liquid dripping or the pump-out phenomenon generates voids between the grease and the member, decreases the adhesiveness of the grease to the member, and causes an increase in heat resistance between the thermal dissipation grease and the member. Due to liquid dripping or the pump-out phenomenon, other members may be contaminated by the grease, and insulation failure may occur.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0007">In order to solve such a problem, a thermally conductive material formed into a solid form such as a sheet may be used. Liquid dripping or the pump-out phenomenon can be suppressed by using a solid-form thermally conductive material. On the other hand, in an electronic component containing a member that generates heat and a thermal dissipation member, deformation such as warpage of the members may occur when cooling and heating is repeated. Accordingly, the solid-form thermally conductive material is required to be a material having excellent elongation so that the material can follow deformation of the members.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0008">According to an aspect, an object of the present invention is to provide a curable composition capable of giving a cured product having excellent elongation.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0009">The inventors of the present invention conducted a thorough study, and as a result, the inventors found that a cured product of a curable composition containing a specific compound having a polyoxyalkylene chain and having two (meth)acryloyl groups has excellent elongation.
