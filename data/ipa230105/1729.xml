Therefore, it is important that the image transfer recording medium can give high image durability.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The image durability is largely influenced by a material of a release layer of a thermal transfer recording medium. As a conventional technology for improving image durability, for example, proposed is a thermal transfer recording medium that includes, on or above a support (base), a laminate including at least a release layer and an ink layer (thermally fusible ink layer) where the release layer includes polyethylene wax as a main component, and the ink layer includes a colorant and wax. In the proposed thermal transfer recording medium, the number average molecular weight of the polyethylene wax is 655 or greater but 1,000 or less, melt viscosity at 149 degrees Celsius is 5 cp or greater but 12 cp or less, a melting point is 99 degrees Celsius or higher but 113 degrees Celsius or lower, the wax included in the release layer and the ink layer has an endothermic peak represented with a differential thermal analysis (DTA) curve, which is obtained by plotting a temperature on a horizontal axis and an endothermic value per unit time on a vertical axis. A temperature at which the endothermic value becomes the maximum is referred to as a melting point, and the polyethylene wax included in the release layer has a melting point higher than a melting point of the wax included in the ink layer (melting point of polyethylene wax in release layer&#x3e;melting point of wax in ink layer). In addition, the enthalpy of fusion [Q] of the wax in the ink layer determined by DTA is 21&#x3c;Q&#x3c;38 [mj/mg] (see, for example, PTL 1).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Moreover, provided is a thermal transfer recording medium including a release layer disposed on or above a support (base) and a thermal transfer layer (thermally fusible ink layer), which is a single layer and disposed on or above the release layer. The release layer includes, as a main component, was obtained by esterifying montan wax. The single-layer thermal transfer layer includes a binder resin that is a thermoplastic resin having a glass transition temperature of 50 degrees Celsius or lower (see, for example, PTL 2).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is possible to improve scratch resistance according to the technology described above, but there is a problem that binding strength between a base and a release layer is not sufficient thus a material of the thermally fusible ink layer is transferred to the base.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to make binding strength with a base appropriately, moreover, proposed is a thermal transfer sheet (thermal transfer recording medium), which includes a base, a release layer disposed on one side of the base, and a transfer layer (thermally fusible ink layer) disposed on the release layer. The transfer layer is provided in a manner that the transfer layer can be peeled from the release layer. The release layer includes a thermoset resin, and a peel force adjuster. The peel force adjuster is a thermoplastic resin having a glass transition temperature (Tg) of 30 degrees Celsius or higher but 130 degrees Celsius or lower, or a hydroxyl group-containing resin having a hydroxyl value of 3 mgKOH/g or greater but 31 mgKOH/g or less, or both. The thermoplastic resin having a glass transition temperature (Tg) of 30 degrees Celsius or higher but 130 degrees Celsius or lower is at least one selected from the group consisting of a thermoplastic acryl resin, a rosin ester resin, a styrene-based resin, an ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, and styrene-butadiene rubber. An amount of the peel force adjuster relative to a total mass of the release layer is 10% by mass or greater but 45% by mass or less (see, for example, PTL 3).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to the proposed technology described above, appropriate binding strength between a base and a release layer can be secured, but scratch resistance is not sufficient.

The release layer includes wax and ethylenepropylene-ethylidene norbornene rubber.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">&#x3c;Base&#x3e;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The base is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose. Examples of the base include various plastic films, such as a polyethylene terephthalate film, a polyester film, a polycarbonate film, a polyimide film, a polyamide film, a polystyrene film, a polysulfone film, a polypropylene film, a polyethylene film, and a cellulose acetate film. Among the above-listed examples, a polyethylene terephthalate film is preferable because of strength, heat resistance, and heat conductivity thereof.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The average thickness of the base is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose. The average thickness of the base is preferably 3 micrometers or greater but 10 micrometers or less.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">&#x3c;Release Layer&#x3e;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The release layer has a function of facilitating peeling between the base and the thermal fusible ink layer at the time of printing. Once the release layer is heated by a thermal head, the release layer is melted by heat to become a low-viscous liquid. Therefore, the thermally fusible ink layer can be easily cut off at an area adjacent to an interface between the heated area and the unheated area.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The release layer includes wax, and, as a binder, ethylene-propylene-ethylidene norbornene rubber. The release layer preferably further includes another binder, and a dispersant. The release layer may further include other components according to the necessity.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">&#x2014;Binder&#x2014;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The binder includes ethylene-propylene-ethylidene norbornene rubber because of excellent binding strength to the base, and excellent image durability. The binder may further include other components according to the necessity. The ethylidene norbornene content of the ethylene-propylene-ethylidene norbornene rubber is preferably 4.5% by mass or greater. When the ethylidene norbornene content of the ethylene-propylene-ethylidene norbornene rubber is 4.5% by mass or greater, a transfer image having excellent scratch resistance can be formed as well as improving binder strength between the base and the release layer.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The above-mentioned another binder is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose. Examples thereof include an ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, a partially saponified ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, an ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer, an ethylene-sodium methacrylate copolymer, polyamide, polyester, polyurethane, polyvinyl alcohol, methylcellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, starch, polyacrylic acid, an isobutylene-maleic acid copolymer, a styrene-maleic acid copolymer, polyacrylamide, polyvinyl acetal, polyvinyl chloride, polyvinylidene chloride, isoprene rubber, styrene-butadiene rubber, ethylene-propylene rubber, butyl rubber, and acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber. The above-listed examples may be used alone or in combination.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">An amount of the ethylene-propylene-ethylidene norbornene rubber is preferably 5 parts by mass or greater but 30 parts by mass or less, and more preferably 10 parts by mass or greater but 25 parts by mass or less, relative to 100 parts by mass of the wax in the release layer. When the amount of the ethylene-propylene-ethylidene norbornene rubber is 5 parts by mass or greater but 30 parts by mass or less, binding strength between the base and the release layer is not excessively strong, and therefore a problem of migrating a material of the thermally fusible ink layer thermal sensitivity to the base can be prevented as well as preventing thermal sensitivity of the thermally fusible ink layer.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">&#x2014;Wax of Release Layer&#x2014;</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The wax of the release layer is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose. Examples of the wax include Fischer-Tropsch wax, paraffin wax, microcrystalline wax, oxidized paraffin wax, candelilla wax, carnauba wax, rice wax, montan wax, ceresin wax, polyethylene wax, oxidized polyethylene wax, castor wax, beef tallow hydrogenated oil, lanolin, Japan wax, sorbitan stearate, sorbitan palmitate, stearyl alcohol, polyamide wax, oleyl amide, stearyl amide, hydroxystearic acid, and synthetic ester wax. The above-listed examples may be used alone or in combination. Among the above-listed examples, Fischer-Tropsch wax, polyethylene wax, and carnauba wax are preferable.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The average particle diameter of the wax is preferably 1.0 micrometer or greater but 6.0 micrometers or less, and more preferably 2.0 micrometers or greater but 4.0 micrometers or less. When the average particle diameter of the wax is 1.0 micrometer or greater but 6.0 micrometers or less, thermal sensitivity is improved, and a highly precise printed image is obtained.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">For example, the average particle diameter can be determined with the state of the particles of the wax observed on the cross-section of the release layer of the thermal transfer recording medium. The cross-sectional observation can be performed by preparing a sample according to a conventional method, and measuring the sample using a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The measured value of the particle diameter of the wax obtained by the TEM observation is substantially matched with a measurement value of a particle diameter of the wax in a release layer coating liquid used for forming the release layer. Therefore, the particle size distribution of the wax in the formed release layer can be set by adjusting the particle size distribution of the wax in the release layer coating liquid. For example, the volume average particle diameter of the wax in the release layer coating liquid can be measured by a laser scanning particle size analyzer LA-960, available from HORIBA, Ltd., etc.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">A melting point of the wax is preferably 70 degrees Celsius or higher but 120 degrees Celsius or lower, and more preferably 80 degrees Celsius or higher but 100 degrees Celsius or lower. When the melting point of the wax is 70 degrees Celsius or higher but 120 degrees Celsius or lower, excellent thermal sensitivity, abrasion resistance, and scratch resistance are obtained.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">A penetration degree of the wax is preferably 3 or less. When the penetration degree of the wax is 3 or less, excellent abrasion resistance and scratch resistance are obtained.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">&#x2014;Dispersant&#x2014;</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the case where the release layer is formed with an aqueous emulsion or aqueous dispersion coating liquid, wax is dispersed into small particles. Therefore, a dispersant is preferably added to the emulsion or dispersion coating liquid.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The dispersant is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose. Examples of the dispersant include an anionic surfactant, a cationic surfactant, and a nonionic surfactant. Among the above-listed examples, a nonionic surfactant is preferable in view of dispersibility.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The nonionic surfactant is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose. Examples of the nonionic surfactant include: fatty acids, such as glycerin fatty acid ester, sucrose fatty acid ester, sorbitan fatty acid ester, polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid ester, polyoxyethylene fatty acid ester, and fatty acid alkanol amide; polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers, such as polyoxyethylene lauryl ether, polyoxyethylene stearyl ether, and polyoxyethylene oleyl ether; higher alcohols, such as alkyl glucoside; polyoxyethylene alkyl phenyl ethers, such as polyoxyethylene octyl phenyl ether, and polyoxyethylene nonyl phenyl ether; polyoxyethylene dialkyl esters, such as polyoxyethylene dilaurate, and polyoxyethylene distearate; and polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene block copolymer. The above-listed examples may be used alone or in combination. Among the above-listed examples, sorbitan fatty acid ester, polyoxyethylene (POE) fatty acid ester, and polyoxyethylene (POE) alkyl ether are preferable, and polyoxyethylene (POE) alkyl ether is more preferable in view of dispersibility.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">An amount of the nonionic surfactant in the release layer is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose. The amount of the nonionic surfactant is preferably 2 parts by mass or greater but 10 parts by mass or less, and more preferably 3 parts by mass or greater but 6 parts by mass or less, relative to 100 parts by mass of wax contained in the release layer. When the amount of the nonionic surfactant is 2 parts by mass or greater, the wax is formed into particles of small particle diameters in an aqueous emulsion or aqueous dispersion liquid. When the amount of the nonionic surfactant is 10 parts by mass or less, moreover, transfer performance to paper having low smoothness is excellent, and therefore abrasion resistance of an image improves.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">&#x2014;Other Components&#x2014;</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The above-mentioned other components are not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose. Examples thereof include a dispersion aid, and a solvent.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The release layer can be formed by applying a release layer coating liquid onto the base by coating, followed by drying. The release layer coating liquid includes the wax, the binder, the dispersant, and optionally the above-mentioned other components. Examples of the coating include gravure coating, wire bar coating, and roll coating.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The average thickness of the release layer is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose. The average thickness of the release layer is preferably 0.2 micrometers or greater but 1.0 micrometer or less, and more preferably 0.3 micrometers or greater but 0.8 micrometers or less. When the average thickness of the release layer is 0.2 micrometers or greater but 1.0 micrometer or less, excellent thermal sensitivity, abrasion resistance, and scratch resistance are obtained.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">&#x3c;Thermally Fusible Ink Layer&#x3e;</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The thermally fusible ink layer preferably includes wax and a colorant. More preferably, the thermally fusible ink layer further includes organic fatty acid and long-chain alcohol. The thermally fusible ink layer may further include other components according to the necessity.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">&#x2014;Wax of Thermally Fusible Ink Layer&#x2014;</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The wax of the thermally fusible ink layer is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose. Examples of the wax include paraffin wax, microcrystalline wax, oxidized paraffin wax, candelilla wax, carnauba wax, rice wax, montan wax, ceresin wax, polyethylene wax, oxidized polyethylene wax, castor wax, beef tallow hydrogenated oil, lanolin, Japan wax, sorbitan stearate, sorbitan palmitate, stearyl alcohol, polyamide wax, oleylamide, stearylamide, hydroxystearic acid, and synthetic ester wax. The above-listed examples may be used alone or in combination. Among the above-listed examples, carnauba wax is preferable.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Since the carnauba wax is hard wax having a penetration degree of 1 or less, use of the carnauba wax improves abrasion resistance of the thermally fusible ink layer. Moreover, the carnauba wax give excellent thermal sensitivity because a melting point of the carnauba wax is low, i.e., 80 degrees Celsius. Furthermore, the carnauba wax give an advantage that excellent printing performance can be obtained because the carnauba wax has sharp thermal characteristics, and has low melt viscosity.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The wax is preferably included in the form of an aqueous emulsion together with organic fatty acid or long-chain alcohol, or both. In this case, the thermally fusible ink layer is preferentially cut and peeled at a boundary of each particle constituting the emulsion to be transferred onto a surface of the transfer target at the time when the thermal transfer recording medium is heated with a thermal head. Therefore, very charge edges of a printed image or letters on the transfer target can be obtained. Moreover, environmental load is kept minimum because the emulsion for use is water-base.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">A formation method of the aqueous emulsion of the wax is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose. For example, the wax can be emulsified using, as an emulsifier, a salt generated by adding the organic fatty acid and the below-mentioned organic base into the fluid.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">&#x2014;Colorant&#x2014;</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The colorant is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose. Examples of the colorant include carbon black, azo-based dyes and pigments, phthalocyanine, quinacridone, anthraquinone, perylene, quinophthalone, aniline black, titanium oxide, zinc flower, and chromium oxide. The above-listed examples may be used alone or in combination. Among the above-listed examples, carbon black is preferable.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">&#x2014;Organic Fatty Acid&#x2014;</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The organic fatty acid is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose. Examples of the organic fatty acid include montanoic acid, oleic acid, and behenic acid. The above-listed examples may be used alone or in combination.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">An acid value of the organic fatty acid is preferably 90 mgKOH/g or greater but 200 mgKOH/g or less, and more preferably 140 mgKOH/g or greater but 200 mgKOH/g or less.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">When the acid value of the organic fatty acid is 90 mgKOH/g or greater but 200 mgKOH/g or less, the organic fatty acid is reacted with alkali to form an anionic emulsifier. Therefore, the wax can be emulsified without adversely affecting sensitivity and smear resistance.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">A melting point of the organic fatty acid is preferably 70 degrees Celsius or higher but 90 degrees Celsius or lower.
