assemble a modular battery system as a traction battery for a hybrid or electrical vehicle.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">TECHNOLOGICAL BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Battery systems composed of multiple battery modules, wherein each battery module comprises a plurality of battery cells, are well known to be used as traction batteries in electric or hybrid vehicles. Battery modules forming the battery system have to be at least electrically connected. However, in order to enable a compact battery system which can be placed inside an electric vehicle for example, mechanical integrity is of great importance as well. Typically, a plurality of battery modules is placed inside a housing or on a carrier plate, in order to form a mechanically stable battery system.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">To provide a more flexible battery system, a modular construction of the battery system is preferred. A modular battery system enables mechanical and electrical connection of an arbitrary number of battery modules in a battery housing.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">DE 102013010001 A1 discloses a spring and groove connection between battery modules, which are placed inside the battery pack housing. DE 102013200383 A1, battery modules are connected to each other and to the carrier plate by one or more rods comprising bearing blocks on each side and means for pretension. DE 102008010822 A1 discloses a separate connection component for connecting battery modules to each other, for example a sliding connection.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">DE 102016224442 A1 discloses a spring-groove connection component for connecting battery modules to each other. The spring and the groove parts are separate components, which are attached to the battery module housing by a clip connection. Additionally, battery modules are fixed to the battery pack housing by a screw, which is placed at the spring-groove connection site.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved housing for receiving battery cells in a modular battery system, preferably for a hybrid or electric vehicle.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The object is solved by a battery housing defined as in claim <b>1</b>. Preferred embodiments are defined in the dependent claims, the general description of the invention as well as the description of specific embodiments and the drawings.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, a battery housing for receiving battery cells, preferably for use in an electric or hybrid vehicle, is suggested, wherein the battery housing comprises a bottom plate forming a base of the housing, wherein the bottom plate is connectable to another bottom plate of the same kind by means of a connection system to form a modular base of the housing.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">By the provision of the connection system at the level of the bottom plate it is possible to assemble a modular battery system by connecting at least two adjacent bottom plates to one another and achieve a structurally sound arrangement. Depending on the actual needs of different specific vehicles, it is possible to adapt the dimensions of the resulting battery system while using the same bottom plates and in particular by using the same battery housings for a greater number of different vehicles and battery systems.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">To achieve a fully modular battery system, battery housings may be mechanically connected to each other without use of a carrier plate. This can be achieved by using a plurality of like battery housings which each forms a battery module and the battery modules are directly mechanically connected to their respective neighbouring module to form a self-supporting battery system. This way, not only the number of modules in a battery system is variable, but also the shape of the battery system can be adapted to the available space. The connection between the respective battery modules should preferably enable an easy to assemble and mechanically stable battery system.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Preferably, the connection system is a clip connector system. The clip connector system enables fast and easy assembly, since no additional fastening means are needed.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Preferably, the bottom plate comprises at least a first edge and a second edge parallel to the first edge, wherein the first edge and the second edge form complementary portions of the clip connector system. For example, the first edge of the bottom plate may be formed as a male part of the clip connector system and the second edge may be formed as a female part of the clip connector system. The appropriate geometry for a clip connection between two battery housings is already incorporated into the corresponding bottom plates, therefore no extra assembly parts are needed for the connection of two or more such housings, which considerably simplifies assembly of the battery system.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Preferably, a gasket is arranged on the male and/or female part of the clip connector system to ensure a tight connection between two bottom plates, after the male and the female part of the clip connector system are tilted and pressed into the end position. The gasket may be placed into a recess of the male part of the clip connector system. The gasket may be made of one elongated piece of rubber or any other appropriate elastomeric material, running along the whole length of the edge of the respective bottom plate. The gasket may be made of several discrete pieces of rubber or any other appropriate elastomeric material being placed at discrete positions along the edge of the respective bottom plate.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Preferably, the gasket is an elastomer of the ethylene-propylene family such as EPDM, or of the butadiene styrene family such as latex or of the silicones family.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">By placing the gasket at the connection site between the first and the second edge, the clip connection becomes tight and fixes the connected bottom plates in a plane. Additionally, the gasket may seal the connection between two bottom plates, such that it becomes impermeable to fluids.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Preferably, the bottom plate of the battery housing is self-supporting, meaning that no additional carrier plate or housing is needed to achieve a mechanically stable battery system. By this measure it is possible to build a mechanically intact modular battery system on the basis of the battery housings only.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Preferably, the battery housing comprises two side plates arranged on the bottom plate, wherein the inner sides of the two side plates and the bottom plate define an internal volume for receiving the battery cells. Each plate comprises a flange at its outer side and wherein each flange comprises fixation means for fastening the battery housing to an adjacent battery.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">By using the flanges of the side plates of the battery housing, the battery housing can furthermore be attached directly to the chassis or to any other receiving frame.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Preferably, the bottom plate and/or the side plates are provided by an extruded material, preferably by an extruded profile and/or wherein the bottom plate and the side plates are integrally formed. Using extruded material and in particular extruded profiles the battery housing can be provided in a cost effective manner and infinite in dimensions along the extrusion direction.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Preferably, the bottom plate comprises fluid channels for receiving a temperature control fluid for to controlling the temperature of the battery cells received within the battery housing. This way the cooling/heating system is incorporated into the battery housing and no external system for temperature control is needed, which reduces weight, assembly time and production cost.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">To maximize heat transfer between the fluid channels and the battery cells, in a preferred embodiment, the battery cells are positioned directly in the battery housing, preferably directly on the bottom plate and between the side plates of the battery housing for forming a battery module.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Preferably, the bottom plate comprises a venting channel for receiving gases released from battery cells in case of thermal runaway. The venting channel is connected to a common venting path, wherein the venting path connects venting outlets of all battery cells accommodated in the housing and conveys released gases to the venting channel and through it to the outside of the battery system.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The above mentioned object is also solved by a battery system with the features of claim <b>15</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Accordingly, the battery system comprises at least two battery housings for receiving battery cells wherein the battery housings are provided in the form as already discussed above and wherein the battery housings are interconnected at the respective adjacent bottom plates as well as at the respective adjacent flanges.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Mechanical connection of the bottom plates ensures stability of the connected battery housings in the plane defined by the bottom plate. By mechanically connecting the side plates of the two adjacent battery housings via their respective flanges, the stability of the battery system is further enhanced, since this way also the movement perpendicular to the bottom plates is suppressed. Furthermore, a connection in two planes which are distanced from each other is achieved.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The present disclosure will be more readily appreciated by reference to the following detailed description when being considered in connection with the accompanying drawings in which:</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a schematic perspective view of two connectable bottom plates in the process of being coupled;</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a schematic close-up view of a clip connector system;</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates two connected battery housings, comprising bottom plates and side plates; and</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a schematic perspective view of a battery system with inserted battery cells.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the following, the invention will be explained in more detail with reference to the accompanying figures.

This will be shown with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref> below.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">A plurality of battery modules <b>100</b> may be combined to a battery system <b>10</b> for a hybrid or electrical vehicle.

Such self-supporting bottom plate <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B may be produced by an extrusion process.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The bottom plate <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B can hence be made of an extruded aluminum profile, an aluminum casting part, reinforced plastic extrusion profile or casting part or of an aluminum or steel deep drawn part.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Further, the bottom plates <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B preferably comprise at least one fluid channel <b>5</b> for receiving a temperature control fluid for controlling the temperature of the internal volume <b>3</b> and, thus, of the battery cells received therein.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Providing temperature control of a battery module or a battery in a battery housing by means of a temperature control fluid is, in principle, known. If cooling of the battery components is required, the temperature control fluid is typically processed to have a lower temperature than the temperature in the internal volume <b>3</b>. If a heating of the battery components is required, the temperature control fluid is typically processed to have a higher temperature than the temperature in the internal volume <b>3</b>. The temperature control fluid is made to flow through the fluid channels <b>5</b> in order to enable temperature control of the inner volume <b>3</b> by means of heat exchange.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">There are two fluid channels <b>5</b> implemented in each of the bottom plates <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B, which are part of the extruded profile forming the bottom plates <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B. The fluid channels <b>5</b> run in parallel to each other in the exemplary implementation of this invention. However, the number and realization of fluid channels may vary in different implementations of this invention. The fluid channels <b>5</b> are a feature of the extruded profile.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The bottom plate <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B may also comprise a venting channel <b>9</b> for receiving gases released from the battery cells in case of a thermal runaway. A venting opening <b>8</b> connects a common venting arrangement to the venting channel <b>9</b>. The common venting arrangement is arranged such that the venting outlets of a number or all battery cells received in the inner volume <b>3</b> of the battery housing <b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>B are combined and connected such that gases released by one or more than one battery cells are conveyed to the venting channel <b>9</b> and through it to the outside of the battery system.
