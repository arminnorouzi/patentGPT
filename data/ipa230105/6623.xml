This places significant constraints on the power amplifiers driving the radiating elements as different output power levels are required without sacrificing efficiency. Existing solutions operate the power amplifier in back-off, use multiple power amplifier designs, or adjust the power supply voltage. These approaches can result in reduced efficiency and significant mismatch in the amplitude and phase transfer characteristics for amplifiers operating at different power levels. What is needed is a power reconfigurable power amplifier architecture that provides evenly stepped output power levels in watts without a large reduction in power-added efficiency for the lower power states.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Disclosed is a reconfigurable power amplifier having a 2<sup>N</sup>&#x2212;1 number of input-side reconfigurable quadrature couplers connected in a tree structure, wherein a 2<sup>(N&#x2212;1) </sup>number of the input-side reconfigurable quadrature couplers have coupler output terminals, and a root of the tree structure is one of the input-side reconfigurable quadrature couplers having a main input terminal.

This requirement places significant constraints on the power amplifiers used to drive the radiating elements. Different output power levels are required without sacrificing power-added efficiency. One approach is to vary the power amplifier supply voltage, VD. This requires controlling the high-power supply of independent array elements. Also, power amplifier gain and compression characteristics start to change if VD is significantly varied. Another approach is to use separate power amplifiers designed for different power levels, increasing design expense, different interface boards, assembly complexity, and bill of materials management. The situation is further complicated if the signal being transmitted has a significant peak-to-average ratio. Static phase and amplitude differences between individual amplifiers can be calibrated with the onboard digital attenuators and phase shifters. Dynamic phase changes resulting from the amplifier's inherent amplitude modulation&#x2014;amplitude modulation (AM/AM) and amplitude modulation&#x2014;phase modulation (AM/PM) characteristics cannot be calibrated. This significantly impacts dynamic sidelobe levels as the modulated signal moves from peaks to valleys unless all of the amplifiers have similar AM/AM and AM/PM characteristics. In other words, if the array power taper requires four different power levels, then four different power amplifier designs are required that have matched AM/AM and AM/PM characteristics.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Disclosed is a power reconfigurable amplifier architecture that provides 2<sup>N </sup>evenly stepped output power levels in watts. Exemplary embodiments utilize an N-level of nested reconfigurable Lange couplers optimized for either quadrature/through or quadrature/coupled operation. The N-level of nested reconfigurable Lange couplers total in number by the relation 2X(2<sup>N</sup>&#x2212;1), which accounts for both input-side and output-side couplers. Further disclosed is a power reconfigurable power amplifier architecture that provides evenly stepped output power levels in watts without a large reduction in power-added efficiency for lower power states. The present disclosure utilizes the N-level of nested reconfigurable Lange couplers providing 2<sup>N </sup>output power levels and 3.01 N dB of range. The disclosed topology inherently exhibits closely matched AM-AM and AM-PM transfer characteristics.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a simplified diagram of a three-mode reconfigurable quadrature coupler <b>10</b> that is structured in accordance with the present disclosure.

The PORT <b>2</b> transformer <b>12</b> is configured to have a selectable second port reflection coefficient &#x393;<sub>2</sub>. The reconfigurable quadrature coupler <b>10</b> further includes a third port (PORT <b>3</b>) connected to a PORT <b>3</b> transformer <b>14</b>.

The phase relationship between the through and coupled modes is the same as what occurs for normal quadrature operation with the through path being &#x2212;90&#xb0; phase shifted from the coupled path.

In these two exemplary embodiments, an upper power amplifier <b>20</b> and a lower power amplifier <b>22</b> are connected between an input quadrature coupler <b>10</b>-<b>1</b> and an output quadrature coupler <b>10</b>-<b>2</b>. The upper power amplifier <b>20</b> has a first input IN<b>1</b> connected to a first PORT <b>2</b> transformer <b>12</b>-<b>1</b> and a first output OUT<b>1</b> connected to a second PORT <b>4</b> transformer <b>16</b>-<b>2</b>. The lower power amplifier <b>22</b> has a second input IN<b>2</b> connected to the first PORT <b>4</b> transformer <b>16</b>-<b>1</b> and a second output OUT<b>2</b> connected to the second PORT <b>2</b> transformer <b>12</b>-<b>2</b>. A first PORT <b>3</b> transformer <b>14</b>-<b>1</b> is configured as an isolation transformer and in this embodiment is coupled to ground through a 50&#x3a9; isolation resistor. A second PORT <b>3</b> transformer <b>14</b>-<b>2</b> is also configured as an isolation transformer and in this embodiment is also coupled to ground through another 500 isolation resistor.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0053">The operational embodiments of the reconfigurable power amplifier <b>18</b> are monolithically implemented and otherwise assumed to be identical. The 100% output power quadrature mode of operation is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>. However, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, by setting the input quadrature coupler <b>10</b>-<b>1</b> to the through mode, all of the input power is directed to the lower power amplifier <b>22</b>. Relatively very little input power is incident to the upper power amplifier <b>20</b>, which can be disabled with gate bias without self-bias effects due to input drive. The output quadrature coupler <b>10</b>-<b>2</b> is set to the coupled mode directing the output from the lower power amplifier <b>22</b> to the RF output port (RF OUT) of the reconfigurable power amplifier <b>10</b>-<b>2</b>. If the amplifier input power is reduced by 3 dB, the lower power amplifier <b>22</b> experiences the same RF drive as that for the quadrature mode. The overall amplifier output power is reduced by 50% while the gain and power-added efficiency remain unaltered. This scenario is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> for one possible set of terminating impedances.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0054">The quadrature phase relationship between the quadrature, coupled, and through modes is not relevant for the two-level examples shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>. This is not the case for nesting additional pairs of quadrature couplers to generate four, eight, or more power level amplifiers. A four-level reconfigurable power amplifier <b>24</b> configured for maximum output power is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>. Like references to transformers <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, and <b>16</b> represent like configurations. All of the couplers <b>10</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>10</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>10</b>-<b>3</b>, and <b>10</b>-<b>4</b> are set to quadrature mode, and the reconfigurable power amplifier <b>24</b> operates as a conventional four-way balanced amplifier. By setting the couplers <b>10</b>-<b>3</b> and <b>10</b>-<b>4</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, the second upper constituent amplifier <b>20</b>-<b>2</b> is effectively turned off. After a corresponding adjustment of the RF input power, a 25% reduction in overall output power results with no change in gain or efficiency.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0055">For the 75% output power mode shown in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> the quadrature through mode/coupled mode phase relationship is critical if the in-phase power combining is to occur at the output port of the reconfigurable power amplifier. The other two modes of operation, 50% power and 25% power, are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, respectively.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0056">As demonstrated by the two- and four-level examples, this approach is scalable to higher numbers of levels at the expense of die size and some performance degradation due to loss from nesting additional couplers.
