When the pixel size is reduced to a certain extent, such as a pixel size of an 8K liquid crystal display product, a problem of poor liquid crystal diffusion as a result of pressing is prone to occur. A specific mechanism is as follows. When a liquid crystal display panel is beaten by an external force, liquid crystals become disordered. Liquid crystal molecules in a liquid crystal layer that correspond to an upper part of a first trunk electrode of a pixel electrode receive a different recovery force than other positions of the pixel electrode, and therefore cannot return to an original state. As a result, poor liquid crystal diffusion as a result of pressing occurs.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Since an area ratio of a trunk electrode in a pixel electrode in an 8K pixel product is much higher than those in conventional 4 k and 2 k products, the foregoing problem is particularly severe, affecting display quality.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Embodiments of this application provide a liquid crystal display panel and a display device, to resolve an existing problem of a liquid crystal display panel such as poor liquid crystal diffusion as a result of pressing.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Solution</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Embodiments of this application provide a liquid crystal display panel.

An orthographic projection of the first metal line on a pixel electrode covers a first trunk electrode. A voltage difference V<b>1</b> between the first metal line and a common electrode is small (that is, &#x2212;1 V&#x2264;V<sub>1</sub>&#x2264;+1 V), so that a liquid crystal molecule corresponding to the first metal line does not deflect. In this way, a problem of an insufficient liquid crystal recovery force of the liquid crystal molecule corresponding to the first trunk electrode when the liquid crystal display panel is pressed is resolved, eliminating poor liquid crystal diffusion as a result of pressing and improving display quality. As a typical application, the liquid crystal display panel of the present invention is applicable to a display device, such as an 8K liquid crystal display (LCD).</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In an embodiment of the present invention, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a liquid crystal display panel <b>100</b> includes a first substrate <b>110</b> and a second substrate <b>120</b> disposed opposite to each other. A liquid crystal layer <b>130</b> is disposed between the first substrate <b>110</b> and the second substrate <b>120</b> and includes a plurality of liquid crystal molecules <b>131</b>. A common electrode <b>121</b> is disposed on a side of the second substrate <b>120</b> facing the first substrate <b>110</b>. A plurality of scan lines <b>111</b> and a plurality of data lines <b>112</b> are disposed on the first substrate <b>110</b>. The scan lines <b>111</b> and the data lines <b>112</b> intersect to define a plurality of pixel units <b>140</b>. A pixel electrode <b>141</b> is disposed in each pixel unit <b>140</b>. The pixel electrode <b>141</b> includes an outer frame portion <b>142</b> shaped as a frame and a trunk electrode <b>143</b> and a plurality of branch electrodes <b>144</b> connected into the outer frame portion <b>142</b>. The trunk electrode <b>143</b> includes a first trunk electrode <b>1431</b> parallel to the data lines <b>112</b> and a second trunk electrode <b>1432</b> parallel to the scan lines <b>111</b>. The first trunk electrode <b>1431</b> and the second trunk electrode <b>1432</b> intersect each other.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In this embodiment, a first metal line <b>151</b> is disposed on the first substrate <b>110</b>. An orthographic projection of the first metal line <b>151</b> on a plane where the pixel electrode <b>141</b> is located covers at least part of the first trunk electrode <b>1431</b>. A voltage difference between the common electrode <b>121</b> and the first metal line <b>151</b> causes a liquid crystal molecule <b>131</b> corresponding to the first metal line <b>151</b> to be in an opaque state. That is, in this embodiment, the first metal line <b>151</b> is disposed and covers at least half a length of the first trunk electrode <b>1431</b>, and the voltage difference V<sub>1 </sub>between the first metal line <b>151</b> and the common electrode <b>121</b> is 0 V. In other words, a potential on the first metal line <b>151</b> is set to be the same as a potential of the common electrode <b>121</b>, so that a voltage difference across the liquid crystal molecule <b>131</b> corresponding to the first metal line <b>151</b> is 0. Since the voltage difference is 0, the liquid crystal molecule <b>131</b> corresponding to the first metal line <b>151</b> does not deflect, and appears in a black and opaque state macroscopically. In this way, the first metal line <b>151</b> functions as a black matrix (BM) for shielding light. Therefore, since the liquid crystal molecule <b>131</b> corresponding to the first metal line <b>151</b> does not deflect, when the liquid crystal display panel <b>100</b> is beaten, the liquid crystal molecule corresponding to the first metal line <b>151</b> can quickly return to an original state and maintains a black state, so that no light leakage occurs. In addition, since the first trunk electrode <b>1431</b> covered by the first metal line <b>151</b> is originally in a dark state, an aperture ratio and a transmittance are not additionally sacrificed.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In another embodiment of the present invention, the voltage difference between the first metal line <b>151</b> and the common electrode <b>121</b> is &#x2212;1 V&#x2264;V<sub>1</sub>&#x2264;1 V. For example, a voltage applied to the first metal line <b>151</b> is 6 V, a voltage applied to the common electrode <b>121</b> is 7 V, and therefore the voltage difference between the first metal line <b>151</b> and the common electrode <b>121</b> is &#x2212;1 V. Alternatively, the voltage applied to the first metal line <b>151</b> is 8 V, the voltage applied to the common electrode <b>121</b> is 7 V, and therefore the voltage difference between the first metal line <b>151</b> and the common electrode <b>121</b> is +1 V. In this embodiment, the voltage difference between the first metal line <b>151</b> and the common electrode <b>121</b> is not 0. In this case, the liquid crystal molecule <b>131</b> corresponding to the first metal line <b>151</b> deflects, but a deflection angle is small, for example, ranges from &#x2212;2&#xb0; to 2&#xb0;. The liquid crystal molecule <b>131</b> still appears in a black and opaque state macroscopically.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In another embodiment of the present invention, a length of the first metal line <b>151</b> may be adjusted according to a size of the pixel electrode <b>141</b>. For example, a length L<b>1</b> of the first metal line <b>151</b> may be 0.5-1 times a length L<b>2</b> of the pixel electrode <b>141</b>, provided that the orthographic projection of the first metal line <b>151</b> on the pixel electrode <b>141</b> covers at least half the length of the first trunk electrode <b>1431</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a width of the first metal line <b>151</b> is greater than or equal to a width of the first trunk electrode <b>1431</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In another embodiment of the present invention, a second metal line <b>152</b> is further disposed on the first substrate <b>110</b>.

A voltage difference between the second metal line <b>152</b> and the common electrode <b>121</b> is V<sub>2</sub>, and V<sub>2</sub>=V<sub>1</sub>. That is, a liquid crystal molecule <b>131</b> corresponding to the second metal line <b>152</b> does not deflect (V<sub>2</sub>=0 V) or deflects by only a small angle (&#x2212;1 V&#x2264;V<sub>2</sub>&#x2264;1 V), and appears in a black and opaque state macroscopically. In this way, the second metal line <b>152</b> shields light leaked at the scan lines <b>111</b>.
