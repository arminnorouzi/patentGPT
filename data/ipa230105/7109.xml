In the width direction, the composite supporting layer <b>1</b> may be a single piece. Alternatively, the composite supporting layer <b>1</b> may be divided into several segments in this direction, respectively having respective first side and second side or having a common first side and second side. It should be appreciated that for realizing the function of the composite supporting layer, there are no gaps between segments. The composite supporting layer <b>1</b> comprises the bendable tensile layer <b>11</b> and the bendable and flattenable supporting layer <b>12</b> of the tensile layer <b>11</b>. The tensile layer can be made of metal sheets such as steel sheets, which have tensile, bending and resilience capabilities and are extremely thin, can be only about 0.03 mm, to meet the needs of flexible bending and excellent tensile strength and prevent the composite supporting layer from being pulled off. The tensile layer can be made of metal sheets such as steel sheets, and the tensile layer can also be made of other tensile sheets with high strength, such as nylon, Kevlar, polyester and other woven fabrics. Composite bendable and flattenable supporting layer <b>12</b> is provided on the tensile layer, the supporting layer can be made of rubber material, silica gel, resin, leather and other materials, and the tensile layer <b>11</b> can be covered on the top surface of the composite supporting layer <b>1</b> by bonding, the supporting layer <b>12</b> is below the tensile layer, or the tensile layer <b>11</b> can be embedded in the supporting layer <b>12</b>. The length of the supporting layer <b>12</b> matches the length of the middle curved part of the flexible screen mobile electronic terminal when folded, and the length is close to or equal to or exceeds the arc length of the entire curved part when the flexible screen mobile electronic terminal is folded. When the mobile electronic terminal is flattened, the length is at least close to the length of the straight line between the flexible screen supporting plate <b>101</b> of the first side housing <b>100</b> and the flexible screen supporting plate <b>201</b> of the second side housing <b>200</b>, and during the flattening process, the supporting layer <b>12</b> can provide the main compressive ability of composite supporting layer <b>1</b> to the elastic mechanism.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Both sides of the tension layer <b>11</b> is longer than the supporting layer <b>12</b>, and when the outer flexible screen mobile electronic terminal is folded, the tension layer has a straight line segment on both sides <b>111</b> and <b>112</b>, which can have smoother motion performance. As the first side of the composite supporting layer <b>1</b>, the first side <b>111</b> of the tensile layer is connected to the flexible screen supporting plate <b>101</b> of the first side housing <b>100</b> or connected to the part that is fixedly connected to the first side housing in the hinge <b>400</b> of the outer flexible screen mobile electronic terminal; as the second side of the composite supporting layer <b>1</b>, the second side <b>12</b> of the tensile layer <b>11</b> is provided with a part connected to the sliding plate, which is connected to the flexible screen supporting plate <b>201</b> of the second side housing <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As a preferred embodiment, the tension layer <b>11</b> is laid above the supporting layer <b>12</b>, the lower surface of the first side <b>111</b> is connected to the flexible screen supporting plate <b>101</b> of the first side housing, and the lower surface of the second side <b>112</b> is connected to the flexible screen supporting plate <b>201</b> of the second side housing; the upper surface of the tensile layer <b>11</b> is connected to the flexible screen in a fit manner. The flexible screen is pasted on the flexible screen supporting plate of the first side housing, the composite supporting layer, and the flexible screen supporting plate of the second side housing. The hinge <b>400</b> of the outer flexible screen mobile electronic terminal is provided below the composite supporting layer <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">It is envisaged that, for the first side, the flexible screen supporting plate <b>101</b> of the first side housing <b>100</b> can also be arranged as a sliding plate, so that both sides of the composite supporting layer <b>1</b> are connected to the sliding part, to achieve the effect of the present invention, but the design will be more complicated. The hinge <b>400</b> of the outer flexible screen mobile electronic terminal is arranged between the first side housing <b>100</b> and the second side housing <b>200</b>, to connect the first side housing <b>100</b> and the second side housing <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The hinge comprises a middle supporting portion <b>4</b>, a first side connection portion <b>5</b> and a second side connection portion <b>6</b>, a synchronous reverse rotation connecting mechanism.
