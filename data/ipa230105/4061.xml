Among such applications is transport of optical energy and utilizing non-linear effects in the fiber, which are commonly more pronounced with higher optical power inside the fiber. The optical power may be continuous wave (CW), pulsed or a mixture thereof. High optical power inside a fiber may be particularly pronounced with pulsed light where a high peak power may be obtainable even while having a relatively modest average power.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">One limitation of the average power/spectral density carried by an optical fiber is the damage threshold of the fiber. The input facet or the first few millimeters of fiber may be destroyed if the optical power (CW, peak power or pulse energy) is above the bulk glass or glass-air interface damage threshold. It has been observed by the present inventors that even when the optical power is below this threshold the optical fiber may still be observed to degrade over time. This degradation is often observed as increased absorption in the visible over time. For commercial applications a long lifetime may be critical.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An object of the present invention is to provide a fiber where such degradation is either eliminated or reduced.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The objects of the invention are achieved by the invention described in the accompanying claims and as described in the following.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">One object of the invention is achieved by an optical fiber comprising a core and a cladding comprising a core material and a cladding material, respectively, said optical fiber being obtained by a method comprising loading said core material and optionally said cladding material with hydrogen and/or deuterium under loading conditions suitable to allow hydrogen and/or deuterium to bind chemically to said material(s). In one embodiment said loading condition comprises at least one of a) a raised temperature T, b) a raised pressure P c) irradiation and/or d) subsequent irradiation. Such an optical fiber may have particular suitable properties in regard to long lifetime in applications where said fiber is arranged to guide relatively high power, such as pulsed light with relatively high peak power.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one embodiment of the invention degradation of the fiber in a supercontinuum light source for shorter wavelengths is reduced by stripping of higher order modes. Accordingly, in one embodiment the invention relates to a supercontinuum light source comprising a fiber coupled to a pump source where said pump source and said fiber are adapted to provide an optical output spanning over at least one octave with at least 10 &#x3bc;W/nm, and/or wherein said pump and said fiber are adapted to provide a maximum modulation instability gain &#x3a9;<sub>max </sub>larger than 20, wherein at least part of said fiber is arranged to strip higher order modes and/or suppress coupling of light from the fundamental mode to higher order modes. In one embodiment this stripping of higher order modes is combined with loading of the fiber with deuterium and/or hydrogen.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Loading by deuterium is sometimes applied in the art in order to overcome absorptions in the so-called water-band, which increases when the fiber is subjected to hydrogen-rich environments, such as found for undersea communication cables. This issue is not similar to the present problem. In one embodiment the fiber is therefore applied in an environment where it is subjected to a medium with a content of H<sub>2 </sub>and/or H<sup>+</sup>-ions of less than 5 at %, such as less than 1 at %, such as less than 0.1 at %, such as less than 0.01 at %, such as less than 0.001at %.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Loading by deuterium is sometimes applied in the art in order to increase the photosensitivity of the fiber in order to enable changing its refractive index, e.g. to induce a Bragg grating in the fiber by exposure through an external light source perpendicular to the fiber. This issue is not similar to the present problem. In one embodiment the fiber is annealed prior to usage, where said anneal significantly reduces the fibers photosensitivity. In one embodiment the fiber is a pure silica fiber without dopants in which it is difficult to write Bragg gratings even if it was H2 or D2 loaded without a subsequent anneal. In one embodiment the photosensitivity of the fiber pre and/or post anneal is less than 50% of that of a typical fiber used for producing fiber Bragg gratings, such as less than 25%, such as less than 10%, such as less than 5%, such as less 1%, such as less than 0.1%, such as less than 0.001%. In one embodiment the photosensitivity is substantially zero.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one embodiment water-band absorption (such as the peak absorption peak around 1400 nm) may be undesirable. In such an embodiment it may be preferable to load the fiber with as little hydrogen as possible so that in one embodiment the loaded fiber comprises bound deuterium relative to bound hydrogen (and/or their corresponding ions) of more than or equal to 1%, such as more than or equal to 10%, such as more than or equal to 100%, such as more than or equal to 10,000% by atom. However, hydrogen may be preferable for applications where such absorption is either insignificant or even preferable, particularly when it is noted that hydrogen is commonly significantly cheaper than deuterium. Hydrogen may also be preferable for applications where the deuterium induced OD-absorption around 1870 nm is undesirable.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one embodiment the lifetime of a fiber has been found to increase with increased ambient temperature during loading (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>). This dependency indicates that providing energy during loading benefits the lifetime. In one embodiment, the extended lifetime depends on a chemical process occurring between the material of the fiber and hydrogen/deuterium being loaded. In one embodiment, the lifetime has been found to increase by introducing energy subsequent to loading, such as by providing &#x201c;subsequent irradiation&#x201d; which is the term used throughout the application for the provision of energy to loaded material during and/or subsequent to loading. In one embodiment subsequent irradiation is taken to mean introducing energy at a rate higher than provided by the general environment subsequent to loading, i.e. energy provided by keeping the fiber at room temperature or energy provided by normal lighting is not subsequent irradiation. In one embodiment this introduction of energy stimulates the chemical process between unbound Hydrogen/Deuterium and the material. In one embodiment it is therefore preferable that subsequent stimulation comprises localized contribution of energy. In one embodiment said chemical process is binding of at least part of the loaded hydrogen and/or deuterium to the material of the fiber. In one embodiment, the fiber is being loaded by subjecting it to hydrogen and/or deuterium under loading conditions suitably to allow hydrogen and/or deuterium to bind chemically to said material(s). In one embodiment, said loading condition comprising at least one of a) raised temperature T, b) raised pressure P, c) irradiation and d) subsequent irradiation. In one embodiment the fiber is a silica fiber, so that in one embodiment said chemical process is binding of at least part of the loaded Hydrogen and/or deuterium to the silica matrix, such as forming an OH<sup>&#x2212; </sup>or OD<sup>&#x2212; </sup>bond. By providing such loading conditions a fiber comprising an increased amount of bound hydrogen and/or deuterium is obtainable so that in one embodiment the loaded material comprises more than 0.1 atom percent (at %) bound hydrogen and/or deuterium, such as more than 1 at %, such as more than 5 at %, such as more than 10 at %, such as more than 20 atom percent, such as more than 50 at %.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In contrast to photosensitizing of fibers via loading the temperature T is in one embodiment raised to allow for binding as discussed above, so that T is more than or equal to 80&#xb0; C., such as more than or equal to 100&#xb0; C., such as more than or equal to 120&#xb0; C., such as more than or equal to 140&#xb0; C., such as more than or equal to 160&#xb0; C., such as more than or equal to 180&#xb0; C., such as more than or equal to 200&#xb0; C., such as more than or equal to 220&#xb0; C., such as more than or equal to 240&#xb0; C., such as more than or equal to 260&#xb0; C., such as more than or equal to 280&#xb0; C., such as more than or equal to 300&#xb0; C., such as more than or equal to 350&#xb0; C., such as more than or equal to 400&#xb0; C., such as more than or equal to 450&#xb0; C., such as more than or equal to 500&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The fiber may and may not comprise a coating, such as a polymer coating. In an embodiment where the fiber comprises a polymer coating the loading temperature for loading deuterium and/or hydrogen is kept below the melting point of the polymer, such as below the softening temperature of the polymer. The practical upper limit for increasing the loading temperature is likely set by the coating of the fiber. In one embodiment high temperature coating may extend the possible deuterium loading temperature to above 250&#xb0; C. or even higher. One example of a high temperature coating is DeSolite&#xae; DF-0005 or DeSolite&#xae; DF-0009, manufactured by DSM Desotech Inc., which are designed for high temperature fiber applications up to about 250&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Alternatively, fibers without coating may be produced, allowing even higher loading temperature e.g. up to and above 500&#xb0; C. and/or loading of the core (and optionally cladding) material may be performed prior or during the process of forming the fiber i.e. prior to coating. In one embodiment, the fiber is stripped of its coating and subsequently recoated.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one embodiment the chemical reaction time depends on the temperature and/or pressure. In one embodiment the loading time during which the fiber is loaded is at least sufficient to ensure that thermal equilibrium has occurred. In one embodiment the loading time is less than 6 days, such as less than or equal to 4 days, such as less than or equal to 1 days, such as less than or equal to 1 day, such as less than or equal to 12 hours, such as less than or equal to 6 hours, such as less than or equal to 3 hours, such as less than or equal to 2 hours, such as less than or equal to 1 hours, such as less than or equal to 30 minutes, such as less than or equal to 1 minute.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">An increased pressure of the loading gas may in one embodiment be utilized to provide a higher concentration of indiffused hydrogen and/or deuterium in the fiber.

In one embodiment said subsequent irradiation is light, such as light introduced during use of the fiber. In one embodiment said subsequent irradiation alters the glass structure such as by creating and/or activating defects which interact with hydrogen/deuterium. Further details of defects in glass may for example be found in the paper &#x201c;OPTICAL PROPERTIES AND STRUCTURE OF DEFECTS IN SILICA GLASS&#x201d; by D. L. Griscom (Journal of the Ceramic Society of Japan. Vol. 99, no. 1154, pp. 923-942, 1991). In one embodiment said irradiation is light guided by the fiber. In one embodiment light otherwise applied in use of the fiber provides the activation energy. In use of the fiber, the pump light, i.e. the light by which the fiber is pumped, entering the fiber may in one embodiment provide sufficient energy to allow unbound hydrogen/deuterium to interact with the fiber and/or create new defects with which remaining unbound hydrogen/deuterium may interact. In embodiments where the fiber is subjected to signal light and pump light or signal light alone, pump light may also refer to signal light or pump and signal light in combination. In the context of this application such subsequent irradiation of the fiber may be referred to as photo activation. However, in principle any types of irradiation of the fiber providing sufficient energy may be applied. In one embodiment UV radiation is applied as subsequent irradiation, since its higher photon energy enables chemical reactions.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In one embodiment the fiber is cooled subsequent to loading and/or annealing in order to reduce diffusion out of the fiber prior to subsequent irradiation. Accordingly, in one embodiment the fiber is stored at reduced temperature (cold storage) for a period in the time from production, i.e. loading, to subsequent irradiation. In one embodiment, reduced temperature is less than &#x2212;30&#xb0; C., such as less than &#x2212;40&#xb0; C., such as less than &#x2212;50&#xb0; C., such as less than &#x2212;60&#xb0; C., such as less than &#x2212;70&#xb0; C., such as less than &#x2212;90&#xb0; C., such as less than &#x2212;100&#xb0; C. In one embodiment storing at reduced temperature preserves or limits the loss of deuterium and/or Hydrogen over time. In one embodiment storing at reduced temperature is applied substantially until the fiber is put in operation. In one embodiment cold storage is applied substantially until the fiber is subjected to subsequent irradiation. In one embodiment the fiber is stored at reduced temperature after loading either before and/or after anneal. In one embodiment storing at reduced temperature is applied at least part of the time between loading and/or anneal and subsequent irradiation and/or operation. In one embodiment the fiber is subjected to storing at reduced temperature during operation.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In one embodiment the term subsequent in subsequent irradiation, e.g. photo activation, refers to a maximum time between loading and subsequent irradiation less than or equal to 2 months, such as less than or equal to 1 month, such as less than three weeks, such as less than or equal to 14 days, such as less than or equal to 7 days, such as less than or equal to 4 days, such as less than or equal to 1 day, such as less than or equal to 12 hours, such as less than or equal to 6 hours, such as less than or equal to 3 hours, such as less than or equal to 1 hour, such as less than or equal to 1 minute. lithe maximum time between loading and subsequent irradiation is exceeded, this will in one embodiment lead to that the lifetime extension effect of the loading is decreased relative to subjecting the fiber to irradiation immediately after loading. In one embodiment storing the fiber at reduced temperature significantly reduces the effects which cause this decrease in lifetime. In one embodiment the time where the fiber has been stored at reduced temperature is therefore not counted in the calculation of the maximum time as described above. In other words, maximum time between loading and subsequent irradiation refers in one embodiment to a maximum accumulated time, not counting time wherein said fiber has been stored at reduced temperature, between loading and subsequent irradiation of less than 2 months, such as less than 1 month, such as less than 14 days, such as less than 7 days, such as less than 4 days, such as less than 1 day, such as less than 12 hours, such as less than 6 hours, such as less than 3 hours, such as less than 1 hour, such as less than 1 minute. In one embodiment the term stored refers to the fiber not being used while in storage, whereas in one embodiment stored refers to the fiber being in use while in storage.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In one embodiment subsequent irradiation is performed by irradiation of the fiber by applying irradiation transversely to the optical axis. In one embodiment subsequent irradiation is performed by applying irradiation to an end facet of the fiber, such as by coupling light or other radiation into the fiber. In one embodiment said irradiation is side coupled to the fiber. In one embodiment the fiber is subjected to subsequent irradiation prior to annealing the fiber. In one such embodiment the fiber ends of the fiber may be annealed to allow splicing of the fiber. In one embodiment said light is coupled into the fiber by splicing the fiber to a light source of delivery fiber. In one embodiment light is coupled into the fiber via free-space or butt-coupling.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In one embodiment subsequent irradiation, e.g. photo activation, comprises pumping the fiber with light having a peak power density within said fiber equal to or higher than 10 W/&#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>, such as equal to or higher than 50 W/&#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>, such as equal to or higher than 100 W/&#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>, such as equal to or higher than 500 W/&#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>, such as equal to or higher than 1 kW/&#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>, such as equal to or higher than 2.5 kW/&#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>, such as equal to or higher than 5 kW/&#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>, such as equal to or higher than 10 kW/&#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>. In one embodiment the subsequent irradiation comprises pumping said fiber with irradiation having an average power of 50 mW or more, such as 100 mW or more, such as 500 mW or more, such as 1 W or more, such as more than 10 W or more, such as 15 W or more, such as 20 W or more, such as 50 W or more, such as 100 W or more. In one embodiment the subsequent irradiation has a duration of more than 1/1000 of a second, such as more then 1/100 of a second, such as more than 1/10 of a second, such as more than 1 second, such as more than 1 minute, such as more than 1 hour, such as more than 12 hours, such as more than 24 hours, such as more than 48 hours, such as more than 1 week.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In principle the materials may be loaded at any time in the process of forming the fiber. However, consideration may have to be taken to ensure that processes following the loading do not disrupt the achieved extension of the lifetime of the final fiber. Such a disruption may occur if a process following the loading comprises conditions which allow the loaded hydrogen/deuterium to escape from the fiber e.g. a sufficiently high temperature over a sufficiently long time. Accordingly, in one embodiment the loading of the core material, and optionally of said cladding material, being performed prior to forming said fiber, during forming of said fiber and/or after forming said fiber. Furthermore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> discussed below, fibers may, at least partially, be regenerated so that in one embodiment the fiber is loaded after use.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">After deuterium and/or hydrogen loading, the fiber is preferably annealed. The anneal enables splicing the fiber to other fibers (plasma heating of hydrogen/deuterium, such as in fusion splicing, may be explosive) and reduces any added photosensitivity due to these molecules. However, as discussed below, an anneal may also serve other functions such as providing increased lifetime of the fiber and increased spectral stability of embodiments of supercontinuum light sources according to the invention. Furthermore, in one embodiment the fiber is annealed prior to loading of the fiber, such as to relieve defects or stress in the fiber material. In one embodiment the fiber is anneal as a part of the drawing process. In one embodiment fiber is annealed between pulling the fiber and coating of the fiber. In one embodiment the temperature of this anneal is equal to or less than the temperature applied to the preform when pulling the fiber, such as 90% or less of that temperature, such as 80% or less of that temperature, such as 70% or less of that temperature, such as 60% or less of that temperature, such as 50% or less of that temperature, such as 40% or less of that temperature, such as 30% or less of that temperature, such as 20% or less that temperature, such as 10% or less that temperature. In one embodiment the anneal is a flash anneal providing a relatively brief high energy irradiation.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one embodiment excessive anneal temperature above approximate 1000&#xb0; C. may lead to out diffusion of the bound hydrogen/deuterium and is therefore often undesirable. In one embodiment the anneal is performed for more than 30 minutes, such as more than 1 hours, such as more than 4 hours, such as more than 8 hours, such as more than 16 hours, such as more than 32 hours, such as more 64 hours. In one embodiment the anneal is a flash anneal of the fiber with or without coating. In one embodiment said anneal is performed at a temperature T<sub>anneal </sub>of more than 40&#xb0; C., such as more than 50&#xb0; C., such as more than 60&#xb0; C., such as more than 70&#xb0; C., such as more than 80&#xb0; C., such as more than 90&#xb0; C., such as more than 100&#xb0; C., such as more than 110&#xb0; C., such as more than 120&#xb0; C., such as more than 130&#xb0; C., such as more than 140&#xb0; C., such as more than 150&#xb0; C., such as more than 160&#xb0; C., such as more than 200&#xb0; C., such as more than 250&#xb0; C., such as more than 300&#xb0; C., such as more than 350&#xb0; C., such as more than 450&#xb0; C., such as more than 550&#xb0; C. In one embodiment the anneal is performed in a chamber comprising an atmosphere adapted to be less aggressive with respect to the materials of the fiber, such as its coating, relative to atmospheric air. Surrounding the fiber with such an atmosphere during the anneal may provide a reduction in damage to the fiber and/or its coating due to the raised temperature relative to atmospheric air. In one embodiment said atmosphere of the chamber comprises a mixture of gasses that have low tendency to interact chemically with the optical fiber and/or its coating. In one embodiment the anneal is performed in an atmosphere which is essentially free of oxygen or other free radicals. In one embodiment the anneal is performed in an atmosphere substantially formed by Nitrogen, Argon, an inert gas, or a mixture thereof.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one embodiment the anneal is performed in the same chamber that is used for loading. In one embodiment the fiber is subjected to subsequent irradiation during the anneal. In one embodiment the fiber is exposed to a flash irradiation in the chamber. In one embodiment the irradiation is coupled into the fiber such as by irradiating the fiber end inside or outside the chamber. In one embodiment a piece of transport fiber is spliced to the fiber to allow the entire fiber to reside in the chamber. In one embodiment the fiber end which the transport fiber is spliced to is annealed sufficiently to allow splicing. In one embodiment the irradiation is a general irradiation of at least part of the fiber surface such as via a light source in the chamber and/or through a window in the chamber.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In one embodiment the lifetime of the fiber is extended relative to the lifetime of an otherwise identical fiber not subjected to loading by deuterium and/or hydrogen by more than 50%, such as more than 100%, such as more than 200%, such as more than 500%, such as more than 1000%, such as more than 10.000%. The absolute lifetime of a fiber subjected to light suitable for generating a supercontinuum may vary depending on the application as well as on the particular material of the fiber core. In one embodiment the lifetime is more than 100 operating hours, such as more than 200 operating hours, such as more than 2000 operating hours, such as more than 20000 operating hours, such as more than 50000 operating hours.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one embodiment the lifetime of a fiber has been found to scale inversely with the peak power of the guided light to the fourth power. Accordingly, in such embodiment a reduction of the peak power by a factor of 2 may extend the lifetime of the fibre by a factor 16.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In one embodiment the lifetime is measured after an initial burn out time of more than 1 minute, such as more than 1 hour, such as more than 5 hours, such as more than 10 hours, such as more than 15 hours, such as more than 20 hours, such as more than 24 hours, such as more than 2 days, such as more than 7 days. In one embodiment, an initial burn out time was observed to impose a decrease of 10% of the spectrum in the visible emitted by a supercontinuum light source. In this context &#x201c;burn out time&#x201d; is understood as an initial time of operation where after the system/fiber/light source reaches a steady state operation. In this context steady state is taken to mean that performance changes are slow relative to the performance change during the burn out time, such as at least 50% or lower, such as at least 100% slower, such as at least 300% slower. In one such example a laser has an output power which increases 2% and thereafter reduces about 10% during the initial two days of operation after which it has a 2% reduction of output power during the next 100 days of operation all else maintained equal. In such an example &#x201c;burn out time&#x201d; may be defined as the first two days of operation. In one embodiment lifetime could be defined relative to the initial output power and in one embodiment relative to the maximum output power and in one embodiment relative to the output power after two days of operation.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In one embodiment the lifetime of a fiber is defined as time in which the fiber may be operated according to its operational purpose. In one embodiment the lifetime of a fiber is defined as the time after which the absorption has increased by more than or equal to 1%, such as more than or equal to 5%, such as more than or equal to 10%, such as more than or equal to 20%, such as more than or equal to 30%, such as more than or equal to 40%, such as more than or equal to 50%, such as more than or equal to 100%, such as more than or equal to 200%, such as more than or equal to 500%, such as more than or equal to 1000%.

In one such embodiment the lifetime of the fiber is defined as the time after which the optical output power of the light source or system is reduced by more than or equal to 1% all else equal, such as more than or equal to 5%, such as more than or equal to 10%, such as more than or equal to 20%, such as more than or equal to 30%, such as more than or equal to 40%, such as more than or equal to 50%, such as more than or equal to 60%, such as more than or equal to 70%, such as more than or equal to 80%, such as more than or equal to 90%. In one embodiment the optical output of said light source and/or system emitting light is pulsed, in which case the optical output power may be taken to be the peak power, average power and/or pulse power. In one embodiment the optical output power relates to the contribution of pump energy to the light source and/or system emitting light either via optical power (such as via a pump laser) or electrically or by other means. In one embodiment the lifetime is defined as more than or equal to a 1% increase in pump energy that is required to maintain the same optical output power, such as more than or equal to 5%, such as more than or equal to 10%, such as more than or equal to 20%, such as more than or equal to 30%, such as more than or equal to 40%, such as more than or equal to 50%, such as more than or equal to 100%, such as more than or equal to 200%, such as more than or equal to 500%, such as more than or equal to 1000%.

As the absorption cross sections of these bonds are known the measured peak height may in one embodiment be used to determine the concentration of such bonds. In one embodiment said peak(s) may be applied to determine an overrepresentation of hydrogen and/or deuterium relative to an unloaded fiber.

However, it should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention, are given by way of illustration only, and should not be taken to limit the inventions as set forth by the appended set of claims.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILS OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In the following some examples will comprise discussion of the invention based on measured data. The conclusions drawn from these should not necessarily be considered limited to the specifics of the underlying experiments.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Super Continuum Generation in Microstructured Fibers</heading><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In one embodiment, of the invention the optical fiber is a microstructured optical fiber. Microstructured optical fibers are a relatively new technical field where the properties of the waveguide may be designed with a relatively large degree of freedom. Such fibers are commonly made of pure silica comprising a pattern, often made of holes or doped glass, extending in the longitudinal direction of the fiber. The freedom of design makes such fibers interesting for application requiring specific non-linear properties of the fiber. One such application is supercontinuum generation wherein a fiber based source is cable of generating a wide spectral output. Supercontinuum (SC) generation in microstructured fibers has been studied for several years as a source of broadband light (termed white light or supercontinuum). While new applications of such sources are continuously discovered, several have already been identified, such as various forms of fluorescent microscopy, laser precision spectroscopy, and optical coherence tomography (OCT). High brightness emission in the visible part of the spectrum is especially important for confocal fluorescent microscopy. SC-generation with relatively high power in the visible has been targeted in the experiments presented here. Most research has so far been based on seeding the microstructured fiber with femtosecond (fs)-lasers but SC-generation using nanosecond-and picosecond (ps)-lasers has also been demonstrated.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">As microstructured fibers often guides by holes extending in the cladding such fibers often consist entirely of un-doped silica (i.e. both core and cladding are made of silica) in opposition to e.g. standard single mode communication fibers where the core is commonly doped with germanium in order to change the refractive index. Accordingly, in one embodiment the core of the fiber comprises a Germanium content of less than or equal to 20 at %, such as less than 5 at %, such as less than 3 at %, such as less than 2 at %, such as less than 0.1 at %, such as less than 0.01 at %, such as less than 0.001 at %.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In one embodiment, submitting the fiber to subsequent irradiation may significantly improve the lifetime of the fiber. In one embodiment experimental results have shown a reduction of optical power of a supercontinuum light source of 30% after 40 hours of operation when the fiber has not been loaded, 30% after 80 hours when the fiber has been loaded and the ends subsequently sealed and the fiber stored at room temperature for over 1 month and only 4% after 200 hours when the fiber was loaded and photo activated within 1 week of load with the ends sealed. It may be noted that in one embodiment experiments have shown that the above degradation scales with applied peak power to the fourth power. Accordingly, the above periods may in one embodiment be extended by e.g. a factor of 16 by reducing the applied optical peak power with 50%. In one embodiment the latter result was found to drop approximately 10% over the first 24 hours where after the source showed this stability.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In one embodiment, the application of irradiation of the fiber subsequent to loading utilizes gaseous hydrogen/deuterium residing in the microstructures formed by holes of a microstructured fiber. In one embodiment the fiber is annealed to improve the life time of the fiber and/or to allow splicing of the end, such as discussed above. However in one embodiment it may be preferable to allow gaseous hydrogen/deuterium to reside in the holes of the microstructure just prior to or during subsequent irradiation, such as photo activation. In such embodiments it may be preferable to seal one or both ends of the fiber. Said sealing is performed prior to storage at reduced temperature and/or prior to loading. In one embodiment sealing is performed by supplying sufficient thermal power, such as by an arch or fusion splicer. In one embodiment sealing is performed by applying a resin, such as epoxy to the fiber ends. In one embodiment said resin may be UV cured. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the initial absorption shown by the dip in transmission around 1710 nm (101) is substantially unchanged for a fiber just after loading (B) and 22 hours post loading with sealed ends (C). On the other hand the same peak is shown to be substantially gone after just 2.5 hours when the ends are left unsealed (A). In some embodiments of the invention the application of such microstructured fibers is selected from the group of supercontinuum generation, optical power transport, optical amplification and forming part of a laser cavity. It is preferred that the irradiation is performed subsequent to loading; however, in one embodiment, it is performed during loading.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In one embodiment sealing of the fiber ends may be preferable to minimize the entrance of impurities into the fiber via the microstructures. In one embodiment such impurities comprises water, which may condensate on the fiber post having the fiber stored at reduced temperature. In one such embodiment said water may otherwise travel to the inside of the fiber via capillary forces and/or diffusion.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">As will be apparent to the skilled person, the considerations in regard to gaseous hydrogen/deuterium in the microstructures and the sealing of these may in one embodiment be relevant for applications of microstructured fibers other than super continuum generation, such as power delivery.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In one embodiment the invention relates to a supercontinuum light source comprising a pulsed pump light source and an optical fiber according to the invention wherein said pump source is adapted to provide light with a peak power density within said fiber equal to or higher than 10 W/&#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>, such as equal to or higher than 50 W/&#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>, such as equal to or higher than 100 W/&#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>, such as equal to or higher than 0.5 kW/&#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>, such as equal to or higher than 1 kW/&#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>, such as equal to or higher than 2.5 kW/&#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>, such as equal to or higher than 5 kW/&#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>, such as equal to or higher than 10 kW/&#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>, and/or wherein said pump and fiber is adapted to provide an output spanning over at least one octave with at least 10 &#x3bc;W/nm and/or wherein said pump and said fiber is adapted to provide a maximum modulation instability gain &#x3a9;<sub>max </sub>such as larger than 20, such as larger than 40.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Here the modulation instability gain &#x3a9;<sub>max </sub>is given by</p><p id="p-0081" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00002" num="00002"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mrow>   <msub>    <mi>&#x3a9;</mi>    <mi>max</mi>   </msub>   <mo>=</mo>   <mrow>    <mo>&#xb1;</mo>    <msqrt>     <mfrac>      <mrow>       <mn>2</mn>       <mo>&#x2062;</mo>       <mi>&#x3b3;</mi>       <mo>&#x2062;</mo>       <msub>        <mi>P</mi>        <mi>peak</mi>       </msub>      </mrow>      <mrow>       <semantics definitionURL="">        <mo>&#x2758;</mo>        <annotation encoding="Mathematica">"\[LeftBracketingBar]"</annotation>       </semantics>       <msub>        <mi>&#x3b2;</mi>        <mn>2</mn>       </msub>       <semantics definitionURL="">        <mo>&#x2758;</mo>        <annotation encoding="Mathematica">"\[RightBracketingBar]"</annotation>       </semantics>      </mrow>     </mfrac>    </msqrt>   </mrow>  </mrow>  <mo>,</mo> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0082" num="0000">where &#x3b2;<sub>2 </sub>is the group velocity at the pump wavelength, P<sub>peak </sub>is the peak power of the pump and &#x3b3; is the pump wavelength.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0080">In one example more than one octave span has been achieved with the microstructured nonlinear fiber SC-5.0-1040 from the Danish company Crystal Fiber A/S.

The reduction in the visible portion of the spectrum extending from about 450 nm to about 750 nm testifies to the degradation of the fiber. The phenomenon is investigated further by the measurements shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> showing attenuation for the prior art microstructured nonlinear fiber operated for 35 hours as a function of the position of the fiber from the entrance of the pump light. A is measured through the first 3 m of the nonlinear fiber (NL-fiber), B is through 3-4 m, C through 4-5 m and D through 5-7 m. The curves are obtained by subtracting a spectrum obtained with a 7 m long reference non-linear fiber which has not been operated with high power for a longer duration of time. Very large absorption is observed in the visible part of the spectrum due to the degradation of the fiber. The dip at 0.9 &#x3bc;m and 1.4 &#x3bc;m likely stems from the single-mode cut-off for the microstructured nonlinear fiber and differences in O&#x2014;H peak absorption for the microstructured nonlinear fiber and the reference fiber, respectively. If the degradation is caused by interaction with the relatively high peak powered pump pulse, then the degradation is expected to be larger closer to the pump laser where the peak power is maximal. As the pump pulses travel through the fiber their average power decreases due to attenuation. Furthermore, non-linear effects will tend to broaden the pulse to reduce the peak power of the pulses along the fiber. Therefore less degradation is expected along the fiber further from the injection of the pump pulses. This tendency is seen in this example as the absorption drops as the fiber sections are taken from parts which were operated further and further from the pump. This trend is also found in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> showing that measurements of the absorption at 633 nm as a function of distance from the entrance of the pump light fit well to an exponential.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows the supercontinuum spectra in the beginning of the experiment (A), after 35 hours were the visible dip is observed (B) and again after heating the fiber to 250&#xb0; C.
