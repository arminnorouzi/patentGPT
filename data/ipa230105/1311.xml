level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority from French Patent Application No. 2107098, filed Jun. 30, 2021, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a Ferris wheel installation comprising a wheel rim structure which is rotatable about a horizontal axis of revolution, and at least one gondola which is connected to the wheel rim structure by a guide structure so as to rotate with respect to the wheel rim structure about an axis of rotation which is parallel to the axis of revolution of the wheel rim structure and remote from the axis of revolution of the wheel rim structure, most often in order to maintain the attitude of the gondola during the revolution of the wheel rim.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">An installation of this kind, which comprises gondolas which are each guided so as to rotate with respect to the wheel rim of the Ferris wheel, by a large-diameter bearing that surrounds the gondola, is described in the document DE476892.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">WO2012/140330 describes a device for mounting the gondolas used in these installations. Said device comprises an outer ring which is rigidly connected to the wheel rim of the Ferris wheel, and a rotating inner ring which is rigidly connected to the gondola. These two rings may rotate relative to one another by virtue of a spacer bearing. The outer ring comprises three lugs which are coplanar and are angularly offset, which ensures the support of the gondola on the wheel rim.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For installations of larger dimensions, intended for receiving a large number of passengers, it is possible to provide for guiding the gondolas so as to rotate with respect to the wheel rim, by using two coaxial bearings of large diameters, which are spaced apart from one another, as described for example in the document FR3088014.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">When the bearing(s) of a gondola are connected to the wheel rim of the Ferris wheel by a plurality of anchoring points, there are risks of errors in the alignment of the axis of rotation of the gondola with respect to the axis of revolution of the wheel rim of the Ferris wheel, or, in the case of gondolas guided by two bearings, a risk of error in the alignment of the axes of rotation of the two bearings. Such alignment errors generate stresses and wear which are prejudicial to the longevity of the installation. However, correcting these alignment errors during assembly of the gondolas on the wheel rim of the Ferris wheel is time-consuming and particularly delicate, given the dimensions of the apparatus.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The difficulties are accentuated further when the assembly of the gondolas is envisaged during renovation of an installation, of which the pre-existing wheel rim of the Ferris wheel does not necessarily meet the same specifications as the gondolas in terms of dimensional tolerance and may have worked during prior service periods.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Alignment errors may also be encountered after the assembly, on account, for example, of deformations of the wheel rim of the Ferris wheel over time, whether these be permanent and due to ageing, or cyclical, in particular on account of thermal expansions.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In this context, the aim of the invention is that of proposing a technical solution which makes it possible to limit the stresses generated in the region of the interface between the gondolas and the wheel rim of the Ferris wheel.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">This aim is achieved according to the invention by a Ferris wheel installation comprising a wheel rim structure which is rotatable about a horizontal axis of revolution, and at least one gondola which is connected to the wheel rim structure by a guide structure comprising at least one bearing. Said guide structure allows the gondola to rotate with respect to the wheel rim structure about an axis of rotation which is in parallel or substantially parallel to the axis of revolution of the wheel rim structure and remote from the axis of revolution of the wheel rim structure.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to the invention, the bearing is connected to the wheel rim structure by two sliding ball joints which have slide axes that are parallel to one another and spaced apart from one another. A sliding ball joint connection offers three degrees of rotational freedom and one degree of translational freedom. The sliding ball joints provide the bearing with a freedom of positioning and orientation in space, with respect to the wheel rim structure, such that the rotation of the gondola with respect to the wheel rim structure does not cause any significant stresses at the interface between the bearing and the wheel rim structure.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In practice, the bearing comprises at least two opposing raceways which are guided, relative to one another, so as to rotate about the axis of rotation of the bearing, a first of the two raceways being rigidly connected to the gondola, and a second of the two raceways being rigidly connected to a support which is connected to the wheel rim structure by the sliding ball joints. The raceways may be formed by bearing rings which are integral or in multiple parts. According to an embodiment, the first of the two raceways is an outer raceway of the bearing, while the second of the two raceways is an inner raceway of the bearing. The reverse is also possible.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In practice, a reference position of the guide structure exists, in which the axis of rotation of the bearing is parallel to the slide axes of the sliding ball joints. Preferably, the axis of rotation of the bearing is equidistant from the slide axes, in the reference position.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The two ball joints together provide the bearing with a freedom of movement with respect to the wheel rim structure. Preferably:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0015">in the first contact position, the bearing is free to pivot about a tilt axis which is coplanar with the slide axes and perpendicular to the slide axes, and/or</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0016">in the first contact position, the bearing is free to pivot about a pivot axis which is secant with the axis of rotation of the gondola. In practice, this movement is accompanied by a translation of the sliding ball joints in opposing axial directions.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0016" num="0017">According to an embodiment, the guide structure comprises a stop device which comprises at least one first stop which is rigidly connected to the bearing opposite a first counter-stop which is rigidly connected to the wheel rim structure, the first stop and the first counter-stop being, in a first contact position, in contact with one another according to a first contact zone so as to limit a translational movement of the bearing with respect to the wheel rim structure, parallel to the slide axes, in a first direction of translation.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0018">The first stop allows for a transmission of stresses from the gondola to the wheel rim structure, in particular stresses due to the wind.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0019">The first contact zone is preferably located at less than 10 cm from a plane containing the slide axes, and/or at less than 10 cm from a median plane between the two slide axes.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0020">According to an embodiment, the stop device comprises at least one second stop which is rigidly connected to the bearing opposite a second counter-stop which is rigidly connected to the wheel rim structure, the second stop and the second counter-stop being, in a second contact position, in contact according to a second contact zone so as to limit a translational movement of the bearing with respect to the wheel rim structure, parallel to the slide axes, in a second direction of translation which is opposite the first direction of translation.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0021">According to an embodiment, the stop device allows for translation of the bearing with respect to the wheel rim structure, parallel to the axis of rotation of the gondola, having an axial clearance between the first contact position and the second contact position. According to an alternative embodiment, the first contact position is coincident with the second contact position, and the stop device prohibits any translation of the bearing with respect to the wheel rim structure, parallel to the axis of rotation of the gondola.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0022">According to an embodiment of the invention, each sliding ball joint comprises a plain bearing. According to another embodiment, each sliding ball joint comprises a ball joint bearing, for example a spherical bearing.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0023">According to an embodiment, the wheel rim structure comprises two parallel shields which define a spacer recess in which a portion of a support, rigidly connected to the bearing, and the two sliding ball joints, are received. Preferably, the two shields belong to a common plate which is fixed to a wheel rim of the wheel rim structure. The counter-stop(s) which limit the translational movements of the bearing are preferably rigidly connected to said common plate.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0024">According to an embodiment, the guide structure comprises at least one additional bearing which defines an axis of rotation, the additional bearing being rigidly connected to the gondola and connected to the wheel rim structure, preferably by two additional sliding ball joints which have slide axes that are parallel to and spaced apart from one another, the additional bearing being at a distance from the bearing, measured parallel to the axis of rotation of the gondola, that is greater than <b>1</b> meter.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0025">In practice, the additional bearing comprises at least two additional opposing raceways which are guided, relative to one another, so as to rotate about the axis of rotation of the additional bearing, a first of the two additional raceways being rigidly connected to the gondola, and a second of the two additional raceways being rigidly connected to a support which is connected to the wheel rim structure by the additional sliding ball joints.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0026">Preferably, the slide axes of the two additional sliding ball joints are parallel to the axis of rotation of the additional bearing. Preferably, the slide axes of the two additional sliding ball joints are each coincident with one of the slide axes of the two sliding ball joints, within manufacturing tolerances.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0027">The two additional ball joints together provide the additional bearing with a freedom of movement with respect to the wheel rim structure.

The gondola <b>14</b> shown is of large dimensions and makes it possible to receive a significant number of passengers, a dozen or more, seated or standing.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0042">The guide structure <b>16</b> of the gondola <b>14</b> comprises at least one bearing <b>20</b>, and preferably two bearings <b>20</b>, which are located in planes remote from one another, ideally in parallel, such that the axes of rotation <b>100</b> of the bearings are ideally coincident, and together define the axis of rotation of the gondola. In the embodiment, each of the bearings <b>20</b> is located in the joint plane between the central cylindrical part <b>14</b>.<b>1</b> and one of the nose cone-shaped end parts <b>14</b>.<b>2</b> of the structure of the gondola <b>14</b>, and has a diameter of more than 1.5 meters, and preferably more than 2 meters.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0043">Each bearing <b>20</b> comprises two bearing rings <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> which form opposing raceways <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> on which rolling elements <b>30</b> roll so as to guide a relative rotational movement between the two raceways <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> about the axis of rotation <b>100</b> of the bearing <b>20</b>. More specifically, a first ring <b>22</b> forming a first raceway <b>26</b> is rigidly connected to the gondola <b>10</b>, while the second ring <b>24</b> forming the second raceway <b>28</b> is rigidly connected to a support <b>32</b> connected to a plate <b>34</b> that is rigidly connected to the wheel rim structure <b>12</b>. In a variant, the support <b>32</b> and the ring <b>24</b> may form just one single piece.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0044">The plate <b>34</b> is preferably formed in one piece, so as to have perfectly controlled dimensions, and comprises for example two parallel shields <b>36</b> which define therebetween a spacer recess <b>38</b> in which a portion of the support <b>32</b> is received. The plate <b>34</b> comprises an interface <b>40</b> for fixing to the body of the wheel rim structure <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0045">The kinematic connection between the plate <b>34</b> and the support <b>32</b> is achieved by two sliding ball joints <b>42</b> having slide axes <b>200</b> which are parallel to one another and remote from one another. In the context of the invention, a sliding ball joint is a mechanical connection which ensures three degrees of rotational freedom about a center of rotation, as well as one degree of translational freedom from the center of rotation along a slide axis. For some applications, the movements according to the degrees of rotational freedom may, if applicable, be of a very small amplitude, for example less than 5&#xb0;. The degree of translational freedom may in turn be of the order of 20 mm. However, these values are given by way of example, since they may vary considerably according to the geometrical defects observed for the structure of the capsule, or the dimensions of the capsule and of the bearings. Larger clearances are not excluded. The slide axes <b>200</b> of the two sliding ball joints <b>42</b> are preferably parallel to the axis of rotation <b>100</b> of the bearing <b>20</b> which they support, at least in a median reference position of the guide structure <b>16</b>. Said sliding ball joints <b>42</b> are received between the two parallel shields <b>36</b> of the plate <b>34</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0046">Each sliding ball joint <b>42</b> comprises, for example, a ring <b>44</b> which is received in a clevis <b>46</b> which is fixed to the support <b>32</b> and is intended to receive a plain bearing <b>48</b> which is at least partially spherical and slides on a shaft formed for example by a pin <b>50</b> that is rigidly connected to the two parallel shields <b>36</b>, for example by two flanges <b>52</b>. The ring <b>36</b>, rigidly connected to the clevis <b>46</b>, comprises a concave slide track having a spherical casing and a profile that is complementary to the outer profile of the plain bearing <b>48</b>, so as to be able to rotate about the center of the bearing <b>48</b>, which can itself move along the axis <b>200</b> of the pin <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0047">The slide axes <b>200</b> defined by the pins <b>40</b> are parallel. Each sliding ball joint <b>42</b> provides the connection between the support <b>32</b> and the plate <b>34</b> with three degrees of rotational freedom and one degree of translational freedom parallel to the axis <b>200</b> of the pin <b>50</b>, which makes it possible to correct the possible offsets between the supports <b>32</b> or between the axes of rotation <b>100</b> of the two bearings <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0048">The guide structure <b>16</b> comprises, for at least one of the supports <b>32</b>, and in this case for the two supports <b>32</b>, a stop device <b>54</b> which is preferably received between the two shields <b>36</b> of the plate <b>34</b>. Each stop device <b>54</b> (one of which is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, and the other in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) comprises two stops <b>56</b> which are rigidly connected to one of the shields <b>36</b> of the plate <b>34</b>, each opposite a counter-stop <b>58</b> which is rigidly connected to the support <b>32</b>, and thereby rigidly connected to the wheel rim structure <b>12</b>.

In a similar manner, the second of the stops <b>56</b> comes into contact with the counter-stop <b>58</b> facing it in a second contact position, in order to limit a translational movement of the support <b>32</b> with respect to the wheel rim structure <b>12</b>, parallel to the slide axes <b>200</b>, in a second direction of translation which is opposite to the first.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0049">In each of the contact positions, the contact zone Z (indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) between the stop <b>56</b> in question and the corresponding counter-stop <b>58</b> is positioned approximately halfway between the sliding ball joints <b>42</b>.
