electrical energy are in use today. However, the systems typically utilize a large number of batteries connected in series. The serial arrangement is highly inflexible and severely limits the range of applications for which the energy storage system can be used. Complex and expensive power conversion equipment was required to interface the serial energy buffers to different power sources.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As such, a need exists for improved energy storage systems capable of interfacing with different power sources in a flexible and efficient manner.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Example embodiments of systems, devices, and methods are provided herein for energy systems having multiple modules arranged in cascaded fashion for storing and discharging power. These multiple modules can be arranged in multiple serial arrays and the modules within each array can be individually controlled such that the array is capable of outputting a cumulative voltage signal in an AC or DC format, where the cumulative voltage signal is a superposition of the voltages generated by each module of the array. The arrays can be connected together using an arrangement of conductors and switches that permits the arrays to be reconfigured for interfacing the energy system with either a DC or AC entity. Such reconfiguration permits the system to receive power from a source of a first type, either AC or DC, to buffer the power, and to output the power to the DC or AC entity. Applications for the reconfigurable arrays are described, such as stationary and mobile charge stations.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Other systems, devices, methods, features and advantages of the subject matter described herein will be or will become apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following figures and detailed description.

Such references are made for ease of explanation and do not mean that a particular embodiment is limited for use to only that particular mobile or stationary application. Embodiments of systems providing power to a motor can be used in both mobile and stationary applications. While certain configurations may be more suitable to some applications over others, all example embodiments disclosed herein are capable of use in both mobile and stationary applications unless otherwise noted.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Module-Based Energy System Examples</heading><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a block diagram depicts an example embodiment of a module-based energy system <b>100</b>. Here, system <b>100</b> includes control system <b>102</b> communicatively coupled with N converter-source modules <b>108</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>108</b>-N, over communication paths or links <b>106</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>106</b>-N, respectively. Modules <b>108</b> are configured to store energy and output the energy as needed to a load <b>101</b> (or other modules <b>108</b>). In these embodiments, any number of two or more modules <b>108</b> can be used (e.g., N is greater than or equal to two). Modules <b>108</b> can be connected to each other in a variety of manners as will be described in more detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>E</figref>. For ease of illustration, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>C</figref>, modules <b>108</b> are shown connected in series, or as a one dimensional array, where the Nth module is coupled to load <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">System <b>100</b> is configured to supply power to load <b>101</b>. Load <b>101</b> can be any type of load such as a motor or a grid. System <b>100</b> is also configured to store power received from a charge source. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>F</figref> is a block diagram depicting an example embodiment of system <b>100</b> with a power input interface <b>151</b> for receiving power from a charge source <b>150</b> and a power output interface for outputting power to load <b>101</b>. In this embodiment system <b>100</b> can receive and store power over interface <b>151</b> at the same time as outputting power over interface <b>152</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>G</figref> is a block diagram depicting another example embodiment of system <b>100</b> with a switchable interface <b>154</b>.

System <b>100</b> can be configured to supply multiple loads <b>101</b>, including both primary and auxiliary loads, and/or receive power from multiple charge sources <b>150</b> (e.g., a utility-operated power grid and a local renewable energy source (e.g., solar)).</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> depicts another example embodiment of system <b>100</b>. Here, control system <b>102</b> is implemented as a master control device (MCD) <b>112</b> communicatively coupled with N different local control devices (LCDs) <b>114</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>114</b>-N over communication paths or links <b>115</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>115</b>-N, respectively. Each LCD <b>114</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>114</b>-N is communicatively coupled with one module <b>108</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>108</b>-N over communication paths or links <b>116</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>116</b>-N, respectively, such that there is a 1:1 relationship between LCDs <b>114</b> and modules <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> depicts another example embodiment of system <b>100</b>. Here, MCD <b>112</b> is communicatively coupled with M different LCDs <b>114</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>114</b>-M over communication paths or links <b>115</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>115</b>-M, respectively. Each LCD <b>114</b> can be coupled with and control two or more modules <b>108</b>. In the example shown here, each LCD <b>114</b> is communicatively coupled with two modules <b>108</b>, such that M LCDs <b>114</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>114</b>-M are coupled with <b>2</b>M modules <b>108</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>108</b>-<b>2</b>M over communication paths or links <b>116</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>116</b>-<b>2</b>M, respectively.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Control system <b>102</b> can be configured as a single device (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>) for the entire system <b>100</b> or can be distributed across or implemented as multiple devices (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>B-<b>1</b>C</figref>). In some embodiments, control system <b>102</b> can be distributed between LCDs <b>114</b> associated with the modules <b>108</b>, such that no MCD <b>112</b> is necessary and can be omitted from system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Control system <b>102</b> can be configured to execute control using software (instructions stored in memory that are executable by processing circuitry), hardware, or a combination thereof. The one or more devices of control system <b>102</b> can each include processing circuitry <b>120</b> and memory <b>122</b> as shown here. Example implementations of processing circuitry and memory are described further below.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Control system <b>102</b> can have a communicative interface for communicating with devices <b>104</b> external to system <b>100</b> over a communication link or path <b>105</b>. For example, control system <b>102</b> (e.g., MCD <b>112</b>) can output data or information about system <b>100</b> to another control device <b>104</b> (e.g., the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) or Motor Control Unit (MCU) of a vehicle in a mobile application, grid controller in a stationary application, etc.).</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Communication paths or links <b>105</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>115</b>, <b>116</b>, and <b>118</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>) can each be wired (e.g., electrical, optical) or wireless communication paths that communicate data or information bidirectionally, in parallel or series fashion. Data can be communicated in a standardized (e.g., IEEE, ANSI) or custom (e.g., proprietary) format. In automotive applications, communication paths <b>115</b> can be configured to communicate according to FlexRay or CAN protocols. Communication paths <b>106</b>, <b>115</b>, <b>116</b>, and <b>118</b> can also provide wired power to directly supply the operating power for system <b>102</b> from one or more modules <b>108</b>. For example, the operating power for each LCD <b>114</b> can be supplied only by the one or more modules <b>108</b> to which that LCD <b>114</b> is connected and the operating power for MCD <b>112</b> can be supplied indirectly from one or more of modules <b>108</b> (e.g., such as through a car's power network).</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Control system <b>102</b> is configured to control one or more modules <b>108</b> based on status information received from the same or different one or more of modules <b>108</b>. Control can also be based on one or more other factors, such as requirements of load <b>101</b>. Controllable aspects include, but are not limited to, one or more of voltage, current, phase, and/or output power of each module <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Status information of every module <b>108</b> in system <b>100</b> can be communicated to control system <b>102</b>, which can independently control every module <b>108</b>-<b>1</b> . . . <b>108</b>-N. Other variations are possible. For example, a particular module <b>108</b> (or subset of modules <b>108</b>) can be controlled based on status information of that particular module <b>108</b> (or subset), based on status information of a different module <b>108</b> that is not that particular module <b>108</b> (or subset), based on status information of all modules <b>108</b> other than that particular module <b>108</b> (or subset), based on status information of that particular module <b>108</b> (or subset) and status information of at least one other module <b>108</b> that is not that particular module <b>108</b> (or subset), or based on status information of all modules <b>108</b> in system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The status information can be information about one or more aspects, characteristics, or parameters of each module <b>108</b>. Types of status information include, but are not limited to, the following aspects of a module <b>108</b> or one or more components thereof (e.g., energy source, energy buffer, converter, monitor circuitry): State of Charge (SOC) (e.g., the level of charge of an energy source relative to its capacity, such as a fraction or percent) of the one or more energy sources of the module, State of Health (SOH) (e.g., a figure of merit of the condition of an energy source compared to its ideal conditions) of the one or more energy sources of the module, temperature of the one or more energy sources or other components of the module, capacity of the one or more energy sources of the module, voltage of the one or more energy sources and/or other components of the module, current of the one or more energy sources and/or other components of the module, State of Power (SOP) (e.g., the available power limitation of the energy source during discharge and/or charge), State of Energy (SOE) (e.g., the present level of available energy of an energy source relative to the maximum available energy of the source), and/or the presence of absence of a fault in any one or more of the components of the module.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">LCDs <b>114</b> can be configured to receive the status information from each module <b>108</b>, or determine the status information from monitored signals or data received from or within each module <b>108</b>, and communicate that information to MCD <b>112</b>. In some embodiments, each LCD <b>114</b> can communicate raw collected data to MCD <b>112</b>, which then algorithmically determines the status information on the basis of that raw data. MCD <b>112</b> can then use the status information of modules <b>108</b> to make control determinations accordingly. The determinations may take the form of instructions, commands, or other information (such as a modulation index described herein) that can be utilized by LCDs <b>114</b> to either maintain or adjust the operation of each module <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">For example, MCD <b>112</b> may receive status information and assess that information to determine a difference between at least one module <b>108</b> (e.g., a component thereof) and at least one or more other modules <b>108</b> (e.g., comparable components thereof). For example, MCD <b>112</b> may determine that a particular module <b>108</b> is operating with one of the following conditions as compared to one or more other modules <b>108</b>: with a relatively lower or higher SOC, with a relatively lower or higher SOH, with a relatively lower or higher capacity, with a relatively lower or higher voltage, with a relatively lower or higher current, with a relatively lower or higher temperature, or with or without a fault. In such examples, MCD <b>112</b> can output control information that causes the relevant aspect (e.g., output voltage, current, power, temperature) of that particular module <b>108</b> to be reduced or increased (depending on the condition). In this manner, the utilization of an outlier module <b>108</b> (e.g., operating with a relatively lower SOC or higher temperature), can be reduced so as to cause the relevant parameter of that module <b>108</b> (e.g., SOC or temperature) to converge towards that of one or more other modules <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The determination of whether to adjust the operation of a particular module <b>108</b> can be made by comparison of the status information to predetermined thresholds, limits, or conditions, and not necessarily by comparison to statuses of other modules <b>108</b>. The predetermined thresholds, limits, or conditions can be static thresholds, limits, or conditions, such as those set by the manufacturer that do not change during use. The predetermined thresholds, limits, or conditions can be dynamic thresholds, limits, or conditions, that are permitted to change, or that do change, during use. For example, MCD <b>112</b> can adjust the operation of a module <b>108</b> if the status information for that module <b>108</b> indicates it to be operating in violation (e.g., above or below) of a predetermined threshold or limit, or outside of a predetermined range of acceptable operating conditions. Similarly, MCD <b>112</b> can adjust the operation of a module <b>108</b> if the status information for that module <b>108</b> indicates the presence of an actual or potential fault (e.g., an alarm, or warning) or indicates the absence or removal of an actual or potential fault. Examples of a fault include, but are not limited to, an actual failure of a component, a potential failure of a component, a short circuit or other excessive current condition, an open circuit, an excessive voltage condition, a failure to receive a communication, the receipt of corrupted data, and the like. Depending on the type and severity of the fault, the faulty module's utilization can be decreased to avoid damaging the module, or the module's utilization can be ceased altogether. For example, if a fault occurs in a given module, then MCD <b>112</b> or LCD <b>114</b> can cause that module to enter a bypass state as described herein.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">MCD <b>112</b> can control modules <b>108</b> within system <b>100</b> to achieve or converge towards a desired target. The target can be, for example, operation of all modules <b>108</b> at the same or similar levels with respect to each other, or within predetermined thresholds limits, or conditions. This process is also referred to as balancing or seeking to achieve balance in the operation or operating characteristics of modules <b>108</b>. The term &#x201c;balance&#x201d; as used herein does not require absolute equality between modules <b>108</b> or components thereof, but rather is used in a broad sense to convey that operation of system <b>100</b> can be used to actively reduce disparities in operation (or operative state) between modules <b>108</b> that would otherwise exist.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">MCD <b>112</b> can communicate control information to LCD <b>114</b> for the purpose of controlling the modules <b>108</b> associated with the LCD <b>114</b>. The control information can be, e.g., a modulation index and a reference signal as described herein, a modulated reference signal, or otherwise. Each LCD <b>114</b> can use (e.g., receive and process) the control information to generate switch signals that control operation of one or more components (e.g., a converter) within the associated module(s) <b>108</b>. In some embodiments, MCD <b>112</b> generates the switch signals directly and outputs them to LCD <b>114</b>, which relays the switch signals to the intended module component.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">All or a portion of control system <b>102</b> can be combined with a system external control device <b>104</b> that controls one or more other aspects of the mobile or stationary application. When integrated in this shared or common control device (or subsystem), control of system <b>100</b> can be implemented in any desired fashion, such as one or more software applications executed by processing circuitry of the shared device, with hardware of the shared device, or a combination thereof. Non-exhaustive examples of external control devices <b>104</b> include: a vehicular ECU or MCU having control capability for one or more other vehicular functions (e.g., motor control, driver interface control, traction control, etc.); a grid or micro-grid controller having responsibility for one or more other power management functions (e.g., load interfacing, load power requirement forecasting, transmission and switching, interface with charge sources (e.g., diesel, solar, wind), charge source power forecasting, back up source monitoring, asset dispatch, etc.); and a data center control subsystem (e.g., environmental control, network control, backup control, etc.).</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>D and <b>1</b>E</figref> are block diagrams depicting example embodiments of a shared or common control device (or system) <b>132</b> in which control system <b>102</b> can be implemented.

These two-level waveforms can be generated by comparing a reference waveform Vref to carriers incrementally shifted by 360&#xb0;/(X&#x2212;1).

If a different reference voltage is available for each phase, then the phase information can be carried in the reference voltage and the same carriers can be used for each phase.

Array controller <b>900</b> can include a peak detector <b>902</b>, a divider <b>904</b>, and an intraphase (or intra array) balance controller <b>906</b>. Array controller <b>900</b> can receive a reference voltage waveform (Vr) and status information about each of the N modules <b>108</b> in the array (e.g., state of charge (SOCi), temperature (Ti), capacity (Qi), and voltage (Vi)) as inputs, and generate a normalized reference voltage waveform (Vrn) and modulation indexes (Mi) as outputs. Peak detector <b>902</b> detects the peak (Vpk) of Vr, which can be specific to the phase that controller <b>900</b> is operating with and/or balancing. Divider <b>904</b> generates Vrn by dividing Vr by its detected Vpk. Intraphase balance controller <b>906</b> uses Vpk along with the status information (e.g., SOCi, Ti, Qi, Vi, etc.) to generate modulation indexes Mi for each module <b>108</b> within the array <b>700</b> being controlled.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0118">The modulation indexes and Vrn can be used to generate the switching signals for each converter <b>202</b>. The modulation index can be a number between zero and one (inclusive of zero and one). For a particular module <b>108</b>, the normalized reference Vrn can be modulated or scaled by Mi, and this modulated reference signal (Vrnm) can be used as Vref (or &#x2212;Vref) according to the PWM technique described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>C-<b>8</b>F</figref>, or according to other techniques. In this manner, the modulation index can be used to control the PWM switching signals provided to the converter switching circuitry (e.g., S<b>3</b>-S<b>6</b> or S<b>1</b>-S<b>6</b>), and thus regulate the operation of each module <b>108</b>. For example, a module <b>108</b> being controlled to maintain normal or full operation may receive an Mi of one, while a module <b>108</b> being controlled to less than normal or full operation may receive an Mi less than one, and a module <b>108</b> controlled to cease power output may receive an Mi of zero. This operation can be performed in various ways by control system <b>102</b>, such as by MCD <b>112</b> outputting Vrn and Mi to the appropriate LCDs <b>114</b> for modulation and switch signal generation, by MCD <b>112</b> performing modulation and outputting the modulated Vrnm to the appropriate LCDs <b>114</b> for switch signal generation, or by MCD <b>112</b> performing modulation and switch signal generation and outputting the switch signals to the LCDs or the converters <b>202</b> of each module <b>108</b> directly. Vrn can be sent continually with Mi sent at regular intervals, such as once for every period of the Vrn, or one per minute, etc.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0119">Controller <b>906</b> can generate an Mi for each module <b>108</b> using any type or combination of types of status information (e.g., SOC, temperature (T), Q, SOH, voltage, current) described herein. For example, when using SOC and T, a module <b>108</b> can have a relatively high Mi if SOC is relatively high and temperature is relatively low as compared to other modules <b>108</b> in array <b>700</b>. If either SOC is relatively low or T is relatively high, then that module <b>108</b> can have a relatively low Mi, resulting in less utilization than other modules <b>108</b> in array <b>700</b>. Controller <b>906</b> can determine Mi such that the sum of module voltages does not exceed Vpk. For example, Vpk can be the sum of the products of the voltage of each module's source <b>206</b> and Mi for that module (e.g., Vpk=M<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub>+M<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub>+M<sub>3</sub>V<sub>3 </sub>. . . +M<sub>N</sub>V<sub>N</sub>, etc). A different combination of modulation indexes, and thus respective voltage contributions by the modules, may be used but the total generated voltage should remain the same.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0120">Controller <b>900</b> can control operation, to the extent it does not prevent achieving the power output requirements of the system at any one time (e.g., such as during maximum acceleration of an EV), such that SOC of the energy source(s) in each module <b>108</b> remains balanced or converges to a balanced condition if they are unbalanced, and/or such that temperature of the energy source(s) or other component (e.g., energy buffer) in each module remains balanced or converges to a balanced condition if they are unbalanced. Power flow in and out of the modules can be regulated such that a capacity difference between sources does not cause an SOC deviation. Balancing of SOC and temperature can indirectly cause some balancing of SOH.

In some embodiments, Mi for each unit <b>604</b> can be set at a level or value that does not cause a net or time average discharge of energy during balanced operation (causes a net energy discharge of zero). This can be useful if module <b>108</b>IC has a lower aggregate charge than other modules in the system.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0133">When an unbalanced condition occurs between arrays <b>700</b>, then the modulation indexes of system <b>100</b> can be adjusted to cause convergence towards a balanced condition or to minimize further divergence.
