Due to personal reasons or other reasons, a scheduled agent may not be available on a scheduled-working-shift and may try to trade the scheduled-working-shift with another agent via a Workforce Management (WFM) system. The agent that is unavailable for a scheduled-working-shift is named a source-agent and each agent that might be willing to take the scheduled-working-shift and give up one of the scheduled-working-shifts, is named a target-agent.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In current WFM solutions in contact centers, a source-agent has to manually select target-agents having a working-scheduled-shift, with whom the source-agent wants to trade the working-scheduled-shift and to submit a trade request which will notify the selected target-agents.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a contact center with a size of 1000 agents, the source-agent might manually select target-agents for the scheduled-working-shift trade from a list of agents, however it may result with redundant trade requests to uninterested target-agents and missed opportunity to those target-agents who could be interested in shift trade. This problem might worsen in case of a large contact center with &#x2dc;30K to &#x2dc;40K agents.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In case none of the target-agents accepts the shift trade request of the source-agent, then it might result with the source-agent taking a day off during the scheduled-working-shift, due to the agent's personal reasons which may result with the particular scheduled-working-shift being understaffed.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Contact center staffing levels may also get affected due to an unavailability of agents, which may require a manual intervention by a supervisor for searching and reassigning the scheduled-working-shift to other available agents with the same set of skills as the unbailable agent.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Furthermore, when the attempt of an agent to trade a scheduled-working-shift fails, it may reduce the flexibility to work with the contact center and even hamper Employee Satisfaction (ESAT) score of the contact center.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, there is a need for a technical solution for trading a scheduled-working-shift which may reflect the agents' flexibility

Unless otherwise indicated, use of the conjunction &#x201c;or&#x201d; as used herein is to be understood as inclusive (any or all of the stated options).</p><p id="p-0047" num="0045">In current systems in contact centers, when an agent is not available to work on a scheduled-working-shift, the agent may try to trade the scheduled-working-shift with another agent, via a Workforce Management (WFM) system. However, in current WFM solutions, a source-agent has to manually select target-agents having a working-scheduled-shift, with whom the source-agent wants to trade the working-scheduled-shift and to submit a trade request which will notify the selected target-agents.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0046">The current WFM solutions have several deficiencies. First, in case none of the target-agents accepts the trade request, then it might result with the source-agent taking a day off during the scheduled-working-shift, which may result with the particular scheduled-working-shift being understaffed. Second, contact center staffing levels may get affected due to an unavailability of agents, because they may be required to perform a manual intervention by a supervisor for searching and reassigning the scheduled-working-shift to other available agents with the same set of skills as the unbailable agent. Third, when the attempt of an agent to trade a scheduled-working-shift fails, it may reduce the flexibility of the source-agent to work with the contact center and even hamper Employee Satisfaction (ESAT) score of the contact center.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0047">Therefore, there is a need for method and system for improving agents' engagement. For example, by increasing the chances that the source-agent will find a target-agent to swap shifts with. The chances that the source-agent will find a target-agent to swap shifts with may be increased by enabling a selection of agents for a scheduled-working-shift for trade, via a Workforce Management (WFM) system, according to agents' availability and also according to agents' trading-rank of shift trade.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0048">In other words, the needed technical solution should provide a mechanism that may reflect target-agents' availability as well as reflecting each target-agent flexibility to swap scheduled-working-shifts thus, elevating the chances that a trade request may be accepted.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0049">Accordingly, there is a need for a technical solution for trading a scheduled-working-shift based on agents' availability to trade a scheduled-working-shift or based on a trading-rank which may reflect the agents' flexibility to trade a scheduled-working-shift.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0050">According to some embodiments of the present disclosure, a computerized system and a computerized method for trading a scheduled-working-shift is provided herein.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0051">According to some embodiments of the present disclosure, the computerized system and computerized method may provide a mechanism that may reflect target-agents' availability to work on the scheduled-working-shift when the source-agent is not available, by allowing agents to tag one or more scheduled-working-shifts, via an Employee Engagement Manager (EEM) system, so that the scheduled-working-shifts may be tagged as available for trading.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0052">According to some embodiments of the present disclosure, the computerized system and computerized method may also provide a mechanism that may reflect each target-agent's flexibility to swap scheduled-working-shifts, by maintaining a trade-ranking mechanism, which may rank agents according to their historical acceptance or failure to notice or to reject scheduled-working-shift trades.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> schematically illustrates a high-level diagram of a system <b>100</b> for trading a scheduled-working-shift, in accordance with some embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0054">According to some embodiments of the present disclosure, a computerized system, such as system <b>100</b>, may include a processor <b>105</b> and a memory <b>150</b>.
