Among the markets impacted the most has been the food industry, particularly restaurants and other shops that provide food items to customers. From cooks to waiters to delivery people, the fear of transmission of the virus has had a devastating impact on the food industry. At the same time, the desire and demand for prepared food items has not waned, thus making it desirable to have a safer system and method for preparing and delivering food items to customers.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Although the food industry has been profoundly affected, the fear of transmission of the virus extends to other industries as well. Any market requiring interaction between providers and customers runs the risk of transmission. As a result, any items that can be provided and delivered to customers that minimizes or at least reduces human interactions correspondingly reduces the risk of transmission. A safer system for preparing and delivering non-food items, such as packages, furniture, clothing, medical products, pharmaceuticals, sundries, and other non-perishable items is therefore also desirable.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition to minimizing human interactions, the Covid-19 pandemic has also raised concerns about contact with materials or surfaces that may be supporting viruses, bacteria, or other germs. Science has shown that some bacteria and infectious diseases can last for days and perhaps longer on certain surfaces including paper, cardboard, plastic, packaging labels, Styrofoam, stamps, and tape. These concerns have made it desirable that delivery processes not only minimize human interactions, but also minimize contact with surfaces.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The delivery of items or services often requires the use of non-clean energy, like oil, gasoline, or kerosene to provide power for the device or transport providing the item or service. As climate change issues continue to have a negative impact on the environment, it would be desirable to use clean sources of energy to safely and securely deliver items and services.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A more complete appreciation of the invention and many of the attendant advantages thereof will be readily obtained as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings, wherein:</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an exemplary mobile transport according to an embodiment;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an exemplary mobile transport according to another embodiment;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a flow chart of an order and delivery process using a mobile transport according to an embodiment;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows an exemplary hub locker according to an embodiment;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows an exemplary kitchen pod according to an embodiment; and</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows an exemplary power storage and delivery device according to an embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The detailed description set forth below is intended as a description of various configurations of the subject technology and is not intended to represent the only configurations in which the subject technology may be practiced.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a mobile transport <b>100</b> includes a vehicle <b>110</b> having a body <b>112</b>, wheels <b>114</b>, a transmission <b>116</b>, and a power source <b>118</b>. Mobile transport also includes a plurality of compartments <b>130</b> coupled to the body <b>112</b> and an operational control unit <b>150</b>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The body <b>112</b> can be made of various materials, such as aluminum, steel, other metals, alloys, and/or fiberglass. The body <b>112</b> can include a cabin <b>120</b> with seating for one or more occupants and doors <b>122</b> to access the cabin. The body <b>112</b> can also include a bed <b>122</b> designed to couple to and support the compartments <b>130</b> and having a flat or other surface to facilitate the coupling to the compartments <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The transmission <b>116</b> is coupled to the body <b>112</b>, the wheels <b>114</b>, and the power source <b>118</b>. The power source <b>118</b> can preferably include one or more batteries <b>124</b> that can be charged in a variety of ways including, for example, by plugging the batteries <b>124</b> to an external power source, through solar panels, or from other power sources as are known to those skilled in the art that are capable of charging a battery. The solar panels can be placed, for example, on the roof of the mobile transport <b>100</b> or on side panels of the mobile transport <b>100</b>. The batteries <b>124</b> can be, for example, a lithium-ion battery or other battery types. The power source <b>118</b> can also be an internal combustion engine or a hybrid engine combining electrical power and gasoline power. Power output from the power source <b>118</b> is provided to the transmission <b>116</b> to power the transmission. The transmission <b>116</b> correspondingly converts the power received from the power source <b>118</b> into driving forces to cause the wheels <b>114</b> to move.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Alternatively, power source <b>118</b> can be provided by other alternative energy sources beyond solar including, for example, hydrogen or wind. These alternative energy sources can be combined with traditional energy sources and provide the ability to extend both range of the mobile transport <b>100</b> as well as provide for additional capacity for on-site operations such as thermal control, the generation of energy for storage, and third-party distribution of energy as a service. A micro wind turbine for power production can attached to the mobile transport <b>100</b> or pulled or accompanied with the mobile transport <b>100</b> by a trailer. Power from hydrogen can be implemented using micro-small-scale electrolyzer technology or hydrogen fuel cells. This capability of providing off-grid power production can be for the benefit of the operation of the mobile transport <b>100</b>, as well as for power storage and the resale or distribution of the power stored from these alternative power sources, and thus acting like a mobile power station for other electric or hybrid vehicles or other devices that can be charged from the alternative power sources. It also allows the mobile transport <b>100</b> to have a zero-carbon footprint by providing alternative schemes for charging its own batteries required for motive power and operation of the mobile transport <b>100</b> without depending on energy from the grid, which may have been generated from fossil fuels, coal, or other non-clean energy.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The compartments <b>130</b>, which are coupled to the body <b>112</b>, each define an interior space <b>132</b> that can be used to store a variety of different items including, for example, foodstuffs, packages, mail, or any other items capable of fitting within the interior space <b>132</b>. Each compartment <b>130</b> can have the same shape and size or can be of different sizes and shapes to accommodate items having different sizes and shapes. Each compartment <b>130</b> also includes a front panel <b>134</b>. The front panel <b>134</b> is movable between an open and a closed position so that an item can be placed in and/or removed from the interior space <b>132</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In addition to serving as a door to access the interior space <b>132</b> of compartment <b>130</b>, the front panel <b>134</b> can include a screen. The screen can be, for example, an LCD, plasma, or other type of display screen capable of displaying text, graphics, images, videos, and/or other data. The screen for the front panel <b>134</b> can provide a variety of information including advertisements for the company providing the item within the associated compartment <b>130</b>, information regarding the contents of the compartment <b>130</b>, or information to identify the customer to which the contents of the compartment is intended (such as a transaction ID or a customer ID that avoids identifying the customer or recipient by name). Instead of individual imaging or videos on each screen, the screens across all compartments <b>130</b> can be controlled and configured to form a unified image or video. The compartments <b>130</b> can also include lighting, such as lighting around the perimeter of each front panel <b>134</b>. The lighting around a specific compartment can be activated, for example, when that compartment is going be used to accept an item or going to be accessed to remove an item, effectively serving as a visual indication to users or customers of the location to insert or remove an item. The front panel <b>134</b> can also be configured to be opaque to ensure that the content of the compartment <b>130</b> cannot be seen.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Each compartment <b>130</b> can also include other electronic components including, for example, one or more cameras, a keyboard, biometric reader, microphone, speaker, RFID, and/or LED lights or other form of indicators. These other electronic components can assist in controlling access to each compartment <b>130</b> and the opening and closing of the front panel <b>134</b>, as will be explained in more detail herein.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The opening of the front panel <b>134</b> can be controlled by a lock <b>138</b> that moves the front panel <b>134</b> between an open position and closed, locked position. The lock <b>138</b> can include a motorized mechanism having, for example, a gas or hydraulic rod, a spring, a solenoid, and/or a servo unit. The lock <b>138</b> preferably includes electronic circuitry, such as a microprocessor, microcontroller, CPU, memory, RAM, and or ROM, configured to control the opening and closing of the front panel <b>134</b> in response to a received signal, as will be explained in more detail herein. The lock <b>138</b> are preferably tamper-proof and can only be activated to open a compartment <b>130</b> with the proper authorization, which provides significant security for the contents of items in the compartments <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In addition to the lock <b>138</b>, each compartment <b>130</b> can includes a temperature controller <b>140</b> (though only one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). The temperature controller <b>140</b> preferably includes both heating and cooling elements that can control the temperature within the compartment <b>130</b> to be set to a particular or desired temperature setting. The temperature setting can be adjusted depending on the type of item provided within the compartment <b>130</b>. For example, for food items that have just been prepared, the temperature controller <b>140</b> can be configured to be set to a higher than ambient temperature to keep the food items warm. Alternatively, if the food items are fresh produce or meats, then the temperature controller <b>140</b> can be configured to be set to a lower than ambient temperature to keep the food items cool. The temperature controller <b>140</b> can also include circuitry, such as a microprocessor, microcontroller, CPU, memory, RAM, and or ROM, that can be configured to receive control signals and, in response to those control signals, control the heating and/or cooling elements to set the temperature within the interior space <b>132</b> to a setting in accordance with the received control signals.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Each compartment <b>130</b> preferably also includes a germicidal controller <b>142</b> (though only one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) to reduce and/or eliminate the risk of germs being present in the compartment <b>130</b>. The germicidal controller <b>142</b> can include, for example, an ultraviolet (UV) light that acts to provide germicidal irradiation of all surfaces and contents of the compartment <b>130</b>. UV germicidal irradiation (UVGI) is an example of a disinfection method that uses short wavelength ultraviolet (UV-C) light to kill or inactivate microorganisms by destroying nucleic acids and disrupting their DNA, leaving them unable to perform vital cellular functions. To minimize risks associated with the use of UV-C light, the germicidal controller can preferably use &#x201c;Far UVCI Light&#x201d; emitters that are known to be safer for and not harmful to the environment. Such emitters include, for example, UVCI LED's. In addition, to ensure the UVGI is able to irradiate all surfaces, the germicidal controller <b>142</b> can include multiple sources of UVGI positioned at multiple locations within each compartment <b>130</b>. The germicidal controller <b>142</b> can also use other forms of germicide instead of or in addition to UVGI. For example, the germicidal controller <b>142</b> can include a germicidal spray or gas that has a germicidal function such as ones including alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, chlorine, formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, and/or phenol.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The germicidal controller <b>142</b> can also include circuitry, such as a microprocessor, microcontroller, CPU, memory, RAM, and/or ROM, that can be configured to receive control signals and, in response to those control signals, control the UVGI, spraying of the germicide, or other form of germicide to sanitize the compartment <b>130</b> in accordance with the received control signals. Through activation of the germicidal controller <b>142</b>, it is possible to sanitize compartments <b>130</b> including the respective interior spaces <b>132</b> in which items are stored. Doing so creates a safe transfer of the items and further assists in the safety of the supply chain and logistics protocols by mitigating or eliminating exposure to disease-causing germs during the last step in delivery to a customer or end users.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The operation control unit <b>150</b> includes circuitry, such as a microprocessor, microcontroller, CPU, memory, RAM, and/or ROM, that can be configured to control all of the operations of the mobile transport <b>100</b> including, for example, movement from location to location, opening and closing of compartments <b>130</b>, controlling the operation of the temperature controller <b>140</b>, controlling the operation of the germicidal controller <b>142</b>, controlling the operation of lighting, controlling access and storage of data received from businesses, users, and customers, and/or controlling the display of information, images, and/or videos on the display screens of the front panels <b>132</b>. In addition to this operational functionality, operation control unit <b>150</b> preferably includes transmitters and receivers that can transmit and receive data and signals over a variety of transmission paths including cellular, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC via IoT or any other form of wired or wireless transmission. Operation control unit <b>150</b> can also include one or more cameras, a keyboard, biometric reader, microphone, speaker, RFID, and/or GPS circuitry. For storing and accessing data received from businesses, users, and customers, the operation control unit <b>150</b> can be configured to store the data in local memory, a hard drive, optical drive, distributed memory, or cloud storage.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an exemplary mobile transport for safe and contactless delivery of items from a supplier to a customer according to another embodiment. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a mobile transport <b>200</b> includes a vehicle <b>210</b> having a body <b>212</b>, wheels <b>214</b>, a transmission <b>216</b>, and a power source <b>218</b>. Mobile transport also includes a plurality of compartments <b>230</b> coupled to the body <b>212</b> and an operational control unit <b>250</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Mobile transport <b>200</b> can have the same structure and operation as the corresponding components of mobile transport <b>100</b>, but with difference regarding sizes and numbers. For example, mobile transport <b>200</b> can be smaller, use fewer wheels, and have fewer compartments. The smaller size and corresponding lower weight can enable mobile transport <b>200</b> to have a longer range for delivery than mobile transport <b>100</b>, operate at higher speeds on the road, and be recharged at a faster rate.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In addition to mobile wheeled vehicles, like mobile transports <b>100</b> and <b>200</b>, the mobile transport can also be alternative conveyances that do not rely on wheels. For example, the mobile transport can also be a drone or other type of unaccompanied air vehicle or a boat. The mobile transport need only be sufficiently sized to include one or more compartments <b>130</b> and include the controllers and operation control unit of mobile transport.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a flow chart of an order and delivery process using a mobile transport according to an embodiment. The order and delivery process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is available for any business that provides items that can be stored and delivered in a mobile transport according to any of the disclosed embodiments and modifications thereof. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a user, such as a customer or other end user, contacts a business to make an order and arrange delivery of an item (step <b>302</b>). The user can contact the business through for example, a website using a mobile device, cell phone, desktop computer, a laptop, tablet, or other computing device, or through an application running on such a device. Alternatively, the user may contact the business by phone or email. If it is a returning or existing user, the business may automatically recognize the user through cookies on the user's device and/or through a login or registration process completed by the user. The information associated with the user through that recognition can include the user's name, address, contact number, payment information, past orders, and preferences. These preferences can include identifying information about the user including, for example, biometric information like a facial ID or fingerprint, a code created by the user, or other data that uniquely identifies the user. These preferences can also include information about how the user prefers to have items delivered, a preferred delivery address, and a preferred identifier to use for accessing a compartment holding a user's ordered items (e.g., using facial ID or a transaction ID).</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The user contacting the business can make an order for one or more items from the business (step <b>304</b>). The items can be, for example, hot food, cold food, packages, mail, or any other type of consumer item that may fit within a compartment of a mobile transport. The order may be submitted through the business's website, application, or orally through a phone call. The order preferably includes information identify the requested items, the location to which to deliver the items, customer information, and any other information as may be needed to complete the order and make the delivery.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In response to the order, unique identifying information is created as a transaction identifier for the order by the user (step <b>306</b>). The unique identifying information created for the transaction identifier can be, for example, a random number, a value created based on identification information of the user, a QR code, or any other unique value that can be used to uniquely identify the transaction corresponding to the order made by the user.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The transaction identifier is provided to the user (step <b>308</b>). If the order was made through the business's website or application, the transaction identifier can be provided directly to the user's computing device through the corresponding web site or application, sent by text, or sent by email. If the order has been made by phone, then an operator at the business can provide the user with the transaction identifier by phone.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Once the order has been completed and the transaction identifier has been provided to the user, the business prepares the requested items for delivery (step <b>308</b>). This preparation may include, for example, cooking requested food items, collecting items from storage, and placing the requested items into some form of packaging. In addition, the business sends a request to a mobile transport (e.g., mobile transport <b>100</b> or <b>200</b>) to be used to deliver the ordered items to the user at the user's preferred delivery address (step <b>310</b>). The request can include the address of the business, the address to which to deliver the item, the transaction identifier, and/or preference information about the user including, for example, biometric information, a unique user code, or other unique user identifier. Since the preference information includes valuable private information about the user, any request sent to the mobile transport can be encrypted to minimize the risk of the preference information being compromised. The request can also include information about a desired pick-up time that, for example, minimizes the time between the completion of the preparation of the requested item and the placement of the requested item into the mobile transport. The request can be transmitted from the business to the mobile transport using any of a variety of communication methods including wirelessly via a cellular network or over a shared Wi-Fi network.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Alternatively, the business may possess one or more mobile transports, through purchase or leasing for example, and have the mobile transport available at its location whenever one or more deliveries need to be made. It also possible that the business uses the mobile transport to be used with items prepared at its discretion without any customer orders, fills the compartments <b>130</b> with those items, and has the mobile transport go to a location where customers can access and purchase the items stored in the compartments <b>130</b>, thereby operating analogously to a food truck or portable vending machine.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In response to the request received from the business, the mobile transport determines how and when to get to the address of the business (step <b>312</b>). The request can be received by a receiver in the operation control unit of the mobile transport. The operation control unit analyzes the content of the received request and extracts the address of the business from the received request. This analysis and extraction can be performed by circuitry in the operation control unit such as a microprocessor or CPU. The operation control unit also determines the current location of the mobile transport by using its GPS circuitry. Based on the current location of the mobile transport and the extracted address of the business, the operation control unit determines a route for the mobile transport to take from its current location to the address of the business. The determined route can also include an estimated time to complete the route based on the length of the route, the speed limits on the route, and the existing traffic along the route. The operation control unit also analyzes the content of the received request and extracts the desired pick-up time. Based on the current time, the desired pick-up time, and the determined route to the address of the business, the operation control unit can determine a time to begin the route to the address of the business to arrive at an optimal time that minimizes the time between the completion of the preparation of the requested items and the arrival of the mobile transport.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Using the determined route and the determined time to start the route, the operation control unit can be configured to control the mobile transport to the address of the business (step <b>314</b>). If the mobile transport can be operated autonomously without human interaction, then the operation control unit can be configured to control the transmission and the steering of the mobile transport according to the determined travel route. For such autonomous operation, the operation control unit can use information from cameras to detect the outside environment and road conditions and use artificial intelligence as is known in the art to control the operation of the steering and transmission to ensure the mobile transport travels the route safely. Alternatively, the mobile transport can be driven by a human operator. In that case, the operation control unit can include a display to show the operator the route to the address of the business and provide oral instructions to the operator regarding where to turn along the route.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">While in route to the address of the business, the business can receive updates about the location of the mobile transport including when it arrives at the address of the business (step <b>316</b>). For example, the operation control unit can send messages to the business that include information about the current location of the mobile transport, as well as an estimated arrival time. The messages can be sent from a transmitter of the operation control unit using any of a variety of communication methods including, for example, wireless communication such as through a cellular or Wi-Fi network. The messages can be received by the business at any of a variety of computing devices including PC's, laptops, and mobile devices such as mobile phones or tablets.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">When the business has completed preparing the requested items and has received a message that the mobile transport has arrived at the address of the business, an employee of the business brings the prepared items to the mobile transport (step <b>318</b>). Based on the type of items to be delivered, the mobile transport determines one or more compartments in which the items are to be placed (step <b>320</b>). For example, if the items need to be temperature controlled, the operation control unit can identify a compartment having the necessary temperature controller that controls the temperature of the compartment to be at a setting appropriate for the item. The operation control unit can also evaluate the size of the items and identify an appropriately sized compartment that can hold the items.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Before allowing access to the identified one or more compartments, the operation control unit can activate the germicidal controller of the identified compartment to sanitize the compartment (step <b>322</b>). Activating the germicidal controller at this time provides multiple benefits. For example, by doing so prior to opening the compartment and allowing the employee to put the items in the compartment, the compartment will already have been sanitized before the employee is exposed to it. In addition, by limiting the activation of the germicidal controller to the compartments that are about to be used for a delivery, the mobile transport can conserve more energy and conserve resources, such as when using germicidal sprays.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">When the employee arrives at the mobile transport, the employee can send a message or provide authorizing information to the mobile transport (step <b>324</b>). The message sent by the employee can include information about the delivery including, for example, the transaction identifier or other unique identifier that enables the operation control unit of the mobile transport to determine whether to open a compartment and which one to open. The message can be sent from a computing device, such as a mobile phone or tablet, and received by a receiver of the operation control unit. Alternatively, instead of sending a message from a computing device, the employee can enter a code on a keypad located on the mobile transport or have biometric information examined such as by a facial scan, a retinal scan, or a fingerprint scan to ensure that the employee is authorized to place items into the identified compartment.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In addition, if the business has its own mobile transport, it can interface with the mobile transport to load one or more items of its choosing into one or more compartments of the mobile transport. In this case, instead of providing a message about the delivery, the message can include information about the item being placed into a compartment, the pricing of the item, any temperature control issues relating to the item, and any other relevant information regarding the item, its transport, and its sale.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Based on the received message or authorization, the one or more compartments for storing the items are opened (step <b>326</b>). Using, for example, the transaction identifier included in the message or corresponding to the authorized employee, the operation control unit sends a signal to the lock of the identified compartment to open the front panel of the compartment. In response to the signal, the lock automatically opens the front panel of the compartment. At that point, the employee places the items into the compartment (step <b>328</b>).</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Once placed into the compartment, the front panel of the compartment is closed (manually or automatically), and the temperature controller is activated, if necessary (step <b>330</b>). The signal for the lock to close the front panel of the compartment can be provided by the operation control unit to the lock of the applicable compartment. The operation control unit sending the signal to the lock can be in response to a message or authorization from the employee, based on the elapsing of a specific time period, or based on a detection system that determines the items have been placed inside the compartment. The detection system can include, for example, motion detectors.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In addition, based on the type of items placed in the compartment, the operation control unit can signal the temperature controller for that compartment to control the temperature inside the interior space of the compartment to be set to an appropriate setting. For example, the temperature controller can receive a signal to set the interior temperature to keep the items warm or to keep the items cold. On the other hand, for non-perishable items and items having no need for maintaining a temperature warmer or cooler than the ambient temperature, the operation control unit need not send any signal to the temperature controller. It is also possible that when the need for a temperature controller is known in advance, the operation control unit can send a control signal to the temperature controller to start warming or cooling for a period of time before items are placed in the compartment.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Once all of the items have been placed in one or more compartments of the mobile transport, the operation control unit can be configured to control the mobile transport to the delivery address (step <b>332</b>). The operation control can determine the route in the same manner as explained with respect to controlling the mobile transport to the address of the business. Similarly, while in route to the delivery address, the user can receive updates about the location of the mobile transport including when it arrives at the delivery address (step <b>334</b>). For example, the operation control unit can send messages to the user that include information about the current location of the mobile transport, as well as an estimated arrival time. The messages can be sent from a transmitter of the operation control unit to any of a variety of computing devices of the user including PC's, laptops, and mobile devices such as mobile phones or tablets. The messages can be text messages, emails, or voice messages.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Before allowing access to the one or more compartments containing the items to be delivered to the user, the operation control unit can activate the germicidal controller of the identified compartments to sanitize them (step <b>336</b>). Activating the germicidal controller at this time provides similar benefits including ensuring that the compartment will already have been sanitized before the user is exposed to it. Additionally, by limiting the activation of the germicidal controller to the compartments that are about to be opened for the user, the mobile transport can conserve more energy and conserve resources.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">When the mobile transport reaches the delivery address, and the user arrives at the mobile transport, the user can send a message or provide authorizing information to the mobile transport (step <b>338</b>). The message sent by the employee can include information about the delivery including, for example, the transaction identifier or other unique identifier that enables the operation control unit of the mobile transport to determine whether to open a compartment and which one to open. The message can be sent from a computing device, such as a mobile phone or tablet, and received by a receiver of the operation control unit. Alternatively, instead of sending a message from a computing device, the user can enter a code on a keypad located on the mobile transport, have a QR code scanned, or have biometric information examined such as by a facial scan, a retinal scan, or a fingerprint scan to ensure that the user is authorized to access the compartment holding the ordered items.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In the alternative, where the mobile transport includes items selected by the business and not in response to an order from a user, the user can send a request to purchase an item from within one of the compartments. To make the request to purchase, the user can similarly use a computing device, such as a mobile phone or tablet, a keypad, a QR code reader, or biometric reader, and the request can be received by a receiver of the operation control unit. For example, the user can access a website or app on the computing device that includes information about the contents of the compartments, identify a desired item, and purchase that item. Alternatively, the user can use a camera on a computing device that scans a QR code on the mobile transport, which directs the computing device to a web site through which the user identifies and purchases an item.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Based on the received message, request, or authorization, the one or more compartments storing the ordered items are opened (step <b>340</b>). Using, for example, the transaction identifier included in the message or corresponding to the authorized user, the operation control unit sends a signal to the lock of the identified compartment to open the front panel of the compartment. In response to the signal, the lock automatically opens the front panel of the compartment. At that point, the user removes the items from the compartment (step <b>342</b>). Once removed the compartment, the front panel of the compartment is closed (step <b>344</b>). The signal for the lock to close the front panel of the compartment can be provided by the operation control unit to the lock of the applicable compartment. The operation control unit sending the signal to the lock can be in response to a message or authorization from the user, based on the elapsing of a specific time period, or based on a detection system that determines the items have been removed from the compartment.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The order and delivery process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> provides multiple benefits that make the order and delivery convenient, safe, and cost-effective for businesses and users ordering items. These benefits include, for example, the ability to apply germicides to compartments that are used to store and deliver items with the use of germicidal controllers before the compartments are accessed by business employees or users receiving deliveries. This ability minimizes or eliminates the risk of transmission of viruses and bacteria for both the business employees and the users receiving deliveries. The order and delivery process also automates the pick-up and delivery of items that can eliminate the need for dedicated delivery employees and/or dedicated delivery vehicles while also minimizing contacts between people.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The mobile transport can be configured to operate autonomously, thus obviating the need for dedicated delivery employees, and can be shared by multiple businesses, thus obviating the need for dedicated delivery vehicles. And with only one person placing the items in the compartments and only one person later removing the items, people-to-people contacts are avoided. By providing temperature controllers, the mobile transports can store and deliver items, particularly foodstuffs, while maintaining an appropriate temperature for those items, both above and below the ambient temperature.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The inclusion of screens on the front panels of the compartments also provides multiple benefits. These benefits include, for example, being able to promote and advertise businesses, both on a single screen and using multiple screens to provide unified images or videos promoting the same. The screens can also be used to provide information to employees about where to put items and to users about where to pick-up the items such as be providing messages or images giving indications about which items belong in which compartments.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The operation of the mobile transports and the process as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> can be limited by geofencing. Geofencing is a location-based service in which an app or other software uses GPS, RFID, Wi-Fi, or cellular data to trigger a pre-programmed action when a mobile device or RFID tag enters or exits a virtual boundary set up around a geographical location, known as a geofence. With geofencing, the operation of the mobile transports can be limited to a set geographical area. As a result, mobile transports can be assigned to an exclusive geographical area such that other mobile transports are unable to operated in that area. Similarly, the mobile transport would be unable to operated outside of its assigned geofence.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Businesses and operators of the mobile transports can also use processes to keep track of items placed and sold in the mobile transports. For example, each item can include a tracking indicator, such as a bar code, RFID, NFC, or other unique identifier to track which items have been input to the mobile transport and have been sold and/or removed from the mobile transport. Through use of the tracking identifiers, the businesses can ensure proper authorized secure conveyance of the items by tracking the item throughout the delivery process. This tracking provides both an inventory monitoring measure as well as a security measure including against theft at any point in the transport and delivery process.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">As previously mentioned, the mobile transport according to this application can provide the function of mobile energy source that both generates the energy and delivers the energy to customers, particularly for alternative energy sources like solar, wind, and hydrogen. For hydrogen, it is known that manufacturing hydrogen through traditional electrolysis methodologies can be inefficient for several reasons including, for example, the cost of energy required to operate the electolyzer, the mass over density causing elevated transportation costs when there is no pipeline, and the corresponding need for physical transportation of tanks or fuel cells.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The mobile transport can provide hydrogen power on a micro level without using power from the grid. Instead, it can use energy from a portable micro wind machine, for example. In addition, the mobility of the truck enables it to operate in a variety of conditions and proximate to a multitude of customers or other end users. For example, if located proximate to an affluent rich water source, such as a flood or sewage spill or a dump site, where it is possible to capture methane gas from the dump to fuel the electrolyzer, in addition to the micro wind option, or just from the captured methane gas alone, the mobile transport can be configured to collect the hydrogen in tanks or portable reusable hydrogen fuel cells to be distributed by locker or rack in a community or village for heat and electricity and communication services off grid. Such a capability can be valuable particularly for less developed regions that have no access to utilities or clean water.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Hydrogen provided by the mobile transports at this scale can changes the quality of life in villages and off-grid locales, such as demonstrated by the Coca Cola project, which manufactures and dispenses potable water. The mobile transports can therefore pop-up and provide a tank or fuel cell weekly, such as a pop-up in a local market or bazaar or directly to a dwelling of any kind. This hydrogen delivery can also replace dirtier and more expensive fuel sources like diesel and kerosene. In addition to powering homes, the hydrogen fuel cells provided by the mobile transports can also fuel machinery and farm equipment.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In addition to mobile transports, the utility of the compartments for storage and pickup of items can be applied to other implementations. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> provides an example of a hub locker <b>400</b> having a body <b>410</b>, plurality of compartments <b>430</b> coupled to the body <b>410</b>, and an operational control unit <b>450</b> coupled to the compartments. The body <b>410</b> includes a structure sufficient to hold and maintain the compartments <b>430</b> and operation control unit <b>450</b>. The body <b>410</b> can be made of various materials, such as aluminum, steel, other metals, alloys, and/or fiberglass.
