The bone anchoring device is particularly applicable to the correction of deformities of the spine, more particularly of the pediatric spine. The bone anchoring device can also be useful in degenerative spinal surgery, in particular in dynamic stabilization or hybrid constructs.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">For the treatment of early onset scoliosis of the pediatric spine, it is known to use growing rods. These are spinal implants fixed above and below the abnormally curved portion of the spine to correct the curvature in a first step to some extent. Thereafter, the rods are prolonged in further correction surgeries to adapt them to the growth of the spine.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Systems, devices, and methods for stabilization of the spinal column, in particular for treating infantile or juvenile scoliosis are known, for example, from U.S. Pat. No. 7,708,762 B2. A system described there includes an elongate support member and a plurality of anchor members configured for anchoring to respective vertebrae. A first of the anchor members is engaged to the elongate support member in a manner that substantially prevents axial movement of the support member relative to the first anchor member, and a second of the anchor members is engaged to the support member in a manner that allows substantially unconstrained axial movement of the support member relative to the second anchor member. With the system and device the number and/or frequency of adjustments of the stabilization system to accommodate for continued growth of a patient's spinal column, particularly in pediatric patients, can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">EP 3 695 796 A1 describes an anchoring assembly for anchoring a rod to a bone or a vertebra that permits selection between rods with different diameters when using a bone anchoring device, and simultaneously permitting selection between different locking mechanisms.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is an object of the invention to provide a bone anchoring device and a system including a bone anchoring device and at least two fixation members that provides a plurality of possibilities of using the bone anchoring device and/or the system together with a rod.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to an aspect of the invention, a bone anchoring device for anchoring a rod to a bone or vertebra via a shank to be anchored in bone includes a receiving part connectable or connected to the shank, the receiving part including two legs that define a channel for the rod and a variable configuration member. The variable configuration member is configured to allow the bone anchoring device to provide a variable functionality. The variable configuration member provides a first rod contact surface that is arranged outside of the receiving part and wherein in the receiving part a second rod contact surface is provided. The variable configuration member is adjustable from a first configuration in which an inserted rod can contact the first rod contact surface, and a second configuration in which an inserted rod is supported by the second rod contact surface and preferably also by the first rod contact surface. Preferably, the variable configuration member is an outer ring extending around the receiving part. Further preferably, a change from the first configuration to the second configuration can be effected by pressure exerted by the rod onto the first rod contact surface.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the first configuration, the first rod contact surface and the second rod contact surface have a first positional relationship relative to each other and in the second configuration, the first rod contact surface and the second rod contact surface may have a second positional relationship relative to each other different from the first positional relationship. Preferably, a change between the first positional relationship and the second positional relationship involves a change in an axial position of at least one of the rod contact surfaces. Preferably, the change in the positional relationship involves a deformation of the variable configuration member. More preferably, an overall axial position of the variable configuration member remains the same during the change of position of the first rod contact surface.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The bone anchoring device can be employed as a bone anchoring device that can be fixed to the rod and as a bone anchoring device that is slidable with respect to the rod to permit a positional change of the bone anchoring device relative to the rod when implanted. Thus, the bone anchoring device can be used as a growing construct that allows the spine to grow while correcting a scoliotic deformity. Whether a fixed or a slidable connection is established can be easily selected by using an appropriate fixation member. This provides an improved or alternative way of treating, in particular, spinal deformities, and more particularly deformities in the pediatric or juvenile spine, or in degenerative spinal surgery, in particular, in dynamic stabilization or hybrid construct applications.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to a further aspect of the invention, the bone anchoring device is a polyaxial bone anchoring device. This means that the receiving part is pivotably coupled to a head provided at an end of the shank, and a pressure member can be arranged in the receiving part that is configured to exert pressure onto the head. In the polyaxial bone anchoring device, the second rod contact surface is provided on the pressure member that is arranged in the receiving part.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In particular, the bone anchoring device may be a bottom-loading bone anchoring device, in which the head of the bone anchoring element is inserted through the bottom end of the receiving part. However, the bone anchoring device may also be a top-loading bone anchoring device, in which the anchoring element is inserted from the top end of the receiving part.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">A first fixation member functions as a closure member for the rod channel. The first fixation member is configured to be insertable into the receiving part in a limited manner so that the head is still freely pivotable and the rod is displaceable in the receiving part. With a second fixation member, it is possible to clamp or substantially lock the head while the rod is still freely displaceable within the receiving part. A third fixation member is configured to exert pressure only onto the rod to finally lock the rod and the head.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to a still further aspect of the invention, the bone anchoring device is a monoaxial bone anchoring device, in which the shank is fixedly connected to the receiving part. The second rod contact surface is provided at the receiving part itself. With the first fixation member, the rod remains movable in the rod channel. With the third fixation member, the rod can be fixed in the rod channel.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The bone anchoring device according to embodiments of the invention is also configured to be used with rods of different diameters.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">By interchanging the fixation member and/or the type of the bone anchoring device, the rod and/or the head can be clamped or kept movable. Hence, the function of the bone anchoring device can be easily defined and/or changed. Thus, the bone anchoring device together with at least two fixation members provides a modular system that permits different locking configurations of the head and/or the rod by selecting an appropriate fixation member.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Further features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the description of embodiments by means of the accompanying drawings.

end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>4</b></figref>, a bone anchoring device according to a first embodiment is a polyaxial axial bone anchoring device. The bone anchoring device includes a bone anchoring element <b>1</b> having a shank <b>2</b> with a threaded portion and a head <b>3</b>. The head <b>3</b> has a spherically-shaped outer surface portion and, on its side opposite to the shank <b>2</b>, a recess <b>4</b> for engagement with a tool. A receiving part <b>5</b> is provided for coupling the bone anchoring element <b>1</b> to a rod <b>100</b>. In the receiving part <b>5</b>, a pressure member <b>6</b> is arranged to exert pressure onto the head <b>3</b> of the bone anchoring element <b>1</b>. Additionally, the bone anchoring device includes a variable configuration member in the form of an outer ring <b>7</b> that is configured to be mounted around the receiving part <b>5</b>. The outer ring <b>7</b> is further configured to provide a support for the rod <b>100</b> when the rod <b>100</b> is placed into the receiving part <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Moreover, the bone anchoring device may further include a first fixation member <b>8</b> that is configured to cooperate with the receiving part <b>5</b> to secure the rod <b>100</b> in the receiving part <b>5</b>. In addition, a second fixation member <b>8</b>&#x2032; and a third fixation member <b>8</b>&#x2033; may be provided wherein the three fixation members are all interchangeably usable with the bone anchoring device. The second fixation member <b>8</b>&#x2032; is configured to cooperate with the receiving part <b>5</b>, such that the head <b>3</b> is clamped or locked and the rod <b>100</b> remains movable along an axis of the rod. The third fixation member <b>8</b>&#x2033; is configured to cooperate with the receiving part <b>5</b>, such that the rod <b>100</b> and the head <b>3</b> can be locked simultaneously. Thus, the polyaxial bone anchoring device and the first, the second, and the third fixation members form a modular system, in particular, a modular system that can realize different functions for the polyaxial bone anchoring device.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The rod <b>100</b> may be a cylindrical straight rod that is configured to stabilize bone parts or vertebrae connected through the rod. Preferably, the surface of the rod <b>100</b> is smooth, at least to an extent such that the rod <b>100</b> can slide along a fixation member when the rod touches the fixation member while not being fixed. It shall be noted that the rod is not limited to a straight rod as depicted in the embodiments, but can be any elongate stabilization member that is configured to be displaceably, in particular slidably, receivable in the receiving part <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> to <b>9</b></figref>, the receiving part <b>5</b> will be described in greater detail. The receiving part <b>5</b> has a first end or top end <b>5</b><i>a </i>and a second end or bottom end <b>5</b><i>b </i>opposite to the top end <b>5</b><i>a. </i>The receiving part may have a substantially cylindrical outer shape, with a central longitudinal axis C extending through the top end <b>5</b><i>a </i>and the bottom end <b>5</b><i>b. </i>Coaxially with the central axis C, a passage <b>51</b> is provided that extends from the top end <b>5</b><i>a </i>to the bottom end <b>5</b><i>b </i>and forms an opening <b>52</b> at the bottom end <b>5</b><i>b. </i>At a distance from the top end <b>5</b><i>a, </i>the passage <b>51</b> widens into an accommodation space <b>53</b> that is configured to receive the head <b>3</b> and at least a portion of the pressure member <b>6</b>. Adjacent to the opening <b>52</b> at the bottom end <b>5</b><i>b, </i>the accommodation space <b>53</b> narrows towards the opening <b>52</b> in a narrowing portion <b>53</b><i>a, </i>which may be, for example, a tapered, and more particularly, a conical surface that may cooperate with a corresponding portion of the pressure member <b>6</b>. A width of the opening <b>52</b> may be greater than a greatest width E of the head <b>3</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>), so that the head <b>3</b> may be inserted from the bottom end <b>5</b><i>b </i>into the accommodation space <b>53</b>. To enable the insertion of the head <b>3</b> from the bottom end <b>5</b><i>b, </i>the width of the accommodation space <b>53</b> is such that the pressure member <b>6</b> can expand therein to permit the insertion of the head <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The receiving part <b>5</b> further defines a substantially U-shaped recess <b>54</b> starting at the top end <b>5</b><i>a </i>and extending in the direction of the bottom end <b>5</b><i>b, </i>with a bottom <b>54</b><i>a </i>at its deepest position. By means of the U-shaped recess <b>54</b>, two free legs <b>55</b> are formed that define a channel for receiving the rod <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">On an inner surface of the legs <b>55</b>, an internal thread <b>56</b> is formed, which is in the exemplary embodiment a square thread or another flat thread. For cooperation with a portion of the pressure member <b>6</b>, a circumferential groove <b>57</b> may be provided at the inner wall of the legs <b>55</b> at a distance from the bottom <b>54</b><i>a </i>of the U-shaped recess <b>54</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In addition, transverse holes <b>58</b> may extend through the legs <b>55</b>, respectively, in a direction perpendicular to the central axis C and at a position approximately at the center of each of the legs <b>55</b> in the circumferential direction. The transverse holes <b>58</b> may serve for accommodating pins <b>59</b> that extend through the holes <b>58</b> into the channel. The pins <b>59</b> are configured to engage the pressure member <b>6</b> to form a securing structure to secure the pressure member <b>6</b> against rotation. In addition, the pins <b>59</b> may limit an upward movement of the pressure member <b>6</b>. At an outside of the legs <b>55</b>, for example, longitudinal recesses <b>50</b> and/or attachment projections <b>50</b><i>a </i>may be provided for engagement with a tool or an instrument.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">At an axial position below the bottom <b>54</b><i>a </i>of the substantially U-shaped recess <b>54</b> and to the right and to the left of the bottom <b>54</b><i>a </i>on either side of the rod channel in a circumferential direction, a holding structure for the outer ring <b>7</b> is provided. The holding structure may include grooves <b>500</b> for engagement with a portion of the outer ring <b>7</b>. The grooves <b>500</b> extend circumferentially in a portion of the outer surface of the receiving part <b>5</b>. More specifically, the grooves <b>500</b> may have a circumferential length that may be less than half, and more particularly, less than a quarter, of the circumference of the receiving part. Hence, four such grooves may be formed, two on each end of the rod channel.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Each of the grooves <b>500</b> has a rectangular contour in a front view and includes an inner wall <b>500</b><i>a </i>which is sandwiched between an upper wall <b>500</b><i>b </i>that faces towards the bottom end <b>5</b><i>b </i>of the receiving part <b>5</b> and a lower wall <b>500</b><i>c </i>that faces towards the top end <b>5</b><i>a </i>of the receiving part <b>5</b>. The inner wall <b>500</b><i>a </i>may be flat, such that a depth of the groove increases from ends of the groove towards a center of the groove in the circumferential direction. The upper wall <b>500</b><i>b </i>may be straight, and more particularly may extend substantially perpendicular to the central axis C. The lower wall <b>500</b><i>c </i>forms a stop for a portion of the outer ring <b>7</b>. In greater detail, the lower wall <b>500</b><i>c </i>is inclined in a manner such that the lower wall forms an undercut of the groove. This permits engagement with a portion of the outer ring <b>7</b> and prevents inadvertent removal or detachment of the outer ring <b>7</b> via the lower end <b>5</b><i>b </i>of the receiving part <b>5</b> once the outer ring <b>7</b> has been mounted. When the outer ring <b>7</b> engages the grooves <b>500</b>, the orientation of the outer ring relative to the receiving part is maintained. Thus, the grooves also form a securing structure against inadvertent rotation of the outer ring. While one such groove may be sufficient, preferably for stability reasons, at least two, and more preferably four, such grooves are provided with the described structure.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring further to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> to <b>14</b></figref>, the outer ring <b>7</b> has a first end or upper end <b>7</b><i>a </i>and an opposite second end or lower end <b>7</b><i>b. </i>An inner width of the outer ring <b>7</b> is such that the outer ring <b>7</b> fits around the receiving part <b>5</b> in an axial region between the bottom <b>54</b><i>a </i>of the U-shaped recess <b>54</b> and the bottom end <b>5</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">At positions corresponding to the positions of the grooves <b>500</b> in the outer surface of the receiving part <b>5</b>, the outer ring <b>7</b> has counterpart holding structures in the form of protrusions <b>70</b> that are configured to engage the grooves <b>500</b>. More specifically, each protrusion <b>70</b> has an inner surface <b>70</b><i>a </i>that is configured to abut against the inner surface <b>500</b><i>a </i>of the groove <b>500</b> when the outer ring <b>7</b> is mounted to the receiving part <b>5</b>. An upper surface <b>70</b><i>b </i>of the protrusion <b>70</b> may be inclined in a manner such that sliding of the outer ring <b>7</b> over the receiving part <b>5</b> when the outer ring <b>7</b> is mounted from the lower end <b>5</b><i>b </i>is more easily facilitated. An opposite lower surface <b>70</b><i>c </i>of the protrusion <b>70</b> is inclined, preferably also having or forming an undercut, in a manner such that the lower surface <b>70</b><i>c </i>can snap into the undercut provided by the lower surface <b>500</b><i>c </i>of the groove <b>500</b>, and preferably can hook therein (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>). Thus, the lower surface <b>500</b><i>c </i>of the groove <b>500</b> forms a stop for the outer ring <b>7</b> when the outer ring <b>7</b> is mounted and moved towards the second end <b>5</b><i>b. </i>The sidewalls <b>70</b><i>d </i>of the protrusion <b>70</b> may be concavely rounded to permit easy entrance into the groove <b>500</b>. The position of the protrusions <b>70</b> in the axial direction and the distance of the protrusions <b>70</b> from the lower end <b>7</b><i>b </i>may be such that, once the protrusions <b>70</b> have entered the grooves <b>500</b>, the protrusions can move slightly in an axial direction in the groove. Corresponding to the grooves <b>500</b>, four protrusions <b>70</b> are formed.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">At a circumferential position between two neighboring protrusions <b>70</b> in the circumferential direction, an elevation <b>71</b> is formed at the upper end <b>7</b><i>a </i>of the outer ring <b>7</b>. Hence, the outer ring <b>7</b> has two elevations <b>71</b> that are offset by 180&#xb0;. The elevations <b>71</b> are configured to protrude above the bottom <b>54</b><i>a </i>of the recess <b>54</b> of the receiving part <b>5</b> when the outer ring <b>7</b> has been mounted to the receiving part <b>5</b>. A shallow depression <b>72</b> may be formed on the upper surface of each elevation <b>71</b>. The depression <b>72</b> functions as a first rod contact surface.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The outer ring <b>7</b> may further include stiffening structures <b>73</b>. The stiffening structures <b>73</b> may be formed as protrusions that are offset from each other by 180&#xb0; and located at circumferential positions approximately in the middle between the elevations <b>71</b> and at an axial position preferably adjacent to or close to the upper end <b>7</b><i>a </i>of the outer ring <b>7</b>. The shape of the protrusions may be similar to the shape of the protrusions <b>70</b>, however the radial thickness of the stiffening structures <b>73</b> may be smaller since the stiffening structures <b>73</b> do not engage a groove in the receiving part. When pressure is exerted via the rod on the first rod contact surface <b>72</b>, the outer ring is deformed in a manner such that the ring shape of the outer ring is slightly changed so that the first rod contact surface <b>72</b> at the elevations <b>71</b> is moved towards the lower end <b>5</b><i>b </i>of the receiving part <b>5</b>. The stiffening structures <b>73</b> enable such a defined deformation. Upon relieving the pressure from the rod, the outer ring can assume its original ring shape again.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">It shall be noted that the design of the holding structures and of the stiffening structures is not limited to the specific shapes shown, but can have different shapes that result in the same or similar functionality.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">An outer width of the outer ring <b>7</b> may be such that the outer ring does not or only minimally protrudes beyond the outer surface of the protrusions <b>50</b><i>a </i>of the receiving part <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The outer ring preferably is made of a material such that the outer ring is flexible or deformable to some extent. In particular, the outer ring <b>7</b> is deformable when pressure is exerted onto the first rod contact surface <b>72</b>. Such a material is preferably a polymer material, more preferably a body-compatible polymer material, such as, for example, polyether ether ketone (PEEK). Due to the material and to the shape, the outer ring may be elastically deformable, i.e., when a load that causes a deformation of the outer ring <b>7</b> is relieved, the outer ring <b>7</b> can assume its original shape. In addition, the material facilitates sliding of the rod when the rod is on the first rod contact surface <b>72</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b> to <b>21</b></figref>, the pressure member <b>6</b> will be described. The pressure member <b>6</b> may be formed as a monolithic part, with a first or upper end <b>6</b><i>a </i>and a second or lower end <b>6</b><i>b </i>opposite to the upper end <b>6</b><i>a. </i>Adjacent to the upper end <b>6</b><i>a, </i>the pressure member <b>6</b> includes a substantially cylindrical first portion <b>61</b> that is adapted to be received in the passage <b>51</b> of the receiving part <b>5</b> and to move therein in an axial direction. Adjacent to the lower end <b>6</b><i>b, </i>a substantially cylindrical second portion <b>62</b> is formed that is configured to extend at least partially into the accommodation space <b>53</b> of the receiving part <b>5</b>. Further, adjacent to the lower end <b>6</b><i>b, </i>a head receiving recess <b>63</b> that may be adapted to the spherical shape of the head <b>3</b> is formed in the second portion <b>62</b>. The head receiving recess <b>63</b> may be sized so as to frictionally hold the head <b>3</b> of the bone anchoring element <b>1</b> therein. A widened cylindrical portion <b>63</b><i>a </i>in the head receiving recess <b>63</b> may enhance flexibility of the head receiving recess <b>63</b> and may facilitate pivoting of the head <b>3</b>. Due to a plurality of longitudinal slits <b>64</b> that are open to the second end <b>6</b><i>b </i>and that preferably have widened end portions <b>64</b><i>a, </i>the second portion <b>62</b> is rendered flexible. Adjacent to the lower end <b>6</b><i>b, </i>the outer surface of the second portion <b>62</b> includes a narrowing portion <b>65</b>, preferably a tapered and more preferably a conically-tapered portion, that is configured to cooperate with the narrowing portion <b>53</b><i>a </i>of the accommodation space <b>53</b>. By means of the cooperating surfaces <b>65</b>, <b>53</b><i>a </i>of the pressure member <b>6</b> and of the receiving part <b>5</b>, respectively, the flexible second portion <b>62</b> of the pressure member <b>6</b> can be compressed to clamp or lock the head <b>3</b> in the head receiving recess <b>63</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Adjacent to the upper end <b>6</b><i>a, </i>a substantially U-shaped recess <b>66</b> forms two open legs <b>67</b> that preferably have substantially flat inner walls. The substantially U-shaped recess <b>66</b> has an elevated base <b>68</b> with a surface <b>68</b><i>a </i>that has a substantially V-shaped contour with a rounded bottom. The surface <b>68</b><i>a </i>forms a second rod contact surface that is in this embodiment configured to receive rods of different diameters thereon. Moreover, the support surface <b>68</b><i>a </i>lies at an axial height with respect to the upper end <b>6</b><i>a </i>of the pressure member <b>6</b> such that, when a rod having a greatest possible diameter that can be accommodated by the pressure member rests on the second rod contact surface <b>68</b><i>a, </i>the upper end <b>6</b><i>a </i>of the pressure member, and more specifically of the legs <b>67</b>, projects above the upper surface of the rod. By means of the elevated base <b>68</b>, two grooves <b>68</b><i>b </i>are formed between the right and the left side of the elevated base <b>68</b> and the legs <b>67</b>. Thereby the legs <b>67</b> may be slightly radially flexible. The end surface at the upper end <b>6</b><i>a </i>of the pressure member <b>6</b> may have a substantially roof-shaped cross-section, with an inclined inner surface <b>601</b> and an inclined outer surface <b>602</b> that may be shorter than the inclined inner surface <b>601</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The pressure member <b>6</b> further includes a coaxial bore <b>60</b> that serves for accessing the recess <b>4</b> of the head <b>3</b> with a tool. In addition, at approximately a center of each of the legs <b>67</b> in a circumferential direction, an axially elongate hole <b>69</b> is provided that is configured to be engaged by the pins <b>59</b>. The corporation between the pins <b>59</b> and the elongate holes <b>69</b> prevents rotation of the pressure member <b>6</b> with respect to the receiving part <b>5</b>. Furthermore, the pins <b>59</b> form a stop against an upward movement of the pressure member <b>6</b>, for example, when the head <b>3</b> is inserted through the lower opening <b>52</b> of the receiving part <b>5</b> into the head receiving recess <b>63</b> of the pressure member <b>6</b>. Above the elongate recesses <b>69</b>, circumferentially extending projections <b>600</b> with a substantially flat upper surface may be provided that are configured to engage the groove <b>57</b> of the receiving part <b>5</b>. By means of this, a pre-locking position of the pressure member <b>6</b> in the receiving part <b>5</b> can be secured, as further described below.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>22</b> and <b>23</b></figref>, the first fixation member <b>8</b> is formed as a set screw with an upper end <b>8</b><i>a </i>and an opposite lower end <b>8</b><i>b. </i>In the upper end <b>8</b><i>a, </i>a tool-receiving recess <b>81</b> is provided that may have, for example, a torx-shape. In addition, at the upper end <b>8</b><i>a, </i>a circumferentially extending flange <b>82</b> is formed that protrudes in a radial direction beyond the outer thread <b>83</b> of the set screw. At the lower end <b>8</b><i>b, </i>a recess <b>84</b> receives an insert <b>85</b>. The insert <b>85</b> may be disc-shaped with a substantially circular outer contour that is held, for example, via a press-fit connection in the recess <b>84</b>. An axial thickness of the disc-shaped insert <b>85</b> may be such that a lower surface <b>85</b><i>a </i>of the insert <b>85</b> protrudes slightly out of the lower end <b>8</b><i>b </i>of the first fixation member <b>8</b>. An outer diameter of the insert <b>85</b> is slightly smaller than the distance between the inner surfaces of the legs <b>67</b> of the pressure member <b>6</b>, such that the insert can extend between the legs <b>67</b>, preferably without exerting a force onto the pressure member <b>6</b>. The insert <b>85</b> is preferably made of a material that facilitates sliding of the rod along the lower surface <b>85</b><i>a. </i>More specifically, the insert <b>85</b> may be made of a polymer, particularly of a body-compatible polymer, such as PEEK.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The flange <b>82</b> functions as a stop to limit the advancement of the first fixation member <b>8</b> between the legs <b>55</b>. An axial length of the first fixation member <b>8</b> is such that when the first fixation member <b>8</b> is inserted between the legs <b>55</b> of the receiving part <b>5</b> and screwed downward until the flange <b>82</b> abuts against the top end <b>5</b><i>a </i>of the receiving part, neither the lower surface <b>85</b><i>a </i>nor the lower end <b>8</b><i>b </i>of the first fixation member <b>8</b> exerts a downward axial force onto the pressure member <b>6</b>. In other words, a position of the pressure member <b>6</b> remains unaffected by the first fixation member <b>8</b> when the flange <b>82</b> abuts against the top end <b>5</b><i>a </i>of the receiving part <b>5</b>. Preferably, there is a small gap between the upper end <b>6</b><i>a </i>of the pressure member <b>6</b> and the surface at the lower end <b>8</b><i>b </i>of the first fixation member <b>8</b>. Moreover, the axial length of the first fixation member is such that there is a gap <b>800</b> between the upper surface of the rod <b>100</b> and the lower surface <b>85</b><i>a </i>of the first fixation member <b>8</b>. The size of the gap <b>800</b> depends on the size of the rod. In some cases, the gap is so small so that the rod <b>100</b> is configured to slide along the lower surface <b>85</b><i>a. </i>In clinical use, if the gap <b>800</b> is large enough, the rod may even be able to move freely without contacting the first fixation member <b>8</b> or the pressure member <b>6</b>. Alternatively, the axial length of the portion of first fixation member <b>8</b> that protrudes into the rod channel and/or the diameter of the rod may be such that the rod slides along the lower side of the first fixation member and on the first rod contacting surface <b>72</b> of the outer ring <b>7</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The bone anchoring element, the receiving part, and the pressure member, as well as the rod and the fixation member, may be made of the same or of different materials, preferably of a bio-compatible material such as titanium or stainless steel, or of a bio-compatible alloy, such as NiTi alloys, for example Nitinol, or of a bio-compatible plastic material, for example, polyether ether ketone (PEEK).</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The receiving part <b>5</b>, the pressure member <b>6</b>, and the outer ring <b>7</b> usually are pre-assembled before attaching them to a bone anchoring element and/or a rod. For assembly, the pressure member <b>6</b> is inserted through the top end <b>5</b><i>a </i>into the receiving part, such that the head receiving recess <b>63</b> extends into the accommodation space <b>53</b>. The second rod contact surface <b>68</b><i>a </i>of the pressure member <b>6</b> is aligned with the U-shaped recess <b>54</b>. The pressure member <b>6</b> is secured against rotation by the pins <b>59</b> which extend through the through-holes <b>58</b> of the receiving part into the elongate holes <b>69</b> of the pressure member. In this configuration, the pressure member <b>6</b> can move along an axial distance which is limited by the abutment of the pins <b>59</b> against the lower end of the elongate holes <b>69</b>. The outer ring <b>7</b> is mounted from the lower end <b>5</b><i>b </i>onto the receiving part <b>5</b>, and is oriented with respect to the receiving part <b>5</b> such that the elevations <b>71</b> with the rod supports <b>72</b> are aligned with the U-shaped recess <b>54</b> of the receiving part <b>5</b>. The outer ring <b>7</b> is then shifted over the receiving part <b>5</b> until the inclined lower surface <b>70</b><i>c </i>of the protrusion <b>70</b> snaps into the groove <b>500</b> and hooks into the inclined lower surface <b>500</b><i>c </i>of the groove <b>500</b>. As a result, the outer ring <b>7</b> is secured against removal in a direction towards the lower end <b>5</b><i>b </i>of the receiving part and/or against rotation. In use, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>24</b><i>a </i>to <b>24</b><i>f</i></figref>, the receiving part <b>5</b> which is pre-assembled with the pressure member <b>6</b> and the outer ring <b>7</b> is configured to be connected to the bone anchoring element <b>1</b>. In a first method of use, the bone anchoring element <b>1</b> has been inserted into a bone part or a vertebra <b>1000</b> prior to coupling the receiving part <b>5</b> to the head <b>3</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b><i>a</i></figref>. The head <b>3</b> of the bone anchoring element <b>1</b> projects out of the bone surface and the pre-assembled receiving part is placed with the lower end <b>5</b><i>b </i>towards the head <b>3</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b><i>b</i></figref>. When the head <b>3</b> enters into the head receiving recess <b>63</b>, the pressure member <b>6</b> is moved upwards in the passage <b>51</b> until further upward movement is limited by the pins <b>59</b>. The flexible second portion <b>62</b> of the pressure member <b>6</b> expands in the accommodation space <b>53</b> and snaps onto the head <b>3</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b><i>c</i></figref>. Thereafter, the receiving part <b>5</b> is pulled slightly away from the head and the pressure member <b>6</b>, so that the cooperating surfaces <b>53</b><i>a </i>of the receiving part <b>5</b> and <b>65</b> of the pressure member <b>6</b> engage to preliminarily hold the head in the receiving part in a pivotable manner, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b><i>d</i></figref>. This is a pre-locking position where the head <b>3</b> is prevented from removal through the lower opening <b>52</b>. In the pre-locking position of the pressure member <b>6</b>, the projections <b>600</b> on the legs <b>67</b> are located in the grooves <b>57</b> of the receiving part <b>5</b> and prevent upward movement of the pressure member <b>6</b> out of the pre-locking position. It shall be noted that the size of the head and the head receiving recess may be selected such that, in the pre-locking position of the pressure member <b>6</b>, the head may be temporarily held by friction at a particular angular position and can be pivoted to another angular position when applying a force to overcome the frictional force, such as manually pivoting the receiving part relative to the head, at which point the head may be held again by friction at the new angular position.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Referring in greater detail to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b><i>d</i></figref>, the outer ring <b>7</b> projects with the elevations <b>71</b> and the first rod contact surface <b>72</b> at least partially above the second rod contact surface <b>68</b><i>a </i>of the pressure member <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>24</b><i>e </i>and <b>24</b><i>f</i></figref>, the rod <b>100</b> is inserted and the fixation member <b>8</b> is screwed between the legs <b>55</b> of the receiving part <b>5</b>.

This could be used, for example, in a growing rod construct. This creates further possibilities of correction steps in which it may be advantageous to keep the receiving part pivotable relative to the shank.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>25</b> to <b>27</b></figref>, a second embodiment of the bone anchoring device includes the second fixation member <b>8</b>&#x2032;. All other parts are identical or very similar to the first embodiment. The second fixation member <b>8</b>&#x2032; is similar to the first fixation member except that it lacks the flange <b>82</b>, and therefore can be screwed deeper into the rod channel. All parts and portions of the second fixation member that are identical or very similar to those of the first fixation member are marked with the same reference numerals, and the descriptions thereof are not repeated. A maximum outer width of the second fixation member is defined by the outer diameter of the thread <b>83</b>. The surface at the lower end <b>8</b><i>b </i>in this embodiment may be concavely shaped to match the corresponding convexly shaped upper end surface of the legs of the pressure member <b>6</b>. In greater detail, the surface at the lower end <b>8</b><i>b </i>of the second fixation member <b>8</b>&#x2032; has an inclined inner surface <b>801</b> that may in a cross-sectional view be longer than an inclined outer surface <b>802</b>, which in combination are concavely roof-shaped. The convexly shaped upper end surfaces <b>601</b>, <b>602</b> of the pressure member and the concavely shaped matching end surfaces <b>801</b>, <b>802</b> fit together when the second fixation member is screwed between the legs <b>55</b> of the receiving part. Thereby, the connection in the radial direction is improved and a radial play that could lead to an inhomogeneous pressure onto the pressure member <b>6</b> may be reduced.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">An axial length of the second fixation member <b>8</b>&#x2032; is such that when the second fixation member is tightened, the second fixation member <b>8</b>&#x2032; presses onto the pressure member <b>6</b> so that the pressure member <b>6</b> is moved downwards until the cooperating surfaces <b>65</b> of the pressure member <b>6</b> and <b>53</b><i>a </i>of the receiving part <b>5</b> engage to clamp the head <b>3</b>. In this configuration as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b></figref>, the rod <b>100</b> rests on the outer ring <b>7</b> while a gap <b>800</b> remains between the lower surface <b>85</b><i>a </i>of the insert member <b>85</b> and the upper surface of the rod, such that the rod can still slide within the receiving part.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>28</b> to <b>30</b></figref>, a third embodiment of the polyaxial bone anchoring device includes the third fixation member <b>8</b>&#x2033;. The third fixation member is a set screw with an upper end <b>8</b><i>a </i>and a lower end <b>8</b><i>b, </i>and a tool engagement recess <b>81</b> that extends from the upper end <b>8</b><i>a </i>towards the lower end <b>8</b><i>b. </i>The third fixation member <b>8</b>&#x2033; further has a projection <b>86</b>, preferably a cylindrical projection, at the lower end <b>8</b><i>b, </i>with a free end surface <b>86</b><i>a. </i>An outer width of the projection <b>86</b> is smaller than an inner width of the pressure member <b>6</b> between the legs <b>67</b>. Thus, when the third fixation member <b>8</b>&#x2033; is inserted between the legs <b>55</b> of the receiving part <b>5</b>, the projection <b>86</b> can be advanced between the legs <b>67</b> of the pressure member <b>6</b> without touching the pressure member <b>6</b>. The length of the projection <b>86</b> in the axial direction is such that when the third fixation member <b>8</b>&#x2033; is inserted between the legs <b>55</b> of the receiving part <b>5</b>, the lower surface <b>86</b><i>a </i>of the projection <b>86</b> presses onto the surface of an inserted rod <b>100</b>. When the third fixation member <b>8</b>&#x2033; exerts pressure onto the rod <b>100</b>, the rod in turn exerts pressure onto the outer ring <b>7</b>. The outer ring <b>7</b> is deformed until the rod rests on the rod contact surface <b>68</b><i>a </i>of the pressure member <b>6</b>. The rod may simultaneously still contact the first rod support surface <b>72</b> of the outer ring.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Hence, the outer ring <b>7</b> is configured to change between a first configuration and a second configuration. In the first configuration, the outer ring <b>7</b> is non-deformed and the elevations <b>71</b> of the outer ring <b>7</b> project above the second rod contact surface <b>68</b><i>a </i>of the pressure member <b>6</b>. In the second configuration, the outer ring <b>7</b> is deformed and the elevations <b>71</b> with the first rod contact surface <b>72</b> no longer extend above the second rod contact surface <b>68</b><i>a </i>of the pressure member <b>6</b>, such that the rod <b>100</b> rests on the second rod contact surface <b>68</b><i>a </i>of the pressure member <b>6</b>. The deformation is reversible. This means that when the pressure from the rod onto the outer ring <b>7</b> is relieved, the outer ring <b>7</b> re-assumes the first configuration.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In use, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b></figref>, tightening the third fixation member <b>8</b>&#x2033; results in an axial force via the projection <b>86</b> onto the inserted rod <b>100</b>. As a result, while tightening the third fixation member <b>8</b>&#x2033;, the head <b>3</b> and the rod <b>100</b> are locked in the receiving part <b>5</b> simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>31</b> and <b>32</b></figref>, a still further embodiment of the polyaxial bone anchoring device is described. The polyaxial bone anchoring device in this embodiment differs from the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>30</b></figref> in the design of the pressure member and the receiving part. The receiving part <b>5</b>&#x2032; includes, adjacent to the lower end <b>5</b><i>b, </i>a seat <b>53</b><i>a</i>&#x2032; for the head <b>3</b> of the bone anchoring element <b>1</b>, in which the head <b>3</b> is pivotably supported. The lower opening <b>52</b>&#x2032; has an inner diameter that is smaller than the greatest diameter E of the head <b>3</b>. Thus, in this embodiment, the bone anchoring element <b>1</b> has to be inserted from the upper end <b>5</b><i>a </i>of the receiving part and guided with the shank <b>2</b> through the lower opening <b>52</b>&#x2032; until the head <b>3</b> rests in the seat <b>53</b><i>a</i>&#x2032;. The accommodation space <b>53</b>&#x2032; is configured to accommodate a portion of the head <b>3</b> and a portion of the pressure member <b>6</b>&#x2032;. The pressure member <b>6</b>&#x2032; has a lower portion <b>62</b>&#x2032; with a spherical recess <b>63</b>&#x2032; that is configured to cover the head <b>3</b> above the region with the greatest outer diameter E and to exert pressure onto the head <b>3</b>. The lower portion <b>62</b>&#x2032; has a substantially cylindrical outer surface and is configured to move in the passage <b>51</b>&#x2032; of the receiving part <b>5</b>&#x2032;. It shall be noted that the seat <b>53</b><i>a</i>&#x2032; may also have any shape that allows the head <b>3</b> to pivot therein like a ball and socket joint. For example, the seat <b>53</b><i>a</i>&#x2032; may also be conically-shaped.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Since the bone anchoring device according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>31</b> and <b>32</b></figref> is a top-loading bone anchoring device in which the anchoring element <b>1</b> is inserted from the upper end <b>5</b><i>a </i>into the receiving part <b>5</b>&#x2032;, the polyaxial bone anchoring device can be inserted into bone with the receiving part <b>5</b>&#x2032;, the pressure member <b>6</b>&#x2032;, the bone anchoring element <b>1</b>, and the outer ring <b>7</b> pre-assembled. In the figures, the first fixation member <b>8</b> is shown in use with the polyaxial bone anchoring device. When the fixation member <b>8</b> is tightened, the rod rests on the outer ring <b>7</b> and is still movable since there is the gap <b>800</b> between the uppermost surface of the rod and the lower surface <b>85</b><i>a </i>of the insert <b>85</b>. The pressure member <b>6</b>&#x2032; may have shorter legs <b>67</b>&#x2032; that do not project over the rod surface. Hence, the pressure member <b>6</b>&#x2032; does not exert pressure onto the head <b>3</b>. Thus, in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>31</b> and <b>32</b></figref>, the head <b>3</b> remains pivotable and the rod <b>100</b> remains movable when the first fixation member is tightened.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">Using the third fixation member <b>8</b>&#x2033; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>28</b> and <b>29</b></figref> allows fixation of the rod and the head simultaneously by pressing the projection <b>86</b> onto the rod, which in turn presses onto the pressure member <b>6</b>&#x2032;, thereby also locking the head <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In a further modification of this embodiment, the pressure member <b>6</b>&#x2032; also includes legs that extend above the uppermost surface of an inserted rod. Hence, in such a modification, the second fixation member <b>8</b>&#x2032; according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>25</b> and <b>26</b></figref> can also be used to lock the head while leaving the rod movable.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>33</b> and <b>34</b></figref>, a further embodiment of the bone anchoring device is described. The bone anchoring device in this embodiment is a monoaxial bone anchoring device. This means, that the shank <b>2</b>&#x2032; and the receiving part <b>5</b>&#x2033; are not pivotable with respect to each other. The receiving part <b>5</b>&#x2033; has an outer appearance that is very similar to that of the receiving part <b>5</b> and <b>5</b>&#x2032; of the previous embodiments. The shank <b>2</b>&#x2032; is, in this embodiment, monolithic with the receiving part <b>5</b>&#x2033;. A second rod support is formed by the bottom <b>54</b><i>a</i>&#x2032; of the substantially U-shaped recess <b>54</b> that defines the channel for receiving the rod. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>34</b></figref>, the second rod contact surface <b>54</b><i>a</i>&#x2032; has a substantially V-shaped contour, preferably with a rounded bottom for receiving rods having different diameters. The outer ring <b>7</b> projects at least partially with the extensions <b>71</b> above the second rod contact surface <b>54</b><i>a</i>&#x2032;, so that the rod <b>100</b> can rest on the first rod contact surface <b>72</b> of the outer ring <b>7</b>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">The bone anchoring device is shown with the first fixation member <b>8</b>. Therefore, when the first fixation member <b>8</b> is tightened, the rod <b>100</b> is still movable in the rod channel and can slide along the lower surface <b>85</b><i>a </i>of the third fixation member and on the first rod contact surface <b>72</b> of the outer ring <b>7</b>.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Alternatively, when the third fixation member <b>8</b>&#x2033; is used, the projection <b>86</b> presses onto the rod when the third fixation member <b>8</b>&#x2033; is tightened. As a result, the outer ring is deformed and the rod <b>100</b> is pressed against the second rod contact surface <b>54</b><i>a</i>&#x2032; of the receiving part <b>5</b>&#x2033;. Hence, by selecting a suitable fixation member, the monoaxial bone anchoring device can be used as a bone anchoring device that allows the rod to freely slide or as a bone anchoring device which is configured to fix the rod thereto.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Further modifications of the above described embodiments are also conceivable without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. In particular, the shapes of the respective parts are not limited to the detailed shapes shown in the figures. Deviations may be possible and encompassed by the disclosure. The variable configuration member is shown as a closed ring. However, the variable configuration member in alternative embodiments can also be a member that is, for example, partially arranged in the rod channel and is deformable upon pressure exerted by the rod onto it.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Also, a two-part fixation member may be included in the system, with an outer member and an inner member. The receiving part and the pressure member are not limited to the detailed shapes shown. The receiving part and/or the pressure member may also have two-part designs. The rod contact surface in the pressure member may be flat or cylindrical. Also, the pressure member in the first embodiment can have short legs that do not project above a surface of an inserted rod. Also, the receiving part may have extended tabs which prolong the legs. Such a receiving part may be used, for example, for reduction procedures in which vertebrae or bone parts are re-aligned.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">In a further modification, the receiving part can be designed to have two rod channels, so that two sliding rods may be employed.
