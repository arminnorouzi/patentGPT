Also, inhomogeneous temperature during operation of the device may result to asymmetric properties.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The consequence of asymmetries of Hall effect devices is primarily a resultant change in the sensitive direction of the magnetic field. For example, suppose a vertical Hall effect device with a current flow parallel to the (x,z)-plane of a Cartesian reference system. In the absence of asymmetries, the vertical Hall effect device would respond to a y-component (By) of a magnetic field (as long as the field is reasonably small and no mechanical stress acts on the device)&#x2014;and it would not respond to an x-component (Bx) and a z-component (Bz) of the magnetic field. That is, the vertical Hall effect device would be responsive to or have a sensitivity axis aligned with the y-direction and not to the x- and z-directions. However, small asymmetries in the device lead to a small sensitivity to the Bx and/or the Bz magnetic field components, too. This is called magnetic cross-talk, and in general it should be avoided for accurate sensor systems.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, an improved device capable of detecting and/or compensating for magnetic cross-talk may be desirable.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Embodiments provide devices, systems, and methods related to measuring and counteracting asymmetry in Hall sensors.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">One or more embodiments provide a sensor cross-talk compensation system including a semiconductor substrate that has a first main surface and a second main surface opposite to the first main surface; a vertical Hall sensor element disposed in the semiconductor substrate, wherein the vertical Hall sensor element is configured to generate a first sensor signal in response to a first magnetic field impinging thereon; and an asymmetry detector configured to detect an asymmetric characteristic of the vertical Hall sensor element.

However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that embodiments may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form or in a schematic view rather than in detail in order to avoid obscuring the embodiments. In addition, features of the different embodiments described hereinafter may be combined with each other, unless specifically noted otherwise.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Further, equivalent or like elements or elements with equivalent or like functionality are denoted in the following description with equivalent or like reference numerals. As the same or functionally equivalent elements are given the same reference numbers in the figures, a repeated description for elements provided with the same reference numbers may be omitted. Hence, descriptions provided for elements having the same or like reference numbers are mutually exchangeable.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">It will be understood that when an element is referred to as being &#x201c;connected&#x201d; or &#x201c;coupled&#x201d; to another element, it can be directly connected or coupled to the other element or intervening elements may be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being &#x201c;directly connected&#x201d; or &#x201c;directly coupled&#x201d; to another element, there are no intervening elements present. Other words used to describe the relationship between elements should be interpreted in a like fashion (e.g., &#x201c;between&#x201d; versus &#x201c;directly between,&#x201d; &#x201c;adjacent&#x201d; versus &#x201c;directly adjacent,&#x201d; etc.).</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In embodiments described herein or shown in the drawings, any direct electrical connection or coupling, i.e., any connection or coupling without additional intervening elements, may also be implemented by an indirect connection or coupling, i.e., a connection or coupling with one or more additional intervening elements, or vice versa, as long as the general purpose of the connection or coupling, for example, to transmit a certain kind of signal or to transmit a certain kind of information, is essentially maintained. Features from different embodiments may be combined to form further embodiments. For example, variations or modifications described with respect to one of the embodiments may also be applicable to other embodiments unless noted to the contrary.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The term &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; may be used herein to account for small manufacturing tolerances (e.g., within 5%) that are deemed acceptable in the industry without departing from the aspects of the embodiments described herein.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The Figures illustrate relative doping concentrations by indicating &#x201c;&#x2212;&#x201d; or &#x201c;+&#x201d; next to the doping type &#x201c;n&#x201d; or &#x201c;p&#x201d;. For example, &#x201c;n&#x2212;&#x201d; means a doping concentration that is lower than the doping concentration of an &#x201c;n&#x201d;-doping region while an &#x201c;n+&#x201d;-doping region has a higher doping concentration than an &#x201c;n&#x201d;-doping region. Doping regions of the same relative doping concentration do not necessarily have the same absolute doping concentration.

Alternatively, the semiconductor devices can be formed with opposite doping relations so that the illustrated p-doped regions are n-doped and the illustrated n-doped regions are p-doped.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The terms &#x201c;wafer&#x201d;, &#x201c;substrate&#x201d;, &#x201c;semiconductor body&#x201d; or &#x201c;semiconductor substrate&#x201d; used in the following description may include any semiconductor-based structure that has a semiconductor surface. Wafer and structure are to be understood to include silicon (Si), silicon-on-insulator (SOI), silicon-on sapphire (SOS), doped and undoped semiconductors, epitaxial layers of silicon supported by a base semiconductor foundation, and other semiconductor structures. However, the semiconductor need not be silicon-based.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The term &#x201c;horizontal&#x201d; as used in this specification intends to describe an orientation substantially parallel to a first or main surface of a semiconductor substrate or body. This can be for instance the surface of a wafer or a semiconductor die.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The term &#x201c;vertical&#x201d; as used in this specification intends to describe an orientation which is substantially arranged perpendicular to the first surface, i.e. parallel to the normal direction of the first surface of the semiconductor substrate or body.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In this specification, a second surface of a semiconductor substrate or semiconductor body is considered to be formed by the lower or backside or rear surface while the first surface is considered to be formed by the upper, front or main surface of the semiconductor substrate.

Because parts of embodiments can be positioned in a number of different orientations, the directional terminology is used for purposes of illustration and is in no way limiting. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural or logical changes may be made without departing from the scope defined by the claims. The following detailed description, therefore, is not to be taken in a limiting sense.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The semiconductor device may have terminal contacts such as contact pads (or electrodes) which allow electrical contact to be made with the integrated circuit or discrete semiconductor device included in the semiconductor body. The electrodes may include one or more electrode metal layers which are applied to the semiconductor material of the semiconductor chips. The electrode metal layers may be manufactured with any desired geometric shape and any desired material composition. The electrode metal layers may, for example, be in the form of a layer covering an area. Any desired metal, for example Cu, Ni, Sn, Au, Ag, Pt, Pd, Al, W, Ti and an alloy of one or more of these metals may be used as the material. The electrode metal layer(s) need not be homogenous or manufactured from just one material, that is to say various compositions and concentrations of the materials contained in the electrode metal layer(s) are possible. As an example, the electrode layers may be dimensioned large enough to be bonded with a wire.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In embodiments disclosed herein one or more conductive layers, in particular electrically conductive layers, are applied. It should be appreciated that any such terms as &#x201c;formed&#x201d; or &#x201c;applied&#x201d; are meant to cover literally all kinds and techniques of applying layers. In particular, they are meant to cover techniques in which layers are applied at once as a whole like, for example, laminating techniques as well as techniques in which layers are deposited in a sequential manner like, for example, sputtering, plating, molding, Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD), physical vapor deposition (PVD), evaporation, hybrid physical-chemical vapor deposition (HPCVD), etc.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Embodiments relate to sensors and sensor systems, and to obtaining information about sensors and sensor systems. A sensor may refer to a component which converts a physical quantity to be measured to an electric signal, for example, a current signal or a voltage signal. The physical quantity may for example comprise a magnetic field, an electric field, a pressure, a force, a current or a voltage, but is not limited thereto. A sensor device, as described herein, may be an angle sensor, a linear position sensor, a speed sensor, motion sensor, and the like.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">A magnetic field sensor, for example, includes one or more magnetic field sensor elements that measure one or more characteristics of a magnetic field (e.g., an amount of magnetic field flux density, a field strength, a field angle, a field direction, a field orientation, etc.). The magnetic field may be produced by a magnet, a current-carrying conductor (e.g., a wire), the Earth, or other magnetic field source. Each magnetic field sensor element is configured to generate a sensor signal (e.g., a voltage signal) in response to one or more magnetic fields impinging on the sensor element. Thus, a sensor signal is indicative of the magnitude and/or the orientation of the magnetic field impinging on the sensor element.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">It will be appreciated that the terms &#x201c;sensor&#x201d; and &#x201c;sensing element&#x201d; may be used interchangeably throughout this description, and the terms &#x201c;sensor signal&#x201d; and &#x201c;measurement signal&#x201d; may be used interchangeably throughout this description.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Magnetic sensors include Hall-effect sensors (Hall sensors), for example. A Hall effect sensor is a transducer that varies its output voltage (Hall voltage) in response to a magnetic field. It is based on the Hall effect which makes use of the Lorentz force. The Lorentz force deflects moving charges in the presence of a magnetic field which is perpendicular to the current flow through the sensor or Hall plate. Thereby, a Hall plate can be a thin piece of semiconductor or metal. The deflection causes a charge separation which causes a Hall electrical field. This electrical field acts on the charge in the opposite direction with regard to the Lorentz Force. Both forces balance each other and create a potential difference perpendicular to the direction of current flow. The potential difference can be measured as a Hall voltage and varies in a linear relationship with the magnetic field for small values. Hall effect sensors can be used for proximity switching, positioning, speed detection, and current sensing applications.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some examples, Hall sensor elements may be implemented as vertical Hall sensor elements. A vertical Hall sensor is a magnetic field sensor which is sensitive to a magnetic field component which extends parallel to their surface. This means they are sensitive to magnetic fields parallel, or in-plane, to the integrated circuit (IC) surface (i.e., the main surface of the chip substrate). The plane of sensitivity may be referred to herein as a &#x201c;sensitivity-axis&#x201d; or &#x201c;sensing axis&#x201d; and each sensing axis has a reference direction. For Hall sensor elements, voltage values output by the sensor elements change according to the magnetic field strength in the direction of the sensing axis.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Some Hall sensor elements may also be implemented as lateral Hall sensor elements. A lateral Hall sensor is sensitive to a magnetic field component perpendicular to their surface. This means they are sensitive to magnetic fields vertical, or out-of-plane, to the IC surface. The plane of sensitivity may be referred to herein as a &#x201c;sensitivity-axis&#x201d; or &#x201c;sensing axis&#x201d; and each sensing axis has a reference direction. For Hall sensor elements, voltage values output by the sensor elements change according to the magnetic field strength in the direction of the sensing axis.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">According to one or more embodiments, a magnetic field sensor and a sensor circuit may be both accommodated (i.e., integrated) in the same chip package (e.g., a plastic encapsulated package, such as leaded package or leadless package, or a surface mounted device (SMD)-package). This chip package may also be referred to as sensor package.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The sensor circuit may be referred to as a signal processing circuit and/or a signal conditioning circuit that receives one or more signals (i.e., sensor signals) from one or more magnetic field sensor elements in the form of raw measurement data and derives, from the sensor signal, a measurement signal that represents the magnetic field.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Signal conditioning, as used herein, refers to manipulating an analog signal in such a way that the signal meets the requirements of a next stage for further processing. Signal conditioning may include converting from analog to digital (e.g., via an analog-to-digital converter), amplification, filtering, converting, biasing, range matching, isolation, and/or any other processes required to make a sensor output suitable for processing after conditioning.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">For example, signal conditioning may further include signal calibration and cross-talk compensation. Signal calibration and cross-talk compensation may be performed by a processing circuit that executes computer code, which when executed by the processing circuit causes the processing circuit to perform at least part of the signal calibration and cross-talk compensation. Furthermore, signal calibration and cross-talk compensation may be performed in the digital domain of a mixed-signal circuit. Furthermore, signal calibration and cross-talk compensation may be performed by analog circuitry, or by a processing circuit that implements operations equivalent to the aforementioned hardware by way of executing computer code stored on a non-transitory computer readable storage medium.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Thus, the sensor circuit may include analog circuity and/or digital circuitry including an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) that converts the analog signal from the one or more sensor elements to a digital signal. The sensor circuit may include a digital signal processor (DSP) that performs some processing on the digital signal. Therefore, the sensor package may include a circuit that conditions and amplifies the small signal of the magnetic field sensor element via signal processing and/or conditioning.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">A sensor device, as used herein, may refer to a device which includes a sensor and sensor circuit as described above. A sensor device may be integrated on a single semiconductor die (e.g., silicon die or chip), although, in other embodiments, a plurality of dies may be used for implementing a sensor device. Thus, one or more sensors and the sensor circuit are disposed on either the same semiconductor die or on multiple dies in the same package. For example, a sensor might be on one die and the sensor circuit may be on another die such that the two dies are electrically connected to each other within the package. In this case, the dies may be comprised of the same or different semiconductor materials, such as GaAs and Si, or the sensor might be sputtered to a ceramic or glass platelet, which is not a semiconductor.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Embodiments relate to electronic devices, referred to as asymmetry detectors, that are manufactured together with one or more vertical Hall-devices (e.g., in a same manufacturing step, such as a doping step), and which provide electrically measurable quantities that are indicative of the degree of asymmetry in a Hall effect device. Specifically, an asymmetry detector is configured to detect an asymmetric characteristic of a vertical Hall sensor element, the asymmetric characteristic being a tilt of current flow lines in the vertical Hall sensor element (with or without a magnetic field present). The tilt is zero when the current flow lines are orthogonal to a main surface (i.e., upper surface) of a semiconductor substrate.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">One or more embodiments relate to operating these so-called asymmetry detectors. Furthermore, one or more embodiments relate to reducing magnetic cross-talk in a sensing system that includes at least one Hall effect device and at least one asymmetry detector via magnetic cross-talk compensation applied to a sensor signal to generate at least one compensated measurement signal.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> illustrates a perspective view of a Hall effect device <b>100</b> according to one or more embodiments. Furthermore, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrates a cross-section view of the Hall effect device <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The Hall effect device <b>100</b> includes a semiconductor substrate <b>1</b> having a first conductivity type (e.g., p-doping) and includes a first (frontside) surface <b>2</b> and a second (backside) surface <b>3</b>. The semiconductor substrate <b>1</b> may be referred to as a common substrate that is common to one or more Hall sensors. Hall effect device <b>100</b> further includes a vertical Hall sensor element <b>10</b> that comprises a plurality of ohmic contacts S<b>1</b>-S<b>5</b>, hereinafter referred to as sensor contacts. In particular, the vertical Hall sensor element <b>10</b> includes a doped well region <b>11</b> (i.e., a sensor main region) having a second conductivity type with a low or a moderate doping concentration that vertically extends from the first surface <b>2</b> into the substrate <b>1</b> towards the second surface <b>3</b>, although not complete to the second surface <b>3</b>. Thus, the doped well region <b>11</b> and the substrate <b>1</b> may share a common first surface <b>2</b>. The doped well region <b>11</b> includes a Hall effect region <b>12</b> and may further include a buried layer <b>13</b>. Like Hall effect region <b>12</b>, the buried layer <b>13</b> is of the second conductivity type, but has a moderate or high doping, and typically has a higher doping concentration than the Hall effect region <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some embodiments, a p-doped cap layer (not illustrated) may be provided above the Hall effect region <b>12</b> to reduce noise. In this case, the top of the p-doped cap is flush with the top surface of the substrate <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In an alternative arrangement, the substrate <b>1</b> may have the same conductivity type as the doped well region <b>11</b>. For example, the substrate <b>1</b> may have an n-doping. In this case, p-tubs having a p-doping between the Hall devices and the substrate maybe used to isolate Hall devices from each other, or a trench isolation with non-conducting isolating layers, such as nitrides, may be used to isolate the Hall devices from each other.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The sensor contacts S<b>1</b>-S<b>5</b> are discrete, highly doped regions (e.g., n+doped regions) that are arranged at the first surface <b>2</b>. In particular, these are shallow n+S/D-tubs (highly n-doped source-drain tubs). In one example, the contacts may be about 200 nm to 1.2 um deep, whereas the substrate <b>1</b> may be about 750 um thick. In another example, the contacts may be disposed onto the first surface <b>2</b> without extending into the substrate <b>1</b>. The contacts are ohmic contacts&#x2014;in contrast to Schottky contacts or other types. As used herein, the term &#x201c;ohmic contact&#x201d; means that current changes its direction but not its magnitude when voltage across the contact is reversed.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In this example, the sensor contacts S<b>1</b>-S<b>5</b> extend from the first surface <b>2</b> partially into the doped well region <b>11</b>, and have a higher doping concentration than the surrounding doped well region <b>11</b>. In addition, the sensor contacts S<b>1</b>-S<b>5</b> are linearly arranged with respect to each other in a direction that is orthogonal to the main sensitive direction (i.e., the sensing axis) of the sensor element <b>10</b>. In this example, the sensor contacts S<b>1</b>-S<b>5</b> are linearly arranged in the x-direction, in-plane to the first surface <b>2</b> of the substrate <b>1</b>. While the sensor contacts have an elongated shape that extends in the y-direction, the shape thereof is not limited to a particular shape. For example, square sensor contacts may be used. Thus, the main sensitive direction is aligned with the y-axis, in-plane to the first surface <b>2</b>, and the sensor element <b>10</b> is sensitive to By magnetic fields. Accordingly, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the main sensitive direction is perpendicular to the figure plane, the cross-sensitive directions are parallel to the figure plane.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Each sensor contact S<b>1</b>-S<b>5</b> is electrically coupled to a respective terminal T<b>1</b>-T<b>4</b>. In this example, sensor contacts S<b>1</b> and S<b>5</b> are shorted together. A current is applied to the outer contacts (i.e., S<b>1</b> and S<b>5</b>) and the middle contact (i.e., S<b>3</b>), resulting in charge carrier flow. For example, the current may be injected into sensor contact S<b>3</b> and extracted from sensor contacts S<b>1</b> and S<b>5</b>. The magnetic field By induces a force on the charge carrier flow, leading to a Hall voltage, which can be measured at the contacts in between (i.e., at sensor contacts S<b>2</b> and S<b>4</b>). Thus, terminals T<b>2</b> and T<b>4</b> are used to read out the Hall voltage as a sensor signal.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Metal contacts M<b>1</b>-M<b>5</b> or conductive plugs may each be disposed on the first surface <b>3</b> and arranged in contact with a respective sensor contact S<b>1</b>-<b>55</b> to provide an electrical contact to a respective terminal T<b>1</b>-T<b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Ideally, the sensor contacts S<b>1</b>-<b>55</b> are symmetrically arranged in the doped well region <b>11</b> according to its sensitive direction. In this example, the sensitive direction is assumed to be the y-direction and the cross-sensitive direction is assumed to be in the z-direction. Thus, the sensor contacts S<b>1</b>-<b>55</b> should be centered in the doped well region <b>11</b> with respect to the y-direction so that the short-sides of the sensor contacts, oppositely situated from each other, are equally spaced from the long edges of the doped well region <b>11</b>. For symmetric sensor contacts S<b>1</b>-S<b>5</b>, the current streamlines are mirrored symmetrically to the center symmetry plane of the doped well region <b>11</b> that is parallel to the long edge of the device (note there are two center symmetry planes). If the sensor contacts S<b>1</b>-S<b>5</b> shift in y-direction, this mirror symmetry is lost and the current streamlines will tend to flow from the asymmetric contact towards the center of the doped well region <b>11</b> in the depth and dive up again towards the other ill-centered contact. Thus, any asymmetrical shift in the x- or y-direction results in a tilted current plane, that is also sensitive to magnetic fields applied in z-direction.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Cross-sensitivity is the additionally measured signal of a magnetic field when the field is applied perpendicular to the intended sensitivity direction of a sensor. Therefore, two cross-sensitive directions for a vertical Hall element should be considered.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">An error of mask alignment affects the fabrication of integrated Hall sensors with one main consequence: the position of the contact regions in relation to the position of the doped well region <b>11</b> varies. Because of the uncertainty regarding the exact position of the sensor contacts S<b>1</b>-S<b>5</b> on the top of the doped well region <b>11</b>, one or more asymmetry detectors may be used to detect the exact position of the sensor contacts S<b>1</b>-S<b>5</b> and compensate the sensor signal based on the detected position. In particular, asymmetries in sensor contact positions can be compensated and the sensor signal corrected.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">By combining one lateral Hall element (for measuring the magnetic field in the z-direction) and two vertical Hall elements (for x and y), a genuine 3-D Hall sensor can be fabricated.

In particular, asymmetry detector <b>200</b><i>x </i>is configured to detect an x-displacement of a contact-mask against a main tub-mask, where the main-tub mask is used for implanting a doped well region <b>20</b> (i.e., a detector main region) into the substrate <b>1</b> and the contact-mask is used for the implanting contacts into the doped well region <b>20</b>. Additionally, the main tub-mask is used to implant the doped well region <b>11</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> into the substrate <b>1</b>, and the contact-mask is used for implanting the sensor contacts S<b>1</b>-S<b>5</b> into the doped well region <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Thus, the doped well regions <b>11</b> and <b>20</b> are formed in the same processing step.

Each contact C<b>1</b>-C<b>4</b> has an elongated shape in the y-direction and is used to detect a shift in the x-direction. While the detector contacts have an elongated shape that extends in the y-direction, the shape thereof is not limited to a particular shape. For example, square detector contacts may be used. The x-direction corresponds to the sensing direction of a sensor element that is to be compensated by the asymmetry detector <b>200</b><i>x. </i>In other words, the asymmetry detector <b>200</b><i>x </i>is used in combination with an X-sensor to compensate an x-sensor signal.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The detector contacts C<b>1</b>-C<b>4</b> are highly doped regions and are connected to wires or interconnect layers of metal or low poly-silicon (e.g., silicide) with tungsten plugs.

In this example, each contact C<b>1</b>-C<b>4</b> is misaligned. For example, if all detector contacts C<b>1</b>-C<b>4</b> are moved to the left, detector contacts C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b> approach the left perimeter of the doped well region <b>20</b>, whereas C<b>3</b>, C<b>4</b> move away from the right perimeter of the doped well region <b>20</b>. Ideally, all detector contacts C<b>1</b>-C<b>4</b> are equally spaced from the perimeter or boundary of the doped well region <b>20</b>. Otherwise, a misalignment is present.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">This misalignment can be detected by measuring the resistances R12 and R34 between detector contacts C<b>1</b>-C<b>2</b> and C<b>3</b>-C<b>4</b>, respectively. Since detector contacts C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b> are closer to the perimeter than contacts C<b>3</b>, C<b>4</b>, movement for the charge carriers is more restrictive between the perimeter and detector contacts C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b> than between the perimeter and contacts C<b>3</b>, C<b>4</b>. This results in a higher resistance between detector contacts C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b> than between C<b>3</b>, C<b>4</b>. As a result, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, it holds: R12&#x3e;R34 because detector contacts C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b> are closer to the perimeter than contacts C<b>3</b>, C<b>4</b>, where R12 is the resistance between detector contacts C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b>, and R34 is the resistance between contacts C<b>3</b> and C<b>4</b>. In the event that the detector contacts C<b>1</b>-C<b>4</b> were instead shifted in the positive x-direction, it would hold that R34&#x3e;R12.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The measured resistances can thus be used to detect a displacement of the contacts in the x-direction. In particular, a misalignment in the x-direction is proportional to a ratio RAT of the resistances R12/R34. In other words, the ratio RAT (i.e., R12/R34) represents a measured cross-sensitivity caused by the misalignment. Thus, the ratio RAT (i.e., R12/R34) can be used to detect x-misalignment and to compensate the x-sensor signal. Furthermore, the ratio RAT is not affected by y-misalignment. In one or more examples, this ratio RAT may be referred to as RAT1. RAT1 is the ratio RAT of an asymmetry detector dedicated for a vertical Hall sensor element H<b>1</b> (i.e., for an X-sensor element).</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The spacing between detector contacts C<b>1</b>-C<b>4</b> and the upper and lower boundaries of the tub should be larger than the spacing between contacts and the left and right boundaries of the doped well region <b>11</b>. This ensures that the asymmetry detector <b>200</b><i>x </i>detects x-displacements, and not y-displacements. Also, the size of the detector contacts C<b>1</b>-C<b>4</b> in y-direction may be larger than in x-direction to make the device responding mainly to x- instead of y-displacements of the detector contacts C<b>1</b>-C<b>4</b> with respect to the doped well region <b>20</b>. Also, the spacing between upper detector contacts C<b>1</b>, C<b>4</b> and the spacing between lower contacts C<b>2</b>, C<b>3</b> should not be too small, so that mismatch of distances C<b>1</b>-C<b>2</b> and C<b>3</b>-C<b>4</b> does not corrupt the measurement. The spacing of each contact from its nearest edge of the tub (i.e., from the edge of the doped well region <b>20</b>) should be substantially equal to the largest expected shift.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In the case that the detector contacts C<b>1</b>-C<b>4</b> have a square shape, as opposed to an elongated shape, the ratio R12/R34 would respond to x-displacement. However, the ratio R14/R24 would respond to y-displacement and may thus also be measured to compensate for a y-displacement. Thus, with an asymmetry detector similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> but having 90&#xb0; symmetry of its well and its contacts, a compensation system may measure both x- and y-shifts in the sensor/detector contacts.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">It is to be noted that the asymmetry detector <b>200</b><i>x </i>and its operation (i.e., the measurement of resistances R12 and R34) is not affected by moderate magnetic fields nor by mechanical stress. In other words, the ratio R12/R34 does not depend on the magnetic field, the mechanicals stress, the temperature, or the doping concentration because such effects would appear as common factors in R12 and R34 and therefore they cancel out the ratio R12/R34.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">For good matching with the Hall devices, the size of the detector contacts C<b>1</b>-C<b>4</b> should be similar to the size of the sensor contacts S<b>1</b>-S<b>5</b> of the sensor element <b>10</b>, whose asymmetry is to be detected. Also the doped well region <b>20</b> should have similar size as the doped well region <b>11</b> of the respective sensor element <b>10</b>. Both rules help to establish a good correlation between the asymmetry detector and sensor element (i.e., the Hall device) when the root cause of asymmetries is oblique implantation angle or out-diffusion.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">As for the operation of the asymmetry detector <b>200</b><i>x, </i>there are numerous ways to measure the resistance of a resistive device. One method is to pass a known current through the asymmetry detector <b>200</b><i>x </i>and measure the potential drop. It is good practice to use Kelvin contacts for the force/sense contacts to avoid measurement errors. This is all the more important, if the device is not hard-wired to a voltmeter circuit and a current generator, but connected via switches (such as MOS transistors), which have significant Rds-on resistance.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The ratio of resistances may be measured directly without measuring the resistances individually. For example, if both resistances are connected in series and considered to be a left side of a Wheatstone bridge, and ordinary identical resistors are used as a right side of the bridge, then the bridge output may be measured by supplying the bridge with a voltage and measuring the bridge output.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the asymmetry detector <b>300</b><i>y </i>includes three ohmic detector contacts C<b>5</b>-C<b>7</b> (i.e., detector contacts) arranged in the Hall effect region of a doped well region <b>30</b> (i.e., a detector main region) in a similar manner described with respect to sensor contacts S<b>1</b>-S<b>5</b>.
