By way of example, in a manufacturing plant for semiconductor wafers or liquid crystal substrates, the highly sensitive semiconductor elements or liquid crystal elements pass sequentially through a plurality of process vacuum chambers, in which the parts located within the process vacuum chambers are machined by means of a respective machining device. Both while being machined within the process vacuum chambers and while being transported from chamber to chamber, the highly sensitive semiconductor elements or substrates must always be in a protected atmosphere, in particular in an airless environment.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">To this end, on the one hand peripheral valves are used to open and close a gas inlet or gas outlet, and on the other hand transfer valves are used to open and close the transfer openings of the vacuum chambers for inserting and removing the parts.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The vacuum valves through which semiconductor parts pass are referred to as vacuum transfer valves on account of the described field of application and the associated dimensioning, as rectangular valves on account of their mainly rectangular opening cross-section, and also as slide valves, rectangular sliders or transfer slide valves on account of their usual mode of operation.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In contrast, peripheral valves are used in particular to control or regulate the gas flow between a vacuum chamber and a vacuum pump or another vacuum chamber. Peripheral valves are located for example within a pipe system between a process vacuum chamber or a transfer chamber and a vacuum pump, the atmosphere or another process vacuum chamber. The opening cross-section of such valves, also known as pump valves, is generally smaller than in the case of a vacuum transfer valve. Peripheral valves are also referred to as regulating valves since, depending on the field of use, they are used not only to fully open and close an opening, but also to control or regulate a flow by continuously adjusting the opening cross-section between a fully open position and a gas-tight closed position. One possible peripheral valve for controlling or regulating the gas flow is the pendulum valve.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a typical pendulum valve, as known for example from U.S. Pat. No. 6,089,537 (Olmsted), in a first step a valve plate, which is usually round, is rotated over an opening, which is likewise usually round, from a position that exposes the opening to an intermediate position that covers the opening. In the case of a slide valve, as described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 6,416,037 (Geiser) or U.S. Pat. No. 6,056,266 (Blecha), the valve plate is usually rectangular, as is the opening, and in this first step is slid linearly from a position that exposes the opening into an intermediate position that covers the opening. In this intermediate position, the valve plate of the pendulum valve or slide valve is located opposite and at a distance from the valve seat surrounding the opening. In a second step, the distance between the valve plate and the valve seat is reduced, so that the valve plate and the valve seat are pressed evenly against each other and the opening is closed in a substantially gas-tight manner. This second movement preferably takes place substantially in a direction perpendicular to the valve seat. The sealing may for example take place either via a sealing ring, which is arranged on the closure side of the valve plate and is pressed onto the valve seat extending around the opening, or via a sealing ring on the valve seat, against which the closure side of the valve plate is pressed. Because the closing process takes place in two steps, the sealing ring between the valve plate and the valve seat is subjected to barely any shear forces that would destroy the sealing ring, since the movement of the valve plate in the second step takes place substantially linearly perpendicular to the valve seat.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Various sealing devices are known from the prior art, for example from U.S. Pat. No. 6,629,682 B2 (Duelli). One suitable material for sealing rings and seals in vacuum valves is, for example, fluoro-rubber, also known as FKM, in particular the fluoro-elastomer known under the trade name &#x201c;Viton&#x201d;, as well as perfluoro-rubber, FFKM for short.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The described multi-stage movement, whereby the closure member is first slid transversely over the opening without the seal coming into contact with the valve seat, and then the closure member is pressed substantially perpendicularly onto the valve seat, not only offers the advantage that the seal is compressed almost exclusively perpendicularly, without there being any transverse or longitudinal load on the seal (avoiding particles), but also the possibility of regulating the flow of a medium (for example process gas) through the valve opening.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Since the valves mentioned above are used, inter alia, in the manufacture of highly sensitive semiconductor elements, it is necessary, as already mentioned, to keep as low as possible any particle generation, which is caused in particular by the actuation of the valve and by the mechanical load on the valve closure member, and the number of free particles in the valve space. Particle generation is primarily a consequence of friction, for example due to metal-metal contact or due to abrasion.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">As described above, vacuum regulating valves are used to set a defined process environment in a process chamber. Here, the regulation typically takes place on the basis of a pressure signal, which provides information about the chamber internal pressure, and on the basis of a target variable, i.e. a setpoint pressure that is to be reached by means of the regulation. In the course of the regulation, the position of a valve closure (valve plate) is then varied such that the setpoint pressure is reached within a certain period of time.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">A time required for the regulation depends directly on the size of the volume of the process chamber to be evacuated. A comparatively large chamber can therefore be disadvantageous, particularly when machining small substrates, i.e. a large dead volume should accordingly be avoided.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">One feature that the above embodiments have in common is that, particularly during a regulation, a regulation curve (volume flow over unit of time) resulting from one of these constructions typically occurs with a disadvantageous curve shape. Specifically, the curve exhibits a clearly inhomogeneous curve shape at the transition from an almost closed valve state to a fully closed valve state due to a &#x201c;snap-shut effect&#x201d; that occurs. A flow through the opening is in this case abruptly interrupted. Fine regulation at very low pressures can therefore be achieved only with great difficulty or is impossible.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Another critical factor in connection with semiconductor manufacture is the use and handling of process gas required for individual machining steps. The regulating valve in this case typically also performs the function of providing a defined gas concentration, i.e. regulating it by means of a variable gas outflow through the valve. The process gas is usually fed in on a side of the process chamber opposite the evacuation opening.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Besides the gas concentration and the atmospheric pressure, a distribution of the process gas that is as homogeneous as possible at least in the region of the substrate to be machined is advantageous. A most symmetrical possible flow of gas through the process chamber, i.e. both when feeding in gas and when evacuating, can be helpful for this.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">U.S. Pat. No. 6,994,311 B2 discloses a vacuum regulating valve with the aim of establishing a symmetrical flow through an opening in an open valve position. The valve plate is suspended centrally on a guide (valve rod) and can be guided axially, so that a volume flow through the opening can be set as a function of the distance between the valve plate and the valve seat. However, one disadvantage of this solution is that, in order to provide the guide for the valve plate, a mechanical connection must be present in the centre of the valve opening. This mechanical connection eliminates the symmetry of the flow at least in parts and leads to turbulence at the connection elements.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The object of the invention is therefore to provide a vacuum regulating valve and vacuum machining system which, on the one hand, precisely regulates or sets the valve opening and thus a flow through the opening and, on the other hand, provides a homogeneous fluid distribution in a process chamber.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In particular, one object of the invention is to provide the above improvements while achieving comparatively short movement times of the valve closure.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">A further object is to provide a machining system which precisely regulates a fluid flow and provides a comparatively small process volume.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">These objects are achieved by implementing the features of the independent claims. Features that further develop the invention in an alternative or advantageous manner are to be found in the dependent claims.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The invention relates to a design of a vacuum machining system which comprises at least one vacuum chamber or process chamber and a vacuum valve, in particular a vacuum regulating valve. The vacuum valve provides for an improved flow of process fluid through and out of a process volume with regard to the homogeneity of the flow behaviour. At the same time, a movement time for changing from an open state to a closed state (or vice versa) can be significantly improved, i.e. reduced. By virtue of the design according to the invention, the vacuum chamber is divided into a main chamber and into a secondary chamber by means of the valve, the valve being arranged within the vacuum chamber.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The aforementioned advantages and improvements are in particular provided by dividing a single valve opening, as known to date in the prior art, into a plurality of valve sub-openings of the vacuum valve. The sub-openings are preferably arranged symmetrically around a central valve axis. Each valve sub-opening is provided by a respective valve seat and is surrounded by a respective sealing surface. The sum of the areas of the plurality of valve sub-openings yields the area of the total valve opening.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The total valve opening cross-section results from the sum of the opening cross-sections of the plurality of valve sub-openings, wherein the opening cross-section depends on the respective open state of the valve sub-openings, i.e. on the flow area exposed by the respective valve closure.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The valve seats form in particular a lower boundary of the main process chamber and an upper boundary of the secondary process chamber. A seal for establishing a gas-tight closure of the main process chamber is preferably provided on the underside of the valve seats, that is to say not in the main process chamber but rather in the secondary process chamber. The valve plates for closing the openings are accordingly located in the secondary process chamber and can be moved in this chamber along a movement axis. As an alternative or in addition, the seal may be provided on the valve plates.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Since the valve plates together with the drive components are arranged in or on the secondary process chamber, a fluid flow in or through the main chamber is not influenced by the valve. As a result, an improved symmetrical (through-)flow and thus an improved substrate machining can take place in the main process chamber.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The valve seats are preferably arranged around the central chuck in such a way that fluid can flow around the chuck with a homogeneous flow distribution.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The invention thus relates to a vacuum machining system for machining, in particular by means of deposition (ALD, atomic layer deposition/epitaxy) or etching (ALE, atomic layer etching), a substrate or workpiece, in particular a semiconductor.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The vacuum machining system comprises a vacuum chamber which defines an evacuable internal volume for generating a vacuum and for machining a substrate in the internal volume. The vacuum machining system additionally comprises a vacuum regulating valve for regulating a volume flow or mass flow of a fluid flowing through the vacuum chamber and for interrupting a flow path of the fluid in a gas-tight manner.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The vacuum regulating valve has at least a first valve seat, which has a first valve opening defining a first opening axis and a first sealing surface extending around the first valve opening, and at least a first valve plate with a first contact surface corresponding to the first sealing surface.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The vacuum machining system comprises at least one drive unit, which is designed in such a way and is coupled to the first valve plate in such a way that said valve plate can be moved at least from an open position to a closed position and back again (for example in a motorized manner). In the open position, the first valve plate and the first valve seat are not in contact with each other. In the closed position, sealing contact between the first sealing surface and the first contact surface exists via a sealing element located therebetween, the first valve opening thereby being closed in a gas-tight manner.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">According to the invention, the first valve seat is arranged within the vacuum chamber and divides the vacuum chamber into a main process chamber for machining the substrate and into a secondary process chamber. The first sealing surface extends orthogonally to the first opening axis and points in the direction of the secondary process chamber, in particular parallel to the first opening axis. The first valve plate is movably arranged in the secondary process chamber.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In one embodiment, the vacuum regulating valve may have a second valve seat, which has a second valve opening defining a second opening axis and a second sealing surface extending around the second valve opening, and a second valve plate with a second contact surface corresponding to the second sealing surface. The second valve seat may be arranged within the vacuum chamber and, together with the first valve seat, may divide the vacuum chamber into the main process chamber and the secondary process chamber. The second sealing surface extends orthogonally to the second opening axis and points in the direction of the secondary process chamber, in particular parallel to the second opening axis. The second valve plate may be movably arranged in the secondary process chamber.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">As a result, a total valve opening of the vacuum regulating valve may be formed at least by the first valve opening as a first valve sub-opening and the second valve opening as a second valve sub-opening.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Providing at least two groups, each comprising at least one valve seat and one valve closure (valve plate), permits a symmetrical arrangement around a centre of the vacuum valve. Consequently, on the one hand a symmetrical volume flow through the valve can be provided, and on the other hand comparatively quick actuation (i.e. quick movement of the valve closures due to the comparatively low individual masses of the valve closures) can be provided, with the possibility of very flexible regulation of the volume flow, i.e. also reaching a comparatively large total opening cross-section from a closed position (and vice versa) within a short time.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In one embodiment, the vacuum regulation valve may have a third valve seat, which has a third valve opening defining a third opening axis and a third sealing surface extending around the third valve opening. A third valve plate with a third contact surface corresponding to the third sealing surface may accordingly be provided.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The third valve seat may be arranged within the vacuum chamber and, together with the first and second valve seat, may divide the vacuum chamber into the main process chamber and the secondary process chamber. The third sealing surface may extend orthogonally to the third opening axis and may point in the direction of the secondary process chamber, in particular parallel to the third opening axis. The third valve plate may be movably arranged in the secondary process chamber.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In this case, the total valve opening may additionally be formed by the third valve opening as a third valve sub-opening.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">By arranging a third combination or further combinations of valve seat and valve plate, the symmetry of the total valve opening around a central axis of the valve can be maintained or enhanced, and thus the symmetry of the volume flow (concentrically) through the valve can be further improved.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In particular, the drive unit may be coupled to the second and third valve plate in such a way that the coupled valve plates can be moved at least from a respective open position, in which the respective valve plate and the respective valve seat are not in contact with each other, to a closed position, in which axially sealing contact between the respective sealing surface and the respective contact surface exists via a respective sealing element located therebetween and the respective valve sub-opening is thereby closed in a gas-tight manner, and back again.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The drive unit may be designed, for example, as an actuator or electric motor, in particular a linear motor or stepper motor.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In one embodiment, the vacuum regulating valve may have a coupling arrangement, which coupling arrangement mechanically couples the first valve plate to the second valve plate, and in particular to the third valve plate, in such a way and is connected to the drive unit in such a way that the respective valve plates can be jointly moved by means of the drive unit. The coupling arrangement may be implemented, for example, using a shaft, joints (for example universal joints), bearings and/or transmissions.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Thus, by means of a mechanical solution for example, some or all coupled valve plates can be moved simultaneously. In particular, a homogeneous and symmetrical fluid flow through the valve can thus be achieved in that an equal opening cross-section is provided for all the openings right from when the valve sub-opening is first opened, and the flow through all the openings is equal with regard to the volume flow or mass flow and then remains equal.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">According to a further embodiment, the drive unit may have at least a first and a second, in particular a third, drive component, in particular respective motors. The first drive component may be coupled to the first valve plate and the second drive component may be coupled to the second valve plate, and in particular the third drive component may be coupled to the third valve plate.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In contrast to the preceding embodiment, in this variant each of the valve plates can be actuated and moved individually. This permits greater flexibility with regard to setting the flow behaviour through the valve and in particular through the main process chamber. For example, it is thus possible to compensate for asymmetries of the volume flow caused by machining devices present in the process chamber or caused by an asymmetrical arrangement of fluid inlets. Such compensation can be achieved by providing different opening cross-sections for the individual valve sub-openings.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In particular, the flow behaviour within the chamber can be set in such a way that it is possible to compensate for an asymmetric flow caused for example by a device in the chamber for machining a substrate. The flow would accordingly take place in an inhomogeneous manner through the process chamber if using a conventional valve. Because the outflow behaviour can be set by means of the valve according to the invention, the outflow of fluid can counteract the asymmetrical flow through the chamber and thus ultimately result in a flow through the chamber that is symmetrical overall. The flow through the valve may in this case accordingly take place in an asymmetrical manner (non-centric, i.e. asymmetrical in relation to a central axis). By way of example, there may be different flow velocities on different (for example opposite) sides of the valve.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In one embodiment, the drive unit, in particular the respective drive components, and at least the first valve plate (or also the second, the third or more valve plates) may be designed and coupled in such a way that at least the first of the valve plates can be moved along a first movement axis, and the first movement axis extends transversely relative to the first opening axis. It will be understood that the number of valve plates preferably corresponds to the number of valve seats, i.e. a valve may have a plurality of (more than three) valve seats and a corresponding number of valve plates.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">According to one embodiment, the main process chamber may enclose a main internal volume and the secondary process chamber may enclose a secondary internal volume, the main internal volume being larger than the secondary internal volume.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In one embodiment, the vacuum machining system may have an electrostatic holding device, in particular a chuck, arranged in the main process chamber.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The vacuum regulating valve may in particular have at least the first valve seat and at least two further valve seats, and the valve seats may define a first valve opening and at least two further valve openings.

Such regulation may typically be used, for example, when using process gas and thus having to set a setpoint pressure. By thus creating a continuous laminar flow of the medium through the openings and in particular through the main process chamber, pressure fluctuations can be avoided and a setpoint pressure can be reached more quickly.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In particular, the individual plate positions (intermediate positions) can each be set individually or sequentially in a controlled manner (by means of the control signal), and thus the volume flow or mass flow of a medium through the valve opening can in particular be continuously regulated.

Such regulation is provided in particular by a stepper motor or a servo motor of the drive unit.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The flow information may in particular comprise or provide at least one of the following items of information:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0063">a mass flow or volume flow of the fluid through the main process chamber and/or the secondary process chamber,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0064">a flow velocity of the fluid in the main process chamber and/or secondary process chamber,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0065">a flow velocity distribution with respect to an internal volume cross-section for the main process chamber and/or the secondary process chamber,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0066">a pressure difference between the main process chamber and the secondary process chamber,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0067">a fluid inflow into the main process chamber,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0068">a fluid outflow out of the secondary process chamber.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0064" num="0069">By means of the control unit, the individual valve plates can be individually positioned in such a way that a symmetrical fluid flow through the main process chamber can be provided as a function of the flow information. For example, when there is an uneven fluid distribution in one of the process chambers or when there is a spatially uneven inflow of fluid into the main process chamber, this can be achieved by setting and/or dynamically adjusting different opening cross-sections for the individual valve sub-openings. However, this can also be achieved, for example, by setting equal opening cross-sections for the valve sub-openings if the fluid distribution or the fluid inflow is homogeneous.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0070">In one embodiment, the positioning of the valve plates can be individually dynamically adjusted and thus the fluid flow through the main process chamber can be continuously regulated.

In particular, this relates to a design of the regulating valve as a vacuum valve.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0080">The process atmosphere area is to be understood in particular as an area that can be defined by a process chamber (vacuum chamber). A process atmosphere, in particular a vacuum, for machining substrates can be established in this area. Components intended for this area must satisfy enhanced requirements, for example with regard to material resistance and atmospheric purity (particle generation). The external atmosphere area can accordingly be understood in particular as an area which surrounds the process chamber and in which for example normal atmospheric conditions prevail, for example room air.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0081">The drive unit may be assigned at least in part, in particular in full, to the external atmosphere area, and the valve seat and the valve closure may in particular be assigned to the process atmosphere area.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0082">The separating device may be formed, for example, by a bellows.

At one side, the valve rod protrudes out of the drive housing into the secondary process chamber (process atmosphere area); at the other side, it is coupled to a motor, for example by means of a transmission. Here, a separating device (for example a dynamic bellows) may be provided, the first end of which is connected to the housing (or to another static element in the drive housing) in a gas-tight manner, and the second end of which is connected to the valve rod in a gas-tight manner. This results in atmospheric separation of the location at which the valve rod is mounted (external atmosphere area), where particles could be generated by the relative movements that occur and where lubricants are possibly used, from the process atmosphere area that is critical in terms of atmospheric purity, while at the same time enabling one or more valve plates to move in a controlled manner.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0084">A housing is made, for example, of aluminium or stainless steel, or is coated on the inside with aluminium or with another suitable material, while the valve plate and bellows may be made of steel. As an alternative or in addition, the bellows may comprise a nickel-based alloy or may be made of a nickel-based alloy. The bellows, which can be expanded and compressed in its longitudinal axis within the movement travel range of the plate, thus seals off the process atmosphere area from the external atmosphere area in an air-tight manner. Two types of bellows in particular are used: on the one hand a diaphragm bellows, and on the other hand a corrugated bellows, the latter being distinguished from the diaphragm bellows by the fact that it has no weld seams and can be cleaned more easily, but has a smaller maximum travel.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><p id="p-0080" num="0085">The device according to the invention will be described in greater detail below, purely by way of example, on the basis of specific exemplary embodiments which are shown schematically in the drawings.

The vacuum regulating valve <b>20</b> is designed to regulate a volume flow or mass flow of a fluid flowing through the vacuum chamber <b>10</b> and to interrupt a flow path of the fluid in a gas-tight manner. To this end, the vacuum regulating valve <b>20</b> has a valve seat <b>21</b><i>a</i>, which defines a valve opening <b>22</b><i>a </i>with an opening axis O. The valve <b>20</b> additionally has a valve plate <b>23</b><i>a</i>. The valve seat <b>21</b><i>a </i>provides a sealing surface on its underside, the valve plate <b>23</b><i>a </i>having a contact surface (plate-side sealing surface) which is designed to be brought into contact with the (seat-side) sealing surface and thus enables gas-tight closure of the valve <b>20</b>. Contact is made in particular indirectly by way of a seal provided between the seat-side sealing surface and the plate-side sealing surface. Although the structural elements valve seat and valve plate are not physically in direct contact here (i.e. only indirectly by way of the seal located therebetween), this state is to be understood as an in-contact state.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0090">The valve plate <b>23</b><i>a </i>can be moved by means of a drive unit <b>30</b> from an open position (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) to a closed position (not shown). In the closed position, sealing contact therefore exists between the sealing surface and the contact surface via a sealing element located therebetween. The valve opening <b>22</b><i>a </i>is thereby closed in a gas-tight manner.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0091">The sealing element may be a polymer-containing seal, which is arranged on the underside of the valve seat <b>21</b><i>a </i>by means of clamping, adhesive bonding or vulcanization. The seal may be designed, for example, as an O-ring. Alternatively, the sealing element may be arranged on the valve plate <b>23</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0087" num="0092">The drive unit <b>30</b> may be, for example, an electrically operated actuator or motor (for example a linear motor or stepper motor) with a linear movement axis V. The drive unit <b>30</b> may provide a travel of at least 50 mm, in particular 100 mm.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0093">The valve seat <b>21</b><i>a </i>is arranged within the vacuum chamber <b>10</b>. The vacuum chamber <b>10</b> is divided by the valve seat <b>21</b><i>a</i>, and thus by the place where gas-tight closure can take place (sealing line), into a main process chamber <b>11</b> for machining a substrate and into a secondary process chamber <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0094">A bottom opening <b>19</b> of the secondary process chamber <b>12</b> connects the vacuum chamber <b>10</b> to a downstream vacuum generator, in particular a vacuum pump, for generating the vacuum in the chamber <b>10</b>. A vacuum valve and/or a pressure sensor may also be provided as a further downstream component.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0095">The vacuum valve <b>20</b> is installed in the chamber <b>10</b> in such a way that the first sealing surface of the valve seat <b>21</b><i>a </i>extends orthogonally to the opening axis O and points in a direction towards the secondary process chamber <b>12</b>, parallel to the first opening axis O. The valve plate <b>23</b><i>a </i>is correspondingly movably arranged in the secondary process chamber <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0096">In the embodiment shown, the valve plate <b>23</b><i>a </i>is mounted on a guide element <b>24</b><i>a</i>. In particular, the mounting is such that the valve plate <b>23</b><i>a </i>is (slightly) tiltable relative to the guide element <b>24</b><i>a</i>. The drive unit <b>30</b> is coupled to the guide element <b>24</b><i>a </i>by means of a valve rod <b>31</b>, whereby the valve plate <b>23</b><i>a </i>can be moved by means of the drive unit <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0097">In another embodiment, the valve plate <b>23</b><i>a </i>may be coupled directly to the valve rod <b>31</b>. The valve plate <b>23</b><i>a </i>may in this case be tiltable relative to the valve rod within narrow limits, so that the contact surface can be brought fully into contact with the sealing surface. Such a tilting may provide a reliable closure of the opening <b>22</b><i>a</i>, particularly when the movement axis V is arranged at an angle relative to the opening axis O. An angled arrangement as shown enables in particular an advantageous use of space in such a way that the movement device (for example the valve rod) takes up a comparatively small amount of space in the vacuum chamber <b>10</b> and the drive unit <b>30</b> can be arranged in a manner that is advantageous with regard to peripheral vacuum elements. Possible downstream elements can in this case be connected to the secondary process chamber <b>12</b> without any problem, i.e. without any limitation on space caused by the drive unit <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0098">It will be understood that the valve plate may alternatively be rigidly connected to the valve rod. Also in this case, the plate may be connected to the rod in such a way that the movement axis V encloses an angle between 0&#xb0; and 90&#xb0; with a plane defined by the seat-side sealing surface, i.e. is arranged transversely thereto.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0099">The drive unit <b>30</b> may additionally have a bellows for separating the atmosphere of the internal volume of process chamber <b>10</b> (process atmosphere area) from an external atmosphere (external atmosphere area). To this end, the bellows may be connected at one side to the valve rod <b>31</b> and at the other side to the inner drive housing. As a result, atmospheric separation of the moving part of the drive unit from the internal volume of the process chamber <b>10</b> can be provided. Any ingress of particles, caused for example by abrasion, can thus be prevented. The bellows is compressed when the valve is open and is expanded or unfolded when the valve <b>20</b> is closed.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0100">The embodiment according to the invention offers the advantage that the volume of the main process chamber <b>11</b>, in which the effective machining of the substrate takes place, can be kept comparatively small and thus a desired internal pressure in the main process chamber <b>11</b> for a particular machining process can be set comparatively quickly.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0101">The secondary process chamber <b>12</b> provides an internal volume which is larger than the internal volume of the main process chamber <b>11</b> and in which an internal pressure that corresponds to or is lower than a setpoint machining pressure can be set by extracting air through the opening <b>19</b>. The secondary process chamber <b>12</b> can thus serve as a holding volume for the main process chamber <b>11</b> and can provide for quickly setting a process pressure in the main process chamber <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0102"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows, in a plan view, the vacuum regulating valve of the vacuum machining system according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The valve has a total of three valve seats <b>21</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>, which are arranged in the shape of a ring. Each valve seat <b>21</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>provides a respective valve opening <b>22</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>. In the exemplary embodiment shown, the valve openings <b>22</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>are provided with grid-like structures, which enable a homogeneous fluid flow through the respective opening. In alternative embodiments, the valve openings <b>22</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>may be designed without the structures shown or with an alternative, fluid-permeable structure.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0103">Each valve seat <b>21</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>is assigned, on the underside thereof (cf. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, not shown here), a respective valve closure <b>23</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>, as shown by way of example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> for the valve seat <b>21</b><i>a </i>and the valve closure designed as the valve plate <b>23</b><i>a</i>. The individual valve closures are each coupled to an individually controllable drive unit (depending on the number of valve plates, a corresponding number of drive components is provided).</p><p id="p-0099" num="0104">As a result, an individual opening cross-section and thus an individual throughflow can be set for each valve opening <b>22</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>. A mass flow or volume flow of a fluid can therefore be set for each valve opening individually and independently of the rest of the openings. Due to this ability to be set individually, a symmetrical fluid flow can be provided in particular through the main process chamber <b>11</b>. To this end, for example, different offsets can be set for the individual valve openings, and inhomogeneous pressure and flow distributions can thus be compensated.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0105">By providing a flow of process fluid through the process chamber that is as symmetrical and as homogeneous as possible, a substrate can accordingly be machined accurately and precisely. A symmetrical flow can ensure, for example, that a comparable or identical process gas concentration exists across the (entire) substrate surface and, for example, any deposition or etching (for example ALD or ALE process) accordingly takes place homogeneously along the surface.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0106">The valve seats <b>21</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>of the vacuum regulating valve are arranged symmetrically around an electrostatic holding device <b>15</b> (chuck). The substrate to be machined can be placed on the holding device <b>15</b> and accordingly held by means of an electrostatic charge. In other words, the chuck <b>15</b> is designed to receive a substrate and to hold it at least during a machining process.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0107">Due to this concentric arrangement of the chuck <b>15</b> and of the valve seats <b>21</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>, a symmetry and homogeneity of the fluid flow can be achieved in an optimized manner. A largely homogeneous flow around the chuck <b>15</b> can thus be achieved, while at the same time the flow rates through the individual openings <b>22</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>can be set individually. As a result, a correspondingly high degree of homogeneity with regard to the machining of the substrate can thus be provided.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0108">In addition, arranging the valve close to the chuck <b>15</b> and around the chuck <b>15</b> advantageously limits a particle flow or the particle flow conductance in the region of the chuck <b>15</b> (particularly in the closed position). As a result, the sealing line of the valve is located comparatively close to the chuck <b>15</b>, i.e. close to the substrate machining location. This leads directly to improved (homogeneous) substrate machining.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0109">By moving a valve plate gradually closer to the associated valve seat <b>21</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>, for example, the opening cross-section of the relevant valve sub-opening can be gradually, in particular continuously, reduced.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0110">The vacuum regulating valve <b>20</b> thus also provides the possibility of setting a fluid flow through the valve opening(s) in a targeted manner. If, therefore, a particular internal pressure is to be provided in the main process chamber, the vacuum regulating valve <b>20</b> can be used to set a particular quantity (mass or volume) of fluid that flows out per unit of time. The regulating variable used for this may be, for example, an internal pressure in the main chamber <b>11</b> determined by means of a pressure sensor. Alternatively, the opening cross-section can be set and varied in a controlled manner on the basis of a predetermined rule.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0111">It should be noted that the invention is not limited solely to embodiments with three valve sub-openings, valve seats and valve plates, but rather extends in particular also to those solutions that have two or more than three valve openings, valve seats and valve plates.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0112">Dividing the total valve opening into a plurality of sub-openings <b>22</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>also offers the advantage that also a plurality of valve closures <b>23</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>is provided, and thus the mass of each individual closure can be reduced individually. Due to the lower individual masses to be moved, significantly shorter movement times can be achieved, i.e. the time required to move one or all of the valve closures from an open position to a closed position (or vice versa) can be shortened.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0113">In addition, the likelihood of the valve disadvantageously snapping shut when the valve opening is very small can be reduced since the forces applied to the individual valve plates are in each case significantly smaller than the force would be in the case of one continuous valve plate of equal surface area, and counteracting holding forces are accordingly easier to achieve in design terms.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0114">An initially asymmetrical fluid flow through the chamber <b>11</b> can be compensated by means of the vacuum regulating valve <b>20</b> according to the invention. By providing different open states of the individual valve sub-openings <b>22</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>, which can additionally be dynamically adjusted, an asymmetry with regard to the gas flow can be compensated. To this end, the valve closures <b>23</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>can be moved into different positions (distances from the respective valve seats), as a result of which different opening cross-sections are provided. The fluid then no longer flows out centrally through the valve, but rather also asymmetrically within the valve with respect to the central axis.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0115">Due to the different open states, the fluid flow can be set to vary across the course of a chamber cross-section. In other words, the flow behaviour of a gas can be set differently in different areas of the chamber, for example different flow velocities can be set on opposite chamber walls.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0116">By variably setting the fluid flow through the valve <b>20</b> in this way, an inhomogeneous, uneven flow behaviour&#x2014;caused for example by a non-central inflow of a process gas&#x2014;can be compensated such that a resulting flow around the chuck <b>15</b> is symmetrical (homogeneous).</p><p id="p-0112" num="0117"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows, in a perspective view, an embodiment of a valve seat together with a corresponding valve plate <b>23</b> of a vacuum machining system according to the invention.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0118">The valve seat <b>21</b> is embodied by a plate, which has the shape of a ring segment. The valve seat <b>21</b> defines a valve opening <b>22</b>, through which a fluid (for example process gas or precursor) can flow. The valve opening <b>22</b> is surrounded by a sealing surface with a sealing element <b>25</b>. The sealing element <b>25</b> (and the sealing surface) is arranged on the underside of the valve seat <b>21</b>, i.e. on the side facing away from the main process chamber <b>11</b> when installed as intended.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0119">The valve seat <b>21</b> additionally has, on the upper side opposite the underside, a structure which is permeable to a process fluid and through which a flow can pass. The structure may be designed, for example, as a grid, as a perforated film, in a lamellar manner, etc. The structure provides for increased stability of the valve seat <b>21</b> and also for homogenizing the fluid flow, i.e. one stream can be divided into individual sub-streams by a plurality of through-channels provided by means of the structure and thus an improved laminar flow behaviour can be achieved.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0120">Alternatively, the valve seat <b>21</b> may be designed without the structure.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0121">The plate-like design of the valve seat <b>21</b> enables easy and quick installation or replacement of the seat <b>21</b> in a vacuum machining device, as shown for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The valve seat plate <b>21</b> can be inserted and fixed in the process chamber (main process chamber <b>11</b>) from above and can likewise be removed from above, without any complicated dismantling of the rest of the valve or of the chamber being necessary. The valve seat plate <b>21</b> can be supplied or removed, for example, through a transfer opening of the process chamber (not shown), through which the substrate to be machined can be introduced into and/or removed from the chamber.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0122">In terms of its shape and spatial extent, the valve plate <b>23</b> corresponds to the valve seat <b>21</b>, in particular to the seal <b>25</b>. By pressing the plate <b>23</b> against the seal <b>25</b> from below, the opening <b>22</b> can be closed in a gas-tight manner. The valve plate <b>23</b> has on its upper side (not visible) a contact surface which corresponds to the shape and spatial extent of the seal <b>25</b> and/or of the sealing surface bearing the seal <b>25</b>. When the valve is closed, the contact surface is brought into contact with the seal <b>25</b>.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0123">The valve plate <b>23</b> additionally has, on its underside, a coupling element <b>26</b> for coupling the drive unit to the plate <b>23</b>.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0124">The valve plate <b>23</b>, like the valve seat, can be installed from above in a vacuum machining system according to the invention, in particular in the secondary process chamber <b>12</b>. To this end, the plate <b>23</b> can likewise be supplied or removed, for example, through a transfer opening of the process chamber (not shown), through which the substrate to be machined can be introduced into and/or removed from the chamber.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0125">The resulting comparatively easy removal and/or installation of both the valve seat <b>21</b> and the valve plate <b>23</b> is particularly advantageous with regard to predictive/preventive maintenance or possible repair work. By way of example, the sealing elements arranged on the valve seats <b>21</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>are exposed to material stress with each movement to or from the closed position and must therefore be replaced or renewed in regular cycles. Due to the advantageous modular construction, a significant time saving compared to conventional valve solutions can be achieved for this maintenance activity.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0126">It will be understood that the illustrated figures schematically show only possible exemplary embodiments. According to the invention, the various approaches can also be combined with one another and with prior art methods and devices for regulating a volume flow or pressure in a process volume under vacuum conditions.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
