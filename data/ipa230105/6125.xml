Therefore, wiring from the outside to the two external connection terminals is not easy.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Further, it has been difficult to realize the supply of a drive signal to power supply surfaces (two main surfaces) of a piezoelectric element, which are on mutually-different positions in the thickness direction of the pump, while matching the positions of the two external connection terminals in the thickness direction, with a simple configuration.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Accordingly, a possible benefit of the present disclosure is to provide an actuator that can more securely realize the supply of a drive signal to a piezoelectric element while matching the positions of two external connection terminals in a thickness direction of the device, with a simple configuration.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">An actuator according to the present disclosure includes a first member, a piezoelectric element, a first power supply member, a second power supply member, and an insulating layer.

The second power supply member is arranged on a same side as the first power supply member on the first member and has a portion connected with the fourth main surface and a portion overlapped with the frame body. The insulating layer is arranged between the second power supply member and the frame body. When a direction in which the first power supply member and the second power supply member are aligned with respect to the piezoelectric element is defined as a thickness direction, the first power supply member includes a first external connection terminal that protrudes in a direction orthogonal to the thickness direction. The second power supply member includes a second external connection terminal that protrudes in the direction orthogonal to the thickness direction. The first external connection terminal and the second external connection terminal are arranged on same positions in the thickness direction. A portion on an opposite side to a side, on which the first external connection terminal protrudes, in the first power supply member is bent toward the frame body to be electrically connected with the frame body.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In this configuration, the position of the first external connection terminal and the position of the second external connection terminal are the same as each other in the thickness direction of the actuator and the first power supply member is directly connected with the frame body and accordingly is connected to the piezoelectric element and the second power supply member is directly connected with the piezoelectric element.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to the present disclosure, the supply of a drive signal to a piezoelectric element can be more securely realized while matching the positions of two external connection terminals in a thickness direction of a device, with a simple configuration.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an exploded perspective view of a fluid control device <b>10</b> including an actuator <b>11</b> according to a first embodiment.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is a plan view of the actuator <b>11</b> according to the first embodiment and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>B, <b>2</b>C, and <b>2</b>D</figref> are side sectional views of the actuator <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a plan view illustrating components of the actuator <b>11</b> according to the first embodiment with respectively-different hatching.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a perspective view of a power supply member <b>60</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is an exploded perspective view of a fluid control device <b>10</b>A including an actuator <b>11</b>A according to a second embodiment.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> is a plan view of the actuator <b>11</b>A according to the second embodiment and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> is a side sectional view of the actuator <b>11</b>A.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A and <b>7</b>B</figref> are side sectional views of an actuator <b>11</b>B according to a third embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0008" level="1">First Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022">An actuator and a fluid control device according to a first embodiment of the present disclosure will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an exploded perspective view of a fluid control device <b>10</b> including an actuator <b>11</b> according to a first embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is a plan view of the actuator <b>11</b> according to the first embodiment and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>B, <b>2</b>C, and <b>2</b>D</figref> are side sectional views of the actuator <b>11</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a plan view illustrating components of the actuator <b>11</b> according to the first embodiment with respectively-different hatching.
