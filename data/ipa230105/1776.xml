The content of the aforementioned application, including any intervening amendments thereto, is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">This application relates to electric vehicle transmission, and more particularly to a multi-mode torque vectoring electric drive axle with a single actuator.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Electric vehicles (EVs) featuring zero fuel consumption, high integration, fast dynamic response, and high driving performance have been vigorously developed and widely popularized in recent years. In order to conform to the developing tendency of high performance, diversification, and individuation, the EVs have growing demand for advanced driving technology that can improve the chassis performance, and electric torque vectoring technology is one of the desired technologies.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Torque vectoring (TV) technology can realize the arbitrary transfer of the driving torque generated by the power source between left and right wheels, or between front and rear axles. Specifically, this technology can realize the transfer of the driving torque from the low-speed wheel (or axle) to the high-speed wheel (or axle), and the transfer of the driving torque from the high-speed side to the low-speed side. Therefore, this technology can overcome the defect in the traditional open differentials that &#x201c;the speeds of two-side wheels can be different, but the torque of them is always equal&#x201d;, so as to improve the control flexibility and steering maneuverability, balance the road adhesion utilization rate of tires, and increase the stability margin of the vehicle, effectively enhancing the handling stability of the vehicle. In addition, this technology can perform the driving torque distribution among four wheels to achieve the goal of energy saving.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Currently, this technology is mainly divided into two categories. One is the torque vectoring control technology applied to distributed-drive-type vehicles represented by in-wheel-motor-drive vehicles, which can achieve the torque vectoring distribution between wheels by directly controlling driving torque of the in-wheel motor of each wheel. However, low power density of the in-wheel motor and increased unsprung mass greatly limit the application of the torque vectoring distribution control technology in automobiles. The other is the torque vectoring differentials (TVDs) (drive axles) applied to centralized driving, which have been applied in some high-end sports cars and high-end sport utility vehicles (SUVs), such as Honda's super handling-all wheel drive (SH-AWD), Mitsubishi's super-all wheel control (SAYC) system and Audi's sport differentials. However, these TVDs are mainly applied on traditional fuel vehicles, and generally use a mechanical torque vectoring distribution mechanism such as multi-disc clutch, resulting in limited torque transfer capacity, reduced mechanical transmission efficiency, low reliability, high cost and complex structure.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition, improving the transmission efficiency of electric vehicles and reducing the loss of battery energy are critical to ensure the range of electric vehicles. The traditional single-motor drive axle can only choose high-power motors to meet the power requirements under extreme working conditions, which will cause the phenomenon &#x201c;a big horse hauls a small carriage&#x201d;, and make the utilization rate of high-efficiency range of the motor low. By comparison, the dual-motor coupling drive technology allows the vehicle to switch to the main motor alone drive when the required driving torque is relatively small, and switch to the dual-motor torque coupling mode when the required driving torque is relatively large, so as to improve the loading rate and the high-efficiency range utilization rate of the driving motor, extending the range.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">So far, it has been rarely reported about the application of the dual-motor parallel coupling driving for efficient driving and energy saving, and the torque vectoring drive axle for improving steering maneuverability and handling stability on electric vehicles, only Chinese patent application publication No. 106965659A, titled &#x201c;Dual-motor coupling drive axle with torque vectoring function&#x201d;, and Chinese patent application publication No. 106965662A, titled &#x201c;Dual-motor coupling drive axle with torque vectoring function&#x201d; mention the related technical content. On the basis of achieving the torque vectoring function, these patent references enable transformation of the torque vectoring control motor, which is usually unoperated under straight driving conditions, into an assisted motor capable of participating in the driving by controlling the switching of the four sets of clutches, so as to achieve the dual-motor torque coupling driving, improving the dynamic performance under the working conditions with large torque demand, such as climbing and rapid acceleration. In addition, through the distribution and regulation of the coupled power of the two motors, the respective high-efficiency range can be fully utilized, so as to realize the energy-saving and high-efficiency driving. However, this technical solution requires four sets of clutches, seven planetary gear sets, resulting in complex structure, large axial length and great control difficulty.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In view of the defects existing in the prior art, this application proposes a multi-mode torque vectoring electric drive axle with a single actuator for a centralized-layout electric vehicle, in which one actuator in conjunction with the planetary gear set and dual gear is used to reach the operation under three modes, respectively main motor independent drive mode, dual-motor torque coupling mode and torque vectoring mode. Structurally, the drive axle only has one actuator, which significantly reduces the production cost and control difficulty. Additionally, the dual-motor torque coupling mode makes full use of the high-efficiency advantage of planetary gear set locking, thereby further improving the transmission efficiency of the drive axle. In terms of function, the drive axle can effectively improve the steering stability, trafficability, power performance and economic efficiency of the electric vehicles by switching between different working modes, having a brilliant application prospect.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">An objective of this application is to provide a multi-mode torque vectoring electric drive axle with a single actuator for centralized-drive electric vehicles, which has a compact structure, and can achieve the switching among three working modes: main motor independent-drive mode, dual-motor torque coupling mode and torque vectoring mode. The switching among the three working modes can be performed by controlling the operating state of the single actuator.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Under the main motor independent-drive mode, only the main motor outputs torque, which is mainly used in the conditions where the driving torque demand is relatively small, so as to improve the loading rate of the main motor, and allow the main motor to work in the high-efficiency range, reducing the efficiency loss of the main motor.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Under the dual-motor torque coupling mode, the torque of an auxiliary motor is coupled with the torque output by the main motor to drive the vehicle, improving the dynamics performance of the vehicles. The dual-motor torque coupling mode is mainly used in the working conditions with relatively large torque demand, such as climbing and rapid acceleration. In addition, through the distribution and regulation of the coupled power of the main motor and the auxiliary motor, the respective high-efficiency range the main motor and the auxiliary motor can be fully utilized, so as to realize the energy-saving and high-efficiency driving.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Under the torque vectoring mode, the driving torque output by the multi-mode torque vectoring electric drive axle can be arbitrarily distributed between the half shafts at two sides, which overcomes the defect in the traditional open differentials that &#x201c;the speeds of two-side wheels can be different, but the torque of them is always equal&#x201d;, effectively enhancing the handling stability of the vehicle, increasing the driving pleasure of the driver, and allowing for better economic efficiency and trafficability.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Technical solutions of this application are described as follows.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">This application provides a multi-mode torque vectoring electric drive axle, comprising:</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">a main motor;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">an auxiliary motor;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">a first flange;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">a second flange;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">a first half shaft;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">a second half shaft;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">a differential;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">a dual-gear mechanism;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">a primary reducer;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">a secondary reducer;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">a three-phase actuator;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">a planetary gear set;

In addition, through the distribution and regulation of the coupled power of the two motors, their respective high-efficiency ranges can be fully utilized to achieve more high-efficiency and energy-saving driving.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0121" num="0116"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a simplified structural diagram of a multi-mode torque vectoring electric drive axle according to Embodiment 1 of this application;</p><p id="p-0122" num="0117"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a structural diagram of the multi-mode torque vectoring electric drive axle according to Embodiment 1 of this application;</p><p id="p-0123" num="0118"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a partial structure diagram of the multi-mode torque vectoring electric drive axle according to Embodiment 1 of this application;</p><p id="p-0124" num="0119"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a simplified structural diagram of a multi-mode torque vectoring electric drive axle according to Embodiment 2 of this application;</p><p id="p-0125" num="0120"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a torque flow of the multi-mode torque vectoring electric drive axle under a main motor independent-drive mode according to Embodiment 1 of this application;</p><p id="p-0126" num="0121"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a torque flow of the multi-mode torque vectoring electric drive axle under a dual-motor torque coupling mode according to Embodiment 1 of this application;</p><p id="p-0127" num="0122"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows a torque flow of the multi-mode torque vectoring electric drive axle according to Embodiment 1 of this application under a torque vectoring mode in which torque increase is performed on left wheels; and</p><p id="p-0128" num="0123"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows a torque flow of the multi-mode torque vectoring electric drive axle according to Embodiment 1 of this application under a torque vectoring mode in which torque increase is performed on right wheels.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0129" num="0124">This application will be described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings and embodiments to enable those skilled in the art to implement the technical solutions disclosed herein.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Embodiment 1</heading><p id="p-0130" num="0125">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>, a torque vectoring electric drive axle using planetary gear sets and a dual gear is provided, which includes a main motor <b>100</b>, an auxiliary motor <b>200</b>, a first flange <b>903</b>, a second flange <b>904</b>, a first half shaft <b>901</b>, a second-half shaft <b>902</b>, a bevel gear differential <b>800</b>, a dual-gear mechanism <b>600</b>, a primary reducer <b>300</b>, a secondary reducer <b>400</b>, a planetary gear set <b>500</b>, a three-phase actuator <b>700</b> and a main housing <b>1001</b>.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0126">The main housing <b>1001</b> is configured to accommodate the primary reducer <b>300</b>, the secondary reducer <b>400</b>, the planetary gear set <b>500</b>, the bevel gear differential <b>800</b>, the dual-gear mechanism <b>600</b> and the three-phase actuator <b>700</b>, and fix the main motor <b>100</b> and the auxiliary motor <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0127">The main motor <b>100</b> is a hollow-shaft inner-rotor permanent magnet synchronous motor.
