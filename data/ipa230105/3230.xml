Generally, the centrifugal compressor is operated with a predetermined margin from the surging line, and a bypass valve is often used as a fail-safe device to dynamically avoid surging.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The bypass valve has a function of opening and closing a bypass passage connecting the outlet side (scroll passage downstream of the impeller) and the inlet side (supply passage upstream of the impeller) of the compressor. During normal operation of the engine, the bypass valve closes the bypass passage. When a disturbance accompanied by a sudden decrease in surge margin occurs, such as a sudden increase in boost pressure due to over-rotation of the turbine, the bypass valve opens the bypass passage to allow the compressed fluid flowing on the outlet side of the compressor to return to the inlet side of the compressor through the bypass passage. This reduces the boost pressure of the compressor and ensures a surge margin.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">On the other hand, the provision of the bypass passage leads to an increase in pressure loss. Specifically, when the bypass passage is closed by the bypass valve, a cavity portion communicating with the scroll passage is formed in the bypass passage. If a large amount of fluid flowing through the scroll passage enters the cavity portion, the fluid entering the cavity portions forms a swirl and is then returned to the scroll passage. The returned fluid may interfere with the fluid flowing through the scroll passage and cause a large pressure loss, which may reduce the efficiency of the compressor. For example, the compressor provided with the bypass passage and the bypass valve may have a decrease in efficiency of about 2 to 3% at the maximum output point of the engine as compared with a configuration not provided with the bypass passage and the bypass valve. This decrease in efficiency corresponds to approximately 10% of the loss in the entire compressor.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Patent Document 1: JP2012-241558A</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Problems to be Solved</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">To solve such a problem of increase in pressure loss, Patent Document 1 proposes to form the surface of the valve body of the bypass valve in accordance with the inner wall of the scroll passage of the compressor. With this structure, it is possible to suppress the increase in pressure loss due to the flow into the bypass passage.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, bypass valves are often made of general-purpose products, and it is necessary to use custom-made products in order to form the surface of the valve body into a specific shape in accordance with the inner wall of the pipe, which leads to an increase in cost.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In view of the above, an object of at least one embodiment of the present disclosure is to provide a compressor that can suppress the increase in pressure loss of the compressor while suppressing the complexity of the valve body shape of the bypass valve, and a turbocharger including the turbocharger.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to the Problems</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A compressor according to the present disclosure comprises: an impeller; a housing configured to rotatably house the impeller and having an intake passage for introducing a gas to the impeller from outside the housing, a scroll passage for guiding the gas having passed through the impeller to the outside, and a bypass passage connecting the intake passage and the scroll passage so as to bypass the impeller; and a bypass valve haying a valve body disposed in the bypass passage and capable of opening and closing the bypass passage.

The upstream passage wall surface portion (<b>61</b>) is configured such that an angle (&#x3b8;<b>1</b>) between the upstream passage wall surface portion (<b>61</b>) and an upstream scroll wall surface (<b>37</b>A) of a scroll passage wall surface (<b>37</b>) which defines the scroll passage (<b>36</b>) connected to the upstream end (<b>45</b>) is less than 90 degrees.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">According to the configuration 1), since the upstream passage wall surface portion (<b>61</b>) connected to the upstream end (<b>45</b>) of the communication port (<b>43</b>) is configured such that the angle (&#x3b8;<b>1</b>) formed with the upstream scroll wall surface (<b>37</b>A) connected to the upstream end (<b>45</b>) is less than 90 degrees, it is possible to prevent the gas flowing along the upstream scroll wall surface (<b>37</b>A) in the scroll passage (<b>36</b>) from entering the inlet-side passage (<b>41</b>), as compared with the case where the angle (&#x3b8;<b>1</b>) formed with the upstream scroll wall surface (<b>37</b>A) is equal to or more than 90 degrees. As a result, it is possible to suppress the formation of a swirl flow due to the gas entering the inlet-side passage (<b>41</b>), and it is possible to suppress the increase in pressure loss of the compressor (<b>2</b>) due to the swirl flow formed in the inlet-side passage (<b>41</b>).</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Further, the increase in pressure loss of the compressor (<b>2</b>) can be suppressed without shaping the surface (<b>511</b>) of the valve body (<b>51</b>) of the bypass valve (<b>5</b>) in accordance with the scroll passage wall surface (<b>37</b>) as in the configuration described in Patent Document 1.

This restricts the layout of the bypass passage (<b>4</b>), which needs to be connected to the intake passage (<b>32</b>) of the compressor (<b>2</b>). In contrast, according to the configuration 1), since the increase in pressure loss can be suppressed without providing the valve body (<b>51</b>) of the bypass valve (<b>5</b>) along the scroll passage wall surface (<b>37</b>), it is not necessary to provide the installation space and movable space of the valve body (<b>51</b>) at a position close to the scroll passage (<b>36</b>) in the bypass passage (<b>4</b>). This makes the layout of the bypass passage (<b>4</b>), which needs to be connected to the intake passage (<b>32</b>) of the compressor (<b>2</b>), more flexible.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">2) In some embodiments, in the compressor (<b>2</b>) described in the above 1), the inlet-side passage wall surface (<b>41</b>) further includes a downstream passage wall surface portion (<b>62</b>) connected to a downstream end (<b>46</b>) of the communication port (<b>43</b>) in a cross-sectional view of the housing (<b>3</b>) taken along the axis (CA) of the impeller (<b>21</b>).
