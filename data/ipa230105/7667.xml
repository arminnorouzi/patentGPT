An incumbent user may also be referred to as a primary user or an incumbent. Incumbent users have priority access to transmit in the spectrum shared with the secondary users. If a secondary user seeks permission to transmit on spectrum shared by incumbent user(s) and/or other secondary user(s), it will only be permitted to do so to the extent its transmissions do not raise aggregate interference at the incumbent user(s) and/or other secondary user(s) above corresponding interference threshold levels for each of such incumbent user(s) and secondary user(s).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Such secondary users use citizens broadband radio service device(s) (CBSD(s)). A CBSD is a radio including a transmitter coupled to an antenna. A CBRS system may include at least two spectrum access systems (SASs) each of which is operated by different entities. Each SAS regulates the transmissions of certain CBSD(s) in the shared spectrum under the SAS's control, e.g., whether each CBSD of a SAS can transmit in the shared spectrum, and if so, then at what frequency spectrum and power level, to ensure that aggregate interference at incumbent users and other CBSDs is within appropriate limits. The SAS also may include a function to coordinate the shared spectrum usage among secondary users that are General Authorized Access (GAA) CBSDs to diminish interference between GAA CBSDs and to regulate interference from GAA CBSD(s) at certain location(s), e.g., geographic location(s) of incumbent user(s), of protection area(s), and of exclusion zone(s).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">SASs operated by different entities may be implemented with different techniques that result in each SAS allocating different frequency spectrums to GAA CBSDs. As a result, a SAS that controls transmission of a GAA CBSD and at least one other SAS that does not control transmission of the GAA CBSD may allocate different frequency spectrums to the GAA CBSD. When this occurs, a contention arises due to different frequency spectrums being allocated by different SASs to the same GAA CBSD. Because of the contention(s), (a) interference is undesirably increased at the same GAA CBSD and/or other GAA CBSD(s), and/or (b) maximum transmit power(s) of each of one or more GAA CBSD(s) is undesirably reduced due to excessive interference at incumbent user(s) and/or geographic region(s) to be maintained interference free.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A method is performed by a spectrum access system (SAS) to at least one of (a) diminish interference at at least one radio of radios (b) increase maximum transmit power of at least one radio of the radios, and (c) increase transmit bandwidth of at least one radio of the radios.

Thus, (a) interference is desirably reduced at the same GAA CBSD and/or other GAA CBSD(s), and/or (b) maximum transmit power(s) of each of one or more GAA CBSD(s) is desirably increased due to diminished interference at incumbent user(s) and/or geographic region(s) to be maintained interference free.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Although embodiments of the invention are applicable to and may be exemplified in the context of CBRS for pedagogical purposes, the embodiments are applicable to other shared spectrum systems, such as for example licensed spectrum access systems or authorized access systems. Thus, for example, a CBSD may be more generally referred to as a radio. Shared spectrum (or shared frequency spectrum) means frequency spectrum utilized by: (a) incumbent user(s) (e.g., a receiver of a fixed satellite service (FSS)) and/or geographic region(s) to be maintained interference free (e.g., a grandfather wireless protection zone (GWPZ) or priority access license (PAL) protection area (PPA), a geographic location of an environmental sensing capability (ESC) system receiver(s) and/or an exclusion zone) and (b) at least one of priority access licensee (PAL) CBSD(s) and GAA CBSD(s). The CBSD may be a GAA or a priority access license (PAL) CBSD. Optionally, threshold levels mentioned herein may be set by a system designer and/or a system user.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">A protection point means a point representing actual and/or potential incumbent user(s) and/or geographic regions which are to remain free of interference (as that term is defined herein) from CBSDs. Network graph means a connected set where there are no pairs of nodes that are connected with an edge and have the same color. A connected set within a network graph means a unique set of at least two nodes where at least two of the at least two nodes have an edge, or a unique node with no edge to any other node. A network graph is comprised of a connected set of nodes, where each node of the at least two nodes having an edge are assigned different colors, and where a number of colors assigned to nodes of the connected set is a minimum number of colors which can be assigned to each node of the connected set. Optionally, a network graph may alternatively mean the network graph defined above, and further where at least one GAA CBSD (comprising at least one node of each connected set) is geographically located within a neighborhood of a protection point.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Embodiments of an invention provide techniques for diminishing a number of contentions between at least two SASs. A contention arises when two SASs have assigned different frequency spectrums to a color assigned to node(s) of a same connected set. Optionally, each GAA CBSD comprising a node is managed by a single network operator. Optionally, each network operator is assigned a unique color.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">A contention between two SASs may be eliminated if the first SAS determines that CBSD(s) (whose transmissions are controlled by the first SAS), comprising either the node(s) assigned the color or the node, have a delta<sup>1 </sup>of bandwidth and/or power level that each is less than or equal to a corresponding acceptance threshold level (e.g., an &#x201c;acceptable bandwidth delta&#x201d; and &#x201c;power level delta&#x201d;). The first SAS seeks to reduce contentions with at least one peer SAS, e.g., the other SAS. If the CBSD(s) (whose transmissions are controlled by the first SAS) have an acceptable bandwidth delta and/or power level delta, then the GAA CBSD(s) are assigned a frequency spectrum determined by the peer SAS. Bandwidth delta may be optionally determined using frequency spectrum (allocated to GAA CBSD(s) by the first SAS) that is not overlapped by other frequency spectrum allocated to other CBSD(s) by a peer SAS. <sup>1 </sup>I.e., a difference between parameters of the first SAS and another SAS, i.e., a peer SAS. Peer SAS means another SAS with which a SAS is attempting to reduce contentions. Thus, the peer SAS is not the first SAS described above.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Co-channel means frequency spectrum equal to or a subset of another frequency spectrum. Frequency spectrum, or each portion thereof, associated with a protection point means frequency spectrum that must be free of interference (as that term is elsewhere defined herein) at the geographic location of the protection point; optionally, such frequency spectrum corresponds to frequency spectrum utilized by a receiver of an incumbent user or a PAL CBSD.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Frequency spectrum means a bandwidth centered about a center frequency. Node means at least one GAA CBSD, where if the node comprises two or more GAA CBSD(s), then each GAA CBSD utilizes the same frequency spectrum and is free of interference (as defined elsewhere herein) from each of the other GAA CBSD(s) comprising the node.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Unless otherwise indicated herein, power as used herein means power or power spectral density. Power levels for a shared spectrum system, such as a CBRS, are often characterized in terms of power spectral density levels. Optionally, power or power spectral density may be a level radiated by antenna(s) electrically coupled to a transmitter of a CBSD and characterized in terms of effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">A CBRS system comprises general authorized access (GAA) and/or priority access license (PAL) CBSDs, and incumbent users and geographic region(s) to be maintained free of interference. The incumbent users, such as government users fixed satellite service receiver(s), have priority access, with respect to secondary users such as CBSDs, to some or all of spectrum in the shared spectrum. When satisfying interference requirements, a SAS is configured to grant the CBSDs access to the shared spectrum, including authorizing frequency spectrum (or channels) requested by CBSDs, and authorizing a corresponding requested maximum transmission power or assigning a lower maximum transmission power. The SAS is configured to control the transmission of GAA CBSDs so that PAL CBSDs and the incumbent users are free of interference from GAA CBSDs. The GAA and PAL CBSDs are secondary users; the PAL CBSDs are secondary users because they have a lower priority than incumbent users. For example, PAL and GAA CBSDs have to also protect Environmental Sensing Capability (ESC) sensors which are used to detect radar transmissions, e.g., from naval ships, in the CBRS band. The SAS is also configured to control the transmission of PAL and GAA CBSDs so that incumbent users are free of interference from PAL and GAA CBSDs.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Free of interference as used herein does not mean an absence of interference, but rather means an acceptable level of interference (i.e., a level of interference below a threshold level of interference) which may be no interference or a finite level of interference; thus, to determine if a geographic location, e.g., of an incumbent user or a geographic region to be maintained interference free, is free of interference, whether the interference level is below the acceptable level of interference (or a threshold interference) is determined. The acceptable level of interference may vary by the type of incumbent user or geographic region, frequency spectrum, and/or other indicia.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">GAA CBSDs may be of two types: category A (low transmission power) and category B (high transmission power). Category A has a maximum transmission power spectral density of 30 dBm/10 MHz. Category B has a maximum transmission power spectral density of 47 dBm/10 MHz.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Incumbent users of shared spectrum have first, or highest, priority to utilize the shared spectrum controlled by the SAS. Thus, incumbent users (e.g., the receivers of incumbent users' communications systems such as radios) shall be able to operate free of interference from other users, e.g., communications systems of priority access licensees and general authorized access users. Communications systems, as used herein, shall include Environmental Sensing Capability (ESC) receivers and satellite ground stations.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In one embodiment, PAL CBSDs have second (or intermediate) priority, after incumbent users (excluding PAL users), to utilize the frequency spectrum controlled by the SAS. In another embodiment, a PAL user shall be able to operate, when incumbent users (excluding PAL CBSDs) are free of interference of such a PAL user, and free of interference from other PAL CBSDs and general authorized access users. In one embodiment, an ability of a PAL CBSD to operate free of interference shall be limited temporally, geographically, and spectrally within the specifications of its license.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">GAA CBSDs have third, or lowest, priority to utilize the frequency spectrum controlled by the SAS. In one embodiment, an operation of GAA CBSDs will be governed by laws, regulations, and/or rules (e.g., pertaining to CBRS). Such laws, regulations, and/or rules may be established by government(s) and/or standards bodies (e.g., Wireless Innovation Forum or WInnForum). Optionally, a GAA CBSD shall be able to transmit when incumbent user(s) and geographic region(s) to be maintained interference free are free of interference when the GAA CBSD transmits.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The invention can be subsequently described in more general terms, e.g., using the term radio rather than CBSD, and shared spectrum system rather than CBRS. However, the terms CBRS and CBSD may be subsequently used when illustrating such a system and a device, or their specifications. Thus, a CBSD may be more generally referred to as a radio. Radio means a radio whose transmission is controlled or regulated by a spectrum access system.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> illustrates a block diagram of one embodiment of a shared spectrum system <b>100</b> configured to perform spectrum allocation at a planned time using a modified spectrum coordination system.

If the WinnForum definition for co-existence group data is used, then co-existence group data means (i) a group type where of two or more GAA CBSDs can be allocated the same frequency spectrum allocation, e.g., Single Frequency Group (SFG) defined by the Signaling Protocol and Procedures for Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS): WinnForum Recognized CBRS Grouping Information Version 4.1.0, and (ii) a group identifier (ID) assigned to the GAA CBSDs comprising such nodes.

A node comprises GAA CBSDs having a SFG group type and the same group ID; e.g., a network operator manages interference amongst the GAA CBSDs comprising a node of SFG group type. An additional coexistence group type is a Spectrum Reuse Group (SRG) defined by Signaling Protocol and Procedures for Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS): WinnForum Recognized CBRS Grouping Information Version 4.1.0. Each GAA CBSD designated as group type SRG comprises its own node. An edge is not formed between two nodes having a SRG group type and a same group ID; e.g., a network operator manages interference amongst the two nodes having a SRG group type and a same group ID.

Node edge data generated by the SAS and the other SAS(s) <b>106</b> may comprise an indication of whether an edge has or has not been determined and the criterion of interference of each node edge.

Optionally, the SAS <b>102</b> and each of the other SAS(s) <b>106</b> use a same algorithm to determine whether a node edge exists or does not exist for each such discrepancy by determining whether an indicium of interference exceeds an indicium of interference threshold value. Optionally, the indicium of interference may be a mean or median of the criterion of interference for each potential node edge where there is a discrepancy.

The set of nodes that comprise a connected set are identical to the nodes that comprise a common network graph, however, the difference between the two is that the common network graph nodes (unlike the nodes of the connected set) have a color assigned to each node, e.g., using the Greedy Coloring Algorithm. Optionally, each SAS is configured to assign a connected set in each common network graph a unique identifier that is the same for each SAS; thus, each connected set may be identified by its unique identifier. Block <b>220</b>E may not be needed if connected set identifiers are identified by each SAS using the same algorithm for determining connected set identifiers. Optionally, each SAS is also configured assign same identifiers for GAA CBSDs, nodes, and/or colors. Connected set identifier numbering scheme may be based on a number of nodes, and identifiers for each node, comprising the connected set. As an example, the connected set with a largest number of nodes may be designated as connected set (CS) identifier (ID) <b>1</b>, the connected set with a second largest number of nodes may be designated as connected set identifier <b>2</b>, and so on. When two or more connected sets have the same number of nodes, then the connected set identifier numbering can be assigned based upon the lowest node identifier number of nodes comprising each connected set having the same number of nodes. The connected set comprising a node with a lowest node identifier number is assigned the next highest connected set identifier number. Each of the other connected sets having the same number of nodes as the connected set comprising the node with the next lowest node identifier is assigned a lower connected set identifier number based upon an order of lowest node identifier number (from lowest to highest node identifier number). Connected set identifier numbering, however, may be performed in different ways. The use of connected set identifiers (which are the same for each SAS) diminishes an amount of data that needs to be communicate between SASs when implementing embodiments of the invention.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In block <b>220</b>F, planned spectrum allocation is performed by the SAS <b>102</b> using the at least one common network graph; that is a frequency spectrum and a maximum transmit power are determined for each GAA CBSD of each connected set of each common network graph comprising each of the node(s) of the common network graphs. Optionally, such a determination may be made on a color-by-color basis or a node-by-node basis, where a color is assigned to each node comprising the common network graph.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In block <b>220</b>G, the frequency spectrum and the maximum transmission power determined for GAA CBSD, for each connected set, are sent (or transmitted) by the SAS <b>102</b> to each of the other SAS(s) <b>106</b>. Optionally, the frequency spectrum and the maximum transmission power are sent for GAA CBSD(s) on a node by node or color by color basis, where the GAA CBSD(s) comprise a specific node or node(s) assigned a specific color. Because GAA CBSD(s) comprising a specific node or node(s) assigned a specific color have the same frequency spectrum, an amount of data sent between SASs is diminished. To diminish an amount of data sent, a frequency spectrum may be sent for each color assigned to node(s) of each connected set as each GAA CBSD comprising each node assigned a unique color is allocated the same frequency spectrum.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In block <b>220</b>H, the frequency spectrum and the maximum transmit power determined, by each of the other SAS(s) <b>106</b> during planned spectrum allocation, for each GAA CBSD, comprising the node(s) that comprise a connected set of each common network graph are received by the SAS <b>102</b>.

The received frequency spectrum(s) and the received maximum transmit power(s) are determined by each of the other SAS(s) <b>106</b>.

Contentions regarding at least one color of a connected set may be resolved only on such a pair basis. Resolved means that the contention has satisfied at least one acceptance criteria.
