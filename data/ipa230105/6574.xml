Some BLDC motors have sensors to determine the angular position of the rotor at standstill. Some other BLDC motors (e.g., sensor-less BLDC motors) do not have these sensors.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Some methods for determining the angular position of a rotor of a BLDC motor at standstill include passing current pulses through windings of the BLDC motor to determine an inductance of the windings. The inductance of the windings may be based on the angular position of the rotor, which includes a permanent magnet, because the magnetic field of the rotor affects the inductance of the windings. For example, when the magnetic field of the rotor is aligned with a magnetic field generated by passing current through a winding wrapped around a core, the inductance of that winding is reduced. Thus, an angular position of the rotor at standstill may be estimated based on the determined inductance of each of the windings (e.g., a north pole of the rotor may be most closely aligned with the winding with the smallest inductance).</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some instances, the inductance of each winding may be determined by the amount of time taken for the magnitude of the current passed through each winding to reach a predetermined threshold. In some such instances, the shorter the amount of time taken for the current passed through a winding to reach the predetermined threshold, the lower the inductance of that winding. Thus, the winding associated with the shortest amount of time may be determined to have the lowest inductance, and hence the position of the rotor may be determined to be most closely aligned with the position of the winding associated with the shortest amount of time.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">However, estimating the angular position of the rotor based on the winding with the smallest inductance may have a limited accuracy. For example, if the BLDC motor includes six windings that are evenly spaced apart (e.g., by an angle of 60 degrees), the estimation may only have an accuracy within a 60 degree range. Thus, the accuracy of the estimation may be low (e.g., the estimation may only give a general idea of the angular position of the rotor). As a result, a performance and/or a reliability of the start-up process of the BLDC motor may be reduced.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Various embodiments of the present description are related to a method for determining an angular position of a rotor of a sensor-less BLDC motor at standstill (e.g., without motion) with improved accuracy (e.g., with an accuracy of within approximately 60 degrees, within approximately 30 degrees, etc.). In some embodiments, the method comprises providing current pulses to a plurality of windings of a BLDC motor with the rotor at standstill. The current pulses respectively change between a first value and a second value. A time that it takes for the current pulses applied to each of the plurality of windings to reach the second value (e.g., a second current threshold) from the first value (e.g., a first current threshold) is measured. A first position of the rotor is determined from the shortest time. The first position corresponds to a winding that is closest to a north pole of the rotor. The times are subsequently acted upon by an interpolation function to determine an adjustment to the first position. The adjustment increases an accuracy of the rotor position. By determining a position of the rotor based on the position detection value and the interpolation function, the accuracy of the determination of the position of the rotor of the BLDC motor may be improved. For example, the interpolation function may output the angular position of the rotor with an accuracy of within about 10 degrees. Because an accuracy of the determination of the position of the rotor may be improved, a performance of the BLDC motor (e.g., a torque of the BLDC motor) and/or a reliability of start-up of the BLDC motor may be improved.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram of some embodiments of a BLDC motor system <b>100</b> comprising rotor position detection circuitry <b>114</b> having an interpolator <b>118</b> configured to improve a determination of a position of a rotor <b>104</b> at standstill.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The BLDC motor system <b>100</b> comprises a BLDC motor <b>101</b> coupled to control circuitry <b>109</b>.

For example, the magnetic field generated by the permanent magnet of the rotor <b>104</b> will pass through the plurality of windings <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<b>106</b><i>f </i>to different degrees depending on an orientation of the rotor <b>104</b>. As a current is applied to a winding of the plurality of windings <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<b>106</b><i>f, </i>the current will change a magnetic flux through the winding. According to Lenz' law the change in current will induce an EMF that resists the change in current. Because the magnetic field generated by the rotor <b>104</b> will cause a different magnetic field to be applied to different ones of the plurality of windings <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<b>106</b><i>f, </i>the currents applied to different ones of the plurality of windings <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<b>106</b><i>f </i>will take different amounts of time to reach the second value. The amount of time that it will take for the current to reach the second value is dependent upon an inductance of a winding (e.g., since the change in current in an RL circuit is dependent on the time constant, &#x3c4;, where &#x3c4;=L/R). For example, winding <b>106</b><i>d </i>is close to the north pole N of the rotor <b>104</b> and thus will have a lower inductance (e.g., a lower resistance to current changes) than winding <b>106</b><i>e, </i>which is further from the north pole N.

This determination method gives the angular position of the rotor &#x3b8;<sub>R </sub>at standstill within a 30 degree range.

The angular position of the rotor &#x3b8;<sub>R </sub>at standstill is further determined by analyzing the interpolated times and angles to determine the overall lowest time and associated angle of the interpolated times and angles.

In some embodiments, the angle &#x3b2; is relative to the angle associated with the shortest time and is measured in the direction of the angle associated with the shorter of the two adjacent times. In other words, in this example, &#x3b2; is an angle with respect to &#x3b8;<sub>1 </sub>in the direction of &#x3b8;<sub>2 </sub>(e.g., in the clockwise direction). In some other examples (e.g., if T<sub>&#x3b8;6 </sub>were the shorter of the two adjacent times instead of T<sub>&#x3b8;2</sub>), &#x3b2; may be an angle with respect to &#x3b8;<sub>1 </sub>in the direction of &#x3b8;<sub>6 </sub>(e.g., the counterclockwise direction).</p><p id="p-0099" num="0096">In some embodiments, the following equations (e.g., equations (2)-(5)) may be used to determine

For example, in some embodiments the position detection value may be multiplied by a first constant (e.g., 31.25) and the product of that multiplication may be subtracted from a second constant (e.g., 30.64375) to determine an adjustment value that may be added or subtracted from a position (e.g., angle) associated with the shortest time to determine the rotor position.

Other equations can be derived from equations (2) through (5) that are also feasible to solve for &#x3b2;.

The domain is set to 30 degrees because, as discussed above, by using the shortest time (e.g., T<sub>&#x3b8;1</sub>) and the shorter of the two adjacent times (e.g., T<sub>&#x3b8;2</sub>), the angular position of the rotor &#x3b8;<sub>R </sub>can be determined within a 30 degree range.

In some embodiments, the linear approximation is derived from a line of best fit. In some embodiments, a linear approximation of the interpolation function is beneficial because a linear function may be much easier to implement in hardware (e.g., in the rotor position detection circuitry <b>114</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref>) than a function containing sine and/or cosine.
