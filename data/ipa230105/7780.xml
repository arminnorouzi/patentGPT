Therefore, until prior to the bonding step, the layers are formed with separated from the substrate <b>10</b>, the heat is not applied to the substrate <b>10</b> repeatedly.

The first and second resist layers <b>20</b>, <b>30</b> don't lose adhesion even under a temperature during molding as described later, and they can follow to the deformation of the substrate <b>10</b> even under a temperature at the time of the molding.
