More specifically, the present disclosure relates to push-to-connect fittings with improved burst resistance.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conduits are used to carry a variety of liquids and/or gases. Couplings, connectors, and fittings are used to join the conduits in various ways so that the conduits can be arranged in different configurations to move media through the conduits. The conduits may be stiff or rigid as with metal or plastic pipes used in household plumbing applications, or the conduits may be flexible. Connectors are used for end-to-end connection of conduits, or they can route conduits at different directions relative to the conduit axis. For example, connectors can be employed to change the direction of piping, such as by a 45&#xb0; or 90&#xb0; angle with respect to a flow passage through the pipe to which the connector is connected. Connectors can also be employed to branch or split piping in different directions. For example, a single pipe section can be connected by a T-fitting or a Y-fitting or a multi-conduit joint or a change in diameter.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present disclosure relates to connectors for conduits with improved ease of assembly and coupling, among other benefits. Certain conduit connectors may be difficult to assemble or require special tools in order to couple the connectors to a conduit. For example, threaded connectors may require a wrench to hold one part while rotating a mating part. Thus, there is a need for a connector that does not require tools for coupling with a conduit, such that a substantially watertight seal may be achieved manually between the connector and the conduit without tools.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Further, some existing connectors require deformation to join two parts or to join the connector to the conduit. For example, the ends of garden hoses have an outer portion of a hose bib crimped around the outside of the conduit to connect the male or female hose bib to the garden hose. In some connectors, a user must manually deform an end portion of a sleeve so that two parts of a connector cannot move axially apart, thus securing the parts of the connector together. There is thus a need for a simpler connector that does not require manual deformation to join parts.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Some connectors are irreversibly coupled to a conduit and may not be removed except by destroying the connector. A welded or soldered pipe joint is a historic example of a permanent connector. However, it may be advantageous to uncouple a conduit and reuse the connector. There is thus a need for a connector that may be uncoupled without destroying the connector. The connectors according to the implementations discussed below address these issues.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is desirable that the fluid connectors not leak, as it may lead to loss of system pressure, or pooling of liquids, for example. The connectors according to the implementations discussed below is configured to provide a fluid-tight seal at least at pressures several times greater than the expected operational pressure of the tubular connector.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Various exemplary descriptions below contain instances of representative ranges, dimensions and/or tolerances for certain components.

The relative direction and term lateral or laterally are in a plane generally orthogonal to the longitudinal axis.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Referring generally to the Figures, a connector assembly (e.g., plumbing fitting, push-to-connect fitting, etc.) <b>120</b> is shown. The connector assembly <b>120</b> is configured for sealingly engaging (e.g., forming a substantially watertight connection with) an end portion of a fluid conduit, such as a copper pipe, PEX tubing, CPVC pipe, PVC tubing, and the like. The connector assembly <b>120</b> may be used with fluid conduits of varying diameters, including fluid conduits having a diameter less than 0.25 inches to fluid conduits having a diameter of greater than 2 inches or more.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">Referring generally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>26</b></figref>, the connector assembly <b>120</b> is shown. The connector assembly <b>120</b> includes an annular connector body <b>124</b>, a retainer sleeve (e.g., sleeve body) <b>128</b>, a sealing member (e.g., sealing ring) <b>132</b>, a protection ring (protection body) <b>136</b>, a grab ring (e.g., grab body) <b>140</b>, a cartridge (e.g., cartridge body) <b>146</b>, and a demount body (e.g., demount ring) <b>154</b>.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In brief, the connector body <b>124</b> includes a catch surface <b>210</b> at an end of the connector body <b>124</b>. The catch surface <b>210</b> extends circumferentially around the connector body <b>124</b>. The retainer sleeve <b>128</b> has at least one and, in this embodiment, a plurality of latches <b>310</b> extending inwardly at an end of the connector assembly <b>120</b>. The latches <b>310</b> engage the catch surface <b>210</b> to connect the retainer sleeve <b>128</b> to the connector body <b>124</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, four equally spaced latches are formed along the retainer sleeve <b>128</b>; however, different numbers and configurations of latches can be employed without departing from the scope of the present disclosure, such as two, three, five, or six latches equally or unequally spaced along the retainer sleeve <b>128</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The connector assembly <b>120</b> has other parts, as outlined above and in further detail below, held between and preferably contained within the connector body <b>124</b> and retainer sleeve <b>128</b>. For instance, the sealing member <b>132</b> is urged toward (e.g., compressed against) an inner shoulder <b>242</b> of the connector body <b>124</b> by an inwardly stepped projection <b>406</b> of the protection ring <b>136</b>. The grab ring <b>140</b> has an annular base <b>442</b> with a plurality of protrusions in the form of teeth <b>444</b> extending inward and distally toward the connector body <b>124</b>. The cartridge <b>146</b> has a tubular wall <b>448</b> proximate to a distal end of the cartridge <b>146</b> and a smaller diameter proximal end <b>450</b> opposite to the tubular wall <b>448</b>. The tubular wall <b>448</b> fits into a recess in the connector body <b>124</b> having an annular, inner shoulder <b>242</b> that limits the motion along the longitudinal axis <b>122</b> in the longitudinal direction. The tubular wall <b>448</b> extends along the longitudinal axis <b>122</b> and encloses the sealing member <b>132</b>, the protection ring <b>136</b>, and the grab ring <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">The demount body <b>154</b> is also located within the retainer sleeve <b>128</b> and includes a tubular proximal end (e.g., free end) <b>458</b> passing through the proximal end <b>450</b> of the cartridge <b>146</b> as the demount body <b>154</b> extends along the longitudinal axis <b>122</b>. A stop flange <b>460</b> is positioned between an inclined distal end surface <b>456</b> and the tubular proximal end <b>458</b>. The stop flange <b>460</b> contacts a second internal shoulder <b>462</b> of the cartridge <b>146</b>. The inclined distal end surface <b>456</b> may have a frustoconical profile that inclines toward the longitudinal axis <b>122</b> and inclines toward the connector body <b>124</b>. The inclined distal end surface <b>456</b> is further configured to generally conform to the conical shape formed by the inclined teeth <b>444</b> of the grab ring <b>140</b> and to incline toward the sealing member <b>132</b>.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">To further elaborate on the components above, the connector body <b>124</b> may be formed of metal material (e.g., brass, such as Bi brass, naval brass, Si brass; stainless steel, etc.); a plastic or other polymeric material suitable for the intended application, such as polyethylene, PPR, or UHMWP, or any combination thereof; a composite material; or any combination thereof. The fluid transported by the fluid conduit and pressures will determine the suitable material for the conduits and for the connector body <b>124</b>.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In some embodiments, the connector body <b>124</b> may be a straight-line connector body <b>124</b><i>a </i>or coupler (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>), a T-connector body <b>124</b><i>b </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>), an elbow connector body <b>124</b><i>c </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>), a blind-end connector body <b>24</b><i>d </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>23</b>A-<b>23</b>C</figref>) which blocks flow through the fluid conduit (similar to connector body <b>124</b>), a connector body configured to receive different diameter fluid conduits, an angle connector body <b>124</b><i>e </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>), a multi-line (or 4-way) connector body <b>124</b><i>f </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref>), a wye (Y) connector body <b>124</b><i>g </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref>), a tee-wye connector body, another type of connector body, or combinations of connector bodies. The connector bodies <b>124</b><i>a</i>-<b>124</b><i>g </i>may have a similar or the same catching arrangement to the catch surface <b>210</b>, so as to be complementary to the catch surface <b>210</b>. As indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>23</b>A-<b>23</b>C</figref>, the connector body <b>124</b><i>d </i>that is a blind-end connector body has an end wall <b>204</b> closing off the fluid passage through the connector body <b>124</b><i>d. </i>The end wall <b>204</b> forms a tube stop that limits movement of the fluid conduit through the connector body <b>124</b><i>d. </i>In some embodiments, the connector assembly can be incorporated as part of a plumbing device, such as a valve, gauge, etc.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">A first end <b>200</b> of the connector body <b>124</b> is slightly chamfered so it may resiliently urge the resilient laches <b>310</b> outward as the retainer sleeve <b>128</b> and the connector body <b>124</b> are moved relative to each other, until the latches <b>310</b> engage the catch surface <b>210</b>. It will be appreciated that the chamfering may be included on any one of the connector bodies <b>124</b><i>a</i>-<b>124</b><i>g. </i>An inclined exterior shoulder surface <b>216</b> adjacent the catch surface <b>210</b> may optionally be provided with the shoulder surface <b>216</b> inclined inward and toward the first end <b>200</b> so as to be aligned with the latches <b>310</b>. The shoulder surface <b>216</b> may prevent the latches <b>310</b> from being bent inward and may strengthen the latch-catch connection (e.g., connection between the latches <b>310</b> and the catch surface <b>210</b>) to better resist separation of the connector assembly <b>120</b> along the longitudinal axis <b>122</b>.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">Referring specifically to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an exploded, cross-sectional view of the connector assembly <b>120</b> is shown. The connector assembly <b>120</b> extends along, and is centered on, a longitudinal axis <b>122</b>. When the connector assembly <b>120</b> is fully assembled, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>-<b>13</b> and <b>19</b></figref>, all of the sealing member <b>132</b>, the protection ring <b>136</b>, the grab ring <b>140</b>, the cartridge <b>146</b>, and the demount body <b>154</b> are positioned between (e.g., interposed between) the retainer sleeve <b>128</b> and the connector body <b>124</b>. The retainer sleeve <b>128</b> and the connector body <b>124</b> are coupled together such that the rest of the connector assembly <b>120</b> (the sealing member <b>132</b>, the protection ring <b>136</b>, the grab ring <b>140</b>, the cartridge <b>146</b>, and the demount body <b>154</b>) is maintained in confronting relation to each other (e.g., pressed, compressed, sandwiched together, etc.) without each component being coupled together individually, such as by potting, adhesives, fasteners, latches, and the like.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The sealing member <b>132</b> is formed of a resilient material, such as rubber, EPDM, or other suitable elastomers. The sealing member <b>132</b> is shown as an O-ring with a circular cross- section. However, in some embodiments, the sealing member <b>132</b> may have various cross- sectional shapes, such as rectangular, oblong, pill shape, and the like. The inner and outer diameters of the sealing member <b>132</b> are selected to fit into and seal against the connector body <b>124</b> and to form a substantially fluid tight seal with a fluid conduit passing through the inner diameter of the sealing member <b>132</b>. In some embodiments, the inner shoulder <b>242</b> is configured to seal against the sealing member <b>132</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, the inner shoulder <b>242</b> is contiguous with the inner surface <b>240</b> at a curved corner <b>243</b>. A radius of the curved corner may be selected to conform to a shape and size of the cross-section of the sealing member <b>132</b>.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, the protection ring <b>136</b> is shown, according to an example embodiment. The protection ring <b>136</b> includes a first end <b>400</b> (e.g., proximal end) and a second end <b>402</b> (e.g., distal end) opposite to the first end <b>400</b>. The second end <b>402</b> is configured to fit inside the first end <b>200</b> of the connector body <b>124</b> to trap the sealing member <b>132</b> between the inner shoulder <b>242</b> and the protection ring <b>136</b>. The sealing member <b>132</b> is allowed to translate axially along the longitudinal axis <b>122</b> between the inner shoulder <b>242</b> and the protection ring <b>136</b>. In some embodiments, the sealing member <b>132</b> is allowed to translate a distance of 2-5 mm along longitudinal axis <b>122</b>. The second end <b>402</b> is preferably cylindrical as is the larger diameter, outer body of the annular, protection ring <b>136</b>, so as to form an annular, radially inward extending protection shoulder <b>404</b> acting as a stop that contacts the first end <b>200</b> of the connector body <b>124</b> to limit the relative axial positions of the protection ring <b>136</b> and connector body <b>124</b> along the longitudinal axis <b>122</b>.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">In addition, the protection shoulder <b>404</b> facilitates centering the protection ring <b>136</b> within the connector body <b>124</b>. When the protection shoulder <b>404</b> engages the first end <b>200</b>, the second end <b>402</b> extends a predetermined distance toward the inner shoulder <b>242</b>, thus defining 2-5 mm of axial movement of the sealing member <b>132</b> along the longitudinal axis <b>122</b>. In other words, the protection ring <b>136</b> includes a projection <b>406</b> extending away from the protection shoulder <b>404</b> that facilitates positioning of the sealing member <b>132</b> in the fluid passage along the longitudinal axis <b>122</b>. The extension of the projection <b>406</b> through at least a portion of the connector body <b>124</b> assists in supporting the received fluid conduit and assists in achieving higher pressure ratings (e.g., burst failure ratings) of the connector assembly <b>120</b>. Furthermore, the protection shoulder <b>404</b> reduces tolerance &#x201c;stack up&#x201d; that may affect the positioning of the sealing member <b>132</b> and the effectiveness of the sealing engagement between the received fluid conduit, the sealing member <b>132</b>, and the rest of the connector assembly <b>120</b>. Accordingly, the projection <b>406</b> assists during assembly such that calibration requirements may be reduced. Separately, the protection shoulder <b>404</b> extends radially outward only a short distance and less than the first portion diameter <b>209</b>.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">The protection ring <b>136</b> includes an inclined surface <b>410</b> inclined inward and toward the second end <b>402</b> of the protection ring <b>136</b> so as to generally align with the teeth <b>444</b> of the grab ring <b>140</b>. The inclined surface <b>410</b> forms a generally frustoconical surface. The axial length of the protection ring <b>136</b> and the inclined surface <b>410</b> prevent the teeth <b>444</b> of the grab ring <b>140</b> from contacting and damaging the sealing member <b>132</b>. The protection ring <b>136</b> can be made of a suitable plastic, e.g., including but not limited to thermoplastics such as nylon fiber.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the grab ring <b>140</b> is shown according to an example embodiment. The grab ring <b>140</b> is formed of metal, such as stainless steel, and includes a flat, radially extending base <b>442</b> and a plurality of teeth <b>444</b> encircling the longitudinal axis <b>122</b>. The teeth <b>444</b> are equally spaced circumferentially and are sufficient in number to resiliently engage an outer surface of a fluid conduit. The teeth <b>444</b> bite into an outer surface of the fluid conduit to selectively prevent the fluid conduit from being removed from the connector assembly <b>120</b> along the longitudinal axis <b>122</b>. The grab ring <b>140</b> is held between the cartridge <b>146</b> and the protection ring <b>136</b> when the connector assembly <b>120</b> is assembled. The first end <b>400</b> of the protection ring <b>136</b> engages a distal side of the base <b>442</b> while a first internal shoulder <b>452</b> on the cartridge <b>146</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) contacts the proximal side of the base <b>442</b>. The teeth <b>444</b> flex radially outward and toward the inclined surface <b>410</b> when the fluid conduit passes through the opening formed by the teeth <b>444</b>. One or all of the inner diameters of the protection ring <b>136</b> and the relative angles of the teeth <b>444</b> may limit the maximum diameter of the fluid conduit able to be inserted through the grab ring <b>140</b> and protection ring <b>136</b>.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, the cartridge <b>146</b> is shown according to an example embodiment. The cartridge <b>146</b> includes a second internal shoulder <b>462</b> extending radially inward of the first internal shoulder <b>452</b>. The first internal shoulder <b>452</b> forms an axially aligned face against which a stop flange <b>460</b> of the demount body <b>154</b> rests to limit axial motion of the demount body <b>154</b> relative to the cartridge <b>146</b> in one axial direction. A tubular proximal end <b>458</b> of the demount body <b>154</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>) is inserted from the distal end of the cartridge <b>146</b> until the stop flange <b>460</b> contacts the second internal shoulder <b>462</b> on the cartridge <b>146</b>. Thus, the cartridge <b>146</b> limits motion along the longitudinal axis <b>122</b> (in the proximal direction) of the demount body <b>154</b> and/or the grab ring <b>140</b>. The demount body <b>154</b> can move in the distal direction along the longitudinal axis <b>122</b> and can spread the teeth <b>444</b> outward to disengage the teeth <b>444</b> from the fluid conduit previously engaged by the teeth <b>444</b>. Thus, an application of force in the distal direction on the proximal end <b>458</b> of the demount body <b>154</b> may disengage the teeth <b>444</b> from the fluid conduit and allow removal of the fluid conduit from the connector assembly <b>120</b>. The cartridge <b>146</b> may be formed of a suitable strong polymer compatible with the fluid carried in the fluid conduit. In some embodiments, the cartridge <b>146</b> is formed of POM (polyoxymethylene).</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref>, the demount body <b>154</b> is shown, according to an example embodiment. When the connector assembly <b>120</b> is assembled, the demount body <b>154</b> is positioned within the cartridge <b>146</b> and configured to move axially along the longitudinal axis <b>122</b> while positioned within the cartridge <b>146</b>. An inclined distal end surface <b>456</b> of the demount body <b>154</b> is on a proximal side of the teeth <b>444</b>, while the inclined surface <b>410</b> on the protection ring <b>136</b> is on the distal side of the teeth <b>444</b>. The teeth <b>444</b> are interposed between the inclined distal end surface <b>456</b> and the inclined surface <b>410</b>. Advantageously, the inclined distal end surface <b>456</b> on the demount body <b>154</b> is configured to engage the base of the teeth <b>444</b> adjacent the base <b>442</b>. The demount body <b>154</b> may be formed of POM.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">To further detail the construction of the connector assembly <b>120</b>, the protection ring <b>136</b> advantageously has an engaging member <b>477</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) extending radially away from an outer surface of the protection ring <b>136</b> and configured for mating with another engaging part on the cartridge <b>146</b>. The depicted construction of the engaging member <b>477</b> includes a slight outward protrusion, preferably a slightly raised, circumferential ring with inclined leading and/or trailing edges. When the connector assembly <b>120</b> is assembled, the engaging member <b>477</b> is located within and configured to fit into a circumferential recess <b>479</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) in the inside of the tubular wall <b>448</b> of the cartridge <b>146</b>. Advantageously, when the engaging member <b>477</b> on the protection ring <b>136</b> engages the recess <b>479</b> on the cartridge <b>146</b>, the protection ring <b>136</b> and the cartridge <b>146</b> are held together to secure the grab ring <b>140</b> between the first internal shoulder <b>452</b> on the cartridge <b>146</b> and the first end <b>400</b> of the protection ring <b>136</b>. Moreover, the demount body <b>154</b> is preferably already seated such that the stop flange <b>460</b> engages the second internal shoulder <b>462</b> of the cartridge <b>146</b>. The snap connection of the engaging member <b>477</b> and recess <b>479</b> restrains the demount body <b>154</b> from moving out of the cartridge <b>146</b>. The demount body <b>154</b> can move axially between the second internal shoulder <b>462</b> and the grab ring <b>140</b>. The cartridge <b>146</b> and protection ring <b>136</b> may thus form a snap-fit sub assembly which restrains movement of the demount body <b>154</b> and grab ring <b>140</b> so that these parts may collectively move as a unit.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">The diameter of the tubular wall <b>448</b> is selected such that the tubular wall <b>448</b> engages the connector body <b>124</b>. When the cartridge <b>146</b> engages the connector body <b>124</b>, the grab ring <b>140</b> is coupled between the protection ring <b>136</b> and the first internal shoulder <b>452</b> on the cartridge <b>146</b>, and the demount body <b>154</b> is located such that the inclined distal end surface <b>456</b> does not urge the teeth <b>444</b> radially outward and away from the longitudinal axis <b>122</b>. Advantageously, the protection ring <b>136</b> extends into the connector body <b>124</b> and, as outlined above, allows the sealing member <b>132</b> to move axially along the longitudinal axis <b>122</b> about 2-5 mm before contacting the protection ring <b>136</b> or the inner shoulder <b>242</b> on the connector body <b>124</b>. The axial motion of the sealing member <b>132</b> is insufficient to allow the sealing member <b>132</b> to skew or tilt enough to become misaligned when the distal end of the fluid conduit contacts the sealing member <b>132</b>.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, a side view of the connector assembly <b>120</b> is shown, according to an example embodiment. The retainer sleeve <b>128</b> covers a portion of the connector body <b>124</b> when the retainer sleeve <b>128</b> is coupled to the connector body <b>124</b>. A portion of the cartridge <b>146</b> extends axially out of a proximal end of the retainer sleeve <b>128</b>, and a portion of the demount body <b>154</b> extends axially out of a proximal end of both the retainer sleeve <b>128</b> and the cartridge <b>146</b>. In some embodiments, the connector assembly <b>120</b> does not include the end wall <b>204</b> and fluid is configured to flow through both ends of the connector assembly <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, a distal view of the connector assembly <b>120</b> is shown, according to another example embodiment. The connector body <b>124</b> may include the end wall <b>204</b> such that the connector body <b>124</b> has a closed end that cuts off a fluid passage through the connector assembly <b>120</b> along the longitudinal axis <b>122</b>. In some embodiments, the connector body <b>124</b> has a center aperture <b>205</b>, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, which allows the fluid passage to extend all the way through the connector body <b>124</b>.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, a proximal view of the connector assembly <b>120</b> is shown, according to an example embodiment. The proximal end of the connector assembly <b>120</b> is configured for receiving a fluid conduit.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b> and <b>13</b></figref>, side cross-sectional views of the connector assembly <b>120</b> are shown, according to example embodiments. After assembly of the connector assembly <b>120</b>, a fluid conduit may then be inserted through the open end of the connector assembly <b>120</b>. The fluid conduit is inserted through the retainer sleeve <b>128</b>, through the demount body <b>154</b>, and through the tubular wall <b>448</b> of the cartridge <b>146</b> until a distal end of the fluid conduit passes through the grab ring <b>140</b>, protection ring <b>136</b>, and the sealing member <b>132</b>. In some embodiments, the fluid conduit contacts a hard stop, which stops relative axial movement of the fluid conduit along the longitudinal axis <b>122</b>. In some embodiments, the connector assembly <b>120</b> includes a tube liner <b>480</b> that is retained within the connector assembly <b>120</b>. The tube liner <b>480</b> assists in supporting the inner wall of a fluid conduit configured to be received by the connector assembly <b>120</b>. In this regard, the tube liner <b>480</b> would be located inboard of the demount body <b>154</b> and configured to receive the fluid conduit.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">The teeth <b>444</b> prevent the fluid conduit from being pulled out of the proximal end of the connector assembly <b>120</b>. An outer diameter of the fluid conduit is larger than the inner diameter of the sealing member <b>132</b> to form a substantially fluid tight seal. Depending on the amount of fluid seal or leakage that is desired or permitted, the interference fit between the sealing member <b>132</b> and the fluid conduit may vary. The sealing member <b>132</b> is advantageously allowed to slide axially in the cylindrical recess ending with the inner shoulder <b>242</b> being at a distance of about 2-5 mm along the longitudinal axis <b>122</b>. Alternatively, in some embodiments, the sealing member <b>132</b> may be pressed against the inner shoulder <b>242</b> by the second end <b>402</b> of the protection ring <b>136</b>. That is, the projection <b>406</b> may, for instance, extend to a position to compress the sealing member <b>132</b>. This may increase the integrity of the sealing engagement by the sealing member <b>132</b>.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">Further, to avoid accidental disengagement of the fluid conduit from the connector assembly <b>120</b>, the tubular proximal end <b>458</b> of the demount body <b>154</b> has an axial length selected to end with the proximal end of the retainer sleeve <b>128</b> and/or the cartridge <b>146</b>. Thus, the sleeve opening <b>368</b>, the proximal end of the demount body <b>154</b>, the tubular proximal end <b>458</b>, and the proximal end <b>450</b> of the cartridge <b>146</b> are in the same general plane. Advantageously, the demount body <b>154</b> is slightly distal of the plane through the proximal end <b>458</b> and/or proximal end <b>450</b>, by about 1 mm or less. The cartridge <b>146</b> contacts the connector body <b>124</b> and may be held stationary relative to the demount body <b>154</b>, which is configured to move axially toward the connector body <b>124</b>. To avoid accidental contact between with the proximal end of the demount body <b>154</b> and the grab ring <b>140</b>, contact that may reduce the gripping force of the grab ring <b>140</b> on the fluid conduit, the proximal end of the demount body <b>154</b> may sit flush with or slightly distal of both the first end <b>300</b> of the retainer sleeve <b>128</b> and the proximal end of the cartridge <b>146</b> such that the connector body <b>124</b> and the cartridge <b>146</b> resist axial movement of the demount body <b>154</b> when a force is provided over at least the demount body <b>154</b> to the cartridge <b>146</b> or the connector body <b>124</b>. In other words, the demount body <b>154</b> is positioned such that an external force being applied from at least the demount body <b>154</b> to the cartridge <b>146</b> will not allow the demount body <b>154</b> to move to a position to disengage the teeth <b>444</b> from the fluid conduit. On this basis, in order to release the fluid conduit, the connector assembly <b>120</b> may require a particular tool to engage the demount body <b>154</b> alone while not engaging another component of the connector assembly <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">To remove the fluid conduit from the connector assembly <b>120</b>, the demount body <b>154</b> is pushed axially along the longitudinal axis <b>122</b> toward the distal end of the connector assembly <b>120</b> (such as with a specific tool) and toward the connector body <b>124</b> so that the inclined surface <b>410</b> of the demount body <b>154</b> engages with and spreads the teeth <b>444</b> outward, disengaging the teeth <b>444</b> from the outer surface of the fluid conduit and allowing the fluid conduit to be removed along the longitudinal axis <b>122</b>. Thus, the connector assembly <b>120</b> is structured such that part of the connector assembly <b>120</b> encircles and prevents lateral movement of the fluid conduit relative to the connector assembly <b>120</b> and prevents removal of the fluid conduit laterally from the connector assembly <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">Advantageously, the connector assembly <b>120</b> allows parts (e.g., fluid conduits) to be arranged and snapped together for use relatively conveniently. The connector assembly <b>120</b> does not require manual deformation of any parts to create a substantially watertight engagement with a fluid conduit. The connector assembly <b>120</b> need only be placed on the end of the fluid conduit and either or both of the connector assembly <b>120</b> and the fluid conduit moved axially together in order to connect them such that the sealing member <b>132</b> provides a fluid tight connection while the connector body <b>124</b> (or <b>124</b><i>a</i>-<b>124</b><i>g</i>) allows the fluid conduit to be used in a variety of fluid connections. If a user desires to disconnect the parts, the demount body <b>154</b> may be used and pressed manually to disengage the fluid conduit&#x2014;e.g., a tool can be used to engage the proximal end of the demount body <b>154</b> and move it axially along the longitudinal axis <b>122</b> to release the grab ring <b>140</b> and disengage the fluid conduit.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">Beneficially, the latch opening <b>314</b> does not allow manual access by a user's fingers to release the latch member <b>311</b> from catch surface <b>210</b>. The use of two or more mating latches and catch(es) along with a tight fit of the retainer sleeve <b>128</b> around the enclosed parts makes it impractical to release the plurality of latches <b>310</b> sequentially from the catch surface <b>210</b>. Thus, disengaging the plurality of latches <b>310</b> from the catch surface <b>210</b> is preferably not achieved without special purpose tools or without permanently deforming at least one of the retainer sleeve <b>128</b> or the connector body <b>124</b>. Thus, the coupling between the plurality of latches <b>310</b> and the catch surface <b>210</b> is not a releasable (e.g., removable, selectively releasable) connection and may require deformation or breakage of the retainer sleeve <b>128</b> or the connector body <b>124</b>, which may result in a visible record (e.g., indicator) that the plurality of latches <b>310</b> was disconnected. In some embodiments, the plurality of latches <b>310</b> and the catch surface <b>210</b> form a permanent connection between the retainer sleeve <b>128</b> and the connector body <b>124</b> that cannot be removed without breaking the connector assembly <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">As outlined above, the connector assembly <b>120</b> may be formed from one or more materials. For high strength or high-pressure applications, it is believed suitable to make all parts of suitable metal, except the sealing member <b>132</b>. The material used for the fluid conduit will vary with the intended use, and may include metal pipes (e.g., copper, brass, iron), stiff plastic pipes (e.g., for plumbing), flexible tubes of plastic or flexible tubes of braided metal, and braided plastic or other braided materials.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, a side, cross-sectional view of the connector body <b>124</b> is shown, according to an example embodiment.

The first end <b>200</b> is configured to receive a fluid conduit, such as a copper pipe.

The sleeve opening <b>368</b> is sized to allow the proximal end <b>450</b> of the cartridge <b>146</b> to pass through. Advantageously, the fit between the sleeve opening <b>368</b> and the proximal end <b>450</b> of the cartridge <b>146</b> is snug (e.g., a slip fit) such that the retainer sleeve <b>128</b> radially supports the proximal end <b>450</b> of the cartridge <b>146</b>, which in turn supports the proximal end <b>458</b> of the demount body <b>154</b>, which further in turn supports the fluid conduit passing through the demount body <b>154</b>. The first end <b>300</b> of the retainer sleeve <b>128</b> includes a rounded reduction in diameter, shown as a sleeve chamfer <b>384</b>, proximate to the first end <b>300</b>. The sleeve chamfer <b>384</b> increases the radial and axial stiffness of the retainer sleeve <b>128</b>, allows a suitable clearance for the parts contained within the retainer sleeve <b>128</b>, and facilitates retention of the components of the connector assembly. By way of example, the first end <b>300</b> of the retainer sleeve <b>128</b> is shown as including a straight portion extending axially away from the sleeve chamfer <b>384</b>, which increases the strength of the retainer sleeve <b>128</b> and prevents (e.g., stops) unrolling of the retainer sleeve <b>128</b>. The outer periphery of the retainer sleeve <b>128</b> preferably conforms to the outer shape of the parts inside the retainer sleeve <b>128</b>, including the portion of the connector body <b>124</b> enclosed by the retainer sleeve <b>128</b>. Advantageously, the second end <b>302</b> of the retainer sleeve <b>128</b> overlaps a portion of the connector body <b>124</b>.

Each of the plurality of latches <b>310</b> extends radially inward from the inner sleeve surface <b>304</b> and toward the longitudinal axis <b>122</b>. Each of the plurality of latches <b>310</b> includes a resiliently flexible protrusion that is in the form of a rectangular tab. A latch opening <b>314</b> is positioned at a proximal end of each of the plurality of latches <b>310</b> and extends through the sleeve sidewall <b>303</b>. In some embodiments, each of the plurality of latches <b>310</b> includes an elongated member resiliently urged in a direction toward the longitudinal axis <b>122</b> and configured to engage the catch surface <b>210</b> when the retainer sleeve <b>128</b> is coupled to the connector body <b>124</b>. Each of the plurality of latches <b>310</b> is shown in a released position <b>313</b>. In the released position <b>313</b>, the plurality of latches <b>310</b> extends radially inward from the inner sleeve surface <b>304</b> at a first non-zero angle relative to the longitudinal axis <b>122</b>. In some embodiments, the first non-zero angle may be greater than 15 degrees, such as between approximately 15 to approximately 30 degrees, inclusive, or between approximately 20 to approximately 45 degrees, inclusive, such as approximately 28 degrees, inclusive, approximately 40 degrees, inclusive. In some embodiments, the first non-zero angle is a non-zero angle of five degrees or less. Accordingly, each of the plurality of latches <b>310</b> extends transversely toward the longitudinal axis <b>122</b> in order to extend into the connector body groove <b>230</b> and engage with the catch surface <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">Each of the plurality of latches <b>310</b> is cut into the sleeve sidewall <b>303</b> such that each of the plurality of latches <b>310</b> is integrally formed with the retainer sleeve <b>128</b>. In some embodiments, each of the plurality of latches <b>310</b> includes a rectangular profile. In some embodiments, each of the plurality of latches <b>310</b> includes a trapezoidal profile. In some embodiments, each of the plurality of latches <b>310</b> includes a rounded profile. After at least one of the plurality of latches <b>310</b> is formed with the retainer sleeve <b>128</b>, the at least one latch member <b>311</b> is bent radially inward toward the longitudinal axis <b>122</b>. The latch opening <b>314</b> in the sidewall <b>303</b> defines a latch end <b>312</b> (e.g., free end, proximal end, etc.) of the latch member <b>311</b>. Two parallel cuts <b>316</b> that are substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis <b>122</b> extend into the sleeve sidewall <b>303</b> and toward the latch opening <b>314</b> to define the remaining two sides of the generally rectangular plate forming the latch member <b>311</b>. Because the sleeve sidewall <b>303</b> is curved, the latch end <b>312</b> of the latch member <b>311</b> is slightly curved at the same general curvature as the sleeve sidewall <b>303</b>. When the retainer sleeve <b>128</b> is coupled to the connector body <b>124</b>, the curvature of the latch member <b>311</b> may approximate the curvature of the groove surface <b>232</b>. The curvature (e.g., radius) of the latch member <b>311</b> provides reinforcement to the latch member <b>311</b> and increases the burst failure pressure of the connector assembly <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">The retainer sleeve <b>128</b> further includes an end portion or area <b>326</b> proximate to the second end <b>302</b>. The end portion <b>326</b> extends between the second end <b>302</b> and the base of the plurality of latches <b>310</b>. A bend plane <b>328</b> is demarcated on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b> and <b>17</b></figref> with a dotted line to show the approximate position of the bend of the plurality of latches <b>310</b> (e.g., a base of the plurality of the latches <b>310</b>). With the retainer sleeve <b>128</b> coupled to the connector body <b>124</b>, the end portion <b>326</b> at least partially engages the second engagement surface <b>214</b> of the interference portion <b>212</b>. In some embodiments, such as when the sleeve diameter <b>308</b> is less than the second portion diameter <b>218</b>, the end portion <b>326</b> expands to the second portion diameter <b>218</b> such that an interference fit is formed between the retainer sleeve <b>128</b> and the connector body <b>124</b>. As a result, the end portion <b>326</b> is at least one of plastically or elastically deformed to correspond to the second portion diameter <b>218</b>.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">For example, the sleeve diameter <b>308</b> may be between about 0.001 and about 0.005 inches (approximately between about 0.0254 and about 0.127 millimeters) less than the second portion diameter <b>218</b>. When the retainer sleeve <b>128</b> is pressed onto the connector body <b>124</b>, the second end <b>302</b> of the retainer sleeve <b>128</b> engages the shoulder surface <b>216</b>, which facilitates expansion of the end portion <b>326</b> to the second portion diameter <b>218</b>.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">In some embodiments, the sleeve diameter <b>308</b> may be between about 0.008 and about 0.02 inches (e.g., between about 0.2 and about 0.5 millimeters) less than the second portion diameter <b>218</b>. As will be appreciated by a person of ordinary skill in the art, an interference fit with the aforementioned tolerance range is generally tighter than a standard and accepted interference fit. Herein, the terms &#x201c;enhanced interference fit&#x201d; and &#x201c;increased interference fit&#x201d; are used to refer to an interference fit that is tighter than an acceptable or typical interference fit (e.g., the shaft has a diameter that is greater than the traditionally accepted diameter for a hole of a given size). As understood by persons skilled in the art, forming an interference fit between two components outside of the accepted tolerance ranges can lead to a fit that is either too loose (e.g., a local interference fit, rigidity of the fitting may be compromised under load) or too tight (e.g., causing unintentional damage to the components during assembly and/or use, such as causing the shaft to ream a new hole, bending/breaking of the shaft, or cracking of the hole).</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b> and <b>19</b></figref>, the retainer sleeve <b>128</b> is shown before and after being coupled to the connector body <b>124</b>.

When the retainer sleeve <b>128</b> is coupled to the connector body <b>124</b>, the thin sidewall <b>303</b> of the retainer sleeve <b>128</b> allows the end portion <b>326</b> to flare radially outward to the second portion diameter <b>218</b> to form a flared portion <b>327</b>.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, the retainer sleeve <b>128</b> is shown coupled to the connector body <b>124</b> with the plurality of latches <b>310</b> shown in a locked (e.g., second, engaged, leveraged, etc.) position <b>315</b>. In the locked position <b>315</b>, the plurality of latches <b>310</b> is at a position, orientation, configuration, etc. (i.e., second position, orientation, configuration, etc.) that is different from the position, orientation, configuration, etc. of the latches in the initial, released position <b>313</b> (i.e., first position, orientation, configuration, etc.), with the second position, orientation, configuration, etc. of the plurality of latches <b>310</b> improving, increasing, etc., engagement between the plurality of latches <b>310</b> and the connector body <b>124</b>. For example, in the locked position <b>315</b>, the free end <b>312</b> of the latch member <b>311</b> may be spaced further away from the inner sleeve surface <b>304</b> of the retainer sleeve <b>128</b> in comparison to the latch member <b>311</b> in the initial, released position <b>313</b>. That is, a distance between the free end <b>312</b> of the latch member <b>311</b> and the inner sleeve surface <b>304</b> of the retainer sleeve <b>128</b> in the locked position <b>315</b> is greater than a distance between the free end <b>312</b> of the latch member <b>311</b> and the inner sleeve surface <b>304</b> of the retainer sleeve <b>128</b> in the initial released position <b>313</b>. Accordingly, the plurality of latches <b>310</b> have improved/increased engagement with the catch surface <b>210</b> on the connector body <b>124</b> (e.g., the increased distance between the free end <b>312</b> of the latch member <b>311</b> and the retainer sleeve <b>128</b> increases the area or portion of engagement between the latch member <b>311</b> and the catch surface <b>210</b> (or groove surface <b>232</b>), reduces the likelihood of partial or discontinuous engagement between the plurality of latches <b>310</b> and the catch surface <b>210</b> (or groove surface <b>232</b>), or increases the force of engagement between the plurality of latches <b>310</b> and the catch surface <b>210</b> (or groove surface <b>232</b>)). Further still, in the locked position <b>315</b>, the plurality of latches <b>310</b> may extend radially inward at a second non-zero angle relative to the longitudinal axis <b>122</b>, the second non-zero angle being greater than the first non-zero angle of the plurality of latches <b>310</b> in the initial, released position <b>313</b>.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">In some embodiments, the plurality of latches <b>310</b> are each biased radially inward (i.e., away from the inner surface of the retainer sleeve) when moved from the released position <b>313</b> to the locked position <b>315</b>. In some embodiments, the flared portion <b>327</b> of the end portion <b>326</b> is substantially maintained within the end portion <b>326</b> (e.g., between the bend plane <b>328</b> and the second end <b>302</b>). In some embodiments, the enhanced (e.g., increased, extreme, etc.) interference fit creates (e.g., imparts) a slight taper in the retainer sleeve <b>128</b> that extends beyond the bend plane <b>328</b> and toward the first end <b>300</b> when the retainer sleeve <b>128</b> is coupled to the connector body <b>124</b>. In some embodiments, the end portion <b>326</b> is flared radially outward at the second end <b>302</b> such that the second end <b>302</b> has a diameter greater than a median diameter of the retainer sleeve <b>128</b>. In some embodiments, the flared portion <b>327</b> extends radially away from the longitudinal axis <b>122</b> at a non-zero angle. When the retainer sleeve <b>128</b> is coupled to the connector body <b>124</b>, the second end <b>302</b> defines a third diameter <b>329</b> greater than the second portion diameter <b>218</b>.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">The flaring of the end portion <b>326</b> causes deformation (e.g., levering, bending, biasing, etc.) of the plurality of latches <b>310</b> toward the longitudinal axis <b>122</b>.

In the locked position <b>315</b>, each of the plurality of latches <b>310</b> is biased radially inward toward the connector body <b>124</b> to improve the engagement between the plurality of latches <b>310</b> and the connector body groove <b>230</b>. In some embodiments, the plurality of latches <b>310</b> bite into (e.g., sink into) the catch surface <b>210</b> (or into groove surface <b>232</b>) to improve the connection between the retainer sleeve <b>128</b> and the connector body <b>124</b>.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">When the end portion <b>326</b> engages the interference portion <b>212</b>, the transition of the plurality of latches <b>310</b> from the released position <b>313</b> to the locked position <b>315</b> facilitates an increase in the failure strength of the connector assembly <b>120</b>. In other words, when the plurality of latches <b>310</b> is in the locked position <b>315</b>, the ambient burst strength is improved (e.g., due at least in part to the increased engagement of the plurality of latches <b>310</b>) and the point of failure may be failure between the fluid conduit and the teeth <b>444</b> rather than at engagement of the retainer sleeve <b>128</b> with the connector body <b>124</b>.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">When the retainer sleeve <b>128</b> is coupled to the connector body <b>124</b>, the interference portion <b>212</b> engages with the end portion <b>326</b> and causes the second end <b>302</b> of the retainer sleeve <b>128</b> to flare outward with respect to the second portion diameter <b>218</b>. The flaring of the end portion <b>326</b> causes the plurality of latches <b>310</b> to deform (e.g., rotate or otherwise lever about the bend plane <b>328</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>) and engage with the catch surface <b>210</b> (or the groove surface <b>232</b>). The levering of the plurality of latches <b>310</b> can increase the engagement (e.g., are of engagement, force of engagement, etc.) between the plurality of latches <b>310</b> and the connector body <b>124</b>. In some embodiments, the levering of the plurality of latches <b>310</b> improves the burst failure strength of the connector assembly <b>120</b>. In particular, the retainer sleeve <b>128</b> and plurality of latches <b>310</b> collectively provide the connector assembly <b>120</b> with sufficient strength to reduce the likelihood of a burst-related failure.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">In some embodiments, the ambient burst strength of the connector assembly <b>120</b> is 1,800 pounds per square inch (psi) or more.

In some embodiments, the plurality of latches <b>310</b> is compressed into the connector body <b>124</b> with a separate process after the retainer sleeve <b>128</b> is coupled to the connector body <b>124</b>. For example, the retainer sleeve <b>128</b>, and specifically the plurality of latches <b>310</b> and the end portion <b>326</b>, may be joined to the connector body <b>124</b> (e.g., forced into the connector body <b>124</b> such that the retainer sleeve <b>128</b> is plastically deformed, such as by rolling, knurling, individually pressing each of the plurality of latches <b>310</b> into the connector body <b>124</b>, etc.). In some embodiments, the enhanced interference fit between the connector body <b>124</b> and the retainer sleeve <b>128</b> helps to reduce, inhibit, or prevent rotation of the retainer sleeve <b>128</b> relative to the connector body <b>124</b> about the longitudinal axis <b>122</b> when the retainer sleeve <b>128</b> is coupled to the connector body <b>124</b>.

Separately, the sealing member <b>132</b> is placed into the connector body <b>124</b> and the above-described sub-assembly is then inserted into the connector body <b>124</b> so the second end <b>402</b> of the protection ring <b>136</b> enters the cylindrical recess of the connector body <b>124</b> until the protection shoulder <b>404</b> contacts the first end of the connector body <b>124</b>. In this manner, the sealing member <b>132</b> is positioned between the inner shoulder <b>242</b> of the connector body <b>124</b> and the second end <b>402</b> of the protection ring <b>136</b>.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">At <b>510</b>, an interference portion, such as the interference portion <b>212</b>, is positioned circumferentially about the axis. In some embodiments, the interference portion is positioned circumferentially about the fluid passage. In some embodiments, the interference portion is coupled to the connector body. In some embodiments, the interference portion is formed into the connector body before or after obtaining of the connector body.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">At <b>512</b>, the retainer sleeve is positioned on the internal components such that the internal components are interposed between the retainer sleeve and the connector body. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b></figref>, the retainer sleeve is shown positioned on the cartridge <b>146</b>.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">At <b>514</b>, the retainer sleeve is pressed around the connector body and the connector body using a press <b>532</b>.

In some embodiments, the retainer sleeve is pressed around the interference portion such that the interference portion engages a portion of the inner sleeve surface proximate to the first sleeve end and causes the portion of the inner sleeve surface proximate to the first sleeve end to deform and expand in diameter to a coupling diameter greater than the inner sleeve diameter. In some embodiments, the press <b>532</b> is operated to push (e.g., press) the retainer sleeve <b>128</b> over the connector body <b>124</b>.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">In some embodiments, pressing the retainer sleeve around both the connector body and the interference portion forms an interference fit between the retainer sleeve and the interference portion such that rotation of the retainer sleeve relative to the connector body about the axis is prevented. In some embodiments, rotation of the retainer sleeve in relation to the connector body is substantially reduced, inhabited, or prevented by the interference fit between the retainer sleeve and the interference feature connector body.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">At <b>518</b>, each of plurality of latches are engaged with a catch surface of the connector body. More specifically, the retainer sleeve <b>128</b> is pressed onto the connector body <b>124</b> until each of the plurality of latches <b>310</b> engages the catch surface <b>210</b> to lock (e.g., couple) the retainer sleeve <b>128</b> to the connector body <b>124</b> and form the connector assembly <b>120</b>. At the same time, the end portion <b>326</b> of the retainer sleeve <b>128</b> engages the interference portion <b>212</b> and forms an interference fit such that the retainer sleeve <b>128</b> is prevented from rotating relative to the connector body <b>124</b>. In some embodiments, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b></figref>, the interference portion is interposed between the retainer sleeve and the connector body generally at or around the same time that the plurality of latches engage the catch surface of the connector body. Moreover, the plurality of latches <b>310</b> are moved from the initial, released position <b>313</b> to the locked position <b>315</b>, e.g., to increase engagement between the plurality of latches <b>310</b> and the catch surface <b>210</b>. While being retained by the catch surface <b>210</b>, the plurality of latches <b>310</b> extends in a transverse direction to the longitudinal axis <b>122</b>. Further, the end portion <b>326</b> of the retainer sleeve <b>128</b> engages the shoulder surface <b>216</b> such that the shoulder surface <b>216</b> causes expansion of the end portion <b>326</b> to the second portion diameter <b>218</b>. The expansion of the end portion <b>326</b> further causes centering of the retainer sleeve <b>128</b> about the connector body <b>124</b> and about the interference portion <b>212</b>.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">At <b>520</b>, the press <b>532</b> is disengaged (e.g., released) from engagement with the connector assembly.

A portion of the second engagement surface <b>214</b> may be uncovered and exposed to air after the retainer sleeve <b>128</b> is coupled to the connector body <b>124</b>. In some embodiments, the retainer sleeve <b>128</b> covers and is engaged with the entirely of the second engagement surface <b>214</b> such that no portion of the second engagement surface <b>214</b> is visible after the retainer sleeve <b>128</b> is coupled to the connector body <b>124</b>.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">Other additional process steps can be included and steps removed without departing from the scope of the present disclosure, e.g., the plurality of latches can be engaged, e.g., pressed in, by a mechanical mechanism to further improve engagement thereof.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">In a further embodiment, it would be appreciated that, for example, the retainer sleeve <b>128</b>, the protection ring <b>136</b>, the grab ring <b>140</b>, the cartridge <b>146</b>, and the demount body <b>154</b> form a sub-assembly during production. This sub-assembly may then be compressed onto the connector body <b>124</b> with the sealing member <b>132</b> positioned therein. During production of the connector assembly <b>120</b>, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure, the latch member <b>311</b> may require the above sub-assemblies to be compressed to allow the latch member <b>311</b> to engage with the catch surface <b>210</b>. That is, one or more of the internal components of the subassemblies may be compressed to a point that allows the latch member <b>311</b> to engage with the catch surface <b>210</b>. After the compression force is released, such as at <b>520</b>, one or more internal components of the sub-assemblies applies a tension force on the retainer sleeve <b>128</b>. This tension force locks each of the plurality of latches <b>310</b> against the catch surface <b>210</b>, thereby substantially preventing rotation of the retainer sleeve <b>128</b> about the longitudinal axis <b>122</b>. The engagement of the plurality of latches <b>310</b> with the catch surface <b>210</b> in this regard also assists in providing the forces necessary to sustain the integrity of the connector assembly <b>120</b> when a (high pressure) fluid passes therethrough.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">The above description is given by way of example, and not limitation. Given the above disclosure, one skilled in the art could undertake modifications that are within the scope and spirit of the present disclosure, including various ways of connecting the demount body <b>154</b> and the cartridge <b>146</b>. For example, an axial slot may be formed along the length of the demount body <b>154</b>. The slot may be sufficiently large such that the demount body <b>154</b> compresses enough to fit through the proximal end of the cartridge <b>146</b> and expand so the protection shoulder <b>404</b> engages the second internal shoulder <b>462</b> on the cartridge <b>146</b> to connect those parts. Similarly, while each of the plurality of latches <b>310</b> is integrally formed with the retainer sleeve <b>128</b>, and the catch surface <b>210</b> is integrally formed with the connector body <b>124</b>, the location of these parts may be reversed and other configurations of latches and catches may be used.
