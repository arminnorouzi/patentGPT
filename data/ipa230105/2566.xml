only after about a week and at a relatively moderate pace.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0198">In the extensive examples of active substance 1, the weight loss trend persists and even exceeds the 100% threshold of excess material-that is, at least part of the weight loss results from elongating the alcohol.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0199">The rate of adsorption/evaporation of the active substance 3 samples is the same as that of the active substance 2 samples and the trend of weight loss continues at a relatively moderate rate.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0200">In the extensive examples of active
