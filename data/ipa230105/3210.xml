The present invention also relates to a method using such a device.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">U.S. Pat. No. 5,509,501 relates to a device for delivering a fluid to a consumption point. It comprises a cover portion comprising a reservoir for receiving the fluid, and a base portion comprising a pump for pumping the fluid from the reservoir to the consumption point. The base portion also comprises a motor which drives the pump and batteries which provide electricity to the motor. The device also comprises control means to control the operation frequency of the pump.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">This device in the state of the art however is not entirely satisfactory.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Each consumption point has its own rate at which the fluid is to be provided. If one changes this rate, there is no possibility to know that such a change happened, and to keep a history of such changes. There is also no opportunity to detect possible anomalies without going to the device. And even like that, there is no indication of which types of anomalies exist.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another problem of this device in the prior art is that the control means is not protected against undesired changes. It is exposed to anyone who wants to change the setting of the control means, including those not allowed. Consequently the reliability of the device is undermined if unexpected changes are made to the control means.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is an aim of the present invention to provide a device for which maintenance work is easier.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">This aim is achieved according to the invention with a device for delivering a fluid to a consumption point, the device comprising:</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">a pedestal comprising:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0010">mechanical coupling means for mechanically coupling the pedestal to the consumption point,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0011">a connector having an upper port and a lower port in fluidic communication, the lower port being configured to be fluidically coupled to the consumption point, and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0012">an electronic control unit for controlling the delivery of the fluid to the consumption point,</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0011" num="0013">a movable casing configured to be mounted on the pedestal and comprising:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0014">a reservoir for storing an amount of the fluid,</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0015">a pump system for pumping the fluid out of the reservoir to the upper port of the connector,</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0016">fluidic coupling means for fluidically coupling the reservoir to the upper port of the connector through the pump system when the movable casing is mounted on the pedestal,</li>        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0017">electrical coupling means for electrically coupling the movable casing to the pedestal when the movable casing is mounted on the pedestal,</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0012" num="0018">With the device of the invention, the electronic control unit in the pedestal plays a central role in its operation. The electronic control unit determines whether the pumping system pumps the fluid from the reservoir to the connector so as to provide the fluid to the consumption point. In addition, the electronic control unit can keep a record of the changes made to the setting of the device, giving a user a historical overview of the device. For example, with the record a user can know whether the rate of the fluid to the consumption point has been increased or decreased. Thanks to the electronic control unit, it is also possible to monitor different parameters linked to the operation of the delivery device, and detect possible faults. The electronic control unit is incorporated in the pedestal that remains at a given consumption point. Therefore, even when the movable casing is removed, for instance for refilling the reservoir, the settings linked to the pumping functions can remain unchanged.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0019">The electronic control unit that is incorporated in the pedestal can be rendered inaccessible, even when the movable casing is removed. This prevents the settings from being modified against undesired changes.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0020">The device of the present invention may comprise one or several of the following features under all technically possible combinations:</p><p id="p-0015" num="0021">the electronic control unit comprises a switch for controlling the operation of the pump system, the switch being preferably a dual in-line package switch or a rotary encoder.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0022">the pedestal has an upper surface around the upper port and a lower surface around the lower port, the switch being located on the upper surface of the pedestal such that when the pedestal is connected to the movable casing, the switch is unreachable to a user.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0023">Consequently, once the movable casing is mounted on the pedestal it is impossible to alter the switch which would change the setting of the pump system.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0024">the electronic control unit comprises a wireless communication module able to receive wireless instruction for the operation of the pump system or to send information on the operation of the pump system.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0025">The wireless communication module allows a user to change the setting of the pump system without actually using the switch, or to monitor the measured parameters at a distance from the device.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0026">the movable casing comprises a power source for supplying power to the pump system.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0027">the electronic control unit comprises at least a sensor configured to sample a parameter of the movable casing.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0028">The sensor measures the operation parameters of the device more precisely than an operator may do. It may also allow measurements to be carried out at a higher frequency. Furthermore, the data from the sensor(s) may be coupled with other components of the device to automate the operation of the device.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0029">at least one sensor is able to send measured parameters via the wireless communication module.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0030">A user can therefore monitor the measured parameters at a distance from the device.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0031">the sensor is a voltage sensor of the power source, or an electric current sensor of the pump system, or an accelerometer, or a proximity sensor able to detect the presence of an operator, or a touch sensor able to detect the presence of an operator, or a magnetic sensor able to detect the presence of an operator.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0032">the pedestal comprises at least an alarm able to emit a sound or a flashing light when the sensor measures a value of the parameter outside a pre-determined range.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0033">This notifies a user of potential operational anomalies of the device by sound signals.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0034">the pedestal is made of a transparent material, the pedestal comprising at least one light able to indicate an operation condition of the movable casing, or able to confirm an interaction with the operator.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0035">The light gives a visual indication of an operation condition of the movable casing, or able to confirm the interaction of the device with a user.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0036">the movable casing comprises at least an internal port configured to receive electric power and pass power on to the pump system.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0037">the pedestal comprises a connector port configured to receive electric power from outside the device, and/or receive data from outside the device, and/or send data of the device away from the device.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0038">the upper port of the connector is threaded, the movable casing comprising a threaded hole configured to cooperate with the threaded upper port of the connector such that the pedestal can be fluidically coupled to the movable casing by screwing the threaded hole of the movable casing onto the threaded upper port of the connector.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0039">The threads preferably ensure an airtight connection between the pedestal and the movable casing.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0040">The present invention also concerns a method of using a device as described above, comprising the following steps:</p><p id="p-0035" num="0041">fluidically coupling the lower port of the connector to the consumption point, and mechanically coupling the pedestal to the consumption point,</p><p id="p-0036" num="0042">fluidically coupling the reservoir to the upper port of the connector through the pump system by the fluidic coupling means,</p><p id="p-0037" num="0043">positioning and mounting the movable casing on the pedestal,</p><p id="p-0038" num="0044">the pump system pumping the fluid out of the reservoir to the upper port of the connector,</p><p id="p-0039" num="0045">the fluid flowing in the connector from the upper port to the consumption point, the electronic control unit controlling the delivery of the fluid to the consumption point.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0046">According to various embodiments of the invention, the method may comprise the following steps:</p><p id="p-0041" num="0047">detaching the movable casing from the upper port of the connector while the pedestal remains attached to the consumption point,</p><p id="p-0042" num="0048">coupling another movable casing to the upper port of the connector.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0049">Since the setting of the device is kept in the electronic control unit, keeping the pedestal attached to the consumption point while the movable casings are changed means that the setting of a new movable casing is still adapted to the consumption point in question. Avoided are the situations where each movable casing needs to be individually set up before it is mounted onto the pedestal.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0050">The method may comprise a step of setting up the switch before coupling the movable casing to the upper port of the connector.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0045" num="0051">The invention will be further explained by means of the following description and the appended figures.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a perspective view from above of one embodiment of the device, with the shell of the movable casing partially removed;</p><p id="p-0047" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a perspective view from below of the device in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>; and</p><p id="p-0048" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is an exploded view of the pedestal according to one embodiment of the invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0049" num="0055">The present invention will be described with respect to particular embodiments and with reference to certain drawings but the invention is not limited thereto but only by the claims.

According to a preferred embodiment, the mechanical coupling means is the connector <b>28</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0066">The connector <b>28</b> has an upper port <b>62</b> and a lower port <b>64</b> in fluidic communication.

When a fluid leak occurs in the movable casing <b>14</b>, the fluid channel <b>66</b> ensures that leaked fluid is channeled outside the pedestal <b>12</b> without contacting the electronic control unit <b>30</b>, thus better protecting the latter.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0068">The connector <b>28</b> is for example made in brass. The connector <b>28</b> is for example in one single piece.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0069">Preferably, when the movable casing <b>14</b> is not mounted on the pedestal <b>12</b>, the pedestal <b>12</b> is able to rotate freely around the connector <b>28</b>, and preferably also to slide up and down within a short range along the connector <b>28</b>. These features allow the internal port <b>88</b> and the pin <b>90</b> to keep aligned when the movable casing <b>14</b> is fixed to the pedestal <b>12</b> during the mounting operation, provided that keyed connection between the protrusion <b>92</b> and the notch <b>91</b> (see below for additional explanation on the keyed connection) is secured.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0070">As shown in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, the upper surface <b>20</b> of the pedestal <b>12</b> surrounds the upper port <b>62</b>.

Examples of maintenance are: refilling the reservoir, change or maintenance of some components such as the pump. Consequently, the numerical identity of the device <b>10</b> is by essence linked to the consumption point.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0076">Preferably, the electronic control unit <b>30</b> comprises a switch <b>68</b> (visible in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>3</b></figref>). The switch <b>68</b> is configured to control the operation of the pump system <b>56</b>. For example, the switch <b>68</b> is configured to control the rate at which the fluid is provided to the consumption point.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0077">Preferably, the switch <b>68</b> is a rotary encoder, as seen in the Figures. As such a user can easily change the debit of the fluid provided to the consumption point by rotating the dial of the rotary encoder. According to one embodiment, the rotary encoder has at least two control positions. In one of the control positions the device <b>10</b> can only be set up wirelessly.

Consequently, once the movable casing <b>14</b> is mounted on the pedestal <b>12</b> it is impossible to alter the switch <b>68</b> which would change the setting of the pump system <b>56</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0079">In a preferred embodiment, the electronic control unit <b>30</b> comprises a wireless communication module <b>72</b> able to receive wireless instruction for the operation of the pump system <b>56</b>. The wireless communication module <b>72</b> allows a user to change the setting of the pump system <b>56</b> without actually using the switch <b>68</b>. According to one embodiment, the pumping frequency of the pump system <b>56</b> is determined solely by the instruction received remotely from outside the device <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0080">As an alternative or an addition, the wireless communication module <b>72</b> is able to send information on the operation of the pump system <b>56</b> away from the device <b>10</b>. This allows a user to monitor the operation of the pump system <b>56</b> remotely from the device <b>10</b>. Different modes of remote monitoring can be envisaged by a person skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0081">In the preferred embodiment, the electronic control unit <b>30</b> comprises at least a sensor <b>76</b> configured to sample a parameter of the movable casing <b>14</b>. The parameter may include the voltage of the power source <b>58</b>, the electric current through the pump system <b>56</b>, and the acceleration of the pump piston. As such the sensors <b>76</b> may be a voltage sensor of the power source <b>58</b>, and/or an electric current sensor of the pump system <b>56</b>, and/or an acceleration sensor of the pump piston, an/or a temperature sensor of the device <b>10</b>. When the reservoir <b>52</b> is low on the fluid, the acceleration of the pump piston is higher. According to one embodiment, the acceleration sensor is an accelerometer for the pump piston. The accelerometer is placed on the electronic control unit <b>30</b>. According to another embodiment, the acceleration sensor is a microphone (not represented on the Figures). The microphone is located in the pedestal <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0082">According to one embodiment of the invention, the sensor(s) <b>76</b> may include a proximity sensor able to detect the presence of an authorized operator near the device <b>10</b>, within a preset distance from the device <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0083">The sensors <b>76</b> can also include a touch sensor, activated when the operator touches the lower surface <b>22</b> of the pedestal <b>12</b> for a preset duration.

The magnetic sensor (on a telescopic stick) can be used when the device <b>10</b> is not easily reachable by hand.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0084">According to one embodiment of the invention, the electronic control unit <b>30</b> is able to determine the operation condition of the device <b>10</b> from the parameter(s) measured by the sensor(s) <b>76</b>. For example, if all the parameters measured by the sensors <b>76</b> remain within their pre-determined ranges, the electronic control unit <b>30</b> determines that the device <b>10</b> is operating normally.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0085">Preferably, at least one sensor <b>76</b> is able to send measured parameters via the wireless communication module <b>72</b> or the connector port <b>40</b>. A user can therefore monitor the measured parameters remotely from the device <b>10</b>. Different modes of remote monitoring are known by the skilled person. The range of the signal will depend not only on the emitter but also on the receptor, as well as the environment. For LoRa (abbreviation of Long Range) technology currently overseen by LoRa Alliance, ranges of several kilometres are possible. The final interface is aimed to be accessible anywhere through a smartphone, tablet, or computer terminal, using for example a server between the receptor and the interface. Then there is no limitation of distance anymore provided that the right environment is provided to the emitter.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0086">The alarm <b>36</b> is able to emit a flashing light when the sensor <b>76</b> measures a value of the parameter outside a pre-determined range. In addition or as an alternative, the alarm <b>36</b> is configured to emit a sound when a sensor <b>76</b> measures a value of a parameter outside a pre-determined range. This notifies a user of potential operational anomalies of the device <b>10</b> by sound signals. For example, when the voltage sensor of the power source <b>58</b> detects that the value is too low, the alarm <b>36</b> emits a first type of sound, such as a continuous beep with a higher frequency f<sub>1</sub>. As another example, when the electric current sensor of the pump system <b>56</b> detects that the value is too low, the alarm <b>36</b> emits a second type of sound, such as emitting beeps at regular intervals. Still as another example, when the acceleration sensor of the pump piston detects accelerations whose amplitude surpasses a threshold, the alarm <b>36</b> emits a third type of sound, such as a continuous beep at a lower frequency f<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0087">According to one embodiment, the electronic control unit <b>30</b> is able save the operation history of the alarm <b>36</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0088">The light <b>38</b> is able to indicate an operation condition of the movable casing <b>14</b>, or able to confirm the interaction of the device <b>10</b> with a user.

According to one embodiment, these four lights <b>38</b> are identical RGB LED. They achieve redundancy along the circumference of the pedestal <b>12</b> such that their light can be seen all around the pedestal <b>12</b>.

A first red colour, is configured to light up when the current sensor detects that the current going through the pump system <b>56</b>, for example going through the motor of the pump system <b>56</b>, is below a threshold. A second yellow colour, is configured to light up when the voltage sensor detects that the voltage of the power source <b>58</b> falls below a threshold. A third blue colour, is configured to light up when the accelerometer detects that acceleration of the pump piston exceeds a threshold. Alternatively or in addition, the third colour is configured to light up when the temperature of the pump system <b>56</b> exceeds a threshold. A fourth green colour is configured to flash at regular intervals, for example every five minutes, if the device <b>10</b> is operating normally.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0092">Preferably, the pedestal <b>12</b> also comprises a light of coupling able to indicate the state of coupling between the pedestal <b>12</b> and the movable casing <b>14</b>.
