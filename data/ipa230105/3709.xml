APPLICATION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to European Patent Application No. 21182695.3, filed on Jun. 30, 2021, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present inventive concept relates to a method of operating a pore field-effect transistor sensor for detecting particles. In particular, the present inventive concept relates to detecting particles with a high sensitivity in a pore field-effect transistor.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Field-effect transistors (FETs) having a pore are known for use in sensing of particles, such as sensing of single molecules. The pore is used for gating the FET such that when a single molecule is passed through the pore, a current modulation of the FET can be achieved. Thus, a pore FET sensor can be formed, wherein translocation of a single molecule through the pore can affect gating of the FET for allowing detection of the single molecule.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In Rui&#x107; et al, &#x201c;Design and Modeling of a Nanopore Transistor&#x201d;, Single-Molecule Sensors and nanoSystems International Conference (S3IC), Nov. 9-11, 2020, pages 1-4, a nanopore FET is disclosed, wherein the nanopore FET is a transistor wrapped around a nanopore connecting two electrolyte reservoirs. The nanopore FET can detect analyte molecules passing through the nanopore as a change in a source-drain current of the nanopore FET. Designing dimensions of the nanopore FET involves optimizing geometry for formation of a carrier channel in semiconductor around the pore while avoiding leakage current from source to drain. Optimal sensitivity can be expected when potential perturbations by molecules in the nanopore impact electron density in the channel maximally. Sensitivity of the nanopore FET can be defined as maximal change in current due to presence of the molecule normalized by magnitude of the current. Rui&#x107; et al discloses that signals (of molecules) can exceed 20%.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, although Rui&#x107; et al discusses optimization of sensitivity of the nanopore FET sensor, there is still a need to improve sensitivity in comparison to signals exceeding 20% as reported by Rui&#x107; et al.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An objective of the present inventive concept is to provide a method for operating a pore field-effect transistor to provide a high sensitivity to movement of particles through the pore.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">This and other objectives are at least partly met by the invention as defined in the independent claims. Preferred embodiments are set out in the dependent claims.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to an aspect of the present inventive concept, there is provided method of operating a pore field-effect transistor sensor for detecting particles, wherein the pore field-effect transistor sensor comprises a field-effect transistor having a source, a drain, a dielectric, a gate, and a channel region between the source and the drain, wherein the gate is controlled by a pore filled by an electrically conducting fluid and the pore is configured to extend from a first side to a second side to provide gating of the field-effect transistor from within the pore, and wherein the pore field-effect transistor sensor further comprises a first electrode for setting a first voltage at the first side of the pore and a second electrode for setting a second voltage at the second side of the pore, wherein said method comprises: controlling the first voltage to set the field-effect transistor in a subthreshold region; controlling the second voltage to set a voltage difference between the first voltage and the second voltage such that an effective difference in gate voltage of the field-effect transistor experienced between a minimum effective gate voltage and a maximum effective gate voltage during movement of a particle to be detected in the fluid, wherein the movement of the particle to be detected includes the particle to be detected being outside the pore and being passed through the pore, is at least kT/q, where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature of the field-effect transistor, and q is the electron charge; and detecting a drain-source current in the field-effect transistor, wherein the particle to be detected passing through the fluid in the pore is configured to modulate the drain-source current for detecting presence of the particle.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is an insight of the present inventive concept that sensitivity of a pore field-effect transistor (FET) sensor for detecting particles may be significantly increased by a particular mode of operation of the pore FET sensor. In particular, a signal provided when a particle is present in the pore may be at a completely different level of magnitude compared to a signal when no particle is present in the pore, such that the sensitivity of the sensor is high and that particles may be accurately detected using the pore FET sensor.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to the present inventive concept, the FET is set into a subthreshold region. This implies that, if the FET is an n-channel FET, a gate-to-source voltage of the FET is below a threshold voltage. Similarly, if the FET is a p-channel FET, a source-to-gate voltage of the FET is below a threshold voltage. Discussion below will mainly be done in relation to an n-channel FET to discuss the gate-to-source voltage being below the threshold voltage, but it should be realized that the FET may alternatively be a p-channel FET and that, in such case, a source-to-gate voltage of the FET is instead below a threshold voltage. The threshold voltage may be defined as a voltage level at which the channel of the FET is turned on so as to allow a current to be easily conducted between drain and source. However, even in the subthreshold region, a current between drain and source will occur. In the subthreshold region, the current varies exponentially with the gate voltage.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is an insight of the present inventive concept that, when operating the FET in the subthreshold region, a difference in voltages applied to electrodes on opposite sides of the pore can be set such that an effective difference in gate voltage during movement of a particle to be detected in the fluid allows sensing the particle with a very high sensitivity.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">When the effective difference in gate voltage between a maximum effective gate voltage and a minimum effective gate voltage is at least kT/q, impact of a particle in the pore will be boosted. This is because an exponent factor of the drain-source current will be larger than 1, since the drain-source current is dependent on e<sup>V</sup><sup><sub2>g</sub2></sup><sup>/V</sup><sup><sub2>t </sub2></sup>where V<sub>g </sub>is the gate voltage and V<sub>t </sub>is a thermal voltage that equals kT/q. Thus, the minimum effective difference in gate voltage of at least kT/q ensures that an exponential boosting in drain-source current between the maximum and minimum effective gate voltage is provided. This implies that a strong signal can be provided by the particle to be detected passing the pore such that the particle can be detected with a high sensitivity ensuring that the particle is accurately detected over noise in the sensor.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Thanks to the present inventive concept, the pore FET sensor may be operated to ensure a high sensitivity for detecting particles. The pore FET sensor may further be improved by design of characteristics of the pore FET sensor. However, since the sensitivity of the pore FET sensor is high, there may not be a need to e.g. optimizing geometry for formation of a carrier channel in semiconductor in order to ensure that the signal from the particle to be detected is sufficiently strong to allow accurate detection over noise.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">As used herein, the term &#x201c;pore field-effect transistor&#x201d; should be construed as a FET, wherein a pore is used for providing a gate voltage to the FET. The pore could be separately arranged from the channel region of the FET. For instance, the pore could be provided with an electrode which is directly connected to a gate electrode of the FET arranged close to the channel region, such that a voltage of the gate electrode could be controlled by the electrode of the pore. However, according to an alternative, the pore may be arranged in relation to the channel region, such that the pore may control the gate voltage directly, whereby the gate material is represented by the fluid inside the pore. For instance, the pore may be configured to extend through the channel region.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The pore is configured to allow the particle to be detected to pass through the pore. Further, the pore is configured to have a cross-sectional dimension at least in one location of the pore, such that the particle to be detected blocks the pore to such an extent that potential perturbations within the pore are generated and the effective gate voltage of the FET is changed. Thus, when the particle to be detected passes through the pore, the effective gate voltage of the FET will be changed such that the drain-source current of the FET will be modulated. This enables detecting the particle being passed through the pore.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">A cross-sectional dimension of the pore may be related to a size of a type of particle to be detected. Hence, the pore may be dimensioned to be adapted for detecting a particular type of particle, such as a DNA molecule or one strand of a DNA molecule or a protein. The method may thus use a pore FET sensor properly dimensioned in relation to the particle to be detected. Typically, the type of particle to be detected is known, being a particle of interest, such that the pore FET sensor may be properly dimensioned.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The cross-sectional dimension of the pore may be small such that small particles to be detected will block a substantial part of the cross-section of the pore. For instance, the pore may be a nanopore, such as having a circular cross-section with a diameter less than 100 nm, but it should be realized that the pore may in other embodiments be larger, if larger molecules or particles are to be detected.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The pore is filled by a fluid during operation such that the particle to be detected may be transported through the fluid for passing through the pore. A sample to be analyzed may be inserted into the fluid which is previously provided in the pore FET sensor. Alternatively, the sample may be introduced with the fluid into the pore FET sensor. The fluid (and the sample) may further be removed from the pore FET sensor and replaced so as to allow the pore FET sensor to analyze further samples.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Each sample may comprise a plurality of particles to be detected. The pore may be sized in relation to the particles to be detected such that two particles cannot pass in parallel through the pore, but rather pass in sequence through the pore. Additionally or alternatively, the pore FET sensor may comprise a control element at an entry into the pore, which control element ensures that a single particle to be detected is entered at a time into the pore.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The FET is beneficially a metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) to provide current through the transistor in the subthreshold region.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">For an n-channel FET, the second voltage is more negative than the first voltage. The first voltage is controlled to set the FET in the subthreshold region. Then, the second voltage should be more negative than the first voltage such that the second voltage also ensures that the FET is in the subthreshold region. For a p-channel FET, the second voltage is more positive than the first voltage to ensure that the FET is in the subthreshold region.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The minimum effective gate voltage may be defined by the second voltage, when the particle to be detected is at the first side of the pore. In this case, the particle to be detected blocks the pore at the first side, such that the second voltage may control the voltage through the pore. However, it should be realized that the minimum effective gate voltage need not in this case be exactly equal to the second voltage, because e.g. entrance of the pore represents a resistance. This implies that there may be a drop in electrical potential through the pore. Similarly, the maximum effective gate voltage may be defined by the first voltage, when the particle to be detected is at the second side of the pore.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">However, it should be realized that the minimum and maximum effective gate voltage may instead be defined when no particle is present in the pore and when the particle to be detected is configured to substantially block a cross-section of the pore. This may for instance occur when the pore has a non-uniform cross-section such that the particle to be detected will only substantially affect the gate voltage when the particle to be detected is arranged at an end of the pore having a smallest cross-section.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The effective difference in gate voltage need not correspond to the difference between the first voltage and the second voltage, since, as mentioned above, there may be a drop in electrical potential through the pore such that the maximum and minimum effective gate voltages are not necessarily directly defined by the first voltage and the second voltage, respectively.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The source and drain may be biased by constant voltages. The source may be connected to ground voltage. It should be realized that gate-to-source voltage is configured to control the FET and that &#x201c;gate voltage&#x201d; and &#x201c;gate-to-source voltage&#x201d; are used interchangeably herein.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to an embodiment, the voltage difference between the first voltage and the second voltage additionally drives the particle to be detected through the pore.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">It should be realized that the voltage difference between the first voltage and the second voltage may drive the particles to be detected through the pore. If the particles are positively charged, the particles to be detected may be driven from the first side to the second side of the pore towards the lower potential set by the second voltage. If the particles are negatively charged, the particles to be detected may be driven from the second side to the first side.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Also, the electrically conducting fluid may be provided with salt ions (or other ions) such that presence of an electric field in the fluid due to the difference between the first voltage and the second voltage may create a force on the fluid to generate a movement in the fluid that may drag along uncharged parts of the fluid, such as uncharged particles to be detected.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">This implies that the voltage difference provided for enabling detecting the particle to be detected with a high sensitivity may also control flow of the particle to be detected through the pore.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">However, it should be realized that alternatively or additionally, the driving of particles to be detected through the pore may be provided by in other manners. This may be particularly useful for driving uncharged particles to be detected.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">For instance, driving of particles may be provided by a pressure difference between the first side and the second side of the pore and/or by a difference in concentration of the particles to be detected or of ions in the fluid, resulting in a fluid flow through the pore dragging particles to be detected along the fluid flow.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">It should be realized that detection of the particle to be detected may be facilitated by prior knowledge of a sign of a charge (if any) of the particle to be detected. However, this may typically be known.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">It should be realized that the current between drain and source may flow either from drain to source (for an n-channel FET) or from source to drain (for a p-channel FET) or even from source to drain in an n-channel FET if allowed by surrounding circuit, since the FET may typically have a symmetric design. The term &#x201c;drain-source current&#x201d; should therefore be construed as a current between drain and source which may either flow from drain to source or from source to drain.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">According to an embodiment, the pore is configured to extend through the channel region between the source and the drain.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The pore may thus be configured to extend in a direction transverse to a direction between the source and the drain. The pore may extend in an orthogonal angle to the direction between the source and the drain. However, it should be realized that the angle may differ from orthogonal, as long as the pore extends through the entire channel region from the first side to the second side.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">This implies that detecting of particles may be provided in a compact pore FET sensor with the pore arranged within the channel region.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">According to an embodiment, the method further comprises identifying the particle to be detected passing through the fluid in the pore by identifying a change in the drain-source current.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Thanks to the particle to be detected providing a modulation of the drain-source current, detection of the particle to be detected may be provided by identifying a change in the drain-source current.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The identifying of the change may involve identifying a difference of the drain-source current when the particle to be detected is present in the pore comparted to the drain-source current when no particle to be detected is present in the pore.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The identifying of the change may involve identifying a difference of the drain-source current when the particle to be detected is arranged at the first side of the pore compared to the drain-source current when the particle to be detected is arranged at the second side of the pore.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">According to an embodiment, the first and second voltages are controlled to set the effective difference in gate voltage such that a difference between a maximum detected drain-source current compared to a minimum detected drain-source current is larger than 100%, such as larger than 200%, of the minimum detected drain-source current.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Thanks to the effective difference in gate voltage provided by the present inventive concept, an exponential boosting in drain-source current difference between the maximum and minimum effective gate voltage is provided. This implies that the difference between the maximum and minimum detected drain-source current may be at least 200%.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Thanks to a large difference between the maximum and minimum detected drain-source current, the particle to be detected can be detected with a high sensitivity allowing accurate detection of the particle to be detected.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">According to an embodiment, the particle to be detected has a size in relation to the pore so as to modify electrical potential distribution in the pore such that location of the particle to be detected functions as a controller to set resistive values in the fluid inside the pore such that the location of the particle determines the resistive divider values and the effective gate voltage.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Hence, the pore and the particle to be detected are sized such that the particle to be detected blocks the pore to such an extent that the electrical potential distribution in the pore is substantially changed. This implies that the location of the particle to be detected along the pore between the first side and the second side controls resistive divider values such that the effective gate voltage is highly dependent on the location of the particle to be detected in the pore.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">According to an embodiment, the second voltage defines a minimum effective gate voltage of the field-effect transistor when the particle to be detected is passed through the fluid in the pore.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">This may be combined with the first voltage defining the maximum effective gate voltage when the particle to be detected is passed through the fluid in the pore.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Hence, both the maximum effective gate voltage and the minimum effective gate voltage may be provided when the particle to be detected is passed through the fluid in the pore. The maximum effective gate voltage may be larger than an effective gate voltage when no particle is in the pore and the minimum effective gate voltage may be smaller than an effective gate voltage when no particle is in the pore. This implies that a larger effective difference in gate voltage may be provided compared to if the minimum effective gate voltage is defined when no particle is in the pore.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">According to an embodiment, an electrolyte fluid is provided at the first side and the second side, and the controlling of the first voltage is provided by applying the first voltage to a first electrode in contact with the electrolyte fluid at the first side and the controlling of the second voltage is provided by applying the second voltage to a second electrode in contact with the electrolyte fluid at the second side.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Hence, the electrolyte fluid provides an electrical potential distribution between the first side and the second side of the pore.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">According to an embodiment, an area of a minimum cross-section of the pore is set in relation to the particle to be detected such that an area of a maximum cross-section of the particle to be detected is larger than 50% of the area of the minimum cross-section of the pore, if the particle to be detected is uncharged, and the area of the maximum cross-section of the particle to be detected is larger than 10% of the area of the minimum cross-section of the pore, if the particle to be detected is charged.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Thanks to the particle to be detected having appropriate size in relation to the cross-section of the pore, it may be ensured that the location of the particle to be detected functions as controller for setting the resistive divider values in the fluid inside the pore.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">A charged particle affects the electrical potential distribution to a higher extent than an uncharged particle, such that the charged particle could be smaller compared to the cross-section of the pore than an uncharged particle.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">According to an embodiment, the pore has a uniform cross-section along the extension from the first side to the second side.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">This implies that the particle to be detected may affect electrical potential distribution in the pore along translocation of the particle to be detected between the first side and the second side. In this case, minimum and maximum effective gate voltage may be defined when the particle is arranged at the first side and the second side, respectively.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">It should be realized that the pore need not necessarily have a uniform cross-section. According to an alternative, the pore may have a shape of a truncated cone, such that the pore provides a minimum cross-section at one end of the pore and a maximum cross-section at an opposite end of the pore.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">According to an embodiment, a length of the pore along the extension from the first side to the second side is longer than a length of the particle to be detected affecting the gate voltage.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Thanks to the pore being longer than the particle to be detected, the particle to be detected may not be arranged simultaneously at the first side and at the second side of the pore such that a substantial effective difference in gate voltage during movement of a particle to be detected in the fluid may be detected. This ensures accurate detection of the particle to be detected.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">It should be realized that a length affecting the gate voltage need not correspond to an absolute length of the particle to be detected. For instance, the particle to be detected may comprise a portion having a relatively large cross-section and further comprise e.g. a tail portion with a very narrow cross-section. In such case, only the portion with a large cross-section would affect the gate voltage such that the pore needs to be longer than a length of the portion of the particle with a large cross-section.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">A portion of the particle to be detected being relevant for affecting the gate voltage may be defined as a portion of the particle having a cross-section larger than 50% of the area of the minimum cross-section of the pore, if the particle to be detected is uncharged, or a portion of the particle having a cross-section larger than 10% of the area of the minimum cross-section of the pore, if the particle to be detected is charged.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">A portion of the particle to be detected being relevant for affecting the gate voltage may be defined as a portion of the particle where charge is distributed, when the particle to be detected is charged.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">According to embodiments, a length of the pore along the extension from the first side to the second side is longer than a length of the particle to be detected. It should be realized that the particle to be detected may be shaped like a sphere or a spheroid. In such case, the length of the pore may be longer than the length of the particle to be detected.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Although the length of the pore being longer than a length of the particle to be detected affecting the gate voltage may facilitate accurate detection of the particle to be detected, it should be realized that detection of particles to be detected may still be achieved, even if the pore is shorter than the particle to be detected.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">According to an embodiment, the method further comprises providing surface charges on a surface of the pore along the extension from the first side to the second side, wherein the surface charges are of an opposite sign to a charge of the particle to be detected.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Having surface charges on the surface of the pore implies that the fluid in the pore may exhibit charge carriers of an opposite sign. Hence, when the particle to be detected is moved through the pore, there may be a local depletion of charges of the same sign in the fluid. The local depletion is induced by the particle to be detected being arranged in the pore. This implies that the introduction of the particle to be detected in the pore may change the fluid current flow through the pore to a large extent so as to increase effective difference in the gate voltage when the particle to be detected is moved through the pore.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">It should be realized that providing surface charges of a same sign as a charge of the particle to be detected may also allow detection of the particle to be detected. However, detection may be more efficiently made if the surface charges and the charge of the particle to be detected are of opposite signs.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">According to an embodiment, a concentration of the surface charges is in a range of 1-10*10<sup>13 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Such surface charge concentration may advantageously increase effective difference in the gate voltage when the particle to be detected is moved through the pore.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">If the surface charge concentration is very high, the surface charges could cause a high ion concentration in the fluid in the pore, such that an impact of the charge of the particle to be detected on the effective gate voltage may be reduced and, hence, blockage of electrical potential distribution in the pore by the particle to be detected may be reduced. Therefore, the surface charge concentration should preferably not be too high.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">According to an embodiment, the method further comprises identifying multiple particles to be detected passing through the fluid in the pore forming a chain through the pore, wherein the length of the chain is shorter than 70% of a length of the pore along the extension from the first side to the second side.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Thanks to the pore being longer than the chain of multiple particles to be detected, there will not be particles arranged simultaneously at the first side and at the second side of the pore such that a substantial effective difference in gate voltage during movement of the multiple particles to be detected in the fluid may be detected. This ensures accurate detection of the multiple particles.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">According to an embodiment, the length of the chain is shorter than 50% of a length of the pore along the extension from the first side to the second side. This may further ensure accurate detection of the multiple particles.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">According to an embodiment, the particle to be detected comprises multiple labels bonded to sites of a long chain, wherein a length of the pore along the extension from the first side to the second side is shorter than 70% of a distance between adjacent labels among the multiple labels.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">By using labels, the particle to be detected may thus be very long, exceeding the length of the pore. Thus, the particle to be detected may modulate the drain-source current of the pore FET via label(s) bonded to the particle to be detected.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The label may comprise a molecule that is bonded to the long chain of the particle to be detected. The label may provide a charge and/or size so as to ensure that the site on the long chain with the label will cause an effective difference in gate voltage when the particle to be detected with the label is moved through the pore. The long chain of the particle to be detected may be sufficiently small such that portions of the long chain to which no label is bonded may not affect or may insignificantly affect the effective gate voltage of the pore FET.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Thanks to the pore being shorter than 70% of a distance between adjacent labels, there will not be labels arranged simultaneously at the first side and at the second side of the pore such that a substantial effective difference in gate voltage during movement of the particles to be detected in the fluid may be detected. This ensures accurate detection of the multiple labels bonded to a common long chain of the particle to be detected.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">According to an embodiment, the pore is a solid-state pore formed in a solid-state material.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Using a pore FET with a solid-state pore for detecting particles may ensure that the pore withstands being subject to the voltage difference based on the first voltage and the second voltage.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">According to an embodiment, a biological membrane is arranged at the first side of the pore and having a biological pore aligned with the pore for assisting in driving particles to be detected through the pore.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The biological membrane may control a speed of the particle to be detected through the biological pore in the biological membrane. In particular, in combination with an enzyme, a speed of DNA passing through the biological membrane may be reduced compared to if DNA passes through the biological membrane without the enzyme. Hence, the biological membrane may slow down speed of particles to be detected, which also implies that the speed of particles to be detected through the pore may be slowed down. A lower speed of the particle to be detected through the pore allows use of a lower sampling rate of the drain-source current in the FET, which may be used for improving a signal-to-noise ratio for detecting the particle to be detected.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In comparison to a solid-state pore, there is a higher risk that a biological membrane would break when being subject to a large voltage difference across the membrane. Hence, the biological membrane may be advantageously used in combination with a solid-state pore. The biological membrane may be arranged at one side of the pore, such that the biological membrane is subject to a smaller voltage difference than the voltage difference experienced by the pore. The biological membrane may thus be used for controlling speed of the particle to be detected, while the solid-state pore may be used for providing a pore that withstands the voltage difference caused by the first voltage and the second voltage.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">According to another embodiment, a biological pore may be attached and aligned with the pore without presence of a biological membrane. Further, the biological pore may be provided with an enzyme to regulate speed of DNA passing through the biological pore.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">According to an embodiment, the pore is provided with a thin dielectric layer at the surface of the pore along the extension from the first side to the second side, and wherein a surface of the channel region facing an electrolyte fluid at the first side and the second side, respectively, is provided with a thick dielectric layer.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">When the pore is configured to extend through the channel region, electrolyte fluid may be arranged in relation to a surface of the channel region. The pore then extends from a first side corresponding to the surface of the channel region to a second side, which may correspond to an opposite surface of the channel region. The electrolyte fluid being arranged in relation to the surface of the channel region implies that gating of the FET could be provided by potential of the electrolyte fluid in relation to the channel region. However, thanks to use of a thick dielectric layer (thicker than the thin dielectric layer at the surface of the pore), gating action of the electrolyte fluid is limited. This implies that the gating of the FET is dominated by the pore, such that the particle to be detected passing through the pore has a high impact on the gating of the FET.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">According to an embodiment, the gating action of the electrolyte fluid on the surface of the channel region is less than 10% of the gating action through the pore.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">According to an embodiment, the method further comprises calibrating the pore field-effect transistor sensor for setting a maximum sensitivity, wherein the calibrating comprises: setting the first voltage equal to the second voltage to obtain characteristics of drain-source current in relation to the first voltage; determining an off voltage value of the first voltage corresponding to a lowest measurable current of the drain-source current; determining a saturation voltage value of the first voltage corresponding to a transition from linear to saturation region of the field-effect transistor; biasing the first voltage using the saturation voltage value and biasing the second voltage using the off voltage value; iteratively increasing the first voltage and decreasing the second voltage until the gate voltage when a particle is arranged in the pore at the first side corresponds to the off voltage value and the gate voltage when the particle is arranged in the pore at the second side corresponds to the saturation voltage value; and determining first voltage value and second voltage value to be used in operation of the pore field-effect transistor sensor based on end values of the iterative increasing of the first voltage and decreasing of second voltage.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Thanks to such calibration, the sensitivity of the pore FET sensor may be optimized for the settings of the pore FET sensor (design of the pore FET sensor is fixed, the particle to be detected is known). This implies that the pore FET sensor may be set to be used with optimal values for the first voltage and the second voltage so as to allow detection of the particle to be detected with high accuracy.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">According to an embodiment, the pore is a nanopore having a cross-sectional diameter smaller than 10 nm.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Using a nanopore with a circular cross-section having a diameter smaller than 10 nm may be useful e.g. for detecting of DNA strands or proteins. For instance, when detecting DNA strands, a cross-sectional diameter of 5 nm may be advantageously used.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">It should be realized that the pore need not necessarily have a circular cross-section. Thus, the pore may alternatively be a nanopore with a cross-section having a dimension smaller than 10 nm. In this regard, dimension of the nanopore may be construed as a largest distance of a straight line within the cross-section, such as a distance between opposite sides in a square-shaped cross-section.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0092" num="0091">The above, as well as additional objects, features and advantages of the present inventive concept, will be better understood through the following illustrative and non-limiting detailed description, with reference to the appended drawings.

The channel region <b>116</b> may be controlled by a gate <b>118</b> so as to control a drain-source current through the pore FET <b>110</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the gate <b>118</b> comprises a pore <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">The pore FET <b>110</b> may be formed in a semiconductor material. For instance, the pore FET <b>110</b> may be formed as a silicon-on-insulator device. The pore <b>120</b> may be formed to extend through semiconductor material so as to form a solid-state pore formed in a solid-state material.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">The FET <b>110</b> is configured such that an electrical potential in the pore <b>120</b> defines a gate voltage for providing gating of the FET from within the pore <b>120</b>. This implies that, during movement of a particle <b>140</b> to be detected though the pore <b>120</b>, the electrical potential in the pore <b>120</b> is affected such that an effective gate voltage is changed, and the drain-source current is modulated. The particle <b>140</b> to be detected will affect the effective gate voltage when a charge and a size of the particle <b>140</b> is sufficiently large in relation to a cross-sectional dimension of the pore <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the pore <b>120</b> may extend through the channel region <b>116</b> so as to provide gating from a pore <b>120</b> extending within the channel region <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">The pore <b>120</b> is configured to have an elongate extension from a first side <b>122</b> to a second side <b>124</b>. Thus, a length of the pore <b>120</b> may be substantially larger than the cross-sectional dimension of the pore <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">The pore <b>120</b> may be a nanopore having a cross-sectional diameter smaller than 10 nm. As will be described below, the cross-sectional size of the pore <b>120</b> should be adapted to the cross-sectional size of the particle <b>140</b> to be detected such that the particle <b>140</b> can block a substantial portion of a cross-sectional area of the pore <b>120</b>. Hence, if small particles are to be detected, the cross-section of the pore <b>120</b> should not be too large. Using a nanopore with a circular cross-section having a diameter smaller than 10 nm may be useful e.g. for detecting of DNA strands. When detecting DNA strands, a cross-sectional diameter of 5 nm may be advantageously used.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">The pore <b>120</b> may provide a fluid connection between a first spacing at the first side <b>122</b> and a second spacing at the second side <b>124</b>. The pore <b>120</b> and the first and second spacings may be filled by an electrically conducting fluid, wherein the fluid is configured to define the electrical potential in the pore <b>120</b> which is affected by movement of the particle <b>140</b> through the pore <b>120</b>. The first and second spacings may be separated from each other except for the connection through the pore <b>120</b>. This implies that a difference in electrical potential between the fluid in the first spacing and the fluid in the second spacing causes a difference in electrical potential through the pore <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">The fluid may be an electrolyte solution, which comprises ions providing an electrical potential of the electrolyte solution. The electrolyte solution may for instance be an aqueous solution in which a soluble salt is provided, which dissociates in cations and anions to form an electrically conducting fluid. Also, hydrogen and hydroxide ions may be added or formed in the aqueous solution.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">The electrical potential at the first side <b>122</b> of the pore <b>120</b> may be controlled by a first electrode <b>126</b>, which is configured to be in contact with the electrolyte solution in the first spacing, whereas the electrical potential at the second side <b>124</b> of the pore may be controlled by a second electrode <b>128</b>, which is configured to be in contact with the electrolyte solution in the second spacing. Thus, by controlling the voltages applied to the first electrode <b>126</b> and the second electrode <b>128</b>, the electrical potential within the electrolyte solution and in particular through the pore <b>120</b> may be controlled.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the pore <b>120</b> may extend through the channel region <b>116</b> of the FET <b>110</b> with the first spacing and second spacing arranged on opposite sides of the channel region <b>116</b>. The channel region <b>116</b> may further be covered by a thick dielectric layer <b>130</b>, e.g. an oxide, so as to isolate the electrolyte solution in the first and second spacing, respectively, from the channel region <b>116</b>. Further, a wall surface of the pore <b>120</b> may be provided with a thin dielectric layer <b>132</b> along the extension of the pore <b>120</b> from the first side <b>122</b> to the second side <b>124</b>. This implies that gating of the FET <b>110</b> may be provided dominantly from within the pore <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">The thick dielectric layer <b>130</b> may thus be sufficiently thick in relation to the thin dielectric layer <b>132</b> so that an impact on the gate voltage is predominantly provided from within the pore <b>120</b> and less than 10% of a gating action of the FET <b>110</b> is provided through the thick dielectric layer <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">It should be realized that further layers may be provided on either side of the channel region <b>116</b> so as to provide further separation of the electrolyte solution from the channel region <b>116</b>. For instance, at one side of the pore <b>120</b>, a substrate may be provided. However, it should be realized that this may imply that the length of the pore <b>120</b> may need to be relatively long, as the pore <b>120</b> needs to extend through the substrate as well as through the channel region <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">Also, a dielectric stack may be provided comprising more than one layer of dielectric material. Further, a passivation layer may be provided between a dielectric layer and the fluid. The passivation layer could be used for creating a desired surface charge (as described below).</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">The thick dielectric layer <b>130</b> and the thin dielectric layer <b>132</b> may be formed from different materials. The materials may have different iso-electric point (pH value at which surface charge of the material is neutral). This may be used for achieving a change of sign of a surface charge inside the pore <b>120</b> compared to at a surface above/below the channel region <b>116</b> facing the first and second spacing, respectively.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, an alternative arrangement of the pore <b>220</b> in relation to the FET <b>210</b> will be described.

The pore <b>220</b> may then be provided to extend through a material layer <b>234</b> from a first side <b>222</b> to a second side <b>224</b>, with an electrode <b>236</b> formed by a conductive material arranged within the material layer <b>234</b>. The electrode <b>236</b> may be formed by a metal layer providing a highly conducting material. The electrode <b>236</b> may be a thin metal layer or a two-dimensional material, such as metallic graphene. The electrode <b>236</b> could be formed by a planar layer having a uniform cross-section throughout the layer, but it should be realized that the electrode <b>236</b> could alternatively have non-uniform widths or thicknesses. The electrode <b>236</b> may surround the pore <b>220</b> completely or only be arranged in relation to one side of the pore <b>220</b> (as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">The material layer <b>234</b> may be formed from a dielectric.

The dielectric material at the interface provides more stable operation of the sensor. The thickness of the dielectric material between the electrode <b>236</b> and the fluid in the pore <b>220</b> should be as small as possible to provide a good capacitive coupling between the fluid and the electrode <b>236</b>.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">According to an embodiment. the electrode <b>236</b> may comprise a combination of more than one highly conductive material, forming a stack of layers of different highly conductive materials. The stack may be arranged to face the fluid in the pore <b>220</b> such that a single material forms the interface towards the pore <b>220</b>. This may be particularly advantageous if the electrode <b>236</b> is in direct contact with the fluid in the pore <b>220</b>, as this may allow to optimize the stack of highly conductive materials for trade-off between high conductivity and good compatibility with the fluid, as one material will form the interface with the fluid and may be selected in view of compatibility with the fluid and other material(s) in the stack may be selected in view of highest conductivity.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">The electrode <b>236</b> is arranged at a distance from the first side <b>222</b> and the second side <b>224</b>.

The channel region <b>216</b> may be controlled by a gate <b>218</b> so as to control a drain-source current through the FET <b>210</b>.

For instance, if silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>) is used as the thin dielectric layer <b>132</b>, silanol groups form when the silicon dioxide is immersed in an aqueous solution (which may be used as the electrolyte fluid), and ionization of silanol molecules at the surface of the thin dielectric layer <b>132</b> would form negative surface charges on the surface of the pore <b>132</b> for a neutral (pH=7) solution. Charge density may have a dependence of pH value of the electrolyte fluid, such that control of pH value may provide a control of concentration and sign of the surface charges.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0172">It would also be possible to form positive surface charges on the surface of the pore <b>132</b> and/or to control the concentration of surface charges.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0173">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, a length of the pore <b>120</b> is illustrated in relation to a length of the particle <b>140</b>.
