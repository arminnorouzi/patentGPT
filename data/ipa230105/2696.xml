id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The disclosed technology relates to lubricants for driveline and industrial gears containing a mono-ester or a mixture of mono- and di-esters, as well as a method of lubricating driveline and industrial gears with such a lubricant.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Market demands are driving lubricating fluids towards lower viscosities in an effort to minimize energy losses due to mechanical operations. As fluids become less viscous, the base oil contribution to performance becomes increasingly more important. Performance attributes of base oils are highly dependent on the type of base oil chosen for a specific application. Mineral oils are derived from crude oil and therefore contain mixtures of aliphatic, cycloaliphatic and aromatic substances. Mineral oils have been categorized by the American Petroleum Industry (API) as Group I, Group II, or Group III based on their physical properties.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In contrast to mineral oils, synthetic oils contain molecules that are more consistent with respect to size and shape, the properties of which can be tuned by the selection of raw materials. Synthetic base oils are categorized by API as either Group IV or Group V oils. All polyalphaolefins (PAO) are considered to be Group IV base oils, while Group V covers any other synthetic base oil, such as mono and dibasic acid esters, polyol esters and alkylated aromatics.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Japanese patent application 2009023385A, filed by Tonengeneral Sekiyu Kk, teaches a method of reducing the traction coefficient for hydrocarbon-based synthetic oils, such as PAO, with a mono-ester. Similarly, US2018/0112148 published Apr. 26, 2018 to Bouvier et al. teaches a composition of a PAO and a mono-ester. Neither reference teaches or suggests that a mono-ester would provide any effect for a mineral oil based system, or that any particular result would occur with the combination of a mono-ester and di-ester. In fact, the Japanese reference expressly indicates that di-esters significantly increase traction coefficient.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. Pat. No. 9,976,099 to Kit Ng et al., issued May 22, 2018, teaches the use of aromatic mono-esters to help improve traction control. The reference does not teach or suggest the use of linear or branched mono-esters, nor the combination of mono-ester and di-ester.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 9,540,587 issued to Nakao et al. Jan. 10, 2017 and U.S. Pat. No. 10,227,541 issued to Masuda et al. Mar. 12, 2019 each teach a composition with improved viscometrics containing, among other things, a mineral oil and a mono-ester. The reference says nothing of improving traction coefficient, nor the combination of mono-ester and di-ester.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The choice of which base oil to use for an application is often dependent on cost, availability, and desired performance characteristics. Group IV base oils, or poly &#x3b1;-olefins, offer the most in terms of performance attributes, like traction. However, the cost and availability of high-end oils, like PAO, make them less than ideal. Enabling a lower treat rate of the Group IV oils, or the use of the more affordable and readily available group II and III type oils to provide improved low and high temperature traction, and/or improved viscosity index (&#x201c;VI&#x201d;) performance would be an attractive alternative.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The disclosed technology, therefore, solves the problem of reducing the overall treat of Grp IV base oils, and/or comparable performance between group II and/or III type oils and Group IV base oils by combining group II and/or III type oils with a mono-ester or mixture of mono-ester and di-ester.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It was found that supplementing group IV base oils with a percentage of a mono-ester made it possible to realize the benefit of the ester on performance characteristics, such as traction and friction, while reducing the treat rate of the group IV base oil. It was further discovered that the mono-esters made it possible to realize the benefit of the ester on performance characteristics, such as traction, while maintaining the majority of the base fluid as a low cost/low viscosity Group II and/or III oil. These discoveries were surprising and unexpected as the majority of accepted wisdom would direct those of ordinary skill in the art to employ more complex esters.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Thus, one aspect of the technology disclosed herein is directed to a lubricant composition containing a) a hydrocarbon lubricating base stock, and b) from about 1 or 1.5 to about 15 wt. % of a carboxylic acid mono-ester, such as, for example, ethylhexyl laurate. In certain embodiments, the hydrocarbon lubricating base stock can be a Group IV base oil, such as a PAO. In some embodiments, the hydrocarbon lubricating base stock can be a Group II base oil. In embodiments, the hydrocarbon lubricating base stock can be a Group III base oil. In embodiments, the hydrocarbon lubricating base stock can be a mixture of two or more of a PAO, Group II, and Group III base oil.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">It was also found that supplementing group II and/or Group III base oils with a combination of mono-esters and di-esters provided a synergistic result on traction over a broad range of operating temperatures, while maintaining the majority of the base fluid as a low cost/low viscosity Group II and/or Group III oil.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Thus, another aspect of the disclosed technology provides a lubricant composition containing a) a hydrocarbon lubricating base stock, b) from about 1 or 1.5 to about 10 wt. % of a carboxylic acid mono-ester, such as, for example, ethylhexyl laurate, and c) from about 1 or 1.5 to about 10 wt. % of a dicarboxylic acid di-ester, such as, for example di-isoctyl adipate.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">For example, the technology encompasses a lubricant composition containing an American Petroleum Institute (&#x201c;API&#x201d;) Group II, III or IV lubricating oil along with at least one of a lauric acid mono-ester, tallow acid mono-ester, oleic acid mono-ester, palmitic acid mono ester, and combinations thereof, as well as at least one of an adipic acid diester, azelaic acid diester, and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The technology also provides a method of lubricating a driveline device or an industrial gear with a composition as described, and operating the driveline device or industrial gear.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Various preferred features and embodiments will be described below by way of non-limiting illustration.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The technology includes a lubricant composition containing a hydrocarbon lubricating base stock, and a combination of esters, namely, a carboxylic acid monoester and a dicarboxylic acid di-ester.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="2">Hydrocarbon Lubricating Base Stock</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">One component of the disclosed technology is a hydrocarbon lubricating base stock.

Purification techniques are known in the art and include solvent extraction, secondary distillation, acid or base extraction, filtration, percolation and the like. Re-refined oils are also known as reclaimed or reprocessed oils, and are obtained by processes similar to those used to obtain refined oils and often are additionally processed by techniques directed to removal of spent additives and oil breakdown products.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Natural oils useful in making the inventive lubricants include mineral lubricating oils such as liquid petroleum oils and solvent-treated or acid-treated mineral lubricating oils of the paraffinic, naphthenic or mixed paraffinic-naphthenic types and oils derived from coal or shale or mixtures thereof.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Synthetic hydrocarbon lubricating oils suitable for use include Group IV oils or polyalpha olefins (PAO).

These samples contained a 50/50 mixture of mono-ester ME-1 and diester DE-6. Sample 23 contained Grp III base oil and a polymethacrylate viscosity modifier. Traction coefficient data for Sample 23 can be compared to Sample 1 with no ester and Samples 2 and 7, which contain only a single ester. Tables 5 and 6 list traction coefficient data recorded as speed was varied from 10-3000 mm/s for selected speeds of 50 mm/s (Table 5) and 500 mm/s (Table 6). Table 7 lists traction coefficient data recorded as the slide to roll ratio was varied from 0.025-100.
