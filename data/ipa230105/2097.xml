id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">A packaging plant comprising a plurality of modular apparatus for filling and closing randomly fed articles, in particular containers, and a method for packaging randomly fed articles.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">It is known that, in the technical sector relating to the packaging of products, for example in liquid, fluid or powder form, there exists the need to handle articles, in particular containers, which have different capacities and forms and which are fed to automatic operating machines such as filling, capping, and labelling machines, each respectively designed to fill, close, label, or subsequently forward the articles/products for packaging.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is also known that these automatic machines must generally be fed continuously, at regular intervals and/or at a predefined constant speed, namely in accordance with parameters determined by the requirements of the machines and by the production cycle for which they are designed and configured.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition, it may also be required that the containers should arrive at the automatic operating machines always in a certain&#x2014;generally upright&#x2014;position, i.e. with the filling opening directed upwards and/or with a specific orientation of their surfaces (conventionally identified as being front, side or rear relative to a longitudinal axis, the position of the filling mouth and/or the advancing direction through the machine), so as to allow correct handling of the article, for example necessary during the filling and labelling operations.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In this context, the packaging plants generally comprise a plurality of apparatus and machines comprising feeding apparatus&#x2014;conventionally called sorting apparatus&#x2014;which, starting with articles, such as containers arranged randomly in special hoppers&#x2014;are able to sort and feed the containers in an ordered sequence and/or with a predefined orientation and/or position (e.g. erect position) to subsequent filling machines in which the containers are filled with the product and subsequently transported to capping apparatus for the application of a closing element, such as a cap, on each filled container. Downstream of the capping station there may be further machines, such as labelling machines, scales for checking the weight of the packaged product and/or automatic wrapping machines.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The known packaging plants have hitherto been designed with the aim of maximizing the production capacity, the speed for sorting, filling, and capping the articles, and the efficiency of handling of said articles, with the aim of achieving maximum productivity during mass production.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">For this purpose, the plants are generally custom-designed and built according to the capacity and production requirements of the client, with a series of apparatus and machines arranged in series and configured to process with the maximum efficiency and speed certain specific types of articles and to operate with a given predetermined production capacity.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">One problem which has recently emerged is that resulting from the fact that the known packaging plants are not versatile with regard to the management of different production volumes or types of production.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In fact, if the demand for the type of article for which the plant is designed is less than that for which it has been configured, it is required to interrupt operation of the plants once production reaches the desired level.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Any changes in format of the articles to be handled and/or products to be dispensed require at least the intervention of specialized operators, washing of the apparatus and often also reconfiguration of the machine by the installation company.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In addition, if instead it is required to increase the production capacity of the installed plant, the only solution is to install a new plant in order to meet the excess demand which cannot be guaranteed by the packaging plant which has already been installed.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The same aforementioned drawbacks also have repercussions on the manufacturers of the packaging plants, in particular of the filling and capping lines, who are generally obliged to design and construct each plant based on the specific production requirements and type of articles specified by the clients; as a result, the production of the packaging plants and in particular the sorting, filling, and capping lines may be standardized only with regard to the more general aspects, but each plant must be subsequently designed and configured in each case with a huge investment in terms of time and technical and economic resources.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the aforementioned context and in order to maximize the production capacity and the speed of packaging of the articles, the automation of the plants, in particular of the sorting apparatus, must be limited, since more complex and therefore highly automated apparatus work more slowly than simple apparatus which must not perform automatically complex operations or movements.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">A further problem is that the known plants occupy a large space in particular lengthwise and, as mentioned, once installed, they cannot be easily removed or adapted to a reduction of or change in the production requirement.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The technical problem which is posed therefore is to provide a packaging plant, in particular for filling and closing randomly fed articles, such as containers, which solves or at least partially overcomes one or more of the said problems of the prior art.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">A particular object of the present disclosure is to provide a plant for packaging articles, in particular containers, which is more versatile as regards variations in the volume and/or type of production required. This improved versatility may be desirable during design and construction of the plant and/or during production once the plant has been installed.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">A further desirable aspect is that the plant should be have small dimensions, in particular lengthwise, be easy and low-cost from a production and assembly point of view and that it should be able to be easily installed at any user location.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">These results are obtained according to the present disclosure by a plant for packaging articles, comprising at least two modular apparatus for filling and closing randomly fed articles, in particular containers, by means of closing elements which are also randomly fed, and by a method for packaging articles according to the herein described subject matter.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Such a configuration of a packaging plant and method with multiple modular apparatus arranged in series allows the production of plants with different capacities for sorting, filling and capping articles such as containers to be filled with a fluid, using always a same modular structure of the filling and capping apparatus and simply combining a suitable number of such apparatus in series along the extraction direction in order to obtain the necessary productive capacity. Likewise, it is possible to vary the capacity of a plant which has previously been installed by simply adding (or removing) further filling and capping modules upstream and downstream thereof in the longitudinal direction.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Also in connection with plants which have already been installed, it is also possible, owing to the modular structure of the apparatus, to vary the production capacity of the plant depending on the actual needs by operating only one or more of the filling and capping modules which are independent of each other; alternatively or in combination it is also possible to perform different types of production using the various filling and capping modules arranged along the same extraction line.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">An embodiment of the packaging plant according to the disclosure may comprise a processing and control unit for each apparatus, configured in particular to coordinate the positioning of the articles filled and closed by a modular filling and closing apparatus so as to occupy an extraction position on the extraction plane not occupied by filled and closed articles positioned by one of the upstream apparatus, in particular an extraction position from among a plurality of predefined extraction positions may be arranged at a constant interval on the extraction plane. In this respect, there may be for example only one processing unit for two or more or all the apparatus and it may include a plurality of processing units each designed to control a respective apparatus and may include a coordinating unit which manages and coordinates single processing units of each modular apparatus, or it may be configured in accordance with a combination of such configurations.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In a packaging plant according to the disclosure, each modular apparatus may be controlled and configured to fill and close articles A independently of one of one or more of the other modular apparatus, in particular to fill different articles or articles with a different filling product, and/or to close with a different closing element and/or with a different frequency and/or article filling and closing speed.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The plant may further comprise operating machines for further processing of the common flow of filled and closed articles, comprising at least one labelling machine, weighing scales and/or a packaging machine. In a particular embodiment, the plant is configured to package the filled and closed articles in batches (for example boxes) which contain mixed articles filled and closed by different apparatus and extracted in a common flow, for example by means of one of said packaging units.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to an aspect of the disclosure, a processing unit of the plant will be provided with information about the position (initial position and subsequent advancing position) in the extraction direction X-X of all the articles in the flow of articles being extracted, it therefore being possible to make this information available both for controlling any downstream operating machines (for example labelling machines) and for following downstream modular filling and capping apparatus, which may thus be controlled so to deposit their filled articles in a predefined &#x201c;empty&#x201d;

Likewise it is possible to vary the capacity of a plant which includes an apparatus according to the disclosure which has previously been installed by simply adding (or removing) further filling and capping modules upstream or downstream of the pre-existing modular apparatus in the longitudinal direction.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Also in connection with plants which have already been installed, it is also possible, owing to the modular structure of the plant with one or more modular apparatus, to vary the production capacity of the plant depending on the actual needs by operating only one or more of the filling and capping modules which are independent of each other; alternatively or in combination it is also possible to perform different types of production using the various filling and capping modules arranged along the same extraction line.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Further aspects may be deduced from the following description, provided with reference still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref> and assuming a set of three reference axes in a longitudinal lengthwise direction X-X corresponding to the direction of extraction of filled and capped containers along the extraction plane, transverse widthwise direction Y-Y of the apparatus, orthogonal to said longitudinal direction, and vertical heightwise direction Z-Z of the apparatus orthogonal to the other two directions, as well as an upstream part and downstream part opposite to each other in the longitudinal extraction direction.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The transport system <b>10</b> for the containers may be of any type designed to transport articles arranged randomly on a transport plane.
