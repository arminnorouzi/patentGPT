Many neurological disorders reduce or eliminate voluntary recruitment of muscles, which may result in loss of ability to perform motor tasks or to maintain systems that depend on muscle activity for their function. Other disorders may cause pain to adjacent tissues.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Neurostimulation is a clinical tool used to treat various neurological disorders. This technique involves modulation of the nervous system by electrically activating fibers in the body.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF APPLICATIONS</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For some applications of the present invention, a system for wireless neurostimulation comprises a circuitry unit, coupled to at least two electrodes. According to one application of the present invention, one electrode is disposed on an outer surface of the circuitry unit, whereas a second electrode is coupled to a nerve cuff. According to another application of the present invention, the at least two electrodes are coupled to the nerve cuff (or to two or more nerve cuffs). Typically, the circuitry unit and nerve cuff are coupled by a lead.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Typically, the circuitry unit comprises circuitry for receiving and processing energy for driving the electrodes, and this energy is received from a site outside of the circuitry unit. For example, the site may be inside, or outside, of the subject's body.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">For some applications of the present invention, the circuitry unit is coupled via leads to two nerve cuffs.

Implants <b>130</b> and <b>140</b> are typically configured to be implanted intradermally or subcutaneously. That is, implants <b>130</b> and <b>140</b> are typically configured to be placed deeper than a surface of the skin of the subject (e.g., deeper than the epidermis). Implants <b>130</b> and <b>140</b> are further typically configured to be implanted by &#x201c;injecting&#x201d; (e.g., as described hereinabove for other implants, mutatis mutandis). Typically, implant <b>130</b> and <b>140</b> are shaped to define respective prismatic shapes, having a skin-facing side, and an opposing side. Implant <b>130</b> is typically shaped to define a prism that has a transverse cross-section that has a generally arced upper portion <b>132</b> that defines the skin-facing side of the implant, and a generally flat lower portion <b>134</b> that defines the opposing side of the implant. For example, the transverse cross-section of implant <b>130</b> may be generally semicircular. Implant <b>140</b> has a transverse cross-section that is generally elliptical, having a generally arced upper portion <b>142</b> that defines the skin-facing side of the implant, and a generally arced lower portion <b>144</b> that defines the opposing side of the implant. Implants <b>130</b> and <b>140</b> are typically shaped such that a height d<b>1</b> and d<b>4</b>, respectively, from the skin-facing side to the opposing side, is smaller than both (1) a longest length d<b>2</b> and d<b>5</b>, respectively, and (2) a width d<b>3</b> and d<b>6</b>, respectively, of the implant. That is, compared to a generally cylindrical implant, implant <b>130</b> and <b>140</b> have generally flattened configurations (i.e., a &#x201c;low profile&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0280" num="0285">Typically, dimension d<b>1</b> is greater than 0.5 mm and/or less than 3 mm (e.g., about 1.5 mm). Typically dimension d<b>4</b> is greater than 0.5 mm and/or less than 3 mm (e.g., between 1.5 and 2 mm). Typically, dimensions d<b>2</b> and d<b>5</b> are greater than 5 mm and/or less than 30 mm (e.g., between 10 and 30 mm, such as between 10 and 20 mm). Typically, dimensions d<b>3</b> and d<b>6</b> are greater than 1 mm and/or less than 5 mm (e.g., between 1.5 and 3 mm).</p><p id="p-0281" num="0286">The shapes of implant <b>130</b> and <b>140</b> are given as non-limiting examples of flattened configurations; other shapes may also be used. For example, implant <b>130</b> and/or <b>140</b> may be generally flat (e.g., sheet-like), having electrodes <b>28</b> disposed on one side. When the implant is flat, the implant typically comprises a resilient material, and is configured to remain generally flat or slightly curved (e.g., not to curl up). Furthermore, other medical implant and/or circuitry units described herein may also be configured to have a flattened configuration for intradermal and/or subcutaneous implantation.</p><p id="p-0282" num="0287">Typically, electrodes <b>28</b> of implant <b>130</b> and <b>140</b> are disposed generally on one side of the implant. For example, electrodes <b>28</b> of implant <b>130</b> are typically disposed only on upper portion <b>132</b>, and electrodes <b>28</b> of implant <b>140</b> are typically disposed only on upper portion <b>142</b>. Thereby, implants <b>130</b> and <b>140</b> typically have a conducting side (i.e., the side on which the electrodes are disposed). This configuration is hypothesized to direct the current that is driven through electrodes <b>28</b> by circuitry unit <b>22</b>, to tissue at the conducting side of the implant (e.g., to tissue adjacent to the upper portion of the implant). That is, implants <b>130</b> and <b>140</b> are typically directional. Typically, the skin-facing side of the implant defines the conducting side of the implant.</p><p id="p-0283" num="0288">For some applications of the invention, and as shown for implant <b>130</b>, the implant may comprise an inhibiting element, such as an insulating member <b>136</b>, (e.g., an insulating layer), configured to inhibit electrical conduction therethrough. Typically, insulating member <b>136</b> is disposed on, such as coupled to, the lower portion and/or the opposing side of the implant, so as to inhibit electrical conduction from electrodes <b>28</b> into tissue adjacent to the lower portion of the implant, i.e., into tissue at the opposing side of the implant. Thereby, insulating member <b>136</b> contributes toward the one-sided configuration of the implant. Although insulating member <b>136</b> is shown as a component of implant <b>130</b>, the insulating member may be used to facilitate the one-sidedness of medical implant <b>140</b>. Element <b>136</b> may also be used in combination with other medical implant described herein. For example, one or more elements <b>136</b> may be (1) disposed around at least part of nerve cuff <b>26</b>, so as to inhibit conduction of current away from a nerve around which the cuff is disposed, or (2) disposed around at least part of a circuitry unit and/or tubular element, so as to provide one-sidedness thereto. Insulating member <b>136</b> may comprise any suitable material known in the art, such as insulating silicone.</p><p id="p-0284" num="0289">For some applications of the invention in which the implant comprises an insulating member, electrodes <b>28</b> laterally circumscribe the implant, and part of the electrodes is covered by the insulating member. That is, for some applications of the invention, electrodes <b>28</b> are not disposed generally on one side of the implant. For example, electrodes <b>28</b> of implant <b>130</b> may be disposed circumferentially around circuitry unit <b>22</b>, and part of the electrode is sandwiched between the circuitry unit and insulating member <b>136</b>. For some such applications, this configuration facilitates manufacturing of the implant, e.g., by facilitating the application of the electrodes to the surface of the circuitry unit.</p><p id="p-0285" num="0290">Implants <b>130</b> and <b>140</b> are thereby typically directional, having a conducting skin-facing side and, for some applications, an insulating member at the lower portion of the implant, which provides an insulating opposing side of the implant. Typically, electrodes <b>28</b> of implants <b>130</b> and <b>140</b> are disposed at least 1 mm (e.g., greater than 2 mm, such as greater than 5 mm) from the lateral edges of the implant. That is, the implants typically define respective lateral zones <b>131</b> and <b>141</b>, on the skin-facing side of the implants, the lateral zones having a width of distance d<b>7</b>, in which electrodes <b>28</b> are not disposed, distance d<b>7</b> being greater than 1 mm (e.g., greater than 2 mm, such as greater than 5 mm). For example, the lateral zone may include the insulating member (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> for lateral zone <b>131</b> of implant <b>130</b>) and/or a portion of the upper portion of the circuitry unit on which electrodes are not disposed (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> for lateral zone <b>141</b> of implant <b>140</b>). It is hypothesized that providing the lateral zone in which electrodes <b>28</b> are not disposed, facilitates the one-sidedness of the implant, by inhibiting electrical conduction from electrodes <b>28</b> into tissue adjacent to the lower portion of the implant, i.e., into tissue at the opposing side of the implant.</p><p id="p-0286" num="0291">For some applications of the invention, implants <b>130</b> and <b>140</b> define lateral zones <b>131</b> and <b>141</b> on the opposing side of the implant, and are configured to be implanted such that the electrodes of the implant face away from the skin. Thereby, for such applications, implants <b>130</b> and <b>140</b> are configured to inhibit electrical conduction from the electrodes into the skin that is superficial to the implant, e.g., so as to stimulate underlying muscle and or nerves. It is hypothesized that, for such applications, current applied from electrodes <b>28</b> advantageously induces less pain in the subject than does current from external skin-mounted electrodes (e.g., Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation electrodes), e.g., due to reduced stimulation of sensory nerve fibers.</p><p id="p-0287" num="0292">Typically, implants <b>130</b> and <b>140</b> further comprise accelerometer <b>122</b>, described hereinabove with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-C</figref>. Alternatively, implants <b>130</b> and <b>140</b> may be used in combination with a an extracorporeal device that comprises an accelerometer.</p><p id="p-0288" num="0293">Reference is again made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>12</b></figref>.

For some applications, the entire implant is configured to be injectable.</p><p id="p-0289" num="0294">For some applications, the implants described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>12</b></figref> are wirelessly powered by a transmitting device, e.g., via radio-frequency (RF) or electromagnetic induction, such as described hereinbelow with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>A-C</figref>, mutatis mutandis. For such applications, the implants typically do not comprise a power supply such as a battery. For clarity, throughout this patent application, including the claims, a &#x201c;power supply&#x201d; is defined as an element that is configured to continuously power the implant for a period of greater than one minute. For some applications, the implants described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>12</b></figref> comprise a temporary power storage element (e.g., to facilitate a delay between receiving wireless power and applying a treatment). For clarity, throughout this patent application, including the claims, a &#x201c;temporary power storage element&#x201d; is defined as an element that is configured to continuously power the implant for a period of up to one minute. For some applications of the invention, the implants are passive implants, and operate only while wireless power is received (e.g., the implants do not comprise a power supply or a temporary power storage element, and consume power as it is received). For some such applications, the transmitting device is worn by the subject, and/or is disposed in, on, or under, an item of furniture or clothing of the subject, such as a bed or a hat of the subject.</p><p id="p-0290" num="0295">Alternatively, the implants described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>12</b></figref> may comprise a power supply (i.e., a power supply that is configured to continuously power the implant for a period of greater than one minute). For example, the implants may comprise a battery that is configured to continuously power the implant for a period of up to three days, and to be wirelessly charged once per day (e.g., at night). Alternatively, the implants may comprise a battery that is configured to power the implant for more than three days (e.g., for more than a month, such as for more than a year).</p><p id="p-0291" num="0296">Reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>A-B</figref>, which are schematic illustrations of medical implant <b>130</b>, having been implanted at respective implantation sites <b>150</b> (e.g., implantation sites <b>150</b><i>a </i>and <b>150</b><i>b</i>) in an arm <b>160</b> of a subject, so as to treat tremor of at least the arm of the subject, in accordance with some applications of the invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>A-B</figref>, medical implant <b>130</b> is shown as an example of such an implanted medical implant, but it is to be noted that the scope of the invention includes the implantation, at the implantation sites, of other medical implants, such as those described herein, mutatis mutandis. Similarly, the techniques described herein may also be used to treat tremor at another site in the body of the subject, such as in another limb of the subject, such as in a leg of the subject.</p><p id="p-0292" num="0297">Implantation sites <b>150</b> (e.g., implantation site <b>150</b><i>a </i>and implantation site <b>150</b><i>b</i>) are intradermal or subcutaneous. Typically, implant <b>130</b> is implanted within subcutaneous tissue of a subject, and is typically delivered by injection (e.g., using techniques known for implanting a BION&#x2122;, and/or as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A-B</figref>, mutatis mutandis). Subcutaneously- and intradermally-implanted implants typically distend overlying skin and/or compress underlying tissue, due to the volume and/or shape of the implant. As described hereinabove, implant <b>130</b> is shaped to have a low profile, compared to a similar cylindrical implant. Thereby, when implanted subcutaneously, implant <b>130</b> distends overlying skin <b>152</b> and/or compresses underlying tissue, such as muscle <b>154</b>, less than does an implant with a greater profile (e.g., a cylindrical implant). Typically, implant <b>130</b> is implanted such that upper portion <b>132</b> faces the skin, and lower portion <b>134</b> faces the underlying tissue, thereby positioning electrodes <b>28</b> toward the skin and, if the implant includes insulating member <b>136</b>, positioning the insulating member toward the underlying tissue. That is, when implanted subcutaneously, the conducting side of the implant is typically a skin-facing side of the implant. Implanting implant <b>130</b> in this configuration thereby configures the implant to direct current toward the skin and/or away from the underlying tissue.</p><p id="p-0293" num="0298">Circuitry unit <b>22</b> is typically configured to drive a current through electrodes <b>28</b>, and to configure the current to stimulate sensory fibers in the skin of the subject. Typically, the subject thereby feels the current being delivered (i.e., the implant induces a sensation in the skin of the subject). For some applications, the current may induce at least temporary discomfort or even pain in the subject, and, for some applications, this is desirable for successful treatment. For some applications, the current may be configured to have an amplitude that is great as possible without causing pain. For some applications, the current and/or sensations induced by the current may be similar to those of TENS apparatus, as is known in the art. Typically, circuitry unit <b>22</b> configures the current to a frequency of greater than 1 and/or less than 150 Hz, but other frequencies may also be used.</p><p id="p-0294" num="0299">It is hypothesized that stimulation of sensory fibers in the skin of the limb of the subject (e.g., as described in the above paragraph) reduces the intensity and/or frequency of tremor in at least that limb. Typically, the stimulation of the sensory fibers in the skin is performed predominantly without directly stimulating underlying tissue such as underlying muscles and/or nerves (i.e., muscles and/or nerves that are disposed deeper than the implant). That is, action potentials are predominantly initiated in sensory fibers in the skin, i.e., upstream of nerves. (In this application, the term &#x201c;nerve&#x201d; is intended to be distinct from the term &#x201c;sensory fiber&#x201d;.) For example, the implant is typically configured so as to predominantly not (1) directly initiate action potentials in nerves, such as ulnar nerve <b>156</b>, (2) stimulate sensory fibers in underlying muscle, and/or (3) induce contraction of underlying muscle (e.g., spasm).</p><p id="p-0295" num="0300">For some applications of the invention, the implant is configured to perform this selective stimulation of sensory fibers by the implant being directional, e.g., as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>-<b>12</b></figref>. For such applications, the implant is typically implanted such that the conducting side of the implant (e.g., the side on which electrodes are disposed) faces superficially, thereby directing the current superficially (e.g., toward the skin). Similarly, implants comprising an insulating member are typically implanted such that the insulating member is disposed deeper into the subject than the electrodes. That is, for such applications, the electrodes are typically disposed on a superficial side (e.g., a skin-facing side) of the implant, and/or the insulating member is typically disposed on a deep side of the implant. Thereby, insulating member <b>136</b> and/or lateral zones <b>131</b> and <b>141</b> act as inhibiting elements that inhibit direct stimulation of one or more nerves disposed deeper than the implanted implant.</p><p id="p-0296" num="0301">For some applications of the invention, the implant is configured to perform the selective stimulation of sensory fibers in the skin, by circuitry unit <b>22</b> being configured to configure the current that it drives via electrodes <b>28</b>, to selectively stimulate the sensory fibers in the skin. For example, circuitry unit <b>22</b> may configure the current to have an amplitude that is sufficient to stimulate the sensory fibers in the skin but insufficient to initiate action potentials in sensory fibers in muscle and/or nerves, and/or to induce contraction of muscle. Alternatively or additionally, circuitry unit <b>22</b> may configure the current to have another characteristic, such as a frequency, a pulse width, and/or an on-off pattern (i.e., durations for which the wireless power is transmitted and not transmitted) that facilitates such selective stimulation of sensory fibers in the skin.</p><p id="p-0297" num="0302">For some applications, the electrodes of the implant are disposed close to each other (e.g., less than 10 mm from each other, such as less than 2 mm from each other), so as to inhibit the current that flows between the electrodes, from flowing far from the implant, and thereby inhibiting the current that flows between the electrodes from reaching the nerves disposed deeper than the implanted implant.</p><p id="p-0298" num="0303">For some applications of the invention, the implant is configured to perform the selective stimulation of sensory fibers in the skin by being implanted sufficiently close to the sensory fibers in the skin, and sufficiently far from the underlying muscle and/or nerves. For example, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>B</figref>, the implant may be subcutaneously implanted at implantation site <b>150</b><i>b</i>, on the lateral side (i.e., the &#x201c;back&#x201d;) of the forearm, which is generally farther from ulnar nerve <b>156</b> and median nerve <b>157</b>, than are sites on the medial side (i.e., the &#x201c;inside&#x201d;) of the forearm. For example, implantation site <b>150</b><i>b </i>may be farther than 1 cm (e.g., farther than 2 cm, such as farther than 3 cm) from the ulnar nerve and/or the median nerve.</p><p id="p-0299" num="0304">For some applications, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>A</figref>, the implant may be otherwise sufficiently configured to perform the selective stimulation of sensory fibers (e.g., as described hereinabove), such that it is possible to implant the implant at an implantation site, such as implantation site <b>150</b><i>a</i>, that is closer to nerves, such as nerves <b>156</b> and <b>157</b>, predominantly without stimulating the nerves. For some applications of the invention, it may be even be desirable to implant the implant at such a site, e.g., so as to facilitate stimulation of specific sensory fibers that conduct impulses toward one or more specific nerves.</p><p id="p-0300" num="0305">As described hereinabove, implant <b>130</b> typically comprises accelerometer <b>122</b>, which is configured to sense movement of the implantation site, and to responsively provide a signal to circuitry unit <b>22</b>. Accelerometer <b>122</b> is typically configured to sense tremor of the limb, and circuitry unit <b>22</b> is typically configured to drive the current via electrodes <b>28</b> at least in part responsively to the sensed tremor. The circuitry unit may be configured to apply the current in phase or out of phase with the tremor. For example, circuitry unit <b>22</b> may be configured to drive the current only during particular phases of the tremor (e.g., during a highest speed portion of the tremor, or, alternatively, only when the limb is at one or both of the endpoints of its tremor-induced travel). That is, the circuitry unit may be configured to modulate the current onto the tremor. Alternatively or additionally, the circuitry unit may be configured to change one or more parameters of the current during particular phases of the tremor.</p><p id="p-0301" num="0306">For some applications of the invention, accelerometer <b>122</b> is used to adjust timing (e.g., phasing) and/or other parameters of the current, so as to optimize treatment of the tremor. For example, circuitry unit <b>22</b> may automatically adjust the phase(s) of the tremor during which it drives the current (i.e., the &#x201c;angle of phase&#x201d; at which it drives the current), until optimal treatment is achieved, e.g., by &#x201c;sweeping&#x201d; different angles of phase. Similarly, other current parameters, such as frequency and amplitude, may be optimized automatically by circuitry unit <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0302" num="0307">For some applications of the invention, an extracorporeal device, e.g., a worn extracorporeal device, comprises an accelerometer, and is configured and/or positioned to detect the tremor, and circuitry unit <b>22</b> of the implant is configured to drive the current in response to the extracorporeal device detecting the tremor. For example, a wristwatch-based extracorporeal device may be worn on an arm of the subject. The wristwatch-based extracorporeal device comprises an accelerometer and, in response to detecting the tremor in the arm of the subject, transmits wireless power. The implant receives the wireless power and, in response to the wireless power (e.g., powered by the wireless power), drives the current into the arm of the subject (e.g., into the skin thereof). For such applications, the implant typically does not comprise a power supply. For applications in which a worn extracorporeal device comprises an accelerometer, the implant typically does not comprise an accelerometer.</p><p id="p-0303" num="0308">For some applications, circuitry unit <b>22</b> is configurable (e.g., manually configurable) using an extracorporeal device, such that an operator may adjust parameters such as phase angle, frequency and amplitude of the current.</p><p id="p-0304" num="0309">For some applications of the invention, tremor in one limb may be treated by an implant implanted in a contralateral limb. For example, tremor in only one limb may be treated by an implant implanted in a contralateral limb, or tremor in a pair of limbs may be treated by an implant implanted in only one of the pair of limbs (i.e., a limb that is contralateral to at least one of the limbs that experiences the tremor).</p><p id="p-0305" num="0310">Reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>A-C</figref>, which are schematic illustrations of a system <b>200</b> for applying a treatment to a tissue of a subject, in accordance with some applications of the invention.

For some applications, one or more of the implants are each configured to respond to more than one control signal, i.e., such that one signal activates more than one implant.</p><p id="p-0314" num="0319">Reference is still made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>A-C</figref>. Typically, implants <b>202</b> do not comprise a power supply, such as a battery, that is able to continuously power the implants for a period greater than one minute (although the implants may comprise a temporary power storage element, such as a capacitor). Typically, transmitting unit <b>210</b> transmits at least one wireless power signal <b>214</b>, and implants <b>202</b> are wirelessly powered by the power signal. For example, the power signal may comprise an electromagnetic signal, such as an RF signal, and each implant <b>202</b> comprises a rectifying antenna (&#x201c;rectenna&#x201d;).

For the applications of the invention described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>C</figref>, power is typically only transmitted generally at the same time as each control signal is transmitted (e.g. the power and control signals may comprise the same signal, such as a coded power signal).</p><p id="p-0316" num="0321">For some applications of the invention, power signal <b>214</b> is transmitted at times when signals <b>212</b> are not transmitted. For example, power signal <b>214</b> may be transmitted both at generally the same time as control signal(s) <b>212</b>, and at at least some times when signals <b>212</b> are not transmitted. For the applications of the invention described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>B</figref>, transmitting unit <b>210</b> typically begins to transmit power signal <b>214</b> generally at the same time as the unit transmits signal <b>212</b>, and continues to transmit the power signal for a subsequent duration, such as until all implants <b>202</b> have responded to signal <b>212</b>. That is, transmitting unit <b>210</b> typically transmits power signal <b>214</b> for a duration that is at least as long as duration <b>218</b><i>d</i>.

For some applications, signals <b>212</b> and <b>214</b> may comprise the same signal (e.g., the power signal may be a coded power signal). For example, each implant may be configured to receive and/or be powered by a respective power signal having a respective characteristic, such as a respective frequency, and transmitting unit <b>210</b> is configured to activate each implant by transmitting the respective power signal.</p><p id="p-0318" num="0323">For some applications, signals <b>212</b> and <b>214</b> comprise different signals.

For some applications, power signal <b>214</b> is not transmitted by transmitting unit <b>210</b>. For example, power signal <b>214</b> may be provided by a separate power-transmitting unit (not shown). For some applications, implants <b>202</b> do comprise a power supply, such as a battery, that is able to continuously power the implants for a period greater than one minute. For such applications, implants <b>202</b> are typically wirelessly rechargeable.</p><p id="p-0319" num="0324">Reference is still made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>A-C</figref>. Although system <b>200</b> is generally described as being typically configured to facilitate asynchronous application of the treatment by each implant, for some applications of the invention, system <b>200</b> is configured to facilitate generally independent control of each implant by the transmitting unit, which may include optionally driving two or more of the implants to apply the treatment simultaneously. For example, for some applications of the invention, transmitting unit <b>210</b> may be configured to drive a first activation &#x201c;wave&#x201d; in a first direction, by activating two electrodes at a time along the length of a stimulated tissue, and to subsequently drive a second activation wave in the opposite direction. Alternatively or additionally, one or more implants may be driven to apply the treatment for an extended duration, during which at least one other implant is activated and deactivated (e.g., repeatedly). It is to be noted that these examples are purely illustrative of independent implant control via wireless power transmission, and that the scope of the invention includes other sequences of implant activation.</p><p id="p-0320" num="0325">Reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, which is a schematic illustration of a system <b>220</b>, for applying a treatment to sequential portions of a tubular anatomical structure <b>226</b> (e.g., a tubular organ) of a subject, in accordance with some applications of the invention. Structure <b>226</b> may comprise a hollow tubular structure such as a blood vessel or a part of the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., an intestine) of the subject, or may comprise a more solid tubular structure such as a nerve of the subject. System <b>220</b> comprises a plurality of implants <b>222</b> (e.g., implants <b>222</b><i>a</i>, <b>222</b><i>b</i>, <b>222</b><i>c</i>, and <b>222</b><i>d</i>), and transmitting unit <b>210</b>. For some applications of the invention, system <b>220</b> and implants <b>222</b> are analogous to system <b>200</b> and implants <b>202</b>, described hereinabove with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>A-C</figref>. Each implant <b>222</b> comprises one or more effector elements <b>224</b>, which apply a treatment in response to control signal <b>212</b>, transmitted by transmitting unit <b>210</b>.

Alternatively, structure <b>226</b> may comprise a nerve, and support <b>228</b> comprises a nerve cuff that is disposable around the nerve. Further alternatively, support <b>228</b> may comprise a removable support, such as part of a delivery device, e.g., that is decoupled from implants <b>222</b> following implantation of the implants. Further alternatively, support <b>228</b> may comprise any implantable medical device, such as an orthopedic device (e.g., a bone screw), or a device configured to be placed near the spinal cord.</p><p id="p-0322" num="0327">Effector elements <b>224</b> typically comprise electrodes <b>205</b>. Implants <b>222</b> are implanted such that electrodes <b>205</b> are in electrical contact with structure <b>226</b> (e.g., disposed against the structure). For example, support <b>228</b> is pressed against the structure. For some applications, electrodes <b>205</b> comprise ring electrodes, and implants <b>222</b> are coupled to structure <b>226</b> such that the ring electrodes are disposed over a portion of the structure. Each implant <b>222</b> applies the treatment at the portion of structure <b>226</b> to which it is coupled, by driving a current via electrodes <b>205</b>, into the portion of the structure. For some applications, when structure <b>226</b> comprises a nerve, the current is configured to induce at least one action potential in the nerve. For some applications, when structure <b>226</b> comprises a hollow tubular structure, such as a blood vessel or intestine, the current is configured to induce constriction in at least the portion of structure <b>226</b> to which the electrode is in contact.</p><p id="p-0323" num="0328">For some applications, when structure <b>226</b> comprises a hollow tubular structure, effector element <b>224</b> comprises an annular constricting element that is couplable to a respective portion of the structure, and circuitry unit <b>208</b> of implant <b>222</b> is configured to drive the constricting element to constrict, thereby inducing constriction of the portion of the structure.</p><p id="p-0324" num="0329">For some applications of the invention, system <b>220</b> is configured such that at least one of the implants applies the treatment asynchronously to at least another one of the implants, using techniques described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>B</figref>, mutatis mutandis. For example, transmitting unit <b>210</b> may be configured to transmit one control signal <b>212</b>, all the implants (e.g., implants <b>222</b><i>a</i>, <b>222</b><i>b</i>, <b>222</b><i>c</i>, and <b>222</b><i>d</i>) receive the signal effectively simultaneously, and each implant is configured to apply the treatment after a different (e.g., pre-set) duration following receiving the signal.</p><p id="p-0325" num="0330">For some applications of the invention, system <b>220</b> is configured such that at least one of the implants applies the treatment asynchronously to at least another one of the implants, using techniques described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>C</figref>, mutatis mutandis. For example, transmitting unit <b>210</b> may be configured to transmit a plurality of control signals <b>212</b>, and to transmit at least one of the control signals asynchronously to another one of the control signals, and each implant is configured to receive a respective control signal and to responsively (e.g., immediately) apply the treatment in the portion of structure <b>226</b> to which it are coupled.</p><p id="p-0326" num="0331">When system <b>220</b> is configured to induce constriction in portions of a tubular anatomical structure such as a blood vessel or intestine, system <b>220</b> is typically configured to induce pumping in the structure. Typically, system <b>220</b> is configured this way by being configured such that implants <b>222</b> induce constriction (i.e., are activated) consecutively according to the order in which they are disposed on structure <b>226</b>, thereby inducing an advanced form of peristaltic pumping. For example, consecutive activation of implants <b>222</b><i>a</i>, <b>222</b><i>b</i>, <b>222</b><i>c</i>, and <b>222</b><i>d </i>may induce peristalsis in structure <b>226</b>.</p><p id="p-0327" num="0332">For some applications of the invention, structure <b>226</b> comprises a blood vessel of the subject, and system <b>220</b> is used to alter blood flow in the blood vessel. For example, structure <b>226</b> may comprise the aorta of the subject, and system <b>220</b> may be used to enhance downstream bloodflow in the aorta by inducing downstream peristalsis (e.g., to treat peripheral vascular disease) and/or to increase blood flow into the coronary arteries by inducing upstream peristalsis (e.g., during ventricular diastole).</p><p id="p-0328" num="0333">For some applications of the invention, structure <b>226</b> is a component of the gastrointestinal tract, such as an intestine or an esophagus, and system <b>220</b> may be used to induce peristalsis or tighten a sphincter or valve in the component of the gastrointestinal tract. For example, system <b>220</b> may be used to induce peristalsis in an esophagus of the subject or tighten the lower esophageal sphincter, so as to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease. Alternatively or additionally, system <b>220</b> may be used to induce peristalsis in a duodenum of the subject, so as to treat obesity.</p><p id="p-0329" num="0334">For some applications of the invention, pumping is induced by stimulating one or more skeletal muscles in a vicinity of a blood vessel, e.g., so as to compress the blood vessel. Typically, such pumping is induced by stimulating two or more skeletal muscles to contract. For some such applications of the invention, system <b>200</b> is used, rather than system <b>220</b>.</p><p id="p-0330" num="0335">Reference is still made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>A-<b>15</b></figref>. As described hereinabove, systems <b>200</b> and <b>220</b> are configured such that at least implant applies the treatment asynchronously to at least another implant. Typically, the systems are thus configured by being configured such that a state of at least one of the implants changes asynchronously to the state of at least another one of the implants. For example, the implants may each have an &#x201c;activated&#x201d; state, in which the treatment is applied and/or constriction is induced, and an &#x201c;off&#x201d; state, in which that treatment is not applied and/or constriction is not induced. For some applications of the invention, the implants may have one or more other states, such as a &#x201c;ready&#x201d; state, and be configured to enter the &#x201c;ready&#x201d; state in response to one or more signals from the transmitting unit. For example (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>C</figref>), when transmitting unit <b>210</b> transmits control signal <b>212</b><i>a</i>, and implant <b>202</b><i>a </i>responsively applies the treatment (i.e., enters the &#x201c;activated&#x201d; state thereof), implant <b>202</b><i>b </i>may be configured to enter the &#x201c;ready&#x201d; state thereof (e.g., to charge a capacitor thereof) in response to control signal <b>212</b><i>a</i>, thereby becoming ready to apply the treatment when control signal <b>212</b><i>b </i>is received. It is hypothesized that such configuration reduces a response time of each implant to the control signal.</p><p id="p-0331" num="0336">Reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, which is a schematic illustration of a system <b>240</b>, for applying a treatment to a plurality of tissues of a subject, in accordance with some applications of the invention. System <b>240</b> comprises a plurality of implants <b>242</b> (e.g., implants <b>242</b><i>a </i>and <b>242</b><i>b</i>), and one or more transmitting units <b>210</b> (e.g., transmitting units <b>210</b><i>a </i>and <b>210</b><i>b</i>). For some applications of the invention, implants <b>242</b><i>a </i>and <b>242</b><i>b </i>are similar to each other and are configured to apply similar treatments, e.g., to bilateral tissues, such as opposing limbs, such as legs <b>246</b> (e.g., leg <b>246</b><i>a </i>and <b>246</b><i>b</i>) of the subject. For some applications, implants <b>242</b> are implanted, and configured, to treat neuropathic leg pain. Alternatively, implants <b>242</b><i>a </i>and <b>242</b><i>b </i>are configured to treat different conditions and/or to apply different treatments.</p><p id="p-0332" num="0337">Typically, transmitting units <b>210</b><i>a </i>and <b>210</b><i>b </i>and/or implants <b>242</b><i>a </i>and <b>242</b><i>b </i>are disposed, at least some of the time, in close proximity to each other (e.g., within 1 m of each other, such as within 30 cm of each other, such as within 10 cm of each other). For example, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, a first transmitting unit <b>210</b><i>a </i>is coupled (e.g., adhered and/or strapped) to a first leg of a subject, and intended (e.g., configured) to power and control a first implant <b>242</b><i>a</i>, and a second transmitting unit <b>210</b><i>b </i>is coupled to a second leg of the subject, and intended (e.g., configured) to control a second implant <b>242</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0333" num="0338">The use of one or more transmitting units to control a plurality of implants may be subjected to problems, such as interference and/or misdirected signals. That is, a first implant may receive, and respond to, a signal that is intended to be received by a second implant. This is more likely when the transmitting units and implants are in close proximity to each other. For example, implant <b>242</b><i>b </i>might respond to signals transmitted by unit <b>210</b><i>a</i>, and/or implant <b>242</b><i>a </i>might respond to signals transmitted by unit <b>210</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0334" num="0339">Typically, apparatus <b>240</b> is configured to use coded signals, e.g., as described hereinabove with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>A-<b>15</b></figref>. For example, transmitting unit <b>210</b><i>a </i>may be configured to transmit wireless power at a first frequency, which implant <b>242</b><i>a </i>is configured to receive and/or by which implant <b>242</b><i>a </i>is configured be powered; while transmitting unit <b>210</b><i>b </i>is configured to transmit wireless power at a second frequency, which implant <b>242</b><i>b </i>is configured to receive and/or by which implant <b>242</b><i>b </i>is configured to be powered. Alternatively or additionally, first and second pulse widths may be used to &#x201c;code&#x201d; the signals. Alternatively or additionally, first and second on-off patterns (i.e., durations for which the wireless power is transmitted and not transmitted) may be used to &#x201c;code&#x201d; the signals. It is hypothesized that the use of coded signals reduces (e.g., prevents) misdirected signals when wirelessly controlling a plurality of implants, and especially implants that are in close proximity. Such misdirected signals may interfere with treatment and/or cause the subject discomfort and/or pain.</p><p id="p-0335" num="0340">For some applications of the invention, transmitting units <b>210</b><i>a </i>and <b>210</b><i>b </i>are configured to be in wireless communication with each other. For example, it may be desirable for the transmitting units to coordinate the driving of implant <b>242</b><i>b </i>with respect to the driving of implant <b>242</b><i>a</i>. For example, transmitting unit <b>210</b><i>b </i>may be configured to drive implant <b>242</b><i>b </i>only when transmitting unit <b>210</b><i>a </i>is not driving implant <b>242</b><i>a </i>(i.e., asynchronously). Alternatively, transmitting unit <b>210</b><i>b </i>may be configured to drive implant <b>242</b><i>b </i>at the same time as transmitting unit <b>210</b><i>a </i>drives implant <b>242</b><i>a</i>. It is to be noted that these two examples are illustrative, and that the scope of the invention includes any coordination between transmitting units <b>210</b><i>a </i>and <b>210</b><i>b </i>for driving implants <b>242</b><i>a </i>and <b>242</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0336" num="0341">Reference is again made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>A-<b>16</b></figref>.

Alternatively, for some applications of the invention, asynchronous application of treatment comprises independent application of one or more treatments.

It is hypothesized that mutually-perpendicular coils facilitate reception of wireless power and/or other signals, e.g., independently of an orientation of the implant. For some applications, antenna <b>260</b> and/or antenna <b>270</b> comprise at least one ferrite core <b>254</b>, as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>A</figref>, mutatis mutandis. For example, each coil <b>252</b> of antenna <b>260</b> and/or <b>270</b> may be disposed around a ferrite core <b>254</b>.</p><p id="p-0338" num="0343"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>D</figref> shows antenna <b>30</b> comprising a planar spiral antenna <b>280</b>. Antenna <b>280</b> is shown as a square spiral, but may be a round spiral, or any other spiral.</p><p id="p-0339" num="0344"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>E</figref> shows antenna <b>30</b> comprising a helical antenna <b>290</b>. Antenna <b>290</b> is shown as a cuboid helix, but may be a cylindrical helix, or any other helix. It is hypothesized that a helical antenna facilitates economization of space, by other components (e.g., circuitry units <b>22</b> and/or <b>208</b>) being disposable within a void <b>292</b>, defined by the helix of the antenna.</p><p id="p-0340" num="0345">Reference is again made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>17</b>E</figref>. For some applications of the invention, the implants described hereinabove may comprise effector elements other than electrodes (e.g., the effector elements described hereinabove may comprise other components, and/or the electrodes described hereinabove may be replaced with other effector elements). For example, for some applications of the invention, one or more of the effector elements may comprise a vibrating element, and the treatment is applied by the circuitry unit driving the vibrating element to vibrate. This vibrating element may be employed in addition to or instead of any or all of the electrodes (e.g., electrodes <b>28</b>) described herein, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>17</b>E</figref>. It is hypothesized that, for some applications, vibrational stimulation is useful for stimulating sensory fibers. For example, an implant, implanted subcutaneously as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, may be used to vibrationally stimulate sensory fibers in the skin of the subject.</p><p id="p-0341" num="0346">For some applications, a combination of electrodes and vibrating units is used in the same implant and/or in different implants. It is noted with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b> and <b>12</b></figref> that insulating member <b>136</b> may be mechanically insulating in order to reduce passage of vibrations into deeper tissues, and to instead maintain more of the vibrational energy near the sensory fibers in the skin of the subject. For such applications, this mechanically-insulating member typically acts as an inhibiting element that inhibits direct stimulation of one or more deeper nerves.</p><p id="p-0342" num="0347">Similarly, one or more of the effector elements described hereinabove may comprise a heating and/or cooling element, a pressure-exerting element, an ultrasound transducer, and/or a laser. Alternatively or additionally, one or more of the implants described hereinabove may comprise one or more sensors, e.g., to provide feedback.</p><p id="p-0343" num="0348">The implantation sites and disorders described hereinabove are examples for illustrating the use of the techniques described herein. The implants described herein may be implanted at a variety of implantation sites, and the techniques described herein may be used to treat a variety of disorders. For example:</p><p id="p-0344" num="0349">stimulation of the tibial nerve (and/or of sensory fibers that lead to the tibial nerve), e.g., to treat neuropathic pain and/or urge incontinence;</p><p id="p-0345" num="0350">stimulation of sensory fibers that lead to the radial and/or ulnar nerves, e.g., to treat tremor (e.g., essential tremor, and tremor associated with Parkinson's disease);</p><p id="p-0346" num="0351">stimulation of the occipital nerve, e.g., to treat migraine;</p><p id="p-0347" num="0352">stimulation of the sphenopalatine ganglion, e.g., to treat cluster headaches;</p><p id="p-0348" num="0353">stimulation of the sacral and/or pudendal nerve, e.g., to treat urge incontinence;</p><p id="p-0349" num="0354">direct stimulation of an implantation site within the brain (e.g., deep brain stimulation), such as the thalamus, e.g., to treat tremor, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and/or depression;</p><p id="p-0350" num="0355">stimulation of the vagus nerve, e.g., to treat epilepsy, depression, inflammation, tinnitus, and/or congestive heart failure (e.g., by incorporating some or all of device <b>20</b> into an aortic stent);</p><p id="p-0351" num="0356">stimulation of baroreceptors in a blood vessel wall (e.g., the wall of the carotid sinus and/or aorta, e.g., to treat high blood pressure);</p><p id="p-0352" num="0357">stimulation of the spinal cord, e.g., to treat pain;</p><p id="p-0353" num="0358">stimulation of one or more muscles (such as shoulder muscles), e.g., to treat muscle pain;</p><p id="p-0354" num="0359">stimulation of the medial nerve, e.g., to treat carpal tunnel syndrome;</p><p id="p-0355" num="0360">stimulation of the hypoglossal nerve and/or one or more muscles of the tongue, e.g., to treat obstructive sleep apnea;</p><p id="p-0356" num="0361">stimulation of cardiac tissue, e.g., to pace and/or defibrillate the heart (e.g., the use of the implant as a leadless pacemaker);</p><p id="p-0357" num="0362">stimulation to treat dystonia;</p><p id="p-0358" num="0363">stimulation of the vagus nerve, e.g., to treat epilepsy;</p><p id="p-0359" num="0364">stimulation to treat interstitial cystitis;</p><p id="p-0360" num="0365">stimulation to treat gastroparesis;</p><p id="p-0361" num="0366">stimulation to treat obesity;</p><p id="p-0362" num="0367">stimulation of the anal sphincter, e.g., to treat fecal incontinence;</p><p id="p-0363" num="0368">stimulation to treat bowel disorders;</p><p id="p-0364" num="0369">stimulation of peripheral nerves of the spinal cord, e.g., to treat chronic pain;</p><p id="p-0365" num="0370">stimulation of the dorsal root ganglion for the treatment of chronic pain; and</p><p id="p-0366" num="0371">stimulation of motor nerves and/or muscles to improve mobility.</p><p id="p-0367" num="0372">Implants whose effector element comprises an electrode and/or a vibrating element may also be used to block nerve signals, such as to induce local anesthesia. It is hypothesized that paresthesia may be induced by driving a relatively low-frequency current (e.g., greater than 1 and/or less than 120 Hz, e.g., between 10 and 40 Hz) into the nerve, and that a relatively high-frequency current (e.g., greater than 5 and/or less than 20 kHz, e.g., between 10 and 20 kHz) may be used to induce complete blocking.</p><p id="p-0368" num="0373">Tibial nerve stimulation (e.g., electrical stimulation) may be used to treat pain, such as neuropathic pain, e.g., neuropathic pain in the legs of a subject. Implants, such as those described hereinabove, may be used to provide such stimulation. However, variation between subjects exists, and such treatment does not sufficiently reduce pain in all subjects. In experiments conducted by the inventors, percutaneous electrodes (i.e., temporary electrodes) were used to stimulate the tibial nerve of 8 subjects by percutaneously delivering at least part (e.g., a tip) of the electrodes to a site in a vicinity of the tibial nerve, and applying a current to the tibial nerve. Sessions comprised 15-60 minutes of stimulation. Of these 8 subjects, 6 experienced good pain relief and 2 experienced moderate pain relief. Interestingly, the degree of pain relief for each subject in the first session was similar to that for the successive sessions. That is, a first session of stimulation was indicative of responsiveness to subsequent treatment. It is therefore hypothesized that data from a single session of percutaneous stimulation of the tibial nerve, lasting 1-120 minutes (e.g., 10-30 minutes) of stimulation and successfully inducing paresthesia in the subject's foot, may be used to facilitate a decision of whether to implant one or more stimulatory implants at the tibial nerve of a given subject.</p><p id="p-0369" num="0374">It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that the present invention is not limited to what has been particularly shown and described hereinabove. Rather, the scope of the present invention includes both combinations and subcombinations of the various features described hereinabove, as well as variations and modifications thereof that are not in the prior art, which would occur to persons skilled in the art upon reading the foregoing description.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-1-146" num="1-146"><claim-text><b>1</b>-<b>146</b>.
