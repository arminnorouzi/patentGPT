More particularly, the invention pertains to an internet connected adjustable structural support and cushioning system for footwear.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Generally, there are three types of foot arches associated with the human foot. Many people encounter pain in their feet, bone spurs, and other problems based upon the arch of their foot being high, medium or low. Some people have low arches which are characterized by an arch that sits low to the ground. Low arches are often biomechanically imbalanced and cause susceptibility to common foot problems such as heel pain, arch pain and plantar fasciitis. Other people have medium arches which are characterized as a well-defined arch. Medium arches are often biomechanically efficient but still can be susceptible to common foot problems such as heel pain or ball-of-foot discomfort. Yet another segment of the population has high arches that are characterized as arches that sit high from the ground. High arches have less surface area for absorbing impact from when walking or running or during sports which causes excessive pressure on the rear foot and forefoot areas. This can increase susceptibility to foot conditions such as heel pain, ball-of-foot pain or plantar fasciitis. Still, most arches fall somewhere in between these three categories, with very few people having an arch that can be purely characterized as low, medium, or high.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Generally, many people who suffer from foot problems related to their arch seek to remedy the problem with insoles. Insoles are expensive and the process for fitting insoles is inexact because every foot is unique.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An internet-enabled sole system, which allows for a fully adjustable support system through custom pressurized air chambers to provide comfort to the foot of the user, is disclosed herein. The sole system is embedded within the shoes through modification of the traditional insole, midsole and outsole sections. In a preferred embodiment, the sole system includes an embedded air pump, compressor, or inflator/deflator operably connected to three air chambers for adjusting the level of air in each chamber through commands received from an application on a computing device or from any Internet connected device. The insole section consists of three separate chambers&#x2014;a forefoot chamber, a heel chamber and an arch chamber. By modifying the insole, midsole and outsole sections of the sole, through one or more associated chambers, the support to a user can be varied. The forefoot and heel chambers can expand and contract as needed to provide either more or less support to the user. The arch chamber changes to provide support to the user based upon the needs of the user.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another embodiment, the sole system includes an external air inlet, adapted to engage with an external air pump, external compressor, or an external inflator/deflator, operably connected to a plurality of air chambers in the sole of the shoe for pressurizing and adjusting the level of air in each chamber through an action. The embedded air pump, compressor, or inflator/deflator is operably connected to the plurality of air chambers for adjusting the level of air in each chamber through commands received from an application on a computing device or from any Internet connected device. The insole section consists of at least four separate chambers. Each chamber of the plurality of chambers located throughout the sole can individually expand and contract as needed to provide more or less support to the user. The individual chambers can change to provide support to the user based upon the needs of the user.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another embodiment, the sole system involves an embedded air pump, compressor, or inflator/deflator operably connected to a single air chamber for adjusting the level of air through commands received from an application on a computing device or from any Internet connected device.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In an additional embodiment, the sole system includes an external air inlet, adapted to engage with an external air pump, an external compressor, or an external inflator/deflator, and is operably connected to a single air chamber for pressurizing and adjusting the level of air in each chamber of the sole system.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">If the consumer is flat-footed, at least one chamber of the sole increases the pressure within the chamber to raise up, or expand and form a firm support. If the user is high-arched, at least one chamber decreases the pressure present within the chamber to soften and contract. Through a combination of the chambers in the sole, the user is able to achieve support and comfort.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The Internet of Things (IoT) capacity of the sole system allows for several different modes of operation. The soles allow remote access by another user, such as a medical professional to check and/or monitor the settings of the shoes of a user to ensure maximum benefit. The user can monitor their own comfort level and alter the support provided through an application connected to the soles. Machine learning can be utilized to find the optimum levels for a user by applying data collected over a period of time. The sole system obviates the need for special insoles and allows for customization of the support provided to a user</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a data processing environment, according to one embodiment of the invention.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows the internal details of a shoe sole, according to an embodiment of the invention.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a dissected view of the bottom portion of the shoe sole as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, according to an embodiment of the invention.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a shoe sole configuration, according to one embodiment of the invention.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a shoe sole configuration, according to another embodiment of the invention.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows an example of the shoe sole in charging mode, according to an embodiment of the invention.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows a shoe sole configuration, according to an additional embodiment of the invention.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows a flow diagram of a method of adjusting a shoe sole support system through custom pressurized air chambers to provide comfort to the foot of the user.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Accordingly, it is to be understood that the embodiments of the invention herein described are merely illustrative of the application of the principles of the invention.

In an example, a medical professional could utilize historical data and advanced data analytics to provide suggestions for adjusting the comfort level of a user which is a patient. In this embodiment, the medical professional is treating an ailment of the user that may be impacted by the user's foot, posture or the way the user carries out an activity. The medical professional can work interactively with the sole system <b>2</b> to adjust the support and comfort level relative to specific parts of the user's foot. While a user (e.g. a secondary user) other than the user wearing the shoe is discussed as being a medical professional, the other user may be a trainer or other individual that not has a specific professional training, medical degree or license.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In a first step (step <b>710</b>) a pressure setting is received by the medical sole system program <b>26</b>. In an embodiment, a medical professional applies a pressure setting, received through medical sole system program <b>26</b> on computing device <b>27</b>, as an initial pressure setting in one or more air chambers <b>9</b> based on a complaint from a user. In this embodiment, a user may have a complaint about pain in the heel area. The medical sole system program <b>26</b>, can receive, via a user interface, a pressure setting from the medical profession, for example between 30-50 pounds per square inch (psi) in the heel area to reduce heel pressure and the corresponding impact force. Setting the pressure reduces load on the foot of a user, prolongs the amount of time from initial foot to ground contact until complete compression of the shoe of the user, and promotes distribution of the actual foot pressure on the shoe of the user.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In another embodiment, the medical sole system program <b>26</b>, can receive, via a user interface, a pressure setting in one or more air chambers <b>9</b> based on an observed deficiency in the user's gait, or as a function of observing the manner in which the shoe of a user is worn down. In this embodiment, a medical professional may recognize a pattern of wear on the shoe that is symptomatic of over protonation in the gait of a user. The medical professional may adjust the one or more air chambers <b>9</b> in the heel of the shoe of the user to provide additional support to counter the over protonation.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In another embodiment, the medical sole system program <b>26</b>, can receive, via a user interface, a pressure setting to compensate for under protonation by increasing the pressure in one or more air chambers <b>9</b> that correspond to the arch area in the shoe of a user.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In another embodiment, the medical sole system program <b>26</b>, can receive, via a user interface, a pressure setting in one or more air chambers <b>9</b> located in the forefoot area in response to a user recovering from an injury to the area.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In a next step (step <b>720</b>) the medical sole system program <b>26</b> receives a pressure data input during an activity by the user from the sole system <b>2</b>, for example via the sole system program <b>18</b>. In an embodiment, the pressure data input includes the pressure exerted by the user on a surface during an activity such as walking, running, jumping, or any other physical activity that causes the foot of the user to strike, or make contact with, the ground surface. In another embodiment, the pressure data input of a pressure input from an activity of the user, is automatically uploaded to, and accessible through, a web based service by the medical sole system program <b>26</b>. The web based service utilizes the pressure data input received from the one or more pressure sensors <b>5</b> and other sensors in sole system <b>2</b>. The pressure data input includes at least data related to the psi settings and the actual psi exerted by the user on the one or more air chambers <b>9</b> of the sole system <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In another embodiment, based on pressure data input and other sensor input from the sole system, the medical sole system program <b>26</b> is capable of determining the type of ground surface the shoe of sole system <b>2</b> of the user is in contact with based upon measurements associated with the pressure data input. In this embodiment, the medical sole system program <b>26</b> determines the type of ground surface that the user contacts as a function of the measurement of the duration of time from the initial sole system <b>2</b> to ground contact until complete compression of the air chambers <b>9</b> until release from the ground and decompression of the air chambers <b>9</b>. A longer duration of time of compression of the air chambers <b>9</b> is associated with a viscous surface such as sand. Comparatively, a shorter duration of time of compression of the air chambers <b>9</b> is associated with a more elastic surface.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In another embodiment, the medical sole system program <b>26</b> is constantly receiving pressure data input, in real time, from the one or more pressure sensors <b>5</b>. In this embodiment, the medical sole system program <b>26</b> constantly receives, and stores the pressure data received from the one or more pressure sensors <b>5</b> to the computing device <b>27</b> to establish data trends with respect to pressure data of the user. For example, a machine learning application may utilize the pressure data input received by the medical sole system program <b>26</b> to analyze trends with respect to the amount of pressure applied in a particular region of the foot. In this example, the pressure trends could be analyzed by a medical professional to determine that a user walks with a gait which indicates an injury that is unknown to the user. In another example, the pressure trends could be used by a medical professional to analyze and compare the amount of pressure applied to specific regions of the shoe of the user based on the type of shoe worn by the user.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In a further step (step <b>730</b>) the medical sole system program <b>26</b> compares the pressure input data received from the sole system <b>2</b> being worn by the user or patient received in step <b>720</b>, from the one or more pressure sensors <b>5</b> of one or more air chambers <b>9</b>, to the initial pressure setting received from the medical professional in step <b>710</b>. In an embodiment, a medical professional in step <b>710</b> initially sets the pressure of one or more air chambers <b>9</b>, in the heel of a shoe of a user, to a range of 30-35 p.s.i. In this embodiment, the sole system program <b>18</b> of embedded processor <b>3</b> sensed pressures of 32 p.s.i. through the one of more air chambers <b>9</b> in the forefoot of shoe of the user, a pressure of 30.02 p.s.i. through the one of more air chambers <b>9</b> in the arch area of the shoe of the user, and a pressure of 32.299 p.s.i. in the one or more air chambers <b>9</b> located in the heel area of the shoe of the user.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In a decision step (step <b>740</b>) the medical sole system program <b>26</b> determines whether the pressure data input during an activity of the user is within a range of the set pressures based on the air pressure set to cushion the user's foot. In an embodiment, the medical sole system program <b>26</b> determines whether the pressure data input, as received by the one of more pressure sensors <b>5</b>, in the one or more air chambers <b>9</b> located in the forefoot area, arch area, and the heel area of the shoe of the user, is within a range of p.s.i. as received by the medical sole system program <b>26</b> as a function of an input received as set by the medical professional in step <b>710</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">If the determined pressures are within the range of the set pressures (step <b>740</b> &#x201c;YES&#x201d;), then the medical sole system program <b>26</b> returns to a sentinel mode, and resumes constantly receiving pressure data from the user during an activity of step <b>720</b>. A sentinel mode is a surveillance mode where the medical sole system program <b>26</b> passively receives, monitors, and stores the pressure data received. It should be noted that step <b>720</b> can be conducted in the sentinel mode. In an embodiment, the pressure data is uploaded to the aforementioned cloud based server.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">If the determined pressures are not within the range of the set pressures (step <b>740</b> &#x201c;NO&#x201d;), then the medical sole system program <b>26</b> adjusts the pressures (step <b>750</b>) by sending updated pressure settings to the sole system <b>2</b>, for example via the sole system program <b>18</b> and the method returns to step <b>720</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In an embodiment, the medical sole system program <b>26</b> determines that the pressure data is 29.5 p.s.i. and not within the appropriate range 30-35 p.s.i., of pressure and automatically adjusts the pressure settings in one or more air chambers <b>9</b>, according to the medical professional recommendations via the embedded processor <b>3</b>, for example through sole system program <b>18</b>. For example, if the data received indicates that the user is walking on the outside of their foot in their shoe, additional pressure may be provided to one or more air chambers <b>9</b> to provide further cushion or support to another portion of the foot.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In another example, the pressure data received indicated, as a function of brief pressure reading interval increases, by the one or more pressure sensors <b>5</b>, in areas of the shoe that correspond to a gait pattern that is signature of the user running, then the pressure settings are applied to be consistent within the appropriate range, 30-35 p.s.i. to aid in reducing heel pain in which the user experiences based on over protonation.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In another example, the medical sole system <b>26</b> may adjust the pressure in one or more air chambers <b>9</b> as a function of the type of surface the sole system <b>2</b> of user is determined to be situated upon. In this example, a user may be running on an elastic surface that is bouncy and requires less pressure in the heel are of air chambers <b>9</b>. The medical sole system program <b>26</b> automatically adjusts the pressure in the heel area of air chambers <b>9</b> by reducing the p.s.i. as a function activating the inflator/deflator <b>4</b>, through embedded processor <b>3</b> of the sole system <b>2</b>, to decrease the pressure in this area.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">After adjustments are made by the medical sole system program <b>26</b>, to the one or more air chambers <b>9</b>, feedback from the one or more sensors <b>5</b> is provided to the user and the user retains the user data temporarily for syncing with the cloud based system if an internet connection is not readily available, or lost. In an embodiment, medical sole system program <b>26</b> and/or the sole system program <b>18</b> updates the cloud based network server with pressure settings and GPS data, heart rate data, blood pressure data, and/or visual data collected during a user defined time period, from one or more components such as pressure sensors <b>5</b>, and air chambers <b>9</b>.

Alternatively, the adjustment of pressure settings can take place using the sole system program <b>18</b>. For example, a user steps onto the wireless charging mat <b>22</b> and the user physically attaches an external pump, or compressor with a deflator to the sole system <b>2</b> via the external air inlet <b>30</b>. In an embodiment, the external inlet <b>30</b> is connected to the chamber inlet/outlet <b>10</b><i>a</i>-<b>10</b><i>h</i>.
