The small size of the device is accomplished by using a thick sensor membrane, compared to conventional devices, and by limiting the size of additional elements of the device relative to the size of the sensor membrane.

More precisely, the method and apparatus relate to monitoring blood pressure, and the corresponding blood pressure gradient, between the portal and hepatic veins which together comprise the porto-hepatic venous system, via a small, passive, sensor that is deployed (implanted) in the portal vein only or in both the hepatic and portal veins. The sensor is capable of implantation in the porto-hepatic venous system due to its reduced dimensions, as compared to current sensors for measuring fluid pressure which are too large and invasive to allow frequent, accurate monitoring of porto-hepatic blood pressures. The implanted sensor measures portal vein blood pressure and/or the porto-hepatic venous pressure gradient by correlation between the blood pressure and the frequency response of the sensor, and may be used in a system which provides pressure readings via an external processing and display system.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The portal vein is a vessel in the abdominal cavity that drains deoxygenated blood to the liver for cleaning. A system of blood vessels called the hepatic veins remove the cleaned blood from the liver to the inferior vena cava, where it is returned to the heart. Portal hypertension (&#x201c;PHT&#x201d;) occurs when the portal vein experiences a rise in blood pressure that is not a consequence of an increase in a patient's overall systemic blood pressure. Often, PHT is defined according to a &#x201c;portal pressure gradient,&#x201d; or, the difference in pressure between the portal vein and the hepatic veins, for example of 10 mmHg or greater. A typical portal venous pressure under normal physiological conditions is less than or equal to approximately 10 mmHg, and the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) is less than approximately 5 mmHg. Increased portal pressure leads to the formation of porto-systemic collaterals; the most serious of them being gastroesophageal varices. Once formed, varices represent a major risk for the patient due to the susceptibility for rupture and subsequent hemorrhage that in many cases leads to death. As a result, PHT is considered the most severe complication of cirrhosis of the liver and is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in cirrhosis patients.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Current procedures for monitoring portal pressure generally involve an indirect measurement of the portal venous pressure through the hepatic venous system. One such procedure is known as the hepatic venous pressure gradient or HVPG. HVPG is used to provide an indirect measurement of the portal vein pressure. The procedure is minimally invasive and involves catheterization of the hepatic venous system via femoral vein or jugular entry. A balloon tipped radiolucent catheter that is capable of measuring local blood pressure usually via a pressure transducer is placed in the Inferior Vena Cava or a large hepatic vein segment. Once in place the pressure is measured to provide the free hepatic venous pressure or FHVP. The FHVP is measured to quantify the external pressures being applied to the venous systems and to zero out the effects of systemic pressure. The catheter is then advanced into a small branch and a complete obstruction of flow is created (wedge position usually done by inflating balloon) to provide the wedged hepatic venous pressure or WHVP. The HVPG is given by HVPG=WHVP&#x2212;FHVP. While the HVPG has been shown to be a very effective diagnostic and prognostic indicator, it has been limited by the invasiveness of the procedure and the need for standardization to provide reliable results.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Other indirect procedures include, for example, measurement of variceal pressure which employs esophago-gastric approaches to advance an inflatable balloon-catheter into the abdomen of patients via the esophagus and stomach and position the balloon, adjacent to a gastroesophageal varix. The force of inflation required against the wall of the varix is used to calculate the intravariceal blood pressure. In general, non-direct portal venous pressure measurement is less precise, while still invasive and uncomfortable for a patient.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Direct measurement of the portal vein has been attempted in the past. One such procedure involves puncture catheterization, wherein a radiologist accesses the portal and/or hepatic venous systems, under fluoroscopic guidance, by puncturing the tissue of the system with a needle or catheter from outside of the system. Using puncture catheterization, the portal vein may be accessed via a transhepatic puncture using either an intracostal or subxiphoid approach, wherein a needle or catheter is inserted at a patient's 12<sup>th </sup>vertebrae, between the ribs, and punctures through to the portal vein. The hepatic venous system may be accessed via a transjugular approach, wherein a needle or catheter is inserted into the jugular vein and advanced into the hepatic vein via the vena cava. The portal vein may also be accessed from the hepatic venous system, using an intrahepatic puncture from the hepatic to portal venous systems. Thus, in order to monitor a portal pressure gradient, two separate punctures (for the portal and hepatic veins) are required. Physicians are reluctant to perform frequent, direct portal vein pressure measurements, due to the invasiveness of the procedure and as a result, it is not clinically practiced.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">There exists a strong clinical need for a pressure monitoring system that can provide accurate pressure measurements of portal and/or hepatic blood pressure while allowing the physician to monitor those pressures non-invasively.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Conventional devices include active electronics, sensors, and controls which require a power supply, or a connection to the outside world, and which increase the size of conventional devices thus restricting their use in the porto-hepatic venous system. In addition, conventional devices rely on components, for example sensors and/or membranes, that are large and/or needed in plurality of sensors/membranes, in order to maintain functionality, due, in part, to their tendency to rupture.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A need therefore exists for a pressure measurement system that is small in size, sensitive in function, and does not require redundancy. In addition, a need exists for a sensor system that may be operated without the need for wires or cables to transmit the pressure experienced by the sensor to an external device. The pressure measurement system should be miniature, passive, implantable and wireless to allow for non-invasive, frequent monitoring of portal venous pressure.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for measuring portal and/or hepatic pressures. The apparatus is a sensor device that is miniature, passive, implantable and wireless, to allow for non-invasive, frequent monitoring of portal venous pressure. The sensor device is miniature to allow for safe implantation into the target vessels. In one embodiment, the sensor device structure comprises a single sensor unit having a sensor membrane of a thickness greater than at least 1 micron and an overall sensor device size range of 0.1 mm-1 mm in width (w), 0.1 mm-1 mm in depth (d), and 0.1 mm-0.75 mm in height (h). The overall volume of the sensor device will preferably not exceed 0.3 cubic millimeters. Other examples of volumetric ranges (in mm<sup>3</sup>) for the sensor device are, e.g., 0.005-0.008, 0.01-0.09, or 0.1-0.3. The apparatus is passive to allow the treating physician to monitor the patient as often as is desired or needed. The invention is useful for interrogating ambient conditions in systems that comprise an incompressible fluid particularly in measuring portal and/or hepatic pressures.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">One object of the present invention is to provide a sensor device for measuring ambient fluid pressure in a system comprising an incompressible fluid, e.g., a liquid. The sensor device may be a naked vibratable sensor or a vibratable sensor housed in a cavity with or without a bottom film sealing the housing. In one embodiment, the sensor device comprises a vibratable sensor having a sensor membrane, which sensor membrane has a resonance frequency responsive to ambient fluid pressure conditions. The sensor membrane has a thickness in the range of 1 micron-200 microns and forms one side of a chamber. The chamber is defined by the sensor membrane and a plurality of walls which are substantially perpendicular to the sensor membrane. The chamber may be sealed with a compressible gas of predefined pressure disposed therein. The chamber is sealed with a bonding layer using an anodic bonding process. The bonding layer may provide a means for attachment of the vibratable sensor to an anchoring device. As such, the sensor device comprising a naked vibratable sensor may be a hermetically sealed, substantially or partially non-solid component of any shape having a sensor membrane and a chamber. Alternatively, the vibratable sensor may be an acoustically-active solid, i.e., a sensor membrane without a chamber. In either aspect, the vibratable sensor is biocompatible, i.e., substantially non-reactive within a human body.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another embodiment, the vibratable sensor may be disposed in a cavity defined by a housing. In this embodiment a cover plate covers the housing cavity such that the bonding layer faces the cover plate. A base plate forms the foundation for the housing. The base plate may contain an orifice exposing the sensor membrane of the vibratable sensor to the bodily environment to be measured. In one aspect of this embodiment, the housing further comprises a bottom film. The bottom film may be semi-permeable or non-permeable to external fluids and/or tissues and may enclose an incompressible fluid.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention also relates to a method for measuring portal and/or hepatic pressure, wherein a sensor device has been implanted in one or both of the portal and hepatic veins, wherein each device has a resonance frequency response that is dependent upon ambient pressure and each device has a predefined, non-overlapping resonance frequency response to pressure comprising the steps of: subjecting each sensor device to ultrasonic vibrations; receiving vibrations elicited in each sensor device by the ultrasonic vibrations, each received vibration including a vibration frequency; determining the resonance frequency response of each device from each elicited vibration frequency; determining the ambient pressure surrounding each sensor device from the frequency response of each sensor device; and in certain circumstances, determining a pressure gradient between each sensor device. Where two sensors are in close proximity to one another, the method further comprises distinguishing the frequency response of each sensor.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one embodiment, a sensor device may be implanted in the portal vein thereby providing a combination of hemostatic and intra-abdominal pressure. In another embodiment, a sensor device may be implanted in each the hepatic and portal venous systems. Implantation into the portal vein may be carried out via a transhepatic puncture using either an intracostal or subxiphoid approach, while the hepatic vein implantation may be carried out through the transjugular approach. In this way, the system may provide information on the pressure gradient between the hepatic venous systems. In this latter embodiment, the system provides both the porto-hepatic pressure gradient and the portal venous pressure in the same session. Implanting the sensor may also include the steps of anchoring the sensor to a bodily tissue or organ, or securing the sensor to a scaffold and implanting the scaffold.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In another embodiment, a sensor device may be implanted in each of the hepatic and portal venous systems. For example, the portal implantation may be performed by a transjugular approach and then traversing a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic (TIPS) shunt for access to the portal system. In this embodiment the measured porto-hepatic pressure gradient may provide the physician with a method of non-invasively monitoring the patency of the TIPS shunt.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">A further object of the invention is to provide a method for measuring portal vein pressure, with an implanted and anchored sensor device in the portal vein comprising the steps of: applying low- and high-frequency acoustic waves to the sensor, receiving the frequencies elicited in the sensor by the low- and high-frequency waves, and processing the received frequencies as acoustic data in order to determine the frequency response, e.g., resonance frequency, of the vibratable sensor, and thereby determine the ambient fluid pressure of the environment in which the sensor is disposed.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">An additional object of the invention is to provide a method for detecting and/or monitoring portal hypertension, wherein an implanted sensor device has a frequency response to ambient pressure conditions and at least one frequency response per given pressure comprising the steps of: transmitting low-frequency acoustic waves from a low-frequency acoustic transmitter, transmitting high-frequency acoustic waves from a high-frequency acoustic transmitter, and receiving reflected high-frequency acoustic waves with a high-frequency acoustic receiver and determining a pressure gradient wherein a raised pressure gradient is indicative of an active portal hypertension condition in need of treatment. Under normal physiological conditions the gradient between the portal and hepatic venous pressures is less than about 10 mm Hg. PHT is often defined as a gradient of 10 mm Hg or more. The method may further comprise capturing, processing, and displaying the received high-frequency acoustic waves as acoustic data.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Another object of the invention is to provide a method for measuring ambient fluid pressure in a subject system, from a sensor device disposed in the subject system, where the sensor device includes a vibration sensor with a sensor membrane that has a resonance frequency response dependent on ambient pressure conditions and at least one frequency response per given pressure, comprising the steps of: subjecting the sensor to low- and high-frequency acoustic waves in order to elicit acoustic resonances, or vibrations, in the sensor, detecting the acoustic resonances as reflected signals from the sensor, and processing the detected acoustic resonances in order to determine ambient fluid pressure.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a device in accordance with the invention for measuring portal venous pressure.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>, <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> show a sensor in accordance with the invention for measuring portal venous pressure.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a system in accordance with the invention for measuring, interpreting, and displaying portal venous pressure.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a passive sensor manufacturing method in accordance with the invention.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>C</figref> show various embodiments of a passive sensor anchoring device in accordance with the invention.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>B</figref> show aspects of various embodiments of a passive sensor implantation device in accordance with the invention.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates exemplary resonance frequencies from a vibration sensor as a function of ambient pressure in response to three different excitation frequencies, based on pressure oscillations around the mean value to be measured.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The method and apparatus of the invention generally relate to measuring ambient pressure in a system comprising an incompressible fluid.

The transducers provide a field of view comprising a depth of penetration of 4-16 cm and a beam spot diameter of 3 cm generating a measurement ellipsoid, for example. The transducers may be implemented using suitable piezoelectric transducers, but other transducers known in the art may be used, such as, but not limited to, capacitive transducers, wideband capacitive transducers, composite piezoelectric transducers, electromagnetic transducers, various transducer array types and various suitable combinations of such transducers configured for obtaining different frequencies and/or beam shapes. For example, acoustic transmitters manufactured by Vemco, PCB Piezoelectronics, and Hardy Instruments may be used. Acoustic waves <b>101</b>, <b>102</b> are directed at the sensor device <b>100</b>, producing modulated acoustic waves <b>105</b> that are detected by high frequency receiver <b>106</b>. Subsequent processing of waves <b>105</b> enables calculation of the ambient pressure in device <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">One aspect of the invention relates to an implantable sensor device comprising a miniature sensor device for measuring ambient fluid pressure. The sensor device comprises a vibratable sensor having a sensor membrane, which has a frequency response to ambient pressure conditions. The sensor membrane of the vibratable sensor forms one side of a chamber wherein resides a compressible gas of predefined pressure. The chamber is further defined by at least one wall which is preferably substantially perpendicular to the sensor membrane. In one embodiment, the vibratable sensor is made of silicon, but other suitable materials may be used, for example a metal, Pyrex&#xae; or other glass, boron nitride, or the like. Non-limiting examples of metals include, e.g., Titanium, Gold, Stainless Steel, Platinum, Tantalum, or any suitable metal, alloy, shape memory alloy such as NITINOL&#xae;. The chamber may be sealed with a bonding layer forming a side of the chamber opposite the sensor membrane. Where the vibratable sensor includes a bonding layer for sealing the chamber, the bonding layer may also be used for attachment to an anchoring means. In one embodiment, the bonding layer provides a hermetic seal for the chamber disposed in the vibratable sensor. The bonding layer may comprise Pyrex&#xae;, glass, silicon, or other suitable materials.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Generally, the vibratable sensor is manufactured by etching the appropriate shape and materials from a larger panel of the material. For example, the larger panel of material may be covered with a mask, the mask defining the shape of a plurality of the desired vibratable sensors, and then subjected to etching, which may be, for example, chemical etching or physical etching. The mask protects those areas of the panel that must not be removed during the etching process in order to produce the desired shape. For example, a plurality of vibratable sensors is formed when a mask having a plurality of precisely measured cut-outs cover a larger panel of material during the etching process, until chambers of the desired shape are produced in the larger panel to a depth that is substantially equal to a cut-out in the mask. The depth of the chamber may be controlled by various factors, for example where chemical etching is used: the volatility, duration, and number of chemical treatments. Each vibratable sensor may then be cut from the larger panel by slicing between consecutive chambers such that the amount of material remaining on each side of the chamber will be the thickness of walls defining a chamber in the vibratable sensor. The amount of material remaining between the bottom surface of the chamber and bottom of the larger panel will be the thickness of the sensor membrane. Any material that requires joining may be connected, for example, by brazing or welding.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As noted above, the vibratable sensor may additionally include a bonding layer of, for example, Pyrex&#xae; or other suitable material, in order to hermetically seal the vibratable sensor, preferably by joining the bonding layer to the walls of the chamber such that the bonding layer and sensor membrane are substantially parallel. In one embodiment, the bonding layer and sensor membrane form opposite walls of a vibratable sensor chamber. The bonding layer may provide a surface for attachment to anchors or other components.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a cross sectional illustration of one embodiment of the sensor device <b>200</b>.

Data <b>305</b> may include radio waves, electrical signals, digital signals, waveform signals, or any other means sufficient for communicating the acoustic properties of modulated acoustic waves <b>105</b>, as received by high frequency receiver <b>106</b>. Processing unit <b>301</b> interprets data <b>305</b> using the properties of modulated acoustic waves <b>105</b> to determine a frequency response of the sensor device <b>100</b>. The frequency response of the sensor is defined herein as the frequency of vibrations, including at least one resonance frequency, emitted by the sensor in response to the transmission of ultrasonic vibrations from transmitters <b>103</b>, <b>104</b>, at a given ambient pressure. For example, the frequency response of sensor device <b>100</b> is known when sensor device <b>100</b> is subject to &#x201c;normal&#x201d;, i.e., non-symptomatic, physiological conditions. In the portal venous system, &#x201c;normal&#x201d; conditions are a pressure approximately 5 mmHg or less, and a pressure gradient between the portal and the hepatic vein of approximately 10 mmHg or less. The internal pressure of sensor device <b>100</b>&#x2014;i.e., the pressure within cavity <b>208</b>&#x2014;is known and substantially constant. In the portal venous system, the frequency response of sensor device <b>100</b> changes in accordance with changes in the venous pressure. Low-frequency acoustic waves <b>102</b>, for example at 50 kHz, will stimulate at least one frequency response of vibrations in sensor device <b>100</b>, at a given pressure, by exciting vibrations in vibratable sensor <b>201</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). High frequency acoustic waves, for example 750 kHz, may be used to interrogate the excited vibratable sensor <b>201</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). This results in modulated acoustic waves <b>105</b> that can be detected by receiver <b>106</b>. High frequency acoustic waves are meant to interrogate, not to excite, the membrane <b>209</b> of the vibratable sensor <b>201</b>, and preferably minimally interact with the membrane <b>209</b> to maximize linearity of the system.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">One type of frequency response which may be measured according to the present invention is a resonance frequency.

The difference between the actual resonance frequency excited in the sensor device <b>100</b> and the resonance frequency of the sensor device under normal conditions is correlated to the difference in pressure between normal conditions and the actual blood pressure.

In this embodiment, a plurality of pressure measurements are taken during the interrogation period, for example, at least one cycle of expansion and contraction of the heart (pulse cycle). During the pulse cycle, the pressure of the entire vascular system will change continuously as the heart draws blood in and forces blood out. Accordingly, an acoustic signal that changes in a consistent manner correlated to the pulse cycle demonstrates an excitation in the sensor. Noise reflected from, for example, surrounding tissues in the interrogation environment, does not produce such a continuously changing signal that is correlated to the pulse cycle. The above features are not limited to a single embodiment; rather, those features and functions may be applied in place of or in conjunction with the other embodiments and concepts herein. The pulse cycle and waveform may be measured by an external device, for example using a pulse oximeter, heart rate monitor, ECG, etc. Optionally, such instruments may be connected to the pressure monitoring system of the invention to input the pulse or pulse waveform into the system for correlation with the acquired pressure waveform from the sensor to determine the validity of the acquired signal.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In operation, sensor device <b>100</b> is disposed in a measurement environment, for example, implanted in an area, vessel, artery, or the like, where pressure measurements are desired. The sensor system may be implanted by methods including, for example, portal venous catheterization procedures to position the sensor device <b>500</b> in the portal vein shown, for example, via scaffoldings <b>504</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>C</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>B</figref>. In such a procedure a percutaneous transhepatic approach to the portal vein may be employed, for example inserting the cannula <b>601</b> into a subject between the ribs and puncturing through to the portal vein. For the hepatic vein, the sensor device <b>500</b> may be inserted, for example, by transjugular hepatic vein access, similar to the procedure used in hepatic vein pressure-gradient measurements. In this procedure, a catheter is inserted into the jugular vein in the neck and advanced into the hepatic vein via the vena cava. The portal vein is also accessible by puncture from the hepatic vein, after a catheter has been inserted via transjugular hepatic procedures similar to the implantation of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts. Implantation into the portal vein may also involve traversing a TIPS shunt, in which case the patency of the TIPS shunt may be non-invasively monitored. Implantation is typically performed by an interventional radiologist under fluoroscopic guidance. Sensor device <b>500</b> is guided to the intended position using catheter delivery system <b>600</b>, for example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>B</figref>.

The sensor device <b>100</b> may be implanted in either or both of the portal and/or hepatic veins according to the procedures described herein or known. Once implanted in the porto-hepatic venous system, the method comprises the steps of: subjecting the sensor device <b>100</b> to ultrasonic vibrations from high frequency <b>103</b> and low frequency <b>104</b> transmitters; receiving the frequency response of one (or each) of the sensor devices <b>100</b>; determining a resonance frequency of the (or each) sensor device <b>100</b> from the received frequency response; determining ambient fluid pressure surrounding the (or each) sensor device <b>100</b> from the resonance frequency of the (or each) sensor device <b>100</b>; determining a pressure gradient between each sensor device <b>100</b> (in each of the portal and hepatic veins) wherein an elevated gradient (generally greater than 10 mm Hg) is indicative of an active portal hypertension condition in need of treatment; and displaying and/or recording the pressure measurements according to the system described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. Thus, the pressure of the portal and/or hepatic veins may be independently interrogated, determined, and displayed. Where the pressure gradient between the portal and hepatic veins is desired, one sensor may be implanted in each of those systems, and data captured for each sensor in the manner described above. The numerical measurement of the hepatic vein pressure, for example, could then be subtracted by further processing from the numerical measurement of the portal vein pressure, providing the gradient, or difference in pressure, between the two systems.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The method of monitoring a pressure gradient between the portal and hepatic veins includes the additional step of delineating between each sensor while performing the interrogation. The mechanism for the differentiation can be one of the following or both: (i) differences in frequency responses between the sensors may be detected by changing the dimensions of the membrane while maintaining the pressure ranges and accuracy of the sensor (i.e., one sensor will have a frequency response at a defined pressure between 30-50 kHz while the other may have a frequency response of 60-80 kHz at the defined pressure). Such a design entails a low frequency transmitter with a wide enough bandwidth to enable the operation of both sensors (i.e., between 30-50 and 60-80 kHz), or two or more low-frequency transmitters, one for each type of sensor; (ii) a narrow high or low (or both) frequency acoustic field is applied to the vicinity of the sensors to precisely locate each sensor during interrogation while acoustically isolating any other sensors in the vicinity.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In one embodiment, determining the pressure in the portal and/or hepatic veins comprises obtaining the mean pressure by a phase inversion method of calculation, which relies on small pressure oscillations created by the heartbeat. The small pressure oscillations exist around the mean pressure value which is to be measured. In order to determine the mean pressure value to be measured, a receiver as described for example with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> measures the response power of the sensor device, which is the amplitude of the oscillation of the vibratable sensor and is measured in decibels (dB). As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the small pressure oscillations occur around a particular mean value&#x2014;for example 90 Torr, indicated by the solid vertical line. When the sensor device is excited by certain frequencies, for example f1 and f2, the response power is an increasing function of the pressure, whereas excitation by another frequency, f3, results in a response power that is a decreasing function of the pressure. As a direct result the response power of f1 and f2 oscillate in phase with each other (and with the pressure) and that of f3 oscillates with an opposite phase. When the small pressure oscillations occur around a different mean value&#x2014;for example 100 torr, indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> by the dashed vertical line&#x2014;the response power of f1 is an increasing function of the pressure, whereas that of f2 and f3 are decreasing functions of the pressure. As a result, the response power of f1 oscillates in phase with the pressure, and that of f2 and f3 oscillated with an opposite phase. The phase inversion algorithm is based on these observations. The resonance frequency of the sensor device at the mean ambient pressure is that around which the phase inversion occurs. In this embodiment, the pulse cycle and waveform may be measured with an external device for correlation with the acquired pressure waveform from the sensor.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">This technique is particularly applicable to PHT since only a mean pressure reading is necessary.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, one example of a manufacturing method embodiment is shown for a sensor device in accordance with the devices and methods described herein. In step <b>401</b>, vibratable sensors are etched and cut from a panel of material to produce a plurality of individual vibratable sensors <b>402</b>, each of which may be hermetically sealed with a layer, such as bonding layer <b>211</b> (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>, <b>2</b>B</figref>) made of, for example, Pyrex&#xae;, which may be anodically bonded to one side of vibratable sensor <b>402</b>, or attached by brazing, welding (such as, for example, arc, laser, resistance, ultrasonic, or torsional), diffusion bonding, vapor deposition, adhesives, epoxies, or the like. Each vibratable sensor may then be assembled into a sensor device directly or may be further processed to be inserted into a housing cavity, as described below. Housing defining a cavity may be created in parallel steps, in which an individual housing is etched and cut <b>403</b> from larger panels of material and assembled <b>404</b> into a housing having a cavity. Cutting is accomplished by any suitable method, e.g., chemical etching, laser cutting, mechanical cutting, plasma cutting, punching, or the like. In a similar fashion if a cover plate is desired, a cover plate and fill port are machined <b>405</b> from a larger panel of material. Similarly, a base plate may be machined <b>406</b> from a larger panel of material. In one embodiment, a bottom film is hermetically sealed to the face of the base plate opposite the face that will abut the stacked assembly, in step <b>407</b>, via brazing, welding (such as, for example, arc, laser, resistance, ultrasonic, or torsional), diffusion bonding, vapor deposition, adhesives, epoxies, or the like. In another embodiment, the bottom film is not used. A vibratable sensor is then inserted into the cavity in the housing and the sensor-housing assembly is disposed on a base plate in a wafer-style stacking arrangement <b>408</b> (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>). As part of step <b>408</b>, the cover plate is disposed on the housing and encloses the vibratable sensor in the cavity, and the base plate and housing, and housing and cover plate, are hermetically sealed via brazing, welding (such as, for example, arc, laser, resistance, ultrasonic, or torsional), diffusion bonding, vapor deposition, adhesives, epoxies, or the like. In a further, non-illustrated step, the empty space of the cavity surrounding the vibratable sensor is filled with an incompressible fluid via the fill port in the cover plate, and the fill port is subsequently hermetically sealed using brazing, welding (such as, for example, arc, laser, resistance, ultrasonic, or torsional), diffusion bonding, or the like.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In the embodiment where the sensor without a housing is desired, the sensor is further manufactured by attaching the vibratable sensor to an anchoring means.

For example, the presence and the intensity of Doppler shifted sideband peaks in the frequency response of the sensor may be used to identify or locate the sensor in the body and to assist the centering of the interrogating ultrasound beam on the sensor(s). The sensor reflects the carrier frequency ultrasound signal (with Doppler shift) with much higher amplitude than any tissue in the human body, thus the identification and localization of the sensor and the centering of the interrogating beam may be performed by searching for a significant Doppler effect in the received signal. If the interrogating beam is scanned across the region in which the sensor is implanted or located, the beam is centered on the sensor when the sideband frequency's amplitude is maximal. When correlating a received signal to a pulse cycle measurement, the pulsatile pressure changes the signal amplitude of the Doppler sideband frequency (or frequencies) during the pulse cycle time. These pulsatile pressure induced sideband amplitude changes are present only in the signal reflected from the vibratable membranes of the sensor. Maximizing the amplitude of these pulsatile (periodic) amplitude changes may also be used by the system for sensor identification and for beam centering. Thus, the operator or user of the device may scan the interrogating beam in the region where the implanted sensor is assumed to be positioned and look for the presence of a sideband component (or components) at the expected frequency (or frequencies) having an amplitude which periodically varies in time at a rate similar to the blood pulse rate. In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, the pulsating sideband component may be visually detected on a display device coupled to the system. The interrogating beam may then be centered by carefully changing the beam direction and/or orientation in until the amplitude of the amplitude of the periodically varying sideband is maximal.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The system's operator may then carefully scan the interrogating beam position for fine-tuning the best beam position. The beam's position may be fine-tuned or optimized by slowly changing the beam direction and/or orientation until the amplitude of the sideband peak(s) is the maximized. By maximizing the sideband amplitude the operator may ensure a good signal to noise ratio by maximizing the received energy at the sideband frequency or frequencies. Maximizing the amplitude of sideband frequency (or frequencies) may also contribute to improving the signal-to-noise ratio and therefore the measurement accuracy and/or the inter-test and/or intra-test accuracy, repeatability and sensitivity. After beam centering, the operator may use the system for determining the blood pressure by determining the resonance frequency of the sensor(s) as disclosed in detail herein and computing the blood pressure from the determined resonance frequency (or frequencies).</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">It will be appreciated by persons having ordinary skill in the art that many variations, additions, modifications, and other applications may be made to what has been particularly shown and described herein by way of embodiments, without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention.
