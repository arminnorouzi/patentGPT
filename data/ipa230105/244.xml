For example, when situated on a desk or table, a laptop computer has a screen positioned typically one to three feet lower than eye level. This positioning arrangement forces a head-down user posture that is dangerous for extended sessions at the laptop computer and contributes greatly to computer-related repetitive use injuries.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is one aspect of some embodiments of the present invention to provide a stand for positioning a mobile computing device at an elevated position. When used in association with a laptop computer, the stand elevates a laptop computer screen to near eye level so that a user may maintain a more ergonomically correct working position, thereby reducing repetitive use injuries from using the laptop computer. The stand may be portable, allowing a user to work at remote locations away from their home or office in a more ergonomically correct position. The stand of embodiment is made without pins.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one example, a collapsible stand for use with a mobile computing device is provided. The stand may include a first side frame structure, a second side frame structure, and a cross frame structure interconnecting the first and second side-frame structures. The cross frame structure of one embodiment is operably coupled to the first and second side-frame structures such that the first and second side-frame structures are oriented parallel or substantially parallel to one another as the stand is moved from a fully extended to a collapsed position.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The first and second side frame structures include an elongate arm with an upper arm configured to engage the laptop's screen and a leg rotatably attached to the arm such that the leg rotates and slides relative to the arm.

The stand <b>2</b> generally consists of opposing side frame structures <b>14</b> interconnected by a cross frame structure <b>18</b> consists of cross frame members <b>20</b>. The side frame structures comprise a leg <b>22</b> and arm <b>26</b>. The arm <b>26</b> includes a first end with an engagement surface <b>30</b> configured to receive the screen of the laptop computer <b>6</b> and a second end that forms at least a portion of a base segment <b>34</b> configured to rest on a flat surface. The leg <b>22</b>, which is slidingly and rotatably associated with the arm <b>26</b>, includes an upper end that accommodates a gripping mechanism <b>42</b> and a second end that acts as a foot configured to engage the flat surface.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0073">The gripping mechanism <b>42</b> is adapted to engage and secure a front edge <b>48</b> of the laptop computer <b>6</b>. The leg <b>22</b> is further interconnected to the base segment <b>34</b> of the arm <b>26</b> by a cross link <b>50</b> to add stability to the expanded stand. In addition, some embodiments of the present invention are equipped with height adjusting functionality. Here, a height adjustment and maintaining mechanism <b>54</b> (hereinafter &#x201c;height adjustment mechanism&#x201d;) is operatively interconnected to the arms <b>26</b>, which will be described in further detail below. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, movement of the height adjustment mechanism <b>54</b> along the length of the arms <b>26</b> will alter the vertical distance between the gripping mechanism <b>42</b> and the flat surface <b>58</b> supporting the stand <b>2</b>, thereby altering the height of the laptop computer.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>8</b></figref> show the height adjustment mechanism <b>54</b> of one embodiment of the present invention comprising a lock <b>62</b> operatively interconnected to a carrier <b>66</b>. The height adjustment mechanism <b>54</b> is associated with at least one channel <b>70</b> integrated into the arms <b>26</b> of each side frame structure. The channel includes a plurality of teeth <b>74</b> that selectively interface with locking protrusions <b>78</b> provided on the carrier <b>66</b>. The locking protrusions <b>78</b> are interconnected to the flexible lock arms <b>82</b> cantilevered to a base portion of the carrier <b>66</b>. In operation, the lock arms <b>82</b> move outwardly and inwardly along Arrow A as the carrier <b>66</b> is moved along the arms <b>26</b> and the locking protrusions encounter lateral side surfaces <b>86</b> of the teeth. The lateral side surfaces <b>86</b> may be angled or arcuate to facilitate carrier movement. The carrier <b>66</b> also includes a longitudinal cavity <b>90</b> that receives fingers extending from a body portion <b>98</b> of the lock <b>62</b>. The fingers <b>94</b> help guide the lock <b>62</b> into the carrier <b>66</b> and control the motion of the lock <b>62</b> relative to the carrier <b>66</b> as the lock is engaged and disengaged. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>C</figref> bodies <b>98</b> also include protrusions <b>102</b> that selectively engage stops <b>104</b> provided on an upper end of the carrier <b>66</b> to prevent extension of the lock beyond a predetermined distance.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0075">In operation, when the lock <b>62</b> is disengaged from the carrier, i.e., when the body portion <b>98</b> is separated from the upper surface <b>106</b> of the carrier <b>66</b>, the height adjustment mechanism <b>54</b> can slide along the arms <b>26</b>. After a preferred laptop computer height is selected, the body portion <b>98</b> is brought into proximity with the upper surface <b>106</b> of the carrier <b>66</b> by using the thumb/finger pads <b>122</b>, which engages an inward-facing surface <b>110</b> of the lock's body portion <b>98</b> onto an outwardly-facing surface <b>114</b> associated with the locking protrusions. When the height adjustment mechanism <b>54</b> is in the locked position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, this engagement prevents the locking protrusions <b>78</b> from moving outwardly along Arrow A, which maintains the locking protrusions <b>78</b> within a locking space <b>18</b> located between adjacent teeth <b>74</b>. Alternatively, the locking protrusions can be adapted to grip a leg Movement of the body portion from a locked to unlocked position along Arrow H may be facilitated by thumb/finger pads <b>122</b>. The carriers <b>66</b> of corresponding arms may selectively interconnected to facilitate adjustment when the stand is in the collapsed configuration as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>. For example, the carrier <b>66</b> and/or body portion <b>98</b> may include detents <b>124</b> that are selectively received in corresponding cavities <b>125</b> of adjacent height adjustment mechanism (see, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>B and <b>9</b></figref>) to temporarily interconnect height adjustment mechanisms for coordinated movement. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that other mechanisms may be used to selectively lock the height adjustment mechanisms relative to the arms, one of which is described herein.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref> illustrate how portions of the stand of one embodiment of the present invention are interconnected. Here, the cross frame member <b>20</b> includes a head <b>126</b> on its upper portion. The head <b>126</b> has a spherical outer profile that fits within a corresponding socket <b>130</b> integrated into each leg <b>22</b>. Each leg <b>22</b> also defines a slider mechanism <b>134</b>, which generally consists of a longitudinal opening <b>138</b> and a corresponding opening <b>142</b> in the head <b>126</b> that operatively receive the arm <b>26</b>. In operation, when the base segments of the arms <b>26</b> are moved away from each other in the direction of Arrow B (see, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>), the slider mechanism <b>134</b> will urge the gripping mechanisms <b>42</b> away from each other. This motion will also move the slider mechanisms <b>134</b> downwardly along Arrow C towards the base segments. Eventually, a lower surface of the legs will abut the locks, thereby arresting the motion thereof and setting a laptop computer height. If a lock(s) is in the open position when the stand is expanded, the force exerted on upper portions of the body <b>98</b> by the lower surface of a leg will force the lock <b>62</b> into the carrier <b>66</b>, thereby setting the location of the height adjustment mechanism <b>54</b> and preventing accidental movement of the leg lower than intended.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0077">When the base segments are moved in the direction opposite to Arrow B, the side frame structures move closer to each other and the gripping mechanisms are rotated towards the engagement surfaces of the arms. The expanding/collapsing operation also causes the lower ends of the cross frame members to rotate about a pivot point associated with the base segment of the arms, which selectively changes the angle of the head relative to the outside surface of the leg. In one embodiment of the present invention, which will be described in further detail below, when fully collapsed, a portion of the head is substantially flush with the outer surface of the leg. Movement of the side frame structures will also cause the cross-link members <b>50</b> to rotate relative to a pivot point <b>160</b>. A lower end of the cross link member <b>50</b> is also attached to a pivot point associated with the base segment, wherein movement of the side frame member to collapse the stand will conceal the cross link members <b>50</b> inside longitudinal grooves <b>164</b> provided in the legs <b>22</b> (see, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0080" num="0078">The gripping mechanism <b>42</b> is very similar to that described in U.S. Pat. No. 9,894,988 mentioned above and includes a rotating member <b>168</b> that rides in an arcuate track (not shown). An elastic band <b>172</b> resides in a channel <b>174</b> and is operatively interconnected to the rotating member <b>168</b> that ends in a nub <b>176</b> that selectively engages the laptop's front edge. The rotating member <b>168</b> is, thus, configured to move along Arrow D to accommodate differing stand heights, computer sizes, etc. In one embodiment of the present invention, the band <b>172</b> is maintained within the channel <b>174</b> by at least one finger <b>184</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b> and <b>12</b></figref> show the interaction between the arms <b>26</b> and the head <b>126</b>, wherein the leg has been removed for clarity. The head of one embodiment has a spherical outer surface with a pin <b>188</b> extending therefrom configured to maintain the head's interconnection with the leg as it slides and rotates relative to the arm as the stand is expanded and collapsed. A retainer <b>192</b> is positioned opposite the pin <b>188</b> and is configured to interface with the inner surface of the socket to operatively secure the head <b>126</b>. The retainer may include a boss <b>196</b> that receives a corresponding pin (not shown) inwardly extending from the retainer <b>192</b>. The retainer <b>192</b> rotates within the socket when the stand is extended and collapsed, allowing the slider mechanism to move freely along the arm. The retainer also allows for the head to be interconnected to the socket during manufacturing. Alternatively, the retainer can be omitted, and the head may be snap-fit into the socket.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> highlights the cross frame member <b>20</b> of one embodiment of the present invention and its interactions with the leg operatively interconnected thereto. The cross frame member includes an opening <b>200</b> that receives the corresponding cross frame member, which is held in place by a pin <b>204</b> that interconnects the cross frame members that allows them to rotate relative to each other when the stand is collapsed and expanded. The cross frame members may also include stiffening ribs <b>208</b> that allows the cross frame member <b>20</b> to be made of thinner material if desired. Stiffening of the cross frame member is also achieved by perpendicularly disposed stiffening ribs <b>212</b> that substantially extend the entire length of the cross frame members. Because one cross frame member penetrates the other, the perpendicularly disposed stiffening rib <b>212</b> of one cross frame member will be located behind the perpendicularly disposed stiffening rib <b>212</b> of the other cross frame memner. Accordingly, when collapsed, the rib <b>212</b> of the penetrating cross frame member will be nested behind the rib <b>212</b> of the forward-most cross frame member.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> shows a leg <b>22</b> of one embodiment of the present invention with an upper end <b>216</b> associated with the gripping mechanism <b>42</b> and a lower end associated with the foot <b>46</b>. The leg <b>22</b> includes an outer surface <b>220</b> with sidewalls <b>224</b>, <b>228</b> extending therefrom to define a longitudinal groove <b>164</b>. The outer surface <b>220</b> may extend from the arm inner sidewall <b>224</b> to define a ledge <b>230</b>. As will be appreciated upon review of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, inner surfaces <b>234</b> of opposing legs <b>22</b> engage when the stand is in the collapsed position. The leg <b>22</b> may also include a cavity <b>238</b> configured to receive the rib <b>208</b> of the cross frame member <b>20</b> as the stand is transitioned into the collapsed position.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b>-<b>19</b></figref> show the stand <b>2</b> and the collapsed configuration, wherein inner surfaces of the gripping mechanisms <b>42</b> are placed in close proximity. Also, as discussed above, portions of the legs contact to conceal the folded cross frame structure. Here, the feet of the side frame structures, which are located above the base segments <b>34</b>, contact each other. The base segments may include a knurled surface to facilitate grasping by the user's thumbs and index fingers, which gives the user tactile confirmation of the correct grasping locations, which may prevent obstruction of the feet that would otherwise prevent outward motion of the base segments. Some embodiments of the present invention include pull tabs <b>250</b> attached to the base segments that may be biased against the outside surface of the arms, which will be described in further detail below. The pull tabs, which may be removable, facilitate expanding the stand and reduces the chances that the user will adversely affect the motion of the legs as they are deployed.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>19</b> and <b>20</b></figref> show the pull tabs <b>150</b> of one embodiment of the present invention operatively associated with the arms <b>26</b> of some embodiments of the present invention. The pull tabs <b>150</b> can employ a traditional hinge mechanism as shown or comprise a living hinge. The pull tabs <b>150</b> are biased with the spring <b>252</b>, for example, in the direction of Arrow E, and lay flat against an outer surface <b>254</b> of the arm's base segments. In operation, the user counteracts the spring force by rotating the pull tabs <b>150</b> in the direction opposite Arrow E and pulls the base segments <b>34</b> away from each other in the direction of Arrow B. Once the stand is expanded, the user removes pressure from the pull tabs, which return to rest against the outer surface <b>254</b>. This functionality virtually eliminates accidental user engagement with the feet, which allows for a smooth transition from the collapsed position to the expanded position. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> also shows the height adjustment mechanisms <b>54</b> interconnected as a unit as mentioned above, which allows for the height of each side frame structure to be modified in the same fashion by moving both locks to the unlocked position.

Here, a living hinge is provided that interconnects the tab portion <b>266</b> to the gripping member <b>270</b>, but other mechanisms for rotatable interconnection are contemplated. In other embodiments, the orientation of the tab portion is fixed relative to the gripping member. In this embodiment, the gripping member <b>270</b> is interconnected to the base segment <b>34</b> by selectively to flexible fingers <b>274</b>.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>25</b>-<b>27</b></figref> show a stand <b>1002</b> of another embodiment of the present invention that employs an alternate height adjustment mechanism <b>1054</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref> shows the stand <b>1002</b> and a collapsed configuration wherein corresponding height adjustment mechanism <b>1054</b> are engaged or selectively interconnected. The height adjustment mechanism <b>1054</b> of this embodiment is biased in the direction of Arrow F by a spring member <b>1500</b>, for example. When positions in a closed position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b></figref>, inwardly-extending detents (not shown) interconnected to an inner surface(s) of the height adjustment mechanism's <b>1054</b> sidewall <b>1504</b> are engaged within a locking cavity <b>1508</b> provided in the arms <b>1026</b>.
