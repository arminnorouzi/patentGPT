corresponding wavelength, and each being modulated to carry a different data stream, are multiplexed onto an optical fiber. In such systems, a laser and a modulator may be used to generate each optical signal. Accordingly, in order to increase the capacity of such systems, additional lasers, modulators and associated circuitry are employed. The cost associated with such systems may therefore increase, as capacity is increased. Accordingly, there is a need for a more cost-effective network requiring fewer components, such as the components described above.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Moreover, conventional optical communication systems may include high speed circuitry and components to generate optical signals at a transmit end of the system. Such signals may carry data at a relatively high data rate. At a receive end, corresponding high-speed circuitry may be provided to detect the incoming data and forward or distribute such data to lower capacity nodes. Accordingly, there is a further need to reduce costs by supplying high capacity signals to less expensive lower capacity nodes without the need for intermediate high-speed circuitry and components at the receive end of the system.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition, in conventional optical communication systems, data may be transmitted as a series of frames, each of which including a payload portion including customer or user data, and a header or overhead portion including operation, administration, and maintenance (&#x201c;OAM&#x201d;) information associated with the system. With increasing network complexity, the amount of such control or OAM information has increased, which may limit the amount of transmitted customer data. Therefore, there is also need to more efficiently transmit the OAM information so that more customer data may be transmitted.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, other aspects, features and advantages will be apparent from the following detailed description, the drawings, and the claims.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one aspect, the present disclosure describes a transmitter that includes a laser operable to output an optical signal; a digital signal processor operable to receive user data and provide a plurality of electrical signals based on the data; and a modulator operable to modulate the optical signal to provide a plurality of optical subcarriers based on the plurality of electrical signals.

Accordingly, relatively inexpensive leaf nodes may be deployed that receive data carrying optical signals from and supply data carrying optical signals to the hub node. One or more connections may couple each leaf node to the hub node, whereby each connection may include one or more spans or segments of optical fibers, optical amplifiers, and optical add/drop multiplexer, for example. Consistent with an aspect of the present disclosure, optical subcarriers may be transmitted over such connections. The subcarriers may be generated by a combination of a laser and a modulator, such that multiple lasers and modulators are not required, and costs may be reduced. In addition, the subcarriers may be employed using multiple access techniques, such as frequency division multiplexing (FDM) and time-division multiple access (TDMA) so that the primary node can communicate with a relatively large number of secondary nodes. In addition, an out-of-band control channel may be provided to carry OAM information from the primary node to the secondary nodes, as well as from the secondary nodes to the primary nodes.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Reference will now be made in detail to the present embodiments of the present disclosure, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.

Based on such time of flight information, primary node <b>110</b> may then schedule or coordinate transmission on various time slots to avoid collisions, such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0168"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b></figref> shows a flow chart of a method for determining time of flight information for each second node <b>112</b>. In step <b>3002</b>, circuitry in primary node <b>110</b> initializes the time of flight of flight (TOF) offset for each leaf <b>112</b> to zero. In step <b>3004</b>, a test message or TOF offset is sent to each leaf node <b>112</b> with an instruction or request for each such leaf node <b>12</b> to respond on a control channel, such as an in-band channel that is transmitted with data and is carried by one of the subcarriers. Circuitry in primary node <b>110</b> next measures a response time for each leaf node <b>112</b> (step <b>3006</b>). Circuitry in primary node <b>110</b> next determines the difference in TOF times (&#x201c;delta TOF&#x201d;) for each node and each delta TOF is adjusted so that the leaf node <b>112</b> having the longest TOF has a delta TOF of zero (step <b>3008</b>). Next, circuitry in primary node <b>110</b> determines when the delta TOF response time of each leaf node <b>112</b> is within a given tolerance or margin (step <b>3010</b>). If not, steps <b>3004</b>, <b>3006</b>, <b>3008</b>, and <b>3010</b> are repeated and will continue to be repeated until the delta response time is within such margin.

In a first step <b>3102</b> of the scheduling method, hub <b>110</b> evaluates or measures by way of the control channel noted above leaf node utilization of subcarriers and time slots. Based on such measured utilization, circuitry in hub <b>110</b> determines whether a leaf node is within the TOF tolerance or margin (step <b>3104</b>). If yes, one or more time slots are allocated to that leaf node (step <b>3106</b>), and, if not, the hub node provides instructions so that one or more subcarriers are allocated to such leaf node such that such leaf node may continuously transmit data on such allocated subcarrier(s) to hub node <b>110</b>. The leaf nodes are then configured to transmit only during designated time slots or continuously over a one or more subcarriers in accordance with instructions received, for example, by way of the subcarriers noted above dedicated for sending control channel information (step <b>3110</b>). In step <b>3112</b>, the hub monitor leaf node utilization over a predetermined time period, such as a time period of Y milliseconds.

For example, secondary node <b>112</b>-<i>m </i>is located 100 km away from primary node <b>110</b> and is thus the farthest secondary node away from primary node <b>110</b>. Further, in this example, secondary node <b>112</b>-<i>l </i>is 60 km away from primary node <b>110</b>, and secondary node <b>112</b>-<i>k </i>is 50 km away.

As noted above, after each TOF is determined, circuitry in primary node <b>110</b>, for example, determines the TOF associated with each node, wherein the delta TOF is the difference between the longest TOF, here 1000 &#x3bc;s, and the TOF of each remaining secondary node <b>112</b> (i.e., longest TOF&#x2014;TOF of each remaining secondary node). Accordingly, as further shown in table 3302 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b></figref>), the delta TOF associated with secondary node <b>112</b>-<i>j </i>is 700 &#x3bc;s (1000 &#x3bc;s-300 &#x3bc;s=700 &#x3bc;s or 3.5 TS); the delta TOF associated with secondary node <b>112</b>-<i>k </i>is 500 &#x3bc;s (1000 &#x3bc;s&#x2212;500 &#x3bc;s=500 &#x3bc;s or 2.5 TS); the delta TOF associated with secondary node <b>112</b>-<i>l </i>is 400 &#x3bc;s (1000 &#x3bc;s&#x2212;600 &#x3bc;s=400 &#x3bc;s or 2.0 TS); the delta TOF associated with secondary node <b>112</b>-<i>m </i>is 0.0 &#x3bc;s (1000 &#x3bc;s&#x2212;1000 &#x3bc;s=0.0 &#x3bc;s or 0 TS).</p><p id="p-0174" num="0173">In scheduling the transmission from secondary node <b>112</b> to primary node <b>110</b>, both TOF and delta TOF are taken into account in order to achieve desired arrival times at primary node <b>110</b> for each such transmission. An example of such scheduling will next be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>34</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0174"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>34</b></figref> shows example timing charts <b>3402</b> and <b>3404</b> in which, for ease of explanation, transmission on only subcarriers SC<b>1</b> to SC<b>4</b> is shown.
