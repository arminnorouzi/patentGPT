Lithium metal is the most widely used lithium source for anode pre-lithiation, despite its high cost and risk. The technology can be divided into two categories depending on whether the lithium serves as a third electrode, or whether it is coated directly on the surface of the anode. When a lithium foil is utilized as third electrode, a long pre-lithiation period up to 20 days is needed to obtain a satisfactory degree of lithiation of the anode (U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,461,769 and 6,740,454). This not only increases the production cost, but also limits the productivity. Additionally, a porous current collector is also needed for penetrating the lithium ions, which further increases production cost. On the other hand, various methods have been developed for lithium coating on the surface of the anode, such as physical vapor deposition, melt lithium coating, ultrathin lithium foil pressing, and stabilized lithium metal powder. However, these methods suffer from poor flexibility and pre-lithiation uniformity in addition to high cost (US20170324073A1 and ECS Transactions, 2007. 3(27):15).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">There are other pre-lithiation methods, such as electrochemical pre-lithiation and internal short-circuit pre-lithiation, which have been extensively explored and utilized in the academic community, but which are believed unpractical for industrial application. The main obstacle with these methods is that it is not practical to assemble every cell only for pre-lithiation of the anode, and then disassemble them again before the final cell assembly. US 2016141596 A1, US 2013003261 A1, KR 20150014877 A, WO 2017100415 A1, and CN 110335992 A disclose a variety of methods for lithiating electrodes.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The invention has for its object to remedy or to reduce at least one of the drawbacks of the prior art, or at least provide a useful alternative to prior art. The object is achieved through features, which are specified in the description below and in the claims that follow. The invention is defined by the independent patent claims, while the dependent claims define advantageous embodiments of the invention.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a first aspect, the invention relates more specifically to a method for pre-lithiating a plurality of anodes, wherein the method comprises the steps of: packing an anode sheet with a lithium-comprising sheet and a separator as a jelly roll or stack in an electrolyte, wherein the lithium-comprising sheet comprises a compound which can provide lithium ions; transferring lithium ions to the anode sheet to obtain a pre-lithiated anode sheet by discharging or charging the anode sheet towards the lithium-comprising sheet; and dividing the pre-lithiated anode sheet into a plurality of pre-lithiated anodes of a desired size and shape.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The lithium-comprising sheet should be able to provide lithium ions to the electrolyte for pre-lithiation of the anode. In a currently non-claimed embodiment, the lithium-comprising sheet may be a lithium foil, but it may also be a sheet of another material which comprises lithium, for example a copper foil coated with lithium. The lithium-comprising sheet that comprises a compound which can provide lithium ions, for example comprises lithium cobalt oxide, lithium manganese oxide, lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide, lithium iron phosphate, lithium titanium oxide, lithium azide, lithium squarate, lithium oxalate, lithium ketomalonate, or lithium di-ketosuccinate. The sheets may be shaped as very long strips which can be rolled around a suitable core to form a jelly roll. Alternatively, the strips may be Z-stacked, or a plurality of anode sheets and lithium-comprising sheets may be stacked on top of each other. In this way the sheets will have a large surface area close to each other to reduce the distance that the lithium ions are required to diffuse through the electrolyte, thereby increasing the efficiency of the method by decreasing the time required to pre-lithiate the anode sheet. Packing of the anode sheet and lithium-comprising sheet in an electrolyte means that electrolyte should be present before the next step in the method, i.e. jelly roll or stack may be assembled before or after addition of electrolyte. A layer of separator is placed between the anode sheet and the lithium-comprising, in which case the anode sheet is discharged towards the lithium-comprising sheet for the lithium ions to be transferred. The pre-lithiated anode sheet may typically be washed with a suitable solvent before it is divided, typically by cutting or slitting.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The process of producing an electrochemical cell typically includes mixing of the electrode components, coating the resulting electrode slurry on a metal foil before drying, calendaring of the electrode to densify and enhance its adhesion onto the metal foil, slitting/cutting the electrode into suitable sizes, pre-lithiating of each of the anodes, and finally cell assembly and formation steps.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">An advantage of using the method according to the invention is that, instead of packing each of a plurality of anodes together with an individual lithium foil into individual cells for pre-lithiation of each anode as in prior art, a larger anode sheet can be packed in a larger cell with a correspondingly large lithium-comprising sheet. The anode sheet may for large scale production be e.g. 0.01-2 m wide and 1-1000 m long. The size and shape of the anode sheet may depend on the packing of the anode sheet in the electrolyte. If packed as a jelly roll, the anode sheet may be very long, for example 1 m wide and 1000 m long. After the pre-lithiated anode sheet has been divided, each pre-lithiated anode obtained by the method can then be packed with a suitable cathode, separator, and electrolyte to produce an electrochemical cell, e.g. a lithium-ion battery or lithium-ion capacitor. This will significantly reduce the number of cells required for pre-lithiation, which reduces the complexity of the process and making it industrially applicable for largescale production. Additionally, the method has the advantages of high flexibility and precise control of the degree of pre-lithiation.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one embodiment, the step of packing the anode sheet with the lithium-comprising sheet as a jelly roll or stack in the electrolyte may include the step of subjecting the anode sheet and lithium-comprising sheet to the electrolyte before assembling a jelly roll or stack of the anode sheet and lithium-comprising sheet. This ensures a high wettability of the sheets, i.e. that the electrolyte covers all areas of the sheets, or at least has a larger contact surface with the sheets. The sheets may for example be immersed in the electrolyte while they are assembled as a jelly roll or a stack. If the jelly roll or stack are assembled before being subjected to the electrolyte, the close contact of the anode sheet and lithium-comprising sheet may prevent the electrolyte accessing some regions between the sheets, or at least increase the time it takes for the electrolyte to access these regions. This problem may be more pronounced for a larger stack or jelly roll. A suitable separator between the anode sheet and the lithium-comprising sheet may also increase the rate and/or degree of wettability of the sheets. A suitable separator may for example comprise a microporous, polymeric membrane.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">As the step of transferring lithium ions to the anode sheet to obtain a pre-lithiated anode sheet includes the step of discharging the anode sheet towards the lithium-comprising sheet, this will provide a driving force for the positively charged lithium ions to be transferred to the anode sheet. This step may be performed by connecting the anode sheet and lithium-comprising sheet to a battery analyzer. The step of transferring lithium ions to the anode sheet to obtain a pre-lithiated anode sheet may also include the step of applying a pre-defined charge or discharge protocol between the anode sheet and the lithium-comprising sheet. In this way, the pre-lithiation degree can be precisely controlled. Additionally, the properties of solid electrolyte interface can be optimized and controlled by controlling the current and charge and discharge protocol as well as the temperature and pressure. This provides a high flexibility of the method. As an alternative to the battery analyzer, a resistor with a predetermined resistance may be used to achieve a similar effect.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one embodiment, the method may additionally comprise the step of masking a predetermined area of the anode sheet with a layer of polymer film before the step of packing the anode sheet with the lithium-comprising sheet in the electrolyte. A current collector area for connection with a metal tab is generally required on the anode for connecting it with an external circuit, and this tab area will be contaminated by the electrolyte during the pre-lithiation process. By masking the tab area with a layer of polymer film, such as polyethylene (PE) or polypropylene (PP), and remove this film after pre-lithiation, contamination of the tab area may be prevented or mitigated. The current collector area can be washed by organic solvent, such as dimethyl carbonate (DMC) or diethyl carbonate (DEC), or laser, to ensure its high welding quality with the metal tab.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one embodiment, the step of transferring lithium ions to the anode sheet to obtain a pre-lithiated anode sheet may be enhanced by pressing the jelly roll through an external fixture. This will ensure a uniform distance between anode and lithium foil thus improving the pre-lithiation uniformity. Additionally, since gas may be generated during the pre-lithiation process, which may form gas bubbles and affect the pre-lithiation uniformity, application of an increased external pressure may facilitate gas transportation away from the electrode surface. The external pressure applied can be up to 1 MPa, for example 0.1, 0.5, or 1 MPa.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one embodiment, the step of packing the anode sheet with the lithium-comprising sheet in the electrolyte includes rolling the anode sheet and lithium-comprising sheet around a large core to decrease the curvature of the anode sheet. The core may for example have a diameter of 5, 25, 50, or 100 cm, or whatever value is practically suitable. The larger the core, the smaller the curvature. In this way bending of the pre-lithiated anode due to volume expansion during the pre-lithiation process will be less severe. Alternative ways for decreasing the bending is to Z-stack the anode sheet and the lithium-comprising sheet, alternately stack a plurality of large sheets, or use a jelly roll core with at least one flat surface to provide a region of the anode that is flat when wounded around the core.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In a second aspect the invention relates to an electrochemical cell, wherein the electrochemical cell comprises an anode which is pre-lithiated by the method according to the first aspect of the invention. The electrochemical cell may for example be a lithium-ion capacitor or a lithium-ion battery.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the following is described examples of preferred embodiments illustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein:</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a preparation of an anode sheet and a lithium-comprising sheet as a cylindrical jelly roll (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a</i></figref>, viewed from along the cylinder axis), and packing of the wound jelly roll in a container with an electrolyte (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>b</i></figref>, viewed perpendicularly to the cylinder axis);</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows another preparation of an anode sheet and a lithium-comprising sheet as a rectangular jelly roll (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>a</i></figref>, viewed along the axis of rotation of the jelly roll), and packing of the jelly roll in an electrolyte (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>b</i></figref>, viewed perpendicular to the view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a</i></figref>) while attached to a battery analyzer;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows additional ways in which the anode sheet and lithium-comprising sheet can be packed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <i>b</i></figref>);</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a flow diagram of an embodiment of the method according to the invention;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows the cyclic stability of the lithium-ion capacitor created in example 1, by cycling between 2 and 3.8 V at a current of 7 A; and</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows the charge and discharge voltage profile of the lithium-ion capacitor created in example 1, by cycling between 2 and 3.8 V at a current of 7 A.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the drawings, the reference numeral <b>1</b> indicates an anode sheet.
