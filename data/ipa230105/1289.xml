In accordance with various aspects of the disclosure, a gaming headset receives a plurality of audio channels during play of a particular game. The plurality of audio channels comprises game audio channels that convey audio for the game, and a chat audio channel that conveys chat audio. The gaming headset includes an integrated analog voiceband modem that modulates data for communication over the chat audio channel, and transmits the modulated data on the chat audio channel that conveys the chat audio. The modulated data may be communicated, via the chat audio channel, to one or more devices associated with one or more other gamers that are engaged in the play of the particular game. The modulated data includes one or more dual tone multi-frequency tones. The gaming headset may receive data, via the chat audio channel, from one or more devices associated with one or more other gamers that are engaged in the play of the particular game. The gaming headset may demodulate the data, which is received via the chat audio channel, from the one or more devices associated with one or more other gamers that are engaged in the play of the particular game. The transmitted data and the demodulated data may comprise parameter settings, scrambling keys, and/or messages comprising text, image, and/or video content. At least a portion of the demodulated data may be converted to audio data, which may be played from speakers on the gaming headset. The gaming headset may receive the data from a second screen communication device that is communicatively coupled to the gaming headset. A gamer that is engaged in the particular game may utilize the second screen communication device to send the data. The data that is received from the second screen communication device may be communicated to another second screen communication device via the chat audio channel. The another second screen communication device may be utilized by another gamer that is engaged in the particular game. The gaming headset may acquire the modulated data from a storage device within the gaming headset.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> depicts an example gaming console, which may be utilized to provide inter-headset communications via data over in-game audio, in accordance with various exemplary embodiment of the disclosure.
