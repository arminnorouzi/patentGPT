The range of frequencies passed by a filter is referred to as the &#x201c;pass-band&#x201d; of the filter. The range of frequencies stopped by such a filter is referred to as the &#x201c;stop-band&#x201d; of the filter. A typical RF filter has at least one pass-band and at least one stop-band. Specific requirements on a passband or stop-band depend on the specific application. For example, a &#x201c;pass-band&#x201d; may be defined as a frequency range where the insertion loss of a filter is better than a defined value such as 1 dB, 2 dB, or 3 dB. A &#x201c;stop-band&#x201d; may be defined as a frequency range where the rejection of a filter is greater than a defined value such as 20 dB, 30 dB, 40 dB, or greater depending on application.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">RF filters are used in communications systems where information is transmitted over wireless links. For example, RF filters may be found in the RF front-ends of cellular base stations, mobile telephone and computing devices, satellite transceivers and ground stations, IoT (Internet of Things) devices, laptop computers and tablets, fixed point radio links, and other communications systems. RF filters are also used in radar and electronic and information warfare systems.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">RF filters typically require many design trade-offs to achieve, for each specific application, the best compromise between performance parameters such as insertion loss, rejection, isolation, power handling, linearity, size and cost. Specific design and manufacturing methods and enhancements can benefit simultaneously one or several of these requirements.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Performance enhancements to the RF filters in a wireless system can have broad impact to system performance. Improvements in RF filters can be leveraged to provide system performance improvements such as larger cell size, longer battery life, higher data rates, greater network capacity, lower cost, enhanced security, higher reliability, etc. These improvements can be realized at many levels of the wireless system both separately and in combination, for example at the RF module, RF transceiver, mobile or fixed sub-system, or network levels.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">High performance RF filters for present communication systems commonly incorporate acoustic wave resonators including surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonators, bulk acoustic wave (BAW) resonators, film bulk acoustic wave resonators (FBAR), and other types of acoustic resonators. However, these existing technologies are not well-suited for use at the higher frequencies and bandwidths proposed for future communications networks.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The desire for wider communication channel bandwidths will inevitably lead to the use of higher frequency communications bands. Radio access technology for mobile telephone networks has been standardized by the 3GPP (3<sup>rd </sup>Generation Partnership Project). Radio access technology for 5<sup>th </sup>generation mobile networks is defined in the 5G NR (new radio) standard. The 5G NR standard defines several new communications bands. Two of these new communications bands are n77, which uses the frequency range from 3300 MHz to 4200 MHz, and n79, which uses the frequency range from 4400 MHz to 5000 MHz. Both band n77 and band n79 use time-division duplexing (TDD), such that a communications device operating in band n77 and/or band n79 use the same frequencies for both uplink and downlink transmissions. Bandpass filters for bands n77and n79 must be capable of handling the transmit power of the communications device. WiFi bands at 5 GHz and 6 GHz also require high frequency and wide bandwidth. The 5G NR standard also defines millimeter wave communication bands with frequencies between 24.25 GHz and 40 GHz.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The Transversely-Excited Film Bulk Acoustic Resonator (XBAR) is an acoustic resonator structure for use in microwave filters. The XBAR is described in U.S. Pat. No. 10,491,291, titled TRANSVERSELY EXCITED FILM BULK ACOUSTIC RESONATOR, which is incorporated herein by reference. An XBAR resonator comprises an interdigital transducer (IDT) formed on a thin floating layer, or diaphragm, of a single-crystal piezoelectric material. The IDT includes a first set of parallel fingers, extending from a first busbar and a second set of parallel fingers extending from a second busbar. The first and second sets of parallel fingers are interleaved. A microwave signal applied to the IDT excites a shear primary acoustic wave in the piezoelectric diaphragm. XBAR resonators provide very high electromechanical coupling and high frequency capability. XBAR resonators may be used in a variety of RF filters including band-reject filters, band-pass filters, duplexers, and multiplexers.

The XBAR is described in U.S. Pat. No. 10,491,291, titled TRANSVERSELY EXCITED FILM BULK ACOUSTIC RESONATOR, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. An XBAR resonator comprises a conductor pattern having an interdigital transducer (IDT) formed on a thin floating layer or diaphragm of a piezoelectric material. The IDT has two busbars which are each attached to a set of fingers and the two sets of fingers are interleaved on the diaphragm over a cavity formed in a substrate upon which the resonator is mounted. The diaphragm spans the cavity and may include front-side and/or back-side dielectric layers. A microwave signal applied to the IDT excites a shear primary acoustic wave in the piezoelectric diaphragm, such that the acoustic energy flows substantially normal to the surfaces of the layer, which is orthogonal or transverse to the direction of the electric field generated by the IDT. XBAR resonators provide very high electromechanical coupling and high frequency capability.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Acoustic filters are typically required to match a system impedance, such as 50 ohms. The system impedance and operating frequency dictate a required equivalent capacitance C<sub>0 </sub>for a filter using a conventional ladder circuit. C0 is inversely proportional to frequency. XBAR resonators have low capacitance per unit area compared to other acoustic resonators. Thus, ladder filter circuits using XBAR resonators may be much larger than comparable filters using other types of acoustic resonators.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The following describes a filter circuit architecture that allows low frequency filters to be implemented with small XBAR resonators. It also describes improved XBAR resonators, filters and fabrication techniques that reduce static capacitance in radio frequency filters having sub-filters connected in parallel between two ports where the sub-filters have XBARs on different substrates of different die. The sub-filter XBARs have a piezoelectric plate with a back surface attached to the different substrates and portions of the plate forming diaphragms spanning cavities in the substrates. Interleaved fingers of IDTs are on the diaphragms and the thicknesses of the piezoelectric plate portions may be different.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a simplified schematic top view, orthogonal cross-sectional views, and a detailed cross-sectional view of a transversely-excited film bulk acoustic resonator (XBAR) <b>100</b>. XBAR resonators such as the resonator <b>100</b> may be used in a variety of RF filters including band-reject filters, band-pass filters, duplexers, and multiplexers. XBARs are particularly suited for use in filters for communications bands with frequencies above 3 GHz. The matrix XBAR filters described in this patent are also suited for frequencies above 1 GHz.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The XBAR <b>100</b> is made up of a thin film conductor pattern formed on a surface of a piezoelectric plate <b>110</b> having parallel front and back surfaces <b>112</b>, <b>114</b>, respectively. The piezoelectric plate is a thin single-crystal layer of a piezoelectric material such as lithium niobate, lithium tantalate, lanthanum gallium silicate, gallium nitride, or aluminum nitride. The piezoelectric plate is cut such that the orientation of the X, Y, and Z crystalline axes with respect to the front and back surfaces is known and consistent. The piezoelectric plate may be Z-cut (which is to say the Z axis is normal to the front and back surfaces <b>112</b>, <b>114</b>), rotated Z-cut, or rotated YX cut. XBARs may be fabricated on piezoelectric plates with other crystallographic orientations.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The back surface <b>114</b> of the piezoelectric plate <b>110</b> is attached to a surface of the substrate <b>120</b> except for a portion of the piezoelectric plate <b>110</b> that forms a diaphragm <b>115</b> spanning a cavity <b>140</b> formed in the substrate. The portion of the piezoelectric plate that spans the cavity is referred to herein as the &#x201c;diaphragm&#x201d; <b>115</b> due to its physical resemblance to the diaphragm of a microphone. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the diaphragm <b>115</b> is contiguous with the rest of the piezoelectric plate <b>110</b> around all of a perimeter <b>145</b> of the cavity <b>140</b>. In this context, &#x201c;contiguous&#x201d; means &#x201c;continuously connected without any intervening item&#x201d;. In other configurations, the diaphragm <b>115</b> may be contiguous with the piezoelectric plate around at least 50% of the perimeter <b>145</b> of the cavity <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The substrate <b>120</b> provides mechanical support to the piezoelectric plate <b>110</b>. The substrate <b>120</b> may be, for example, silicon, sapphire, quartz, or some other material or combination of materials. The back surface <b>114</b> of the piezoelectric plate <b>110</b> may be bonded to the substrate <b>120</b> using a wafer bonding process. Alternatively, the piezoelectric plate <b>110</b> may be grown on the substrate <b>120</b> or attached to the substrate in some other manner. The piezoelectric plate <b>110</b> may be attached directly to the substrate or may be attached to the substrate <b>120</b> via one or more intermediate material layers (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">&#x201c;Cavity&#x201d; has its conventional meaning of &#x201c;an empty space within a solid body.&#x201d; The cavity <b>140</b> may be a hole completely through the substrate <b>120</b> (as shown in Section A-A and Section B-B) or a recess in the substrate <b>120</b> under the diaphragm <b>115</b>. The cavity <b>140</b> may be formed, for example, by selective etching of the substrate <b>120</b> before or after the piezoelectric plate <b>110</b> and the substrate <b>120</b> are attached.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The conductor pattern of the XBAR <b>100</b> includes an interdigital transducer (IDT) <b>130</b>. The IDT <b>130</b> includes a first plurality of parallel fingers, such as finger <b>136</b>, extending from a first busbar <b>132</b> and a second plurality of fingers extending from a second busbar <b>134</b>. The first and second pluralities of parallel fingers are interleaved. The interleaved fingers overlap for a distance AP, commonly referred to as the &#x201c;aperture&#x201d; of the IDT. The center-to-center distance L between the outermost fingers of the IDT <b>130</b> is the &#x201c;length&#x201d; of the IDT.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The first and second busbars <b>132</b>, <b>134</b> serve as the terminals of the XBAR <b>100</b>. A radio frequency or microwave signal applied between the two busbars <b>132</b>, <b>134</b> of the IDT <b>130</b> excites a primary acoustic mode within the piezoelectric plate <b>110</b>. The primary acoustic mode of an XBAR is a bulk shear mode where acoustic energy propagates along a direction substantially orthogonal to the surface of the piezoelectric plate <b>110</b>, which is also normal, or transverse, to the direction of the electric field created by the IDT fingers. Thus, the XBAR is considered a transversely-excited film bulk wave resonator.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The IDT <b>130</b> is positioned on the piezoelectric plate <b>110</b> such that at least the fingers of the IDT <b>130</b> are disposed on the diaphragm <b>115</b> of the piezoelectric plate which spans, or is suspended over, the cavity <b>140</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the cavity <b>140</b> has a rectangular shape with an extent greater than the aperture AP and length L of the IDT <b>130</b>. A cavity of an XBAR may have a different shape, such as a regular or irregular polygon. The cavity of an XBAR may have more or fewer than four sides, which may be straight or curved.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The detailed cross-section view (Detail C) shows two IDT fingers <b>136</b><i>a</i>, <b>136</b><i>b </i>on the surface of the piezoelectric plate <b>110</b>. The dimension p is the &#x201c;pitch&#x201d; of the IDT and the dimension w is the width or &#x201c;mark&#x201d; of the IDT fingers. A dielectric layer <b>150</b> may be formed between and optionally over (see IDT finger <b>136</b><i>a</i>) the IDT fingers. The dielectric layer <b>150</b> may be a non-piezoelectric dielectric material, such as silicon dioxide or silicon nitride. The dielectric layer <b>150</b> may be formed of multiple layers of two or more materials. The IDT fingers <b>136</b><i>a </i>and <b>136</b><i>b </i>may be aluminum, copper, beryllium, gold, tungsten, molybdenum, alloys and combinations thereof, or some other conductive material. Thin (relative to the total thickness of the conductors) layers of other metals, such as chromium or titanium, may be formed under and/or over and/or as layers within the fingers to improve adhesion between the fingers and the piezoelectric plate <b>110</b> and/or to passivate or encapsulate the fingers and/or to improve power handling. The busbars of the IDT <b>130</b> may be made of the same or different materials as the fingers.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">For ease of presentation in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the geometric pitch and width of the IDT fingers is greatly exaggerated with respect to the length (dimension L) and aperture (dimension AP) of the XBAR. A typical XBAR has more than ten parallel fingers in the IDT <b>110</b>. An XBAR may have hundreds of parallel fingers in the IDT <b>110</b>. Similarly, the thickness of the fingers in the cross-sectional views is greatly exaggerated.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">An XBAR based on shear acoustic wave resonances can achieve better performance than current state-of-the art surface acoustic wave (SAW), film-bulk-acoustic-resonators (FBAR), and solidly-mounted-resonator bulk-acoustic-wave (SMR BAW) devices. In particular, the piezoelectric coupling for shear wave XBAR resonances can be high (&#x3e;20%) compared to other acoustic resonators. High piezoelectric coupling enables the design and implementation of microwave and millimeter-wave filters of various types with appreciable bandwidth.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The basic behavior of acoustic resonators, including XBARs, is commonly described using the Butterworth Van Dyke (BVD) circuit model as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>.

The static arm includes a static capacitance C<sub>0 </sub>and a resistance R<sub>0</sub>. While the BVD model does not fully describe the behavior of an acoustic resonator, it does a good job of modeling the two primary resonances that are used to design band-pass filters, duplexers, and multiplexers (multiplexers are filters with more than 2 input or output ports with multiple passbands).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The first primary resonance of the BVD model is the motional resonance caused by the series combination of the motional inductance L<sub>m </sub>and the motional capacitance C<sub>m</sub>.

The acoustic resonators XL1, XL2, XH1, and XH2 create &#x201c;transmission zeros&#x201d; at their respective resonance frequencies. A &#x201c;transmission zero&#x201d; is a frequency where the input-output transfer function of the filter <b>300</b> is very low (and would be zero if the acoustic resonators XL1, XL2, XH1, and XH2 were lossless). The zero transmission may be caused by one or more of the acoustic resonators creating a very low impedance to ground and thus, in this configuration cause the sub-filters to be removed as filtering components as the acoustic resonators are basically short circuits to ground so that the sub-filters have no effect on the filter <b>300</b> during transmission zero frequencies. Typically, but not necessarily, the resonance frequencies of XL1 and XL2 are equal, and the resonance frequencies of XH1 and XH2 are equal.
