In particular, layer formation is performed through solidification of photo curable resin under the action of visible or UV light irradiation. Two techniques are known: one in which new layers are formed at the top surface of the growing object; the other in which new layers are formed at the bottom surface of the growing object.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">If new layers are formed at the top surface of the growing object, then after each irradiation step the object under construction is lowered into the resin &#x201c;pool,&#x201d; a new layer of resin is coated on top, and a new irradiation step takes place. An early example of such a technique is given in Hull, U.S. Pat. No. 5,236,637, at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. A disadvantage of such &#x201c;top down&#x201d; techniques is the need to submerge the growing object in a (potentially deep) pool of liquid resin and reconstitute a precise overlayer of liquid resin.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">If new layers are formed at the bottom of the growing object, then after each irradiation step the object under construction must be separated from the bottom plate in the fabrication well. An early example of such a technique is given in Hull, U.S. Pat. No. 5,236,637, at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. While such &#x201c;bottom up&#x201d; techniques hold the potential to eliminate the need for a deep well in which the object is submerged by instead lifting the object out of a relatively shallow well or pool, a problem with such &#x201c;bottom up&#x201d; fabrication techniques, as commercially implemented, is that extreme care must be taken, and additional mechanical elements employed, when separating the solidified layer from the bottom plate due to physical and chemical interactions therebetween. For example, in U.S. Pat. No. 7,438,846, an elastic separation layer is used to achieve &#x201c;non-destructive&#x201d; separation of solidified material at the bottom construction plane. Other approaches, such as the B9Creator&#x2122; 3-dimensional printer marketed by B9Creations of Deadwood, S. Dak., USA, employ a sliding build plate. See, e.g., M.

Well-known functions or constructions may not be described in detail for brevity and/or clarity.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0089">It will be understood that when an element is referred to as being &#x201c;on,&#x201d; &#x201c;attached&#x201d; to, &#x201c;connected&#x201d; to, &#x201c;coupled&#x201d; with, &#x201c;contacting,&#x201d; etc., another element, it can be directly on, attached to, connected to, coupled with and/or contacting the other element or intervening elements can also be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being, for example, &#x201c;directly on,&#x201d; &#x201c;directly attached&#x201d; to, &#x201c;directly connected&#x201d; to, &#x201c;directly coupled&#x201d; with or &#x201c;directly contacting&#x201d; another element, there are no intervening elements present.

It will be understood that the spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example, if the device in the figures is inverted, elements described as &#x201c;under&#x201d; or &#x201c;beneath&#x201d; other elements or features would then be oriented &#x201c;over&#x201d; the other elements or features. Thus the exemplary term &#x201c;under&#x201d; can encompass both an orientation of over and under. The device may otherwise be oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein interpreted accordingly. Similarly, the terms &#x201c;upwardly,&#x201d; &#x201c;downwardly,&#x201d; &#x201c;vertical,&#x201d; &#x201c;horizontal&#x201d; and the like are used herein for the purpose of explanation only, unless specifically indicated otherwise.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0091">It will be understood that, although the terms first, second, etc., may be used herein to describe various elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections, these elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections should not be limited by these terms. Rather, these terms are only used to distinguish one element, component, region, layer and/or section, from another element, component, region, layer and/or section. Thus, a first element, component, region, layer or section discussed herein could be termed a second element, component, region, layer or section without departing from the teachings of the present invention.

By &#x201c;core,&#x201d; it is meant an internal portion of the core-shell rubber. The core may form the center of the core-shell particle, or an internal shell or domain of the core-shell rubber. A shell is a portion of the core-shell rubber that is exterior to the rubbery core. The shell portion (or portions) typically forms the outermost portion of the core-shell rubber particle. The shell material can be grafted onto the core or is cross-linked. The rubbery core may constitute from 50 to 95%, or from 60 to 90%, of the weight of the core-shell rubber particle.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0101">The core of the core-shell rubber may be a polymer or copolymer of a conjugated diene such as butadiene, or a lower alkyl acrylate such as n-butyl-, ethyl-, isobutyl- or 2-ethylhexylacrylate.

In some embodiments suitable resins includes photocurable hydrogels like poly(ethylene glycols) (PEG) and gelatins. PEG hydrogels have been used to deliver a variety of biologicals, including Growth factors; however, a great challenge facing PEG hydrogels crosslinked by chain growth polymerizations is the potential for irreversible protein damage. Conditions to maximize release of the biologicals from photopolymerized PEG diacrylate hydrogels can be enhanced by inclusion of affinity binding peptide sequences in the monomer resin solutions, prior to photopolymerization allowing sustained delivery. Gelatin is a biopolymer frequently used in food, cosmetic, pharmaceutical and photographic industries. It is obtained by thermal denaturation or chemical and physical degradation of collagen. There are three kinds of gelatin, including those found in animals, fish and humans. Gelatin from the skin of cold water fish is considered safe to use in pharmaceutical applications. UV or visible light can be used to crosslink appropriately modified gelatin. Methods for crosslinking gelatin include cure derivatives from dyes such as Rose Bengal.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0110">Photocurable silicone resins. A suitable resin includes photocurable silicones.

In some embodiments, the polymerizable liquid may carry live cells as &#x201c;particles&#x201d; therein. Such polymerizable liquids are generally aqueous, and may be oxygenated, and may be considered as &#x201c;emulsions&#x201d; where the live cells are the discrete phase.

Apparatus.</heading><p id="p-0114" num="0121">A non-limiting embodiment of an apparatus of the invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.

The bottom of the chamber <b>15</b> is constructed of a build plate comprising a rigid or flexible semipermeable member as discussed further below. The top of the object under construction <b>17</b> is attached to a carrier <b>18</b>. The carrier is driven in the vertical direction by linear stage <b>19</b>, although alternate structures can be used as discussed below.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0122">A liquid resin reservoir, tubing, pumps liquid level sensors and/or valves can be included to replenish the pool of liquid resin in the build chamber (not shown for clarity) though in some embodiments a simple gravity feed may be employed. Drives/actuators for the carrier or linear stage, along with associated wiring, can be included in accordance with known techniques (again not shown for clarity). The drives/actuators, radiation source, and in some embodiments pumps and liquid level sensors can all be operatively associated with a suitable controller, again in accordance with known techniques.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0123">Build plates <b>15</b> used to carry out the present invention generally comprise or consist of a (typically rigid or solid, stationary, and/or fixed, although in some embodiments flexible) semipermeable (or gas permeable) member, alone or in combination with one or more additional supporting substrates (e.g., clamps and tensioning members to tension and stabilize an otherwise flexible semipermeable material). The semipermeable member can be made of any suitable material that is optically transparent at the relevant wavelengths (or otherwise transparent to the radiation source, whether or not it is visually transparent as perceived by the human eye&#x2014;i.e., an optically transparent window may in some embodiments be visually opaque), including but not limited to porous or microporous glass, and the rigid gas permeable polymers used for the manufacture of rigid gas permeable contact lenses. See, e.g., Norman G. Gaylord, U.S. Pat. No. RE31,406; see also U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,862,176; 7,344,731; 7,097,302; 5,349,394; 5,310,571; 5,162,469; 5,141,665; 5,070,170; 4,923,906; and 4,845,089. In some embodiments such materials are characterized as glassy and/or amorphous polymers and/or substantially crosslinked that they are essentially non-swellable. Preferably the semipermeable member is formed of a material that does not swell when contacted to the liquid resin or material to be polymerized (i.e., is &#x201c;non-swellable&#x201d;). Suitable materials for the semipermeable member include amorphous fluoropolymers, such as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,308,685 and 5,051,115. For example, such fluoropolymers are particularly useful over silicones that would potentially swell when used in conjunction with organic liquid resin inks to be polymerized. For some liquid resin inks, such as more aqueous-based monomeric systems and/or some polymeric resin ink systems that have low swelling tendencies, silicone based window materials maybe suitable. The solubility or permeability of organic liquid resin inks can be dramatically decreased by a number of known parameters including increasing the crosslink density of the window material or increasing the molecular weight of the liquid resin ink. In some embodiments the build plate may be formed from a thin film or sheet of material which is flexible when separated from the apparatus of the invention, but which is clamped and tensioned when installed in the apparatus (e.g., with a tensioning ring) so that it is tensioned and stabilized in the apparatus. Particular materials include TEFLON AF&#xae; fluoropolymers, commercially available from DuPont. Additional materials include perfluoropolyether polymers such as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 8,268,446; 8,263,129; 8,158,728; and 7,435,495.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0124">It will be appreciated that essentially all solid materials, and most of those described above, have some inherent &#x201c;flex&#x201d; even though they may be considered &#x201c;rigid,&#x201d; depending on factors such as the shape and thickness thereof and environmental factors such as the pressure and temperature to which they are subjected. In addition, the terms &#x201c;stationary&#x201d; or &#x201c;fixed&#x201d; with respect to the build plate is intended to mean that no mechanical interruption of the process occurs, or no mechanism or structure for mechanical interruption of the process (as in a layer-by-layer method or apparatus) is provided, even if a mechanism for incremental adjustment of the build plate (for example, adjustment that does not lead to or cause collapse of the gradient of polymerization zone) is provided).</p><p id="p-0118" num="0125">The semipermeable member typically comprises a top surface portion, a bottom surface portion, and an edge surface portion. The build surface is on the top surface portion; and the feed surface may be on one, two, or all three of the top surface portion, the bottom surface portion, and/or the edge surface portion. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> the feed surface is on the bottom surface portion, but alternate configurations where the feed surface is provided on an edge, and/or on the top surface portion (close to but separate or spaced away from the build surface) can be implemented with routine skill.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0126">The semipermeable member has, in some embodiments, a thickness of from 0.01, 0.1 or 1 millimeters to 10 or 100 millimeters, or more (depending upon the size of the item being fabricated, whether or not it is laminated to or in contact with an additional supporting plate such as glass, etc., as discussed further below.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0127">The permeability of the semipermeable member to the polymerization inhibitor will depend upon conditions such as the pressure of the atmosphere and/or inhibitor, the choice of inhibitor, the rate or speed of fabrication, etc. In general, when the inhibitor is oxygen, the permeability of the semipermeable member to oxygen may be from 10 or 20 Barrers, up to 1000 or 2000 Barrers, or more. For example, a semipermeable member with a permeability of 10 Barrers used with a pure oxygen, or highly enriched oxygen, atmosphere under a pressure of 150 PSI may perform substantially the same as a semipermeable member with a permeability of 500 Barrers when the oxygen is supplied from the ambient atmosphere under atmospheric conditions.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0128">Thus, the semipermeable member may comprise a flexible polymer film (having any suitable thickness, e.g., from 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1 or 1 millimeters to 1, 5, 10, or 100 millimeters, or more), and the build plate may further comprise a tensioning member (e.g., a peripheral clamp and an operatively associated strain member or stretching member, as in a &#x201c;drum head&#x201d;; a plurality of peripheral clamps, etc., including combinations thereof) connected to the polymer film and to fix and tension, stabilize or rigidify the film (e.g., at least sufficiently so that the film does not stick to the object as the object is advanced and resiliently or elastically rebound therefrom). The film has a top surface and a bottom surface, with the build surface on the top surface and the feed surface preferably on the bottom surface. In other embodiments, the semipermeable member comprises: (i) a polymer film layer (having any suitable thickness, e.g., from 0.001, 0.01, 0.1 or 1 millimeters to 5, 10 or 100 millimeters, or more), having a top surface positioned for contacting the polymerizable liquid and a bottom surface, and (ii) a gas permeable, optically transparent supporting member (having any suitable thickness, e.g., from 0.01, 0.1 or 1 millimeters to 10, 100, or 200 millimeters, or more), contacting the film layer bottom surface. The supporting member has a top surface contacting the film layer bottom surface, and the supporting member has a bottom surface which may serve as the feed surface for the polymerization inhibitor. Any suitable materials that are semipermeable (that is, permeable to the polymerization inhibitor) may be used. For example, the polymer film or polymer film layer may, for example, be a fluoropolymer film, such as an amorphous thermoplastic fluoropolymer like TEFLON AF 1600&#x2122; or TEFLON AF 2400&#x2122; fluoropolymer films, or perfluoropolyether (PFPE), particularly a crosslinked PFPE film, or a crosslinked silicone polymer film. The supporting member comprises a silicone or crosslinked silicone polymer member such as a polydimethylsiloxane polydmiethylxiloxane member, a gas permeable polymer member, or a porous or microporous glass member. Films can be laminated or clamped directly to the rigid supporting member without adhesive (e.g., using PFPE and PDMS materials), or silane coupling agents that react with the upper surface of a PDMS layer can be utilized to adhere to the first polymer film layer. UV-curable, acrylate-functional silicones can also be used as a tie layer between UV-curable PFPEs and rigid PDMS supporting layers.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0129">When configured for placement in the apparatus, the carrier defines a &#x201c;build region&#x201d; on the build surface, within the total area of the build surface. Because lateral &#x201c;throw&#x201d; (e.g., in the X and/or Y directions) is not required in the present invention to break adhesion between successive layers, as in the Joyce and Chen devices noted previously, the area of the build region within the build surface may be maximized (or conversely, the area of the build surface not devoted to the build region may be minimized). Hence in some embodiments, the total surface area of the build region can occupy at least fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty, or ninety percent of the total surface area of the build surface.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0130">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the various components are mounted on a support or frame assembly <b>20</b>. While the particular design of the support or frame assembly is not critical and can assume numerous configurations, in the illustrated embodiment it is comprised of a base <b>21</b> to which the radiation source <b>11</b> is securely or rigidly attached, a vertical member <b>22</b> to which the linear stage is operatively associated, and a horizontal table <b>23</b> to which wall <b>14</b> is removably or securely attached (or on which the wall is placed), and with the build plate fixed, either permanently or removably, to form the build chamber as described above.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0131">As noted above, the build plate can consist of a single unitary and integral piece of a semipermeable member, or can comprise additional materials. For example, a porous or microporous glass can be laminated or fixed to a semipermeable material. Or, a semipermeable member as an upper portion can be fixed to a transparent lower member having purging channels formed therein for feeding gas carrying the polymerization inhibitor to the semipermeable member (through which it passes to the build surface to facilitate the formation of a release layer of unpolymerized liquid material, as noted above and below). Such purge channels may extend fully or partially through the base plate: For example, the purge channels may extend partially into the base plate, but then end in the region directly underlying the build surface to avoid introduction of distortion. Specific geometries will depend upon whether the feed surface for the inhibitor into the semipermeable member is located on the same side or opposite side as the build surface, on an edge portion thereof, or a combination of several thereof.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0132">Any suitable radiation source (or combination of sources) can be used, depending upon the particular resin employed, including electron beam and ionizing radiation sources. In a preferred embodiment the radiation source is an actinic radiation source, such as one or more light sources, and in particular one or more ultraviolet light sources. Any suitable light source can be used, such as incandescent lights, fluorescent lights, phosphorescent or luminescent lights, a laser, light-emitting diode, etc., including arrays thereof. The light source preferably includes a pattern-forming element operatively associated with a controller, as noted above. In some embodiments, the light source or pattern forming element comprises a digital (or deformable) micromirror device (DMD) with digital light processing (DLP), a spatial modulator (SLM), or a microelectromechanical system (MEMS) mirror array, a liquid crystal display (LCD) panel, a mask (aka a reticle), a silhouette, or a combination thereof. See, U.S. Pat. No. 7,902,526. Preferably the light source comprises a spatial light modulation array such as a liquid crystal light valve array or micromirror array or DMD (e.g., with an operatively associated digital light processor, typically in turn under the control of a suitable controller), configured to carry out exposure or irradiation of the polymerizable liquid without a mask, e.g., by maskless photolithography. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,312,134; 6,248,509; 6,238,852; and 5,691,541.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0133">In some embodiments, as discussed further below, there may be movement in the X and/or Y directions concurrently with movement in the Z direction, with the movement in the X and/or Y direction hence occurring during polymerization of the polymerizable liquid (this is in contrast to the movement described in Y. Chen et al., or M. Joyce, supra, which is movement between prior and subsequent polymerization steps for the purpose of replenishing polymerizable liquid). In the present invention such movement may be carried out for purposes such as reducing &#x201c;burn in&#x201d; or fouling in a particular zone of the build surface.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0134">Because an advantage of some embodiments of the present invention is that the size of the build surface on the semipermeable member (i.e., the build plate or window) may be reduced due to the absence of a requirement for extensive lateral &#x201c;throw&#x201d; as in the Joyce or Chen devices noted above, in the methods, systems and apparatus of the present invention lateral movement (including movement in the X and/or Y direction or combination thereof) of the carrier and object (if such lateral movement is present) is preferably not more than, or less than, 80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, or even 10 percent of the width (in the direction of that lateral movement) of the build region.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0135">While in some embodiments the carrier is mounted on an elevator to advance up and away from a stationary build plate, on other embodiments the converse arrangement may be used: That is, the carrier may be fixed and the build plate lowered to thereby advance the carrier away therefrom. Numerous different mechanical configurations will be apparent to those skilled in the art to achieve the same result.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0136">Depending on the choice of material from which the carrier is fabricated, and the choice of polymer or resin from which the article is made, adhesion of the article to the carrier may sometimes be insufficient to retain the article on the carrier through to completion of the finished article or &#x201c;build.&#x201d; For example, an aluminum carrier may have lower adhesion than a poly(vinyl chloride) (or &#x201c;PVC&#x201d;) carrier. Hence one solution is to employ a carrier comprising a PVC on the surface to which the article being fabricated is polymerized. If this promotes too great an adhesion to conveniently separate the finished part from the carrier, then any of a variety of techniques can be used to further secure the article to a less adhesive carrier, including but not limited to the application of adhesive tape such as &#x201c;Greener Masking Tape for Basic Painting #2025 High adhesion&#x201d; to further secure the article to the carrier during fabrication.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">III.

In one embodiment, the controller is a general purpose computer that runs software, operatively associated with monitors, drives, pumps, and other components through suitable interface hardware and/or software. Suitable software for the control of a three-dimensional printing or fabrication method and apparatus as described herein includes, but is not limited to, the ReplicatorG open source 3d printing program, 3DPrint&#x2122; controller software from 3D systems, Slic3r, Skeinforge, KISSlicer, Repetier-Host, PrintRun, Cura, etc., including combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0139">Process parameters to directly or indirectly monitor, continuously or intermittently, during the process (e.g., during one, some or all of the filling, irradiating and advancing steps) include, but are not limited to, irradiation intensity, temperature of carrier, polymerizable liquid in the build zone, temperature of growing product, temperature of build plate, pressure, speed of advance, pressure, force (e.g., exerted on the build plate through the carrier and product being fabricated), strain (e.g., exerted on the carrier by the growing product being fabricated), thickness of release layer, etc.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0140">Known parameters that may be used in feedback and/or feed-forward control systems include, but are not limited to, expected consumption of polymerizable liquid (e.g., from the known geometry or volume of the article being fabricated), degradation temperature of the polymer being formed from the polymerizable liquid, etc.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0141">Process conditions to directly or indirectly control, continuously or step-wise, in response to a monitored parameter, and/or known parameters (e.g., during any or all of the process steps noted above), include, but are not limited to, rate of supply of polymerizable liquid, temperature, pressure, rate or speed of advance of carrier, intensity of irradiation, duration of irradiation (e.g. for each &#x201c;slice&#x201d;), etc.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0142">For example, the temperature of the polymerizable liquid in the build zone, or the temperature of the build plate, can be monitored, directly or indirectly with an appropriate thermocouple, non-contact temperature sensor (e.g., an infrared temperature sensor), or other suitable temperature sensor, to determine whether the temperature exceeds the degradation temperature of the polymerized product. If so, a process parameter may be adjusted through a controller to reduce the temperature in the build zone and/or of the build plate. Suitable process parameters for such adjustment may include: decreasing temperature with a cooler, decreasing the rate of advance of the carrier, decreasing intensity of the irradiation, decreasing duration of radiation exposure, etc.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0143">In addition, the intensity of the irradiation source (e.g., an ultraviolet light source such as a mercury lamp) may be monitored with a photodetector to detect a decrease of intensity from the irradiation source (e.g., through routine degradation thereof during use). If detected, a process parameter may be adjusted through a controller to accommodate the loss of intensity. Suitable process parameters for such adjustment may include: increasing temperature with a heater, decreasing the rate of advance of the carrier, increasing power to the light source, etc.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0144">As another example, control of temperature and/or pressure to enhance fabrication time may be achieved with heaters and coolers (individually, or in combination with one another and separately responsive to a controller), and/or with a pressure supply (e.g., pump, pressure vessel, valves and combinations thereof) and/or a pressure release mechanism such as a controllable valve (individually, or in combination with one another and separately responsive to a controller).</p><p id="p-0138" num="0145">In some embodiments the controller is configured to maintain the gradient of polymerization zone described herein (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) throughout the fabrication of some or all of the final product.

Indeed, the rate of steps can be varied over time depending upon factors such as the density and/or complexity of the region under fabrication.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0165">Also, since mechanical release from a window or from a release layer generally requires that the carrier be advanced a greater distance from the build plate than desired for the next irradiation step, which enables the window to be recoated, and then return of the carrier back closer to the build plate (e.g., a &#x201c;two steps forward one step back&#x201d; operation), the present invention in some embodiments permits elimination of this &#x201c;back-up&#x201d; step and allows the carrier to be advanced unidirectionally, or in a single direction, without intervening movement of the window for re-coating, or &#x201c;snapping&#x201d; of a pre-formed elastic release-layer. However, in other embodiments of the invention, reciprocation is utilized not for the purpose of obtaining release, but for the purpose of more rapidly filling or pumping polymerizable liquid into the build region.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0166">While the dead zone and the gradient of polymerization zone do not have a strict boundary therebetween (in those locations where the two meet), the thickness of the gradient of polymerization zone is in some embodiments at least as great as the thickness of the dead zone. Thus, in some embodiments, the dead zone has a thickness of from 0.01, 0.1, 1, 2, or 10 microns up to 100, 200 or 400 microns, or more, and/or the gradient of polymerization zone and the dead zone together have a thickness of from 1 or 2 microns up to 400, 600, or 1000 microns, or more. Thus the gradient of polymerization zone may be thick or thin depending on the particular process conditions at that time. Where the gradient of polymerization zone is thin, it may also be described as an active surface on the bottom of the growing three-dimensional object, with which monomers can react and continue to form growing polymer chains therewith. In some embodiments, the gradient of polymerization zone, or active surface, is maintained (while polymerizing steps continue) for a time of at least 5, 10, 15, 20 or 30 seconds, up to 5, 10, 15 or 20 minutes or more, or until completion of the three-dimensional product.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0167">The method may further comprise the step of disrupting the gradient of polymerization zone for a time sufficient to form a cleavage line in the three-dimensional object (e.g., at a predetermined desired location for intentional cleavage, or at a location in the object where prevention of cleavage or reduction of cleavage is non-critical), and then reinstating the gradient of polymerization zone (e.g. by pausing, and resuming, the advancing step, increasing, then decreasing, the intensity of irradiation, and combinations thereof).</p><p id="p-0161" num="0168">In some embodiments, the advancing step is carried out sequentially in uniform increments (e.g., of from 0.1 or 1 microns, up to 10 or 100 microns, or more) for each step or increment. In some embodiments, the advancing step is carried out sequentially in variable increments (e.g., each increment ranging from 0.1 or 1 microns, up to 10 or 100 microns, or more) for each step or increment. The size of the increment, along with the rate of advancing, will depend in part upon factors such as temperature, pressure, structure of the article being produced (e.g., size, density, complexity, configuration, etc.)</p><p id="p-0162" num="0169">In other embodiments of the invention, the advancing step is carried out continuously, at a uniform or variable rate.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0170">In some embodiments, the rate of advance (whether carried out sequentially or continuously) is from about 0.1 1, or 10 microns per second, up to about to 100, 1,000, or 10,000 microns per second, again depending again depending on factors such as temperature, pressure, structure of the article being produced, intensity of radiation, etc</p><p id="p-0164" num="0171">As described further below, in some embodiments the filling step is carried out by forcing the polymerizable liquid into the build region under pressure. In such a case, the advancing step or steps may be carried out at a rate or cumulative or average rate of at least 0.1, 1, 10, 50, 100, 500 or 1000 microns per second, or more. In general, the pressure may be whatever is sufficient to increase the rate of the advancing step(s) at least 2, 4, 6, 8 or 10 times as compared to the maximum rate of repetition of the advancing steps in the absence of the pressure. Where the pressure is provided by enclosing an apparatus such as described above in a pressure vessel and carrying the process out in a pressurized atmosphere (e.g., of air, air enriched with oxygen, a blend of gasses, pure oxygen, etc.) a pressure of 10, 20, 30 or 40 pounds per square inch (PSI) up to, 200, 300, 400 or 500 PSI or more, may be used. For fabrication of large irregular objects higher pressures may be less preferred as compared to slower fabrication times due to the cost of a large high pressure vessel. In such an embodiment, both the feed surface and the polymerizable liquid can be are in fluid contact with the same compressed gas (e.g., one comprising from 20 to 95 percent by volume of oxygen, the oxygen serving as the polymerization inhibitor.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0172">On the other hand, when smaller items are fabricated, or a rod or fiber is fabricated that can be removed or exited from the pressure vessel as it is produced through a port or orifice therein, then the size of the pressure vessel can be kept smaller relative to the size of the product being fabricated and higher pressures can (if desired) be more readily utilized.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0173">As noted above, the irradiating step is in some embodiments carried out with patterned irradiation. The patterned irradiation may be a fixed pattern or may be a variable pattern created by a pattern generator (e.g., a DLP) as discussed above, depending upon the particular item being fabricated.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0174">When the patterned irradiation is a variable pattern rather than a pattern that is held constant over time, then each irradiating step may be any suitable time or duration depending on factors such as the intensity of the irradiation, the presence or absence of dyes in the polymerizable material, the rate of growth, etc. Thus in some embodiments each irradiating step can be from 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1 or 10 microseconds, up to 1, 10, or 100 minutes, or more, in duration. The interval between each irradiating step is in some embodiments preferably as brief as possible, e.g., from 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, or 1 microseconds up to 0.1, 1, or 10 seconds. In example embodiments, the pattern may vary hundreds, thousands or millions of times to impart shape changes on the three-dimensional object being formed. In addition, in example embodiments, the pattern generator may have high resolution with millions of pixel elements that can be varied to change the shape that is imparted. For example, the pattern generator may be a DLP with more than 1,000 or 2,000 or 3,000 or more rows and/or more than 1,000 or 2,000 or 3,000 or more columns of micromirrors, or pixels in a liquid crystal display panel, that can be used to vary the shape. In example embodiments, the three-dimensional object may be formed through the gradient of polymerization allowing the shape changes to be imparted while continuously printing. In example embodiments, this allows complex three-dimensional objects to be formed at high speed with a substantially continuous surface without cleavage lines or seams. In some examples, thousands or millions of shape variations may be imparted on the three-dimensional object being formed without cleavage lines or seams across a length of the object being formed of more than 1 mm, 1 cm, 10 cm or more or across the entire length of the formed object. In example embodiments, the object may be continuously formed through the gradient of polymerization at a rate of more than 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000 or more microns per second.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0175">In some embodiments the build surface is flat; in other the build surface is irregular such as convexly or concavely curved, or has walls or trenches formed therein. In either case the build surface may be smooth or textured.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0176">Curved and/or irregular build plates or build surfaces can be used in fiber or rod formation, to provide different materials to a single object being fabricated (that is, different polymerizable liquids to the same build surface through channels or trenches formed in the build surface, each associated with a separate liquid supply, etc.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0177">Carrier Feed Channels for Polymerizable liquid. While polymerizable liquid may be provided directly to the build plate from a liquid conduit and reservoir system, in some embodiments the carrier include one or more feed channels therein. The carrier feed channels are in fluid communication with the polymerizable liquid supply, for example a reservoir and associated pump. Different carrier feed channels may be in fluid communication with the same supply and operate simultaneously with one another, or different carrier feed channels may be separately controllable from one another (for example, through the provision of a pump and/or valve for each). Separately controllable feed channels may be in fluid communication with a reservoir containing the same polymerizable liquid, or may be in fluid communication with a reservoir containing different polymerizable liquids. Through the use of valve assemblies, different polymerizable liquids may in some embodiments be alternately fed through the same feed channel, if desired.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">V. Reciprocal Feed of Polymerizable Liquid.</heading><p id="p-0171" num="0178">In an embodiment of the present invention, the carrier is vertically reciprocated with respect to the build surface to enhance or speed the refilling of the build region with the polymerizable liquid.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0179">In some embodiments, the vertically reciprocating step, which comprises an upstroke and a downstroke, is carried out with the distance of travel of the upstroke being greater than the distance of travel of the downstroke, to thereby concurrently carry out the advancing step (that is, driving the carrier away from the build plate in the Z dimension) in part or in whole.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0180">In some embodiments, the speed of the upstroke gradually accelerates (that is, there is provided a gradual start and/or gradual acceleration of the upstroke, over a period of at least 20, 30, 40, or 50 percent of the total time of the upstroke, until the conclusion of the upstroke, or the change of direction which represents the beginning of the downstroke.

Stated differently, the downstroke concludes, or ends, gently or gradually.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0182">While in some embodiments there is an abrupt end, or abrupt deceleration, of the upstroke, and an abrupt beginning or deceleration of the downstroke (e.g., a rapid change in vector or direction of travel from upstroke to downstroke), it will be appreciated that gradual transitions may be introduced here as well (e.g., through introduction of a &#x201c;plateau&#x201d; or pause in travel between the upstroke and downstroke). It will also be appreciated that, while the reciprocating step may be a single upstroke and downstroke, the reciprocations may occur in linked groups thereof, of the same or different amplitude and frequency.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0183">In some embodiments, the vertically reciprocating step is carried out over a total time of from 0.01 or 0.1 seconds up to 1 or 10 seconds (e.g., per cycle of an upstroke and a downstroke).</p><p id="p-0177" num="0184">In some embodiments, the upstroke distance of travel is from 0.02 or 0.2 millimeters (or 20 or 200 microns) to 1 or 10 millimeters (or 1000 to 10,000 microns). The distance of travel of the downstroke may be the same as, or less than, the distance of travel of the upstroke, where a lesser distance of travel for the downstroke serves to achieve the advancing of the carrier away from the build surface as the three-dimensional object is gradually formed.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0185">Preferably the vertically reciprocating step, and particularly the upstroke thereof, does not cause the formation of gas bubbles or a gas pocket in the build region, but instead the build region remains filled with the polymerizable liquid throughout the reciprocation steps, and the gradient of polymerization zone or region remains in contact with the &#x201c;dead zone&#x201d; and with the growing object being fabricated throughout the reciprocation steps. As will be appreciated, a purpose of the reciprocation is to speed or enhance the refilling of the build region, particularly where larger build regions are to be refilled with polymerizable liquid, as compared to the speed at which the build region could be refilled without the reciprocation step.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0186">In some embodiments, the advancing step is carried out intermittently at a rate of 1, 2, 5 or 10 individual advances per minute up to 300, 600, or 1000 individual advances per minute, each followed by a pause during which an irradiating step is carried out.

Increased Speed of Fabrication by Increased Light Intensity.</heading><p id="p-0182" num="0189">In general, it has been observed that speed of fabrication can increase with increased light intensity. In some embodiments, the light is concentrated or &#x201c;focused&#x201d; at the build region to increase the speed of fabrication. This may be accomplished using an optical device such as an objective lens.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0190">The speed of fabrication may be generally proportional to the light intensity. For example, the build speed in millimeters per hour may be calculated by multiplying the light intensity in milliWatts per square centimeter and a multiplier. The multiplier may depend on a variety of factors, including those discussed below. A range of multipliers, from low to high, may be employed. On the low end of the range, the multiplier may be about 10, 15, 20 or 30. On the high end of the multiplier range, the multiplier may be about 150, 300, 400 or more.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0191">The relationships described above are, in general, contemplated for light intensities of from 1, 5 or 10 milliWatts per square centimeter, up to 20 or 50 milliWatts per square centimeter.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0192">Certain optical characteristics of the light may be selected to facilitate increased speed of fabrication. By way of example, a band pass filter may be used with a mercury bulb light source to provide 365&#xb1;10 nm light measured at Full Width Half Maximum (FWHM). By way of further example, a band pass filter may be used with an LED light source to provide 375&#xb1;15 nm light measured at FWHM.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0193">As noted above, polymerizable liquids used in such processes are, in general, free radical polymerizable liquids with oxygen as the inhibitor, or acid-catalyzed or cationically polymerizable liquids with a base as the inhibitor. Some specific polymerizable liquids will of course cure more rapidly or efficiently than others and hence be more amenable to higher speeds, though this may be offset at least in part by further increasing light intensity.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0194">At higher light intensities and speeds, the &#x201c;dead zone&#x201d; may become thinner as inhibitor is consumed. If the dead zone is lost then the process will be disrupted. In such case, the supply of inhibitor may be enhanced by any suitable means, including providing an enriched and/or pressurized atmosphere of inhibitor, a more porous semipermeable member, a stronger or more powerful inhibitor (particularly where a base is employed), etc.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0195">In general, lower viscosity polymerizable liquids are more amenable to higher speeds, particularly for fabrication of articles with a large and/or dense cross section (although this can be offset at least in part by increasing light intensity). Polymerizable liquids with viscosities in the range of 50 or 100 centipoise, up to 600, 800 or 1000 centipoise or more (as measured at room temperature and atmospheric pressure with a suitable device such as a HYDRAMOTION REACTAVISC&#x2122; Viscometer (available from Hydramotion Ltd, 1 York Road Business Park, Malton, York YO17 6YA England). In some embodiments, where necessary, the viscosity of the polymerizable liquid can advantageously be reduced by heating the polymerizable liquid, as described above.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0196">In some embodiments, such as fabrication of articles with a large and/or dense cross-section, speed of fabrication can be enhanced by introducing reciprocation to &#x201c;pump&#x201d; the polymerizable liquid, as described above, and/or the use of feeding the polymerizable liquid through the carrier, as also described above, and/or heating and/or pressurizing the polymerizable liquid, as also described above.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="2">VII.

Numerous embodiments thereof may be carried out. In the following, note that, where particular acrylates such as methacrylates are described, other acrylates may also be used.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0201">Part A chemistry. As noted above, in some embodiments of the present invention, a resin will have a first component, termed &#x201c;Part A.&#x201d; Part A comprises or consists of a mix of monomers and/or prepolymers that can be polymerized by exposure to actinic radiation or light. This resin can have a functionality of 2 or higher (though a resin with a functionality of 1 can also be used when the polymer does not dissolve in its monomer). A purpose of Part A is to &#x201c;lock&#x201d; the shape of the object being formed or create a scaffold for the one or more additional components (e.g., Part B). Importantly, Part A is present at or above the minimum quantity needed to maintain the shape of the object being formed after the initial solidification. In some embodiments, this amount corresponds to less than ten, twenty, or thirty percent by weight of the total resin (polymerizable liquid) composition.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0202">In some embodiments, Part A can react to form a cross-linked polymer network or a solid homopolymer.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0203">Examples of suitable reactive end groups suitable for Part A constituents, monomers, or prepolymers include, but are not limited to: acrylates, methacrylates, &#x3b1;-olefins, N-vinyls, acrylamides, methacrylamides, styrenics, epoxides, thiols, 1,3-dienes, vinyl halides, acrylonitriles, vinyl esters, maleimides, and vinyl ethers.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0204">An aspect of the solidification of Part A is that it provides a scaffold in which a second reactive resin component, termed &#x201c;Part B,&#x201d; can solidify during a second step (which may occur concurrently with or following the solidification of Part A). This secondary reaction preferably occurs without significantly distorting the original shape defined during the solidification of Part A.

In some embodiments, an organic peroxide may be included in the polymerizable liquid or resin, for example to facilitate the reaction of potentially unreacted double bonds during heat and/or microwave irradiation curing. Such organic peroxides may be included in the resin or polymerizable liquid in any suitable amount, such as from 0.001 or 0.01 or 0.1 percent by weight, up to 1, 2, or 3 percent by weight.

A particularly useful embodiment for implementing the invention is for the formation of elastomers. Tough, high-elongation elastomers are difficult to achieve using only liquid UV-curable precursors. However, there exist many thermally cured materials (polyurethanes, silicones, natural rubber) that result in tough, high-elongation elastomers after curing. These thermally curable elastomers on their own are generally incompatible with most 3D printing techniques.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0211">In embodiments of the current invention, small amounts (e.g., less than 20 percent by weight) of a low-viscosity UV curable material (Part A) are blended with thermally-curable precursors to form (preferably tough) elastomers (e.g. polyurethanes, polyureas, or copolymers thereof (e.g., poly(urethane-urea)), and silicones) (Part B). The UV curable component is used to solidify an object into the desired shape using 3D printing as described herein and a scaffold for the elastomer precursors in the polymerizable liquid. The object can then be heated after printing, thereby activating the second component, resulting in an object comprising the elastomer.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0212">Adhesion of formed objects. In some embodiments, it may be useful to define the shapes of multiple objects using the solidification of Part A, align those objects in a particular configuration, such that there is a hermetic seal between the objects, then activate the secondary solidification of Part B. In this manner, strong adhesion between parts can be achieved during production. A particularly useful example may be in the formation and adhesion of sneaker components.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0213">Fusion of particles as Part B. In some embodiments, &#x201c;Part B&#x201d; may simply consist of small particles of a pre-formed polymer. After the solidification of Part A, the object may be heated above the glass transition temperature of Part B in order to fuse the entrapped polymeric particles.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0214">Evaporation of solvent as Part B. In some embodiments, &#x201c;Part B&#x201d; may consist of a pre-formed polymer dissolved in a solvent. After the solidification of Part A into the desired object, the object is subjected to a process (e.g. heat+vacuum) that allows for evaporation of the solvent for Part B, thereby solidifying Part B.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0215">Thermally cleavable end groups. In some embodiments, the reactive chemistries in Part A can be thermally cleaved to generate a new reactive species after the solidification of Part A. The newly formed reactive species can further react with Part B in a secondary solidification. An exemplary system is described by Velankar, Pezos and Cooper, Journal of Applied Polymer Science, 62, 1361-1376 (1996). Here, after UV-curing, the acrylate/methacrylate groups in the formed object are thermally cleaved to generated diisocyanate prepolymers that further react with blended chain-extender to give high molecular weight polyurethanes/polyureas within the original cured material or scaffold. Such systems are, in general, dual-hardening systems that employ blocked or reactive blocked prepolymers, as discussed in greater detail below. It may be noted that later work indicates that the thermal cleavage above is actually a displacement reaction of the chain extender (usually a diamine) with the hindered urea, giving the final polyurethanes/polyureas without generating isocyanate intermediates.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0216">Methods of mixing components. In some embodiments, the components may be mixed in a continuous manner prior to being introduced to the printer build plate. This may be done using multi-barrel syringes and mixing nozzles. For example, Part A may comprise or consist of a UV-curable di(meth)acrylate resin, Part B may comprise or consist of a diisocyanate prepolymer and a polyol mixture. The polyol can be blended together in one barrel with Part A and remain unreacted. A second syringe barrel would contain the diisocyanate of Part B. In this manner, the material can be stored without worry of &#x201c;Part B&#x201d; solidifying prematurely. Additionally, when the resin is introduced to the printer in this fashion, a constant time is defined between mixing of all components and solidification of Part A.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0217">Other additive manufacturing techniques. It will be clear to those skilled in the art that the materials described in the current invention will be useful in other additive manufacturing techniques including fused deposition modeling (FDM), solid laser sintering (SLS), and Ink-jet methods. For example, a melt-processed acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene resin may be formulated with a second UV-curable component that can be activated after the object is formed by FDM. New mechanical properties could be achieved in this manner. In another alternative, melt-processed unvulcanized rubber is mixed with a vulcanizing agent such as sulfur or peroxide, and the shape set through FDM, then followed by a continuation of vulcanization.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="2">IX.

The reactive diluent (10-50 wt %) is an acrylate or methacrylate that helps to reduce the viscosity of ABPU and will be copolymerized with the ABPU under UV irradiation. The photoinitiator (generally about 1 wt %) can be one of those commonly used UV initiators, examples of which include but are not limited to such as acetophenones (diethoxyacetophenone for example), phosphine oxides diphenyl(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)phosphine oxide, phenylbis(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)phosphine oxide (PPO), Irgacure 369, etc.</p><p id="p-0248" num="0245">After UV curing to form a intermediate shaped product having blocked polyurethane oligomers as a scaffold, and carrying the chain extender, the ABPU resin is subjected to a thermal cure, during which a high molecular weight polyurethane/polyurea is formed by a spontaneous reaction between the polyurethane/polyurea oligomers and the chain extender(s). The polyurethane/polyurea oligomer can react with proper chain extenders through substitution of TBAEMA, N-vinylformamide (NVF) or the like by proper chain extenders, either by deblocking or displacement. The thermal cure time needed can vary depending on the temperature, size, shape, and density of the product, but is typically between 1 to 6 hours depending on the specific ABPU systems, chain extenders and temperature.</p><p id="p-0249" num="0246">One advantageous aspect of the foregoing is using a tertiary amine-containing (meth)acrylate (e.g., t-butylaminoethyl methacrylate, TBAEMA) to terminate synthesized polyurethane/polyurea oligomers with isocyanate at both ends. Using acrylate or methacrylate containing hydroxyl groups to terminate polyurethane/polyurea oligomers with isocyanate ends is used in UV curing resins in the coating field. The formed urethane bonds between the isocyanate and hydroxyl groups are generally stable even at high temperatures. In embodiments of the present invention, the urea bond formed between the tertiary amine of TBAEMA and isocyanate of the oligomer becomes labile when heated to suitable temperature (for example, about 100&#xb0; C.), regenerating the isocyanate groups that will react with the chain extender(s) during thermal-cure to form high molecular weight polyurethane (PU). While it is possible to synthesize other (meth)acrylate containing isocyanate blocking functionality as generally used (such as N-vinylformamide, &#x3b5;-caprolactam, 1,2,3-triazole, methyl ethyl ketoxime, diethyl malonate, etc.), the illustrative embodiment uses TBAEMA that is commercially available. The used chain extenders can be diols, diamines, triols, triamines or their combinations or others. Ethylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol, methylene dicyclohexylamine (H12MDA; or PACM as the commercial name from Air Products), hydroquinone bis(2-Hydroxyethyl) Ether (HQEE), 4,4&#x2032;-Methylenebis(3-Chloro-2,6-Diethylaniline) (MCDEA), 4,4&#x2032;-methylene-bis-(2,6 diethylaniline)(MDEA), 4,4&#x2032;-Methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) (MOCA) are the preferred chain extenders.</p><p id="p-0250" num="0247">To produce an ABPU, TBAEMA may be used to terminate the isocyanate end groups of the prepolymer, which is derived from isocyanate tipped polyols. The polyols (preferably with hydroxyl functionality of 2) used can be polyethers [especially polytetramethylene oxide (PTMO), polypropylene glycol (PPG)], polyesters [polycaprolactone (PCL), polycarbonate, etc.], polybutadiene and block copolymers such as PCL and PTMO block copolymer (Capa 7201A of Perstop, Inc.). The molecular weight of these polyols can be 500 to 6000 Da, and 500-2000 Da are preferred. In the presence of a catalyst (e.g., stannous octoate with 0.1-0.3 wt % to the weight of polyol; other tin catalysts or amine catalysts), diisocyanate (e.g., toluene diisocyanate (TDI), methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI), hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI), isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI), hydrogenated MDI (HMDI), para-phenyl diisocyanate (PPDI) etc.) is added to the polyol (or the reverse order; preferably the polyol being added to the isocyanate) with certain molar ratio (larger than 1:1; preferably, no less than 2:1 and 2:1 is mostly preferred) to make a prepolymer with residual isocyanate groups (50-100&#xb0; C.). TBAEMA is then added to the reaction [Note: moles (TBAEMA) *2+moles (OH)=moles (isocyanate)] to cap the remaining isocyanate groups, resulting in ABPU (under 40-70&#xb0; C.). Radical inhibitors such as hydroquinone (100-500 ppm) can be used to inhibit polymerization of (meth)acrylate during the reaction.</p><p id="p-0251" num="0248">In general, a three-dimensional product of the foregoing methods comprises (i) a linear thermoplastic polyurethane, polyurea, or copolymer thereof (e.g., poly(urethane-urea)), (ii) a cross-linked thermoset polyurethane, polyurea, or copolymer thereof (e.g., poly(urethane-urea)), or (iii) combinations thereof (optionally blended with de-blocked blocking group which is copolymerized with the reactive diluents(s), for example as an interpenetrating polymer network, a semi-interpenetrating polymer network, or as a sequential interpenetrating polymer network)).

This area has been noted by Sperling at Lehigh University and K. C. Frisch at the University of Detroit, and others.</p><p id="p-0303" num="0283">In non-limiting examples, the polymerizable liquid and method steps are selected so that the three-dimensional object comprises the following:</p><p id="p-0304" num="0284">Sol-gel compositions. This may be carried out with an amine (ammonia) permeable window or semipermeable member. In the system discussed here, tetraethyl orthosiliciate (TEOS), epoxy (diglycidyl ether of Bisphenol A), and 4-amino propyl triethoxysilane are be added to a free radical crosslinker and in the process the free radical crosslinker polymerizes and contain the noted reactants which are then reacted in another step or stage. Reaction requires the presence of water and acid. Photoacid generators (PAGs) could optionally be added to the mixture described above to promote the reaction of the silica based network. Note that if only TEOS is included one will end up with a silica (glass) network. One could then increase the temperature to remove the organic phase and be left with a silica structure that would be difficult to prepare by more conventional methods. Many variations (different polymeric structures) can be prepared by this process in addition to epoxies including urethanes, functionalized polyols, silicone rubber etc.)</p><p id="p-0305" num="0285">Hydrophobic-hydrophilic IPNs. Prior IPN research contained a number of examples for hydrophobic-hydrophilic networks for improved blood compatibility as well as tissue compatibility for biomedical parts. Poly(hydroxyethyl (meth)acrylate) is a typical example of a hydrophilic component. Another option is to added poly(ethylene oxide) polyols or polyamines with a diisocyanate to produce polyurethane, polyurea, or copolymer thereof (e.g., poly(urethane-urea)), incorporated in the reactive system.</p><p id="p-0306" num="0286">Phenolic resins (resoles). Precursors to phenolic resins involve either phenolic resoles (formaldehyde terminal liquid oligomers) or phenolic novolacs (phenol terminal solid oligomers crosslinkable with hexamethyltetraamine). For the present process phenolic resoles can be considered. The viscosity thereof may be high but dilution with alcohols (methanol or ethanol) may be employed. Combination of the phenolic resole with the crosslinkable monomer can then provide a product formed from an IPN. Reaction of the phenolic resole to a phenolic resin can occur above 100&#xb0; in a short time range. One variation of this chemistry would be to carbonize the resultant structure to carbon or graphite. Carbon or graphite foam is typically produced from phenolic foam and used for thermal insulation at high temperatures.</p><p id="p-0307" num="0287">Polyimides. Polyimides based on dianhydrides and diamines are amenable to the present process. In this case the polyimide monomers incorporated into the reactive crosslinkable monomer are reacted to yield an IPN structure. Most of the dianyhdrides employed for polyimides may be crystalline at room temperature but modest amounts of a volatile solvent can allow a liquid phase. Reaction at modest temperatures (e.g., in the range of about 100&#xb0; C.) is possible to permit polyimide formation after the network is polymerized.</p><p id="p-0308" num="0288">Conductive polymers. The incorporation of aniline and ammonium persulfate into the polymerizable liquid is used to produce a conductive part. After the reactive system is polymerized and a post treatment with acid (such as HCl vapor), polymerization to polyaniline can then commence.</p><p id="p-0309" num="0289">Natural product based IPNs. Numerous of natural product based IPNs are known based on triglyceride oils such as castor oil. These can be incorporated into the polymerizable liquid along with a diisocyanate. Upon completion of the part the triglycerides can then be reacted with the diisocyanate to form a crosslinked polyurethane. Glycerol can of course also be used.</p><p id="p-0310" num="0290">Sequential IPNs. In this case, the molded crosslinked network are swollen with a monomer and free radical catalyst (peroxide) and optionally crosslinker followed by polymerization. The crosslinked triacylate system should imbide large amounts of styrene, acrylate and/or methacrylate monomers allowing a sequential IPN to be produced.</p><p id="p-0311" num="0291">Polyolefin polymerization. Polyolefin catalysts (e.g. metallocenes) can be added to the crosslinkable reactive system. Upon exposure of the part to pressurized ethylene (or propylene) or a combination (to produce EPR rubber) and temperature in the range of 100&#xb0; C.) the part can then contain a moderate to substantial amount of the polyolefin. Ethylene, propylene and alpha olefin monomers should easily diffuse into the part to react with the catalyst at this temperature and as polymerization proceeds more olefin will diffuse to the catalyst site. A large number of parts can be post-polymerized at the same time.</p><heading id="h-0019" level="2">XI. Fabrication Products.</heading><heading id="h-0020" level="2">A.

Example Structures and Geometries of 3D Objects.</heading><p id="p-0319" num="0299">In example embodiments, the three-dimensional (3D) object may be formed with thousands or millions of shape variations imparted on the three-dimensional object while being formed. In example embodiments, the pattern generator generates different patterns of light to activate photoinitiator in the region of the gradient of polymerization to impart different shapes as the object is extracted through the gradient of polymerization. In example embodiments, the pattern generator may have high resolution with millions of pixel elements that can be varied to change the shape that is imparted. For example, the pattern generator may be a DLP with more than 1,000 or 2,000 or 3,000 or more rows and/or more than 1,000 or 2,000 or 3,000 or more columns of micromirrors, or pixels in an LCD panel, that can be used to vary the shape. As a result, very fine variations or gradations may be imparted on the object along its length. In example embodiments, this allows complex three-dimensional objects to be formed at high speed with a substantially continuous surface without cleavage lines or seams. In some examples, more than a hundred, thousand, ten thousand, hundred thousand or million shape variations may be imparted on the three-dimensional object being formed without cleavage lines or seams across a length of the object being formed of more than 1 mm, 1 cm, 10 cm or more or across the entire length of the formed object. In example embodiments, the object may be continuously formed through the gradient of polymerization at a rate of more than 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000 or more microns per second.</p><p id="p-0320" num="0300">In example embodiments, this allows complex three-dimensional (3D) objects to be formed. In some example embodiments, the 3D formed objects have complex non-injection moldable shapes. The shapes may not be capable of being readily formed using injection molding or casting. For example, the shapes may not be capable of being formed by discrete mold elements that are mated to form a cavity in which fill material is injected and cured, such as a conventional two-part mold. For example, in some embodiments, the 3D formed objects may include enclosed cavities or partially open cavities, repeating unit cells, or open-cell or closed-cell foam structures that are not amenable to injection molding and may including hundreds, thousands or millions of these structures or interconnected networks of these structures. However, in example embodiments, these shapes may be 3D formed using the methods described in the present application with a wide range of properties, including a wide range of elastomeric properties, tensile strength and elongation at break through the use of dual cure materials and/or interpenetrating polymer networks to form these structures. In example embodiments, the 3D objects may be formed without cleavage lines, parting lines, seams, sprue, gate marks or ejector pin marks that may be present with injection molding or other conventional techniques. In some embodiments, the 3D formed objects may have continuous surface texture (whether smooth, patterned or rough) that is free from molding or other printing artifacts (such as cleavage lines, parting lines, seams, sprue, gate marks or ejector pin marks) across more than 1 mm, 1 cm, 10 cm or more or across the entire length of the formed object. In example embodiments, complex 3D objects may be formed with no discrete layers visible or readily detectable from the printing process in the finished 3D object across more than 1 mm, 1 cm, 10 cm or more or across the entire length of the formed object. For example, the varying shapes imparted during the course of printing by the pattern generator may not be visible or detectable as different layers in the finished 3D object since the printing occurs through the gradient of polymerization zone (from which the 3D object is extracted as it is exposed by varying patterns projected from the pattern generator). While the 3D objects resulting from this process may be referred to as 3D printed objects, the 3D objects may be formed through continuous liquid interphase printing without the discrete layers or cleavage lines associated with some 3D printing processes.</p><p id="p-0321" num="0301">In some embodiments, the 3D formed object may include one or more repeating structural elements to form the 3D objects, including, for example, structures that are (or substantially correspond to) enclosed cavities, partially-enclosed cavities, repeating unit cells or networks of unit cells, foam cell, Kelvin foam cell or other open-cell or closed-cell foam structures, crisscross structures, overhang structures, cantilevers, microneedles, fibers, paddles, protrusions, pins, dimples, rings, tunnels, tubes, shells, panels, beams (including I-beams, U-beams, W-beams and cylindrical beams), struts, ties, channels (whether open, closed or partially enclosed), waveguides, triangular structures, tetrahedron or other pyramid shape, cube, octahedron, octagon prism, icosidodecahedron, rhombic triacontahedron or other polyhedral shapes or modules (including Kelvin minimal surface tetrakaidecahedra, prisms or other polyhedral shapes), pentagon, hexagonal, octagon and other polygon structures or prisms, polygon mesh or other three-dimensional structure. In some embodiments, a 3D formed object may include combinations of any of these structures or interconnected networks of these structures. In an example embodiments, all or a portion of the structure of the 3D formed object may correspond (or substantially correspond) to one or more Bravais lattice or unit cell structures, including cubic (including simple, body-centered or face-centered), tetragonal (including simple or body-centered), monoclinic (including simple or end-centered), orthohombic (including simple, body-centered, face-centered or end-centered), rhombohedral, hexagonal and triclinic structures. In example embodiments, the 3D formed object may include shapes or surfaces that correspond (or substantially correspond) to a catenoid, helicoid, gyroid or lidinoid, other triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS), or other geometry from the associate family (or Bonnet family) or Schwarz P (&#x201c;Primitive&#x201d;) or Schwarz D (&#x201c;Diamond&#x201d;), Schwarz H (&#x201c;Hexagonal&#x201d;) or Schwarz CLP (&#x201c;Crossed layers of parallels&#x201d;) surfaces, argyle or diamond patterns, lattice or other pattern or structure.</p><p id="p-0322" num="0302">In example embodiments, the pattern generator may be programmed to vary rapidly during printing to impart different shapes into the gradient of polymerization with high resolution. As a result, any of the above structural elements may be formed with a wide range of dimensions and properties and may be repeated or combined with other structural elements to form the 3D object. In example embodiments, the 3D formed object may include a single three-dimensional structure or may include more than 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000 or more of these structural elements. The structural elements may be repeated structural elements of similar shapes or combinations of different structural elements and can be any of those described above or other regular or irregular shapes.

In example embodiments, a height, width or other dimension across the structure may be in the range of from about 10 nanometers to about 50 cm or more or any range subsumed therein. As used herein, &#x201c;any range subsumed therein&#x201d; means any range that is within the stated range. For example, the following are all subsumed within the range of about 10 nanometers to about 50 square cm and are included herein: 10 nanometers to 1 micron; 1 micron to 1 millimeter; 1 millimeter to 1 centimeter; and 1 centimeter to 50 cm or any other range or set of ranges within the stated range. In example embodiments, each of the structural elements may form a volume of the 3D object in the range of from about 10 square nanometers to about 50 square cm or more or any range subsumed therein. In example embodiments, each of the structural elements may form a cavity or hollow region or gap between surfaces of the structural element having a dimension across the cavity or hollow region or gap in the range of from about 10 nanometers to about 50 cm or more or any range subsumed therein or may define a volume within the expanse of the 3D formed object in the range of from about 10 square nanometers to about 50 square cm or more or any range subsumed therein.</p><p id="p-0323" num="0303">The structural elements may be about the same size or the size may vary throughout the volume of the 3D formed object. The sizes may increase or decrease from one side of the 3D formed object to another side (gradually or step-wise) or elements of different shapes may be intermixed in regular or irregular patterns (for example, a 3D elastomeric foam with varying sizes of open-cell and/or closed-cell cavities intermixed throughout the foam).</p><p id="p-0324" num="0304">In some embodiments, the 3D formed objects may have irregular shapes with overhangs, bridging elements or asymmetries or may otherwise have an offset center of gravity in the direction being formed. For example, the 3D formed object may be asymmetric. In example embodiments, the 3D formed object may not have rotational symmetry around any axis or may have rotational symmetry only around a single axis. In example embodiments, the 3D formed object may not have reflectional symmetry around any plane through the 3D formed object or may have reflectional symmetry only around a single plane. In example embodiments, the 3D object may have an offset center of gravity. For example, the center of gravity of the 3D formed object may not be at the positional center of the object. In some examples, the center of gravity may not be located along any central axis of the object. For example, the 3D formed object may be a shoe sole or insert that generally follows the contour of a foot. The shoe sole or insert may tilt to the right or left and have different widths for the heel and toes. As a result, the 3D formed object in this example will not have reflectional symmetry from side to side or front to back. However, it may have reflectional symmetry from bottom to top if it is a uniformly flat shoe sole or insert. In other examples, the shoe sole or insert may be flat on one side and be contoured to receive the arch of a foot on the other side and, as a result, will not have reflectional symmetry from bottom to top either. Other 3D formed objects for wearable, prosthetic or anatomical shapes or devices may have similar asymmetries and/or offset center of gravity. For example, a 3D formed object for a dental mold or dental implant may substantially conform to the shape of a tooth and may not have reflectional symmetry about any plane. In another example, a 3D formed component for a wearable device may substantially conform to the shape of a body party and have corresponding asymmetries, such as athletic wear such as a right or left contoured shin guard or foam padding or insert for use between a hard shin guard or a helmet or other wearable component and the human body. These are examples only and any number of 3D formed objects may be asymmetric and/or have an offset center of gravity. In example embodiments, where there are significant asymmetries or protruding elements (such as arms, bridging elements, cantilevers, brush fibers or the like) and the desired structural elements will be elastomeric, there is a potential for deformation during 3D printing or subsequent curing. For example, if a large amount of non-UV curable elastomeric resin material is included, gravity may cause deformation before final curing. While the scaffold formed from UV-curable material during 3D printing (from the initial cure in a dual cure process) helps lock-in the shape, some elastomeric compositions with highly asymmetric or protruding shapes may be susceptible to deformation. In some example embodiments, the UV curable material in the composition may be adjusted to form a more rigid scaffold to avoid deformation. In other example embodiments, objects with asymmetric shapes and/or offset center of gravity may be formed in pairs (or in other combinations) with connectors that are later removed, particularly if the 3D formed objects or protruding elements are relatively long. In an example, an elastomeric 3D object may be formed along a length, and have an asymmetry, center of gravity offset and/or protruding element transverse to the length that is more than 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% or more of the length. For example, the 3D formed object may have a length of about 1 cm to 50 cm or more or any range subsumed therein and may have a transverse or lateral asymmetry or protruding element of about 1 cm to 50 cm or more or any range subsumed therein. In an example embodiment, two or more of these objects may be formed together in a way that provides support for the transverse or protruding elements until the elastomeric material is cured and the objects are separated. For example, two shoe soles may be formed (e.g., when formed in the direction of their length) as a pair (for example, with rotated and inverted shoe soles formed together with small removable connectors between them) such that the soles provide support to one another while being formed. In other example embodiments, other support structures may be formed and removed after curing of the elastomeric material.</p><heading id="h-0022" level="2">C.

Many photoinitiators may be used in combination with amines. Here the photoinitiators in the excited state serve to abstract a hydrogen atom from the amine, thus generating an active radical.

Example Properties of 3D Objects.</heading><p id="p-0377" num="0354">The structural properties of the 3D formed object may be selected together with the properties of the materials from which the 3D object is formed to provide a wide range of properties for the 3D object. Dual cure materials and methods described above in the present application may be used to form complex shapes with desired materials properties to form a wide range of 3D objects.</p><p id="p-0378" num="0355">In some embodiments, 3D formed objects may be rigid and have, for example, a Young's modulus (MPa) in the range of about 800 to 3500 or any range subsumed therein, a Tensile Strength (MPa) in the range of about 30 to 100 or any range subsumed therein, and/or a percent elongation at break in the range of about 1 to 100 or any range subsumed therein. Non-limiting examples of such rigid 3D formed objects may include fasteners; electronic device housings; gears, propellers, and impellers; wheels, mechanical device housings; tools and other rigid 3D objects.</p><p id="p-0379" num="0356">In some embodiments, 3D formed objects may be semi-rigid and have, for example, a Young's modulus (MPa) in the range of about 300-2500 or any range subsumed therein, a Tensile Strength (MPa) in the range of about 20-70 or any range subsumed therein, and/or a percent elongation at break in the range of about 40 to 300 or 600 or any range subsumed therein.

In example embodiments, 3D formed objects may include multiple materials (which may, for example, be a thermoplastic or thermoset polyurethane, polyurea, or copolymer thereof) with different tensile strengths. While a fault line or plane may be formed in the intermediate by the interruption, if the subsequent polymerizable liquid is, in its second cure material, reactive with that of the first, then the two distinct segments of the intermediate will cross-react and covalently couple to one another during the second cure (e.g., by heating or microwave irradiation). Thus, for example, any of the materials described herein may be sequentially changed to form a product having multiple distinct segments with different tensile properties, while still being a unitary product with the different segments covalently coupled to one another. In some embodiments, a 3D object may be formed with a plurality of regions with different materials and properties. For example, a 3D formed object could have one or more regions formed from a first material or first group of one or more materials having a Tensile Strength (MPa) in the range of about 30-100 or any range subsumed therein, and/or one or more regions formed from a second material or second group of one or more materials having a Tensile Strength (MPa) in the range of about 20-70 or any range subsumed therein and/or one or more regions formed from a third material or third group of one or more materials having a Tensile Strength (MPa) in the range of about 0.5-30 or any range subsumed therein or any combination of the foregoing. For example, the 3D object could have from 1-10 or more different regions (or any range subsumed therein) with varying tensile strength selected from any of the materials and tensile strengths described above. For example, a hinge can be formed, with the hinge comprising a rigid segment, coupled to a second elastic segment, coupled to a third rigid segment, by sequentially changing polymerizable liquids (e.g., from among those described in examples 19-60 above) during the formation of the three-dimensional intermediate. A shock absorber or vibration dampener can be formed in like manner, with the second segment being either elastic or semi-rigid. A unitary rigid funnel and flexible hose assembly can be formed in like manner.</p><heading id="h-0024" level="2">E.

Ierusalimschy, Programming in Lua (2013) (ISBN-10: 859037985X; ISBN-13: 978-8590379850).</p><p id="p-0413" num="0390">This Example illustrates the control of a method and apparatus of the invention with an example program written utilizing Lua scripting. Program code corresponding to such instructions, or variations thereof that will be apparent to those skilled in the art, is written in accordance with known techniques based upon the particular microcontroller used.</p><p id="p-0414" num="0391">Concepts. A part consists of slices of polymer which are formed continuously. The shape of each slice is defined by the frame that is being displayed by the light engine.</p><p id="p-0415" num="0392">Frame. The frame represents the final output for a slice. The frame is what manifests as the physical geometry of the part. The data in the frame is what is projected by the printer to cure the polymer.</p><p id="p-0416" num="0393">Slice. All the 2D geometry that will be outputted to a frame should be combined in a Slice. Slices can consist of procedural geometry, Slices of a 3D model or any combination of the two. The slice generating process allows the user to have direct control over the composition of any frame.</p><p id="p-0417" num="0394">Slice of a 3D Model. A slice is a special type of 2D geometry derived from a 3D model of a part. It represents the geometry that intersects a plane that is parallel to the window. Parts are usually constructed by taking 3D models and slicing them at very small intervals. Each slice is then interpreted in succession by the printer and used to cure the polymer at the proper height.</p><p id="p-0418" num="0395">Procedural Geometry. Procedurally generated geometry can also be added to a slice. This is accomplished by invoking shape generation functions, such as &#x201c;addcircle&#x201d;, &#x201c;addrectangle&#x201d;, and others. Each function allows projection of the corresponding shape onto the printing window. A produced part appears as a vertically extruded shape or combination of shapes.</p><p id="p-0419" num="0396">Coordinate spaces: Stage. The coordinate system that the stage uses is usually calibrated such that the origin is 1-20 microns above the window.</p><p id="p-0420" num="0397">Coordinate spaces: Slice. Coordinate system of the projected slice is such that origin is located at the center of the print window.</p><heading id="h-0040" level="2">Quick Start.</heading><p id="p-0421" num="0398">The following is the most basic method of printing a part from a sliced 3D model. Printing a sliced model consists of 4 main parts: Loading the data, preparing the printer, printing, and shutdown.</p><p id="p-0422" num="0399">Loading Data. In this section of the code the sliced model data is loaded into memory. The file path to the model is defined in the Constants section of the code. See the full code below for details.</p><heading id="h-0041" level="2">&#x2014;Loading Model</heading><p id="p-0423" num="0400">modelFilePath=&#x201c;Chess King.svg&#x201d;<br/>numSlices=loadslices(modelFilePath)<br/>Preparing the printer it is important to do two things before printing. You must first turn on the light engine with the relay function, and if applicable, the desired fluid height should be set.</p><heading id="h-0042" level="2">&#x2014;Prepare Printer</heading><p id="p-0424" num="0401">relay(true)&#x2014;turn light on<br/>showframe(&#x2212;1)&#x2014;ensure nothing is exposed during setup<br/>setlevels(0.55, 0.6)&#x2014;if available, printer set fluid pump to maintain about 55% fill</p><p id="p-0425" num="0402">Printing. The first step of the printing process is to calibrate the system and set the stage to its starting position by calling gotostart. Next we begin a for loop in which we print each slice. The first line of the for loop uses the infoline command to display the current slice index in the sidebar. Next we determine the height at which the next slice should be cured. That value is stored to nextHeight. Following this we move the stage to the height at which the next slice needs to be cured. To ensure a clean print it can sometimes be necessary to wait for oxygen to diffuse into the resin. Therefore we call sleep for a half second (the exact time for preExposureTime is defined in the constants section as well). After this it's time to actually cure the resin so we call showframe and pass it the index of the slice we want to print, which is stored in sliceIndex by the for loop. We sleep again after this for exposureTime seconds in order to let the resin cure. Before moving on to the next frame, we call showframe (&#x2212;1) in order to prevent the light engine from curing any resin while the stage is moving to the next height.<ul id="ul0016" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0016-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0017" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0017-0001" num="0403">Execute Print</li>        <li id="ul0017-0002" num="0404">gotostart( )&#x2014;move stage to starting position</li>        <li id="ul0017-0003" num="0405">for sliceIndex=0,numSlices&#x2212;1 do</li>        <li id="ul0017-0004" num="0406">infoline(5, string.format(&#x201c;Current Slice: % d&#x201d;, sliceIndex))</li>        <li id="ul0017-0005" num="0407">nextHeight=sliceheight(sliceIndex)&#x2014;calculate the height that the stage should be at to expose this frame</li>        <li id="ul0017-0006" num="0408">moveto(nextHeight, stageSpeed)&#x2014;move to nextHeight</li>        <li id="ul0017-0007" num="0409">sleep(preExposureTime)&#x2014;wait a given amount of time for oxygen to diffuse into resin, prepExposureTime is predefined in the Constants section</li>        <li id="ul0017-0008" num="0410">showframe(sliceIndex)&#x2014;show frame to expose</li>        <li id="ul0017-0009" num="0411">sleep(exposureTime)&#x2014;wait while frame exposes, exposureTime is predefined in the Constants section</li>        <li id="ul0017-0010" num="0412">showframe(&#x2212;1)&#x2014;show nothing to ensure no exposure while stage is moving to next position<br/>end<br/>Shutdown. The final step in the printing process is to shut down the printer. Call relay (false) to turn the light engine off. If you are using fluid control, call setlevels (0,0) to ensure the valve is shut off. Finally it is a good idea to move the stage up a bit after printing to allow for easy removal of the part.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><heading id="h-0043" level="2">&#x2014;Shutdown</heading><p id="p-0426" num="0413">relay(false)<br/>setlevels(0,0)<br/>&#x2014;Lift stage to remove part<br/>moveby(25, 16000)<br/>Fully completed code implementing instructions based on the above is set forth below.</p><heading id="h-0044" level="2">&#x2014;Constants</heading><p id="p-0427" num="0414">exposureTime=1.5&#x2014;in seconds<br/>preExposureTime=0.5&#x2014;in seconds<br/>stageSpeed=300&#x2014;in mm/hour</p><heading id="h-0045" level="2">&#x2014;Loading Model</heading><p id="p-0428" num="0415">modelFilePath=&#x201c;Chess King.svg&#x201d;<br/>numSlices=loadslices(modelFilePath)<br/>&#x2014;calculating parameters<br/>maxPrintHeight=sliceheight(numSlices&#x2212;1)&#x2014;find the highest point in the print, this is the same as the height of the last slice.

In this embodiment, the vertical movement or advancing step (which can be achieved by driving either the carrier or the build surface, preferably the carrier), is continuous and unidirectional, and the irradiating step is carried out continuously. Polymerization of the article being fabricated occurs from a gradient of polymerization, and hence creation of &#x201c;layer by layer&#x201d; fault lines within the article is minimized.</p><p id="p-0478" num="0710">An alternate embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>. In this embodiment, the advancing step is carried out in a step-by-step manner, with pauses introduced between active advancing of the carrier and build surface away from one another. In addition, the irradiating step is carried out intermittently, in this case during the pauses in the advancing step. We find that, as long as the inhibitor of polymerization is supplied to the dead zone in an amount sufficient to maintain the dead zone and the adjacent gradient of polymerization during the pauses in irradiation and/or advancing, the gradient of polymerization is maintained, and the formation of layers within the article of manufacture is minimized or avoided. Stated differently, the polymerization is continuous, even though the irradiating and advancing steps are not. Sufficient inhibitor can be supplied by any of a variety of techniques, including but not limited to: utilizing a transparent member that is sufficiently permeable to the inhibitor, enriching the inhibitor (e.g., feeding the inhibitor from an inhibitor-enriched and/or pressurized atmosphere), etc. In general, the more rapid the fabrication of the three-dimensional object (that is, the more rapid the cumulative rate of advancing), the more inhibitor will be required to maintain the dead zone and the adjacent gradient of polymerization.</p><heading id="h-0073" level="1">Example 11</heading><heading id="h-0074" level="1">Continuous Fabrication with Reciprocation During</heading><heading id="h-0075" level="1">Advancing to Enhance Filling of Build Region with Polymerizable Liquid</heading><p id="p-0479" num="0711">A still further embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>. As in Example 10 above, this embodiment, the advancing step is carried out in a step-by-step manner, with pauses introduced between active advancing of the carrier and build surface away from one another. Also as in Example 10 above, the irradiating step is carried out intermittently, again during the pauses in the advancing step. In this example, however, the ability to maintain the dead zone and gradient of polymerization during the pauses in advancing and irradiating is taken advantage of by introducing a vertical reciprocation during the pauses in irradiation.</p><p id="p-0480" num="0712">We find that vertical reciprocation (driving the carrier and build surface away from and then back towards one another), particularly during pauses in irradiation, can serve to enhance the filling of the build region with the polymerizable liquid, apparently by pulling polymerizable liquid into the build region. This is advantageous when larger areas are irradiated or larger parts are fabricated, and filling the central portion of the build region may be rate-limiting to an otherwise rapid fabrication.</p><p id="p-0481" num="0713">Reciprocation in the vertical or Z axis can be carried out at any suitable speed in both directions (and the speed need not be the same in both directions), although it is preferred that the speed when reciprocating away is insufficient to cause the formation of gas bubbles in the build region.</p><p id="p-0482" num="0714">While a single cycle of reciprocation is shown during each pause in irradiation in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>, it will be appreciated that multiple cycles (which may be the same as or different from one another) may be introduced during each pause.</p><p id="p-0483" num="0715">As in Example 10 above, as long as the inhibitor of polymerization is supplied to the dead zone in an amount sufficient to maintain the dead zone and the adjacent gradient of polymerization during the reciprocation, the gradient of polymerization is maintained, the formation of layers within the article of manufacture is minimized or avoided, and the polymerization/fabrication remains continuous, even though the irradiating and advancing steps are not.</p><heading id="h-0076" level="1">Example 12</heading><heading id="h-0077" level="1">Acceleration During Reciprocation Upstroke and</heading><heading id="h-0078" level="1">Deceleration During Reciprocation Downstroke to Enhance Part Quality</heading><p id="p-0484" num="0716">We observe that there is a limiting speed of upstroke, and corresponding downstroke, which if exceeded causes a deterioration of quality of the part or object being fabricated (possibly due to degradation of soft regions within the gradient of polymerization caused by lateral shear forces a resin flow).
