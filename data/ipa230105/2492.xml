Immunotherapy provides the advantage of cell specificity that other treatment modalities, such as chemotherapy and radiation, lack. As such, methods for enhancing the efficacy of immune based therapies can be clinically beneficial. For example, immune checkpoint molecules that provide costimulatory or coinhibitory signals play a central role in the regulation of immune responses against tumor cells.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, despite impressive patient responses to agents targeting the checkpoint molecules, including, for example, the successes of YERVOY, KEYTRUDA, and OPDIVO, immunotherapies such as checkpoint inhibition therapy still fails in the overwhelming majority of patients. Further still, many immunotherapies are complicated by side effects that significantly narrows a patient's therapeutic window for treatment and makes the patient more susceptible to other diseases.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, there remains a need for improved immunotherapeutic agents that can provide targeted therapy against cancers while causing minimal side effects.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In various aspects, the present invention relates to binding agents having at least one targeting moiety that specifically binds to PD-1 or PD-L1.

In various embodiments, the signaling agent is antagonistic in its wild type form and bears one or more mutations that attenuate its antagonistic activity. In various embodiments, the signaling agent is antagonistic due to one or more mutations, e.g. an agonistic signaling agent is converted to an antagonistic signaling agent and, such a converted signaling agent, optionally, also bears one or more mutations that attenuate its antagonistic activity (e.g. as described in WO 2015/007520, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference).</p><p id="p-0124" num="0137">Accordingly, in various embodiments, the signaling agent is a modified (e.g. mutant) form of the signaling agent having one or more mutations.

In some embodiments, the mutations which attenuate or reduce binding or affinity include those mutations which substantially reduce or ablate binding or activity. In some embodiments, the mutations which attenuate or reduce binding or affinity are different than those mutations which substantially reduce or ablate binding or activity. Consequentially, in various embodiments, the mutations allow for the signaling agent to have improved safety, e.g. reduced systemic toxicity, reduced side effects, and reduced off-target effects relative to unmutated, i.e. wild type, signaling agent (e.g. comparing the same signaling agent in a wild type form versus a modified (e.g. mutant) form).</p><p id="p-0125" num="0138">In some embodiments, the targeting moiety of the present invention restores the modified signaling agent's affinity or activity at the signaling agent's receptor.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0139">As described herein, the agent may have improved safety due to one of more modifications, e.g. mutations.

In some embodiments, the signaling agent is modified to have one or more mutations that substantially reduce or ablate binding affinity or activity for the receptors. In some embodiments, the activity provided by the wild type signaling agent is agonism at the receptor (e.g. activation of a cellular effect at a site of therapy). For example, the wild type signaling agent may activate its receptor. In such embodiments, the mutations result in the modified signaling agent to have reduced or ablated activating activity at the receptor. For example, the mutations may result in the modified signaling agent to deliver a reduced activating signal to a target cell or the activating signal could be ablated. In some embodiments, the activity provided by the wild type signaling agent is antagonism at the receptor (e.g. blocking or dampening of a cellular effect at a site of therapy). For example, the wild type signaling agent may antagonize or inhibit the receptor. In these embodiments, the mutations result in the modified signaling agent to have a reduced or ablated antagonizing activity at the receptor. For example, the mutations may result in the modified signaling agent to deliver a reduced inhibitory signal to a target cell or the inhibitory signal could be ablated. In various embodiments, the signaling agent is antagonistic due to one or more mutations, e.g. an agonistic signaling agent is converted to an antagonistic signaling agent (e.g. as described in WO 2015/007520, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference) and, such a converted signaling agent, optionally, also bears one or more mutations that reduce its binding affinity or activity for one or more of its receptors or that substantially reduce or ablate binding affinity or activity for one or more of its receptors.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0141">In some embodiments, the reduced affinity or activity at the receptor is restorable by attachment with one or more of the targeting moieties as described herein (e.g., targeting moiety against PD-L1 or any other targeting moiety described herein). In other embodiments, the reduced affinity or activity at the receptor is not substantially restorable by the activity of one or more of the targeting moieties.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0142">In various embodiments, the chimeric proteins or chimeric protein complexes of the present invention reduce off-target effects because their signaling agents have mutations that weaken or ablate binding affinity or activity at a receptor. In various embodiments, this reduction in side effects is observed relative with, for example, the wild type signaling agents. In various embodiments, the signaling agent is active on target cells because the targeting moiety(ies) compensates for the missing/insufficient binding (e.g., without limitation and/or avidity) required for substantial activation. In various embodiments, the modified signaling agent is substantially inactive en route to the site of therapeutic activity and has its effect substantially on specifically targeted cell types which greatly reduces undesired side effects.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0143">In some embodiments, the signaling agent may include one or more mutations that attenuate or reduce binding or affinity for one receptor (i.e., a therapeutic receptor) and one or more mutations that substantially reduce or ablate binding or activity at a second receptor. In such embodiments, these mutations may be at the same or at different positions (i.e., the same mutation or multiple mutations). In some embodiments, the mutation(s) that reduce binding and/or activity at one receptor is different than the mutation(s) that substantially reduce or ablate at another receptor. In some embodiments, the mutation(s) that reduce binding and/or activity at one receptor is the same as the mutation(s) that substantially reduce or ablate at another receptor. In some embodiments, the present chimeric proteins or chimeric protein complexes have a modified signaling agent that has both mutations that attenuate binding and/or activity at a therapeutic receptor and therefore allow for a more controlled, on-target therapeutic effect (e.g. relative wild type signaling agent) and mutations that substantially reduce or ablate binding and/or activity at another receptor and therefore reduce side effects (e.g. relative to wild type signaling agent).</p><p id="p-0131" num="0144">In some embodiments, the substantial reduction or ablation of binding or activity is not substantially restorable with a targeting moiety (e.g., a targeting moiety against PD-L1 or any other targeting moiety described herein). In some embodiments, the substantial reduction or ablation of binding or activity is restorable with a targeting moiety. In various embodiments, substantially reducing or ablating binding or activity at a second receptor also may prevent deleterious effects that are mediated by the other receptor. Alternatively, or in addition, substantially reducing or ablating binding or activity at the other receptor causes the therapeutic effect to improve as there is a reduced or eliminated sequestration of the therapeutic chimeric proteins or chimeric protein complexes away from the site of therapeutic action. For instance, in some embodiments, this obviates the need of high doses of the present chimeric proteins or chimeric protein complexes that compensate for loss at the other receptor. Such ability to reduce dose further provides a lower likelihood of side effects.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0145">In various embodiments, the modified signaling agent comprises one or more mutations that cause the signaling agent to have reduced, substantially reduced, or ablated affinity, e.g. binding (e.g. K<sub>D</sub>) and/or activation (for instance, when the modified signaling agent is an agonist of its receptor, measurable as, for example, K<sub>A </sub>and/or EC<sub>50</sub>) and/or inhibition (for instance, when the modified signaling agent is an antagonist of its receptor, measurable as, for example, K<sub>I </sub>and/or IC<sub>50</sub>), for one or more of its receptors. In various embodiments, the reduced affinity at the signaling agent's receptor allows for attenuation of activity (inclusive of agonism or antagonism). In such embodiments, the modified signaling agent has about 1%, or about 3%, about 5%, about 10%, about 15%, about 20%, about 25%, about 30%, about 35%, about 40%, about 45%, about 50%, about 60%, about 65%, about 70%, about 75%, about 80%, about 85%, about 90%, about 95%, or about 10%-20%, about 20%-40%, about 50%, about 40%-60%, about 60%-80%, about 80%-100% of the affinity for the receptor relative to the wild type signaling agent.

In some embodiments, this binding affinity differential is between signaling agent/receptor and targeting moiety/receptor on the same cell. In some embodiments, this binding affinity differential allows for the signaling agent, e.g. mutated signaling agent, to have localized, on-target effects and to minimize off-target effects that underlie side effects that are observed with wild type signaling agent. In some embodiments, this binding affinity is at least about 2-fold, or at least about 5-fold, or at least about 10-fold, or at least about 15-fold lower, or at least about 25-fold, or at least about 50-fold lower, or at least about 100-fold, or at least about 150-fold.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0149">Receptor binding activity may be measured using methods known in the art.

VEGF is a potent growth factor that plays major roles in physiological but also pathological angiogenesis, regulates vascular permeability and can act as a growth factor on cells expressing VEGF receptors. Additional functions include, among others, stimulation of cell migration in macrophage lineage and endothelial cells. Several members of the VEGF family of growth factors exist, as well as at least three receptors (VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3). Members of the VEGF family can bind and activate more than one VEGFR type. For example, VEGF-A binds VEGFR-1 and -2, while VEGF-C can bind VEGFR-2 and -3. VEGFR-1 and -2 activation regulates angiogenesis while VEGFR-3 activation is associated with lymphangiogenesis. The major pro-angiogenic signal is generated from activation of VEGFR-2. VEGFR-1 activation has been reported to be possibly associated with negative role in angiogenesis. It has also been reported that VEGFR-1 signaling is important for progression of tumors in vivo via bone marrow-derived VEGFR-1 positive cells (contributing to formation of premetastatic niche in the bone). Several therapies based on VEGF-A directed/neutralizing therapeutic antibodies have been developed, primarily for use in treatment of various human tumors relying on angiogenesis. These are not without side effects though. This may not be surprising considering that these operate as general, non-cell/tissue specific VEGF/VEGFR interaction inhibitors. Hence, it would be desirable to restrict VEGF (e.g. VEGF-A)/VEGFR-2 inhibition to specific target cells (e.g. tumor vasculature endothelial cells).</p><p id="p-0271" num="0281">In some embodiments, the VEGF is VEGF-A, VEGF-B, VEFG-C, VEGF-D, or VEGF-E and isoforms thereof including the various isoforms of VEGF-A such as VEGF<sub>121</sub>, VEGF<sub>121</sub>b, VEGF<sub>145</sub>, VEGF<sub>165</sub>, VEGF<sub>165</sub>b, VEGF<sub>189</sub>, and VEGF<sub>206</sub>. In some embodiments, the modified signaling agent has reduced affinity and/or activity for VEGFR-1 (Flt-1) and/or VEGFR-2 (KDR/Flk-1). In some embodiments, the modified signaling agent has substantially reduced or ablated affinity and/or activity for VEGFR-1 (Flt-1) and/or VEGFR-2 (KDR/Flk-1). In an embodiment, the modified signaling agent has reduced affinity and/or activity for VEGFR-2 (KDR/Flk-1) and/or substantially reduced or ablated affinity and/or activity for VEGFR-1 (Flt-1). Such an embodiment finds use, for example, in wound healing methods or treatment of ischemia-related diseases (without wishing to be bound by theory, mediated by VEGFR-2's effects on endothelial cell function and angiogenesis). In various embodiments, binding to VEGFR-1 (Flt-1), which is linked to cancers and pro-inflammatory activities, is avoided. In various embodiments, VEGFR-1 (Flt-1) acts a decoy receptor and therefore substantially reduces or ablates affinity at this receptor avoids sequestration of the therapeutic agent. In an embodiment, the modified signaling agent has substantially reduced or ablated affinity and/or activity for VEGFR-1 (Flt-1) and/or substantially reduced or ablated affinity and/or activity for VEGFR-2 (KDR/Flk-1). In some embodiments, the VEGF is VEGF-C or VEGF-D. In such embodiments, the modified signaling agent has reduced affinity and/or activity for VEGFR-3. Alternatively, the modified signaling agent has substantially reduced or ablated affinity and/or activity for VEGFR-3.</p><p id="p-0272" num="0282">Proangiogenic therapies are also important in various diseases (e.g. ischemic heart disease, bleeding etc.), and include VEGF-based therapeutics. Activation of VEGFR-2 is proangiogenic (acting on endothelial cells). Activation of VEFGR-1 can cause stimulation of migration of inflammatory cells (including, for example, macrophages) and lead to inflammation associated hypervascular permeability. Activation of VEFGR-1 can also promote bone marrow associated tumor niche formation. Thus, VEGF based therapeutic selective for VEGFR-2 activation would be desirable in this case. In addition, cell specific targeting, e.g. to endothelial cells, would be desirable.</p><p id="p-0273" num="0283">In some embodiments, the modified signaling agent has reduced affinity and/or activity (e.g. antagonistic) for VEGFR-2 and/or has substantially reduced or ablated affinity and/or activity for VEGFR-1. When targeted to tumor vasculature endothelial cells via a targeting moiety that binds to a tumor endothelial cell marker (e.g. PSMA and others), such construct inhibits VEGFR-2 activation specifically on such marker-positive cells, while not activating VEGFR-1 en route and on target cells (if activity ablated), thus eliminating induction of inflammatory responses, for example. This would provide a more selective and safe anti-angiogenic therapy for many tumor types as compared to VEGF-A neutralizing therapies.</p><p id="p-0274" num="0284">In some embodiments, the modified signaling agent has reduced affinity and/or activity (e.g. agonistic) for VEGFR-2 and/or has substantially reduced or ablated affinity and/or activity for VEGFR-1. Through targeting to vascular endothelial cells, such construct, in some embodiments, promotes angiogenesis without causing VEGFR-1 associated induction of inflammatory responses. Hence, such a construct would have targeted proangiogenic effects with substantially reduced risk of side effects caused by systemic activation of VEGFR-2 as well as VEGR-1.</p><p id="p-0275" num="0285">In an illustrative embodiment, the modified signaling agent is VEGF<sub>165</sub>, which has the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 95).</p><p id="p-0276" num="0286">In another illustrative embodiment, the modified signaling agent is VEGF<sub>165b</sub>, which has the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 96.</p><p id="p-0277" num="0287">In these embodiments, the modified signaling agent has a mutation at amino acid I83 (e.g., a substitution mutation at I83, e.g., I83K, I83R, or I83H). Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that such mutations may result in reduced receptor binding affinity. See, for example, U.S. Pat.

TNF is a pleiotropic cytokine with many diverse functions, including regulation of cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, tumorigenesis, viral replication, autoimmunity, immune cell functions and trafficking, inflammation, and septic shock. It binds to two distinct membrane receptors on target cells: TNFR1 (p55) and TNFR2 (p75). TNFR1 exhibits a very broad expression pattern whereas TNFR2 is expressed preferentially on certain populations of lymphocytes, Tregs, endothelial cells, certain neurons, microglia, cardiac myocytes and mesenchymal stem cells. Very distinct biological pathways are activated in response to receptor activation, although there is also some overlap. As a general rule, without wishing to be bound by theory, TNFR1 signaling is associated with induction of apoptosis (cell death) and TNFR2 signaling is associated with activation of cell survival signals (e.g. activation of NFkB pathway). Administration of TNF is systemically toxic, and this is largely due to TNFR1 engagement. However, it should be noted that activation of TNFR2 is also associated with a broad range of activities and, as with TNFR1, in the context of developing TNF based therapeutics, control over TNF targeting and activity is important.</p><p id="p-0280" num="0290">In some embodiments, the modified signaling agent has reduced affinity and/or activity for TNFR1 and/or TNFR2. In some embodiments, the modified signaling agent has substantially reduced or ablated affinity and/or activity for TNFR1 and/or TNFR2. TNFR1 is expressed in most tissues, and is involved in cell death signaling while, by contrast, TNFR2 is involved in cell survival signaling. Accordingly, in embodiments directed to methods of treating cancer, the modified signaling agent has reduced affinity and/or activity for TNFR1 and/or substantially reduced or ablated affinity and/or activity for TNFR2. In these embodiments, the chimeric proteins or chimeric protein complexes may be targeted to a cell for which apoptosis is desired, e.g. a tumor cell or a tumor vasculature endothelial cell. In embodiments directed to methods of promoting cell survival, for example, in neurogenesis for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders, the modified signaling agent has reduced affinity and/or activity for TNFR2 and/or substantially reduced or ablated affinity and/or activity for TNFR1.

Such a chimera, in some embodiments, finds use in inducing tumor cell death or a tumor vasculature endothelial cell death (e.g. in the treatment of cancers). Also, in some embodiments, these chimeras avoid or reduce activation of T<sub>reg </sub>cells via TNFR2, for example, thus further supporting TNFR1-mediated antitumor activity in vivo.</p><p id="p-0282" num="0292">In some embodiments, the chimeric protein or the chimeric protein complexes has a modified TNF having reduced affinity and/or activity for TNFR2 and/or substantially reduced or ablated affinity and/or activity for TNFR1.

In addition, such a TNFR2-favoring chimeras also are useful in the treatment of autoimmune diseases (e.g. Crohn's, diabetes, MS, colitis etc. and many others described herein).

Without wishing to be bound by theory these auto-reactive T cells, have their apoptosis/survival signals altered e.g. by NFkB pathway activity/signaling alterations. In some embodiments, the chimera causes the death of autoreactive T cells having lesions or modifications in the NFKB pathway, which underlie an imbalance of their cell death (apoptosis)/survival signaling properties and, optionally, altered susceptibility to certain death-inducing signals (e.g., TNFR2 activation).</p><p id="p-0284" num="0294">In some embodiments, a TNFR-2 based chimera has additional therapeutic applications in diseases, including autoimmune disease, various heart disease, de-myelinating and neurodegenerative disorders, and infectious disease, among others.</p><p id="p-0285" num="0295">In an embodiment, the wild type TNF-&#x3b1; has the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 97.</p><p id="p-0286" num="0296">In such embodiments, the modified TNF-&#x3b1; agent has mutations at one or more amino acid positions 29, 31, 32, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 145, 146 and 147 which produces a modified TNF-&#x3b1; with reduced receptor binding affinity.

In various embodiments, the linker is a hinge region of an antibody (e.g., of IgG, IgA, IgD, and IgE, inclusive of subclasses (e.g. IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4, and IgA1 and IgA2)). The hinge region, found in IgG, IgA, IgD, and IgE class antibodies, acts as a flexible spacer, allowing the Fab portion to move freely in space. In contrast to the constant regions, the hinge domains are structurally diverse, varying in both sequence and length among immunoglobulin classes and subclasses. For example, the length and flexibility of the hinge region varies among the IgG subclasses. The hinge region of IgG1 encompasses amino acids 216-231 and, because it is freely flexible, the Fab fragments can rotate about their axes of symmetry and move within a sphere centered at the first of two inter-heavy chain disulfide bridges. IgG2 has a shorter hinge than IgG1, with 12 amino acid residues and four disulfide bridges. The hinge region of IgG2 lacks a glycine residue, is relatively short, and contains a rigid poly-proline double helix, stabilized by extra inter-heavy chain disulfide bridges. These properties restrict the flexibility of the IgG2 molecule. IgG3 differs from the other subclasses by its unique extended hinge region (about four times as long as the IgG1 hinge), containing 62 amino acids (including 21 prolines and 11 cysteines), forming an inflexible poly-proline double helix. In IgG3, the Fab fragments are relatively far away from the Fc fragment, giving the molecule a greater flexibility. The elongated hinge in IgG3 is also responsible for its higher molecular weight compared to the other subclasses. The hinge region of IgG4 is shorter than that of IgG1 and its flexibility is intermediate between that of IgG1 and IgG2. The flexibility of the hinge regions reportedly decreases in the order IgG3&#x3e;IgG1&#x3e;IgG4&#x3e;IgG2.</p><p id="p-0372" num="0382">According to crystallographic studies, the immunoglobulin hinge region can be further subdivided functionally into three regions: the upper hinge region, the core region, and the lower hinge region. See Shin et al., 1992 <i>Immunological Reviews </i>130:87. The upper hinge region includes amino acids from the carboxyl end of C<sub>H1 </sub>to the first residue in the hinge that restricts motion, generally the first cysteine residue that forms an interchain disulfide bond between the two heavy chains. The length of the upper hinge region correlates with the segmental flexibility of the antibody. The core hinge region contains the inter-heavy chain disulfide bridges, and the lower hinge region joins the amino terminal end of the C<sub>H2 </sub>domain and includes residues in C<sub>H2</sub>. Id. The core hinge region of wild-type human IgG1 contains the sequence Cys-Pro-Pro-Cys (SEQ ID NO: 168) which, when dimerized by disulfide bond formation, results in a cyclic octapeptide believed to act as a pivot, thus conferring flexibility. In various embodiments, the present linker comprises, one, or two, or three of the upper hinge region, the core region, and the lower hinge region of any antibody (e.g., of IgG, IgA, IgD, and IgE, inclusive of subclasses (e.g. IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4, and IgA1 and IgA2)). The hinge region may also contain one or more glycosylation sites, which include a number of structurally distinct types of sites for carbohydrate attachment. For example, IgA1 contains five glycosylation sites within a 17-amino-acid segment of the hinge region, conferring resistance of the hinge region polypeptide to intestinal proteases, considered an advantageous property for a secretory immunoglobulin. In various embodiments, the linker of the present invention comprises one or more glycosylation sites.

In another illustrative embodiment, the multispecific chimeric protein comprising two or more targeting moieties is constructed by genetic fusion, i.e., constructing a single polypeptide which includes the polypeptides of the individual targeting moieties. For example, a single polypeptide construct may be formed which encodes a first antibody or antibody derivative (e.g., a VHH) with an antigen recognition domain against PD-L1 and a second antibody or antibody derivative with a recognition domain against a tumor antigen. A method for producing bivalent or multivalent VHH polypeptide constructs is disclosed in PCT patent application WO 96/34103, the entire contents of which is hereby incorporated by reference. In a further illustrative embodiment, the multispecific chimeric protein or the chimeric protein complex of the invention may be constructed by using linkers. For example, the carboxy-terminus of a first antibody or antibody derivative (e.g., a VHH) with an antigen recognition domain against PD-L1 may be linked to the amino-terminus of a second antibody or antibody derivative with a recognition domain against a tumor antigen (or vice versa). Illustrative linkers that may be used are described herein. In some embodiments, the components of the multispecific chimeric protein or the chimeric protein complex of the invention are directly linked to each other without the use of linkers.</p><p id="p-0486" num="0515">In various embodiments, the multi-specific chimeric protein or the chimeric protein complex of the invention recognizes and binds to PD-L1 and one or more antigens found on one or more immune cells, which can include, without limitation, megakaryocytes, thrombocytes, erythrocytes, mast cells, basophils, neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, macrophages, natural killer cells, T lymphocytes (e.g., cytotoxic T lymphocytes, T helper cells, natural killer T cells), B lymphocytes, plasma cells, dendritic cells, or subsets thereof.

rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0571" num="0599">MS disease progression may be most intensive, and most damaging, at the earliest stages of disease progression. Accordingly, counter to many reimbursement policies and physician practice in light of, for example, costs and side effect mitigation, it may be most beneficial for a patient's long term disease status to begin treatment with the most intensive DMTs, for instance so-called second-line therapies. In some embodiments, a patient is treated with a regimen of the chimeric protein or the chimeric protein complex in combination with a second-line therapy. Such a combination is used to reduce the side effect profile of one or more second-line therapies. In some embodiments, the combination is used to reduce dose of frequency of administration of one or more second-line therapies. For example, the doses of agents listed in the Table provided above may be reduced by about 50%, or about 40%, or about 30%, or about 25% in the context of the combination and the/or the frequency of dosing may be decreased to be half as often, or a third as often or may be reduced from, for example, daily to every other day or weekly, every other day to weekly or bi-weekly, weekly to bi-weekly or monthly, etc. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the chimeric protein or the chimeric protein complex increases patient adherence by allowing for more convenient treatment regimens. Further, some DMTs have a suggested lifetime dose limitation e.g. for mitoxantrone, the lifetime cumulative dose should be strictly limited to 140 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, or 2 to 3 years of therapy. In some embodiments, supplementation with the chimeric protein or the chimeric protein complex preserves patient's access to mitoxantrone by allowing for lower or less frequent dosing with this DMT.</p><p id="p-0572" num="0600">In some embodiments, the patient is a naive patient, who has not received treatment with one or more DMTs, and the chimeric protein or the chimeric protein complex is used to buffer the side effects of a second-line therapy. Accordingly, the naive patient is able to benefit from the long-term benefits of a second-line therapy at disease outset. In some embodiments, the chimeric protein or the chimeric protein complex is used as an entry therapy that precedes the use of a second-line therapy. For example, the chimeric protein or the chimeric protein complex may be administered for an initial treatment period of about 3 months to stabilize disease and then the patient may be transitioned to a maintenance therapy of a second line agent.</p><p id="p-0573" num="0601">It is generally believed that naive patients are more likely to respond to therapy as compared to patients that have received, and perhaps failed one or more DMT. In some embodiments, the chimeric protein or the chimeric protein complex finds use in patients that have received, and perhaps failed one or more DMT. For example, in some embodiments, the chimeric protein or the chimeric protein complex increases the therapeutic effect in patients that have received, and perhaps failed one or more DMT and may allow these patients to respond like naive patients.</p><p id="p-0574" num="0602">In some embodiments, the patient has received or is receiving treatment with one or more DMTs and is not responding well. For example, the patient may be refractory or poorly responsive to one or more DMTs. In some embodiments, the patient is refractory, or poorly responsive to one or more of teriflunomide (AUBAGIO (GENZYME)); interferon beta-1a (AVONEX (BIOGEN IDEC); interferon beta-1b (BETASERON (BAYER HEALTHCARE PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.); glatiramer acetate (COPAXONE (TEVA NEUROSCIENCE); interferon beta-1b (EXTAVIA (NOVARTIS PHARMACEUTICALS CORP.); fingolimod (GILENYA (NOVARTIS PHARMACEUTICALS CORP.); alemtuzumab (LEMTRADA (GENZYME); mitoxantrone (NOVANTRONE (EMD SERONO); pegylated interferon beta-1a (PLEGRIDY (BIOGEN IDEC); interferon beta-1a (REBIF (EMD SERONO, INC.); dimethyl fumarate (BG-12) (TECFIDERA (BIOGEN IDEC); and natalizumab (TYSABRI (BIOGEN IDEC). In some embodiments, the one or more disclosed binding agent results in a therapeutic benefit of one or more DMTs in the patient and therefore reduces or eliminates the non-responsiveness to the DMT. For instance, this may spare the patient therapy with one or more DMTs at a higher dosing or frequency.</p><p id="p-0575" num="0603">In patients with more aggressive disease, one approach is an induction treatment model, where a therapy with strong efficacy but strong safety concerns would be given first, followed by a maintenance therapy. An example of such a model might include initial treatment with alemtuzumab, followed by IFN-&#x3b2;, GA, or BG-12. In some embodiments, the one or more disclosed binding agent is used to prevent the need to switch therapies for maintenance. In some embodiments, the one or more disclosed binding agent is used to as maintenance therapy to one or more DMTs, including second line therapies. In some embodiments, the one or more disclosed binding agent is used to as first therapy in an induction, followed by another DMT as a maintenance therapy&#x2014;such as, for example, a first line therapy.</p><p id="p-0576" num="0604">In some embodiments, the one or more disclosed binding agent may be administered for an initial treatment period of about 3 months to stabilize disease and then the patient may be transitioned to a maintenance therapy of a first line agent.</p><p id="p-0577" num="0605">In various embodiments, the one or more disclosed binding agent is used to reduce one or more side effects of a DMT, including without limitation any agent disclosed herein. For example, the one or more disclosed binding agent may be used in a regimen that allows dose sparing for one or more DMTs and therefore results in fewer side effects. For example, in some embodiments, the one or more disclosed binding agent may reduce one or more side effects of AUBAGIO or related agents, which may include hair thinning, diarrhea, flu, nausea, abnormal liver tests and unusual numbness or tingling in the hands or feet (paresthesias), levels of white blood cells, which can increase the risk of infections; increase in blood pressure; and severe liver damage. In some embodiments, the one or more disclosed binding agent may reduce one or more side effects of AVONEX or related agents which include flu-like symptoms following injection, depression, mild anemia, liver abnormalities, allergic reactions, and heart problems. In some embodiments, the one or more disclosed binding agent may reduce one or more side effects of BETASERON or related agents which include flu-like symptoms following injection, injection site reactions, allergic reactions, depression, liver abnormalities, and low white blood cell counts. In some embodiments, the one or more disclosed binding agent may reduce one or more side effects of COPAXONE or related agents which include injection site reactions, vasodilation (dilation of blood vessels); chest pain; a reaction immediately after injection, which includes anxiety, chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, and flushing. In some embodiments, the one or more disclosed binding agent may reduce one or more side effects of EXTAVIA or related agents which include flu-like symptoms following injection, injection site reactions, allergic reactions, depression, liver abnormalities, and low white blood cell counts. In some embodiments, the one or more disclosed binding agent may reduce one or more side effects of GILENYA or related agents which include headache, flu, diarrhea, back pain, liver enzyme elevations, cough, slowed heart rate following first dose, infections, and swelling in the eye. In some embodiments, the one or more disclosed binding agent may reduce one or more side effects of LEMTRADA or related agents which include rash, headache, fever, nasal congestion, nausea, urinary tract infection, fatigue, insomnia, upper respiratory tract infection, hives, itching, thyroid gland disorders, fungal Infection, pain in joints, extremities and back, diarrhea, vomiting, flushing, and infusion reactions (including nausea, hives, itching, insomnia, chills, flushing, fatigue, shortness of breath, changes in the sense of taste, indigestion, dizziness, pain). In some embodiments, the one or more disclosed binding agent may reduce one or more side effects of NOVANTRONE or related agents which include blue-green urine 24 hours after administration; infections, bone marrow suppression (fatigue, bruising, low blood cell counts), nausea, hair thinning, bladder infections, mouth sores, and serious liver and heart damage. In some embodiments, the one or more disclosed binding agent may reduce one or more side effects of PLEGRIDY or related agents which include flu-like symptoms following injection, injection site reactions, depression, mild anemia, liver abnormalities, allergic reactions, and heart problems. In some embodiments, the one or more disclosed binding agent may reduce one or more side effects of REBIF or related agents which include flu-like symptoms following injection, injection site reactions, liver abnormalities, depression, allergic reactions, and low red or white blood cell counts. In some embodiments, one or more disclosed binding agent may reduce one or more side effects of TECFIDERA or related agents which include flushing (sensation of heat or itching and a blush on the skin), gastrointestinal issues (nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain), rash, protein in the urine, elevated liver enzymes; and reduction in blood lymphocyte (white blood cell) counts. In some embodiments, the one or more disclosed binding agent may reduce one or more side effects of TYSABRI or related agents which include headache, fatigue, urinary tract infections, depression, respiratory tract infections, joint pain, upset stomach, abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, vaginitis, pain in the arms or legs, rash, allergic or hypersensitivity reactions within two hours of infusion (dizziness, fever, rash, itching, nausea, flushing, low blood pressure, difficulty breathing, chest pain).</p><p id="p-0578" num="0606">In some embodiments, the present invention relates to combination therapy with one or more chimeric agents described in WO 2013/10779, WO 2015/007536, WO 2015/007520, WO 2015/007542, and WO 2015/007903, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties.</p><p id="p-0579" num="0607">In some embodiments, the chimeric protein or the chimeric protein complex described herein, include derivatives that are modified, i.e., by the covalent attachment of any type of molecule to the composition such that covalent attachment does not prevent the activity of the composition.

PD-L1 VHHs used here are named 2LIG99 (SEQ ID NO: 1) and 2LIG189 (SEQ ID NO: 26).</p><heading id="h-0023" level="1">Example 1: First Round of Mutagenesis for 2LIG99 VHH</heading><p id="p-0629" num="0657">The VHH 2LIG99 (SEQ ID NO: 1) contains the sequence motif DG in CDR2 which has a high risk for isomerization. To circumvent this problem the residues D54 and G55 were individually randomly mutagenized. For each D54 and G55, 48 clones were randomly picked, sequenced, and the VHH purified from TES extracts based on the C-terminal His-tag and using HisPur Cobalt Spin Plates (ThermoFisher) according to the manufacturer's guidelines.</p><p id="p-0630" num="0658">Affinities of purified VHH variants were screened using the bio-layer interferometry technology on an Octet Red 96 instrument (ForteBio). In brief, recombinant PD-L1 extracellular domain fused to the mouse IgG1 Fc domain (SinoBiologicals) was immobilized on anti-murine IgG quantitation (AMQ) biosensors (ForteBio). Loaded sensors were incubated with a single concentration of PD-L1 VHH variant, association and dissociation monitored and kinetic parameters were calculated using the Octet Data Analysis software v10 (ForteBio). Based on the analysis of the dissociation kinetics the mutations D54G, D54K, D54T and G55R were selected for further mutagenesis of the 2LIG99 VHH.</p><p id="p-0631" num="0659">For the humanization of 2LIG99, the sequence was aligned with the human VH3-23_JH5 sequence and a construct designed with a series of mutations in the framework regions (Q1D_Q5V_A14P_T74S_K86R_Q110; 2LIG99_OPT1; SEQ ID NO: 8). An aspartic acid at position 1 was included to avoid the risk of pyroglutamate formation. An additional series of variants was designed by combining with individual mutation of T23A, A63V, K76N, 597Y, or a combination of these latter (SEQ ID NO: 9-13). In addition, for the DG isomerization site in CDR2, mutations D54G, D54K, D54T or G55R were evaluated again (SEQ ID NO: 14-17). These variants (with a C-terminal His-tag) were cloned in the pHEN6C vector for periplasmic expression in <i>E. coli </i>WK6 cells. After overnight expression upon IPTG induction, cells were pelleted, and proteins purified from the periplasmic extracts using the HisPur Cobalt Spin Plates (ThermoFisher) according to the manufacturer's guidelines.</p><p id="p-0632" num="0660">Affinities of resulting variants were measured using the bio-layer interferometry technology on an Octet Red 96 instrument (ForteBio).

Results summarized in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrate that humanization mutations can result in a loss of affinity especially for SEQ ID NOs: 9 and 13 containing the mutation T23A.</p><heading id="h-0024" level="1">Example 2: Combination of Mutations for 2LIG99 VHH</heading><p id="p-0633" num="0661">Based on the affinity in Octet of the first series of 2LIG99 variants, we selected the OPT1 humanization variant (with mutations Q1D_Q5V_A14P_T74S_K86R_Q110) and combined these with the variations A63V, K76N, and S79Y resulting in SEQ ID Nos: 18-25. The isomerization motif in all these variants was removed by the D54G mutation. Variants were produced as described above and affinity measured on an Octet instrument using the recombinant PD-L1-mouse Fc protein. Data in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrate that it is possible to humanize and remove the isomerization motif in the 2LIG99 sequence without losing affinity or even improving affinity in case of SEQ ID Nos: 20, 21, and 24 indicating the surprisingly beneficial effect of the presence of the mutation K76N and/or S79Y in the framework region.</p><p id="p-0634" num="0662">We next evaluated the effect of the sequence variations on ability to interfere with the PD-L1/PD-1 interaction. To testis, we have generated a bi-valent AFN based on the extracellular portion of PD-L1 (see SEQ ID Nos: 169 and 170. When applied on HL116 cells, a HT1080 derived clone stably transfected with the firefly luciferase gene controlled by the IFN-inducible 6-16 promoter, this AFN is more active on cells expressing PD-1 compared to parental cells. This bioassay was used to test the neutralizing capacity of the 2LIG99 variants. In brief, a sub-optimal PD-L1 AFN concentration (i.e. 1 &#x3bc;g/ml) was pre-incubated with a serial dilution of 2LIG99 variants. Half an hour later, the combination of AFN and VHH was added to 20.000 HL116-PD-1 cells in a 96-well and cells were further incubated for 6 hours. Luciferase was measured and plotted in function of the VHH concentration. Due to the concentration of PD-L1 AFN needed and the relative high affinity and neutralization of the 2LIG99 VHH the sensitivity of the assay does not allow to discriminate variants with improved neutralization. Nevertheless, the data confirm that the variants containing the mutation K76N and/or S79Y (also in combination with D54G and or A63V) are potently neutralizing the PD-L1/PD-1 interaction as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p><heading id="h-0025" level="1">Example 3: Mutagenesis for 2LIG189</heading><p id="p-0635" num="0663">For the humanization of 2LIG189 (SEQ ID NO: 26) the sequence was aligned with the human VH3-23_JH5 sequence and a construct designed with a series of mutations in the framework regions (Q1D_Q5V_A14P_A74S_K86R_Q109L; 2LIG189_OPT1; SEQ ID NO: 33). The aspartic acid at position 1 was included to avoid the risk of pyroglutamate formation. An additional series of variants was designed by combining with mutation of M77T and/or M78V (SEQ ID NOS: 34-36). The N32 and D33 residues in the deamidation motif in CDR1 were mutated separately, resulting in 22 variants (SEQ ID NOs: 37-58). M97, at the border of CDR3, possibly sensitive to oxidation was mutated to E, F, H, I, L, Q, R, V, or Y (SEQ ID NOs: 59-67). Resulting mutants were purified and affinities measured as described in Example 1. Results are summarized in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.

Affinities (summarized in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>) and neutralization potency (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>) were measured as described above. Both datasets illustrate that some variants with both the deamidation and oxidation risk site removed (especially SEQ ID NO: 72 and 73) increase both affinity (40- and 10-fold respectively) and neutralization of the PD-L1/PD-1 interaction.</p><heading id="h-0027" level="1">Example 5: Selection of Variant 2LIG99 and 2LIG189 VHH</heading><p id="p-0637" num="0665">In order to generate PD-L1 targeted AcTakines the following variants are selected.</p><p id="p-0638" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00012" num="00012"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" tabstyle="monospace"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>2LIG189;&#x2003;SEQ&#x2003;ID&#x2003;NO:&#x2003;74:</entry></row><row><entry>Q1D_Q5V_A14P_D33H_A62S_A74S_M77T_M78V_S79Y_K86R_</entry></row><row><entry>M97V_Q109L</entry></row><row><entry>DVQLVESGGGLVQPGGSLRLSCAASGKIFSGNHMGWYRQAPGKQRELVGI</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>ITSGGITDYADSVKGRFTISRDNSKNTVYLQMNSLRPEDTAVYYCNVRDR</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>TIWWGQGTLVTVSS</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>2LIG99;&#x2003;SEQ&#x2003;ID&#x2003;NO:&#x2003;24:</entry></row><row><entry>Q1D_Q5V_A14P_D54G_T74S_K76N_S79Y_K86R_Q110L</entry></row><row><entry>DVQLVESGGGLVQPGGSLRLSCTASGTIFSINRMDWFRQAPGKQRELVAL</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>ITSGGTPAYADSAKGRFTISRDNSKNTVYLQMNSLRPEDTAVYYCHVSSG</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>VYNYWGQGTLVTVSS</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><heading id="h-0028" level="1">Example 6: PD-L1 Targeted AFNs Based on Selected 2LIG99 and 2LIG189 VHH Variants</heading><p id="p-0639" num="0666">In this example, twelve PD-L1 targeted AFNs were generated and evaluated.

Here, the ability of the PD-L1 VHH AFNs to interfere with the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction was compared in a commercial AlphaLisa set-up according to the manufacturer's instructions (cat AL356; PerkinElmer). In brief, a biotinylated PD-1 binds to the Streptavidin-coated Alpha donor beads, while His-tagged PD-L1 is captured by anti-His AlphaLISA acceptor beads. When PD-L1 binding to PD-1 happens, donor beads and acceptor beads come into close proximity. The excitation of the donor beads provokes the release of singlet oxygen molecules that triggers a cascade of energy transfer in the acceptor beads, resulting in a sharp peak of light emission at 615 nm. To evaluate neutralization of the interaction, the acceptor beads were pre-incubated with a serial dilution of PD-L1 VHH AFN before adding the donor beads. Data in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b></figref> clearly illustrate that all tested PD-L1 AFNs inhibited the interaction to the same extent (IC50 values between 350 and 400 pM) and that this neutralization was comparable to the that of the anti-PD-L1 Ab atezoluzimab.</p><heading id="h-0033" level="2">Neutralization of the CD80/PD-L1 Interaction</heading><p id="p-0646" num="0687">A second known ligand for PD-L1 is cluster of differentiation 80 (CD80), also called B7-1.
