According to presence or absence of external acoustic stimuli, OAEs can be divided into two categories: Spontaneous Otoacoustic Emissions (SOAEs) and Evoked Otoacoustic Emissions (EOAEs). EOAEs are divided into three classes in terms of different evoked acoustic stimuli, i.e., Transient-Evoked Otoacoustic Emissions (TEOAEs), Distortion-Product Otoacoustic Emissions (DPOAEs) and Stimulus-Frequency Otoacoustic Emissions (SFOAEs).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Since a pure-tone hearing threshold test currently used in clinical practice is a kind of behavioral test, subjective feedback from a subject is required during the test, but it is greatly affected by subjective factors such as attention and degree of cooperation. Especially for those who are lack of cooperation (e.g., infants and young children), this detection method that requires the subjective feedback from the subject is not applicable. The SFOAEs refers to active emission of a weak sound signal at the same frequency as stimulus sound after the inner ear cochlea is subjected to stimulation of a single-frequency signal. SFOAEs can reflect active mechanism of cochlear outer hair cells so as to further reflect the function of the peripheral auditory system. Since the frequency of SFOAEs is exactly the same as that of the stimulus sound, SFOAEs have very good frequency specificity. Besides, since SFOAEs can be detected in moderately and severely deaf ears in the case that moderate or high stimulation intensity is applied, SFOAEs have a potential to objectively and quantitatively reflect a hearing threshold, and is especially suitable for hearing detection of those being lack of cooperation.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the prior art, a portable full-featured otoacoustic emission detection system, specifically, a portable otoacoustic emission detection system based on a USB multimedia sound card has been disclosed, which realizes full-featured quantitative detection and analysis on signals of TEOAEs and DPOAEs. However, it neither involves detection of input-output (I/O) function of SFOAEs, nor a detection technology and method of using the I/O function of SFOAEs for hearing threshold estimation and hearing state screening of the auditory system. Further, an invention titled a Stimulus-Frequency Otoacoustic Emissions tuning curve detection and calibration system is also disclosed in the prior art, which only provides detection technology regarding a detection method and calibration system of SFOAEs' suppression tuning curve, but fails to involve a detection technology and method for hearing threshold estimation by using the I/O function of SFOAEs. Further disclosed in the prior art is an auditory sensitivity detection system based on SFOAEs, which provides detection of intensity and sensitivity by using waveform shapes of respective points of SFOAEs and detection of intensity and sensitivity by using waveform shapes of respective points of SFOAEs' suppression tuning curve, but fails to involve methods using, for example, an I/O function curve of SFOAEs.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">To sum up, some of the existing technologies detect no hearing thresholds, while the other detect hearing thresholds without using complete information of the I/O output function of SFOAEs, as a result of which accuracy of hearing threshold detection results are not high.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In view of the above problems, an objective of the present disclosure is to provide a hearing threshold or hearing state detection system and method capable of extracting a hearing threshold or a hearing state at a set frequency point in a rapidly and accurate manner.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to achieve the above objective, the present disclosure adopts the following technical schemes.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a first aspect, the present disclosure provides a hearing threshold and/or hearing state detection system, comprising:</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">an acquisition and transmission system, configured to transmit stimulation signals and acquire an ear canal signal;
