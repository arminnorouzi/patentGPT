Its main chain contains hydrolyzable ester bonds. The positively charged tertiary amine can electrostatically interact with the negatively charged nucleic acid to form a nanocomposite. Among them, the cationic polymer can effectively condense nucleic acid molecules through its own positive charge and the negative charge of the nucleic acid molecule through electrostatic interaction. At the same time, it mainly uses the excess positive charge on the surface of the polymer to bind to the cell membrane to promote endocytosis, so it can be used for nucleic acid Delivery; research has found that compared with other structures, the polymer structure of the present invention can significantly enhance the interaction between the polymer and the nucleic acid molecule, improve the gene condensation ability, and at the same time can increase cell uptake by enhancing the interaction with the cell membrane.

As well as high gene transfection ability, it has good application prospects in nucleic acid drug delivery systems.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00001" cdx-file="US20230000992A1-20230105-C00001.CDX" mol-file="US20230000992A1-20230105-C00001.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00002" cdx-file="US20230000992A1-20230105-C00002.CDX" mol-file="US20230000992A1-20230105-C00002.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00003" cdx-file="US20230000992A1-20230105-C00003.CDX" mol-file="US20230000992A1-20230105-C00003.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00004" cdx-file="US20230000992A1-20230105-C00004.CDX" mol-file="US20230000992A1-20230105-C00004.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00005" cdx-file="US20230000992A1-20230105-C00005.CDX" mol-file="US20230000992A1-20230105-C00005.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00006" cdx-file="US20230000992A1-20230105-C00006.CDX" mol-file="US20230000992A1-20230105-C00006.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00007" cdx-file="US20230000992A1-20230105-C00007.CDX" mol-file="US20230000992A1-20230105-C00007.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00008" cdx-file="US20230000992A1-20230105-C00008.CDX" mol-file="US20230000992A1-20230105-C00008.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00009" cdx-file="US20230000992A1-20230105-C00009.CDX" mol-file="US20230000992A1-20230105-C00009.MOL"/><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
