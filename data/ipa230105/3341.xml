Technical Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a tank holding device.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">For example, there is known a tank holding device described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2016-070467 (JP 2016-070467 A). In this tank holding device, a tank is placed in a support member having a recess for storing the tank, and is held by tightening the tank with bands from a side opposite to the support member for the tank. In this tank holding device, one end of the band is fixed to the support member with a bolt. The other end of the band is fixed to the support member while being urged by a coil spring. The band receives an urging force of the coil spring and is pressed against the outer peripheral surface of the tank.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Recently, studies have been conducted to hold a tank by using a band having a leaf spring structure instead of the coil spring in order to reduce the size of the tank holding device. When holding the tank by using the band having the leaf spring structure, however, a gap is present between the band and the tank. When a solid foreign substance such as a pebble enters the gap, the stroke of the leaf spring (that is, deformation of the leaf spring) may be hindered. When a liquid foreign substance such as muddy water enters the gap, dry mud or icy mud may also hinder the stroke of the leaf spring. To suppress the entry of the foreign substance into the gap, for example, the entire band may be covered with a rubber cover. When the entire band is covered with the rubber cover, however, a large amount of rubber is required, which may lead to an increase in cost.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present disclosure provides a tank holding device capable of suppressing entry of a foreign substance into a gap between a band and a tank.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A tank holding device according to one aspect of the present disclosure includes a band configured to tighten a tank. The band includes a band-shaped base portion extending along an outer circumference of the tank, and a plurality of pressing portions projecting from both sides of the base portion in a width direction orthogonal to a longitudinal direction of the base portion and configured to apply a pressing force to an outer peripheral surface of the tank by elastically deforming in abutment against the outer peripheral surface of the tank. At least an elastic member is provided in a gap between the band and the tank to fill the gap.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the tank holding device according to the one aspect of the present disclosure, the elastic member is provided in the gap between the band and the tank to fill the gap. The elastic member can be used to suppress the entry of the foreign substance into the gap between the band and the tank. Since the elastic member fills the gap, it is possible to suppress influence of arrangement of the elastic member on the elastic deformation of the pressing portions.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the tank holding device according to the present disclosure, the elastic member may be a closed cell foam. The closed cell foam has a property that liquid hardly enters the inside. Therefore, the closed cell foam can suppress not only a solid foreign substance but also a liquid foreign substance such as muddy water from entering the gap between the band and the tank.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the tank holding device according to the present disclosure, the elastic member may be made of urethane. Urethane is relatively inexpensive and has high stretchability. By using urethane for the elastic member, it is possible to suppress the entry of the foreign substance into the gap between the band and the tank. By using urethane for the elastic member, it is possible to suppress the influence of the arrangement of the elastic member on the elastic deformation of the pressing portions. By using urethane for the elastic member, it is possible to suppress an increase in cost along with the arrangement of the elastic member.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the tank holding device according to the present disclosure, the elastic member may be configured to limit deformation of the pressing portions to a specified amount. Even if a large stress is applied to the band due to vibration, impact, or the like, the deformation of the pressing portions to the specified amount can be limited by using the elastic member. Thus, it is possible to suppress irreversible deformation of the band.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the tank holding device according to the present disclosure, a metal member or a hard resin member may be provided inside the elastic member. Thus, the deformation of the pressing portions to the specified amount can be limited by using the metal member or the hard resin member provided inside the elastic member. Even if a large stress is applied to the band due to vibration, impact, or the like, the deformation of the pressing portions to the specified amount can be limited by using the elastic member. Thus, it is possible to suppress the irreversible deformation of the band.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the tank holding device according to the present disclosure, a slide plate may be interposed between each of the pressing portions and the outer peripheral surface of the tank.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the tank holding device according to the present disclosure, the slide plate may include a body extending along the outer peripheral surface of the tank, and a left standing portion and a right standing portion standing at both ends of the body in the width direction orthogonal to the longitudinal direction.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to the present disclosure, it is possible to suppress the entry of the foreign substance into the gap between the band and the tank.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Features, advantages, and technical and industrial significance of exemplary embodiments of the disclosure will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which like signs denote like elements, and wherein:</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a plan showing a tank holding device according to a first embodiment;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a sectional view taken along a line II-II in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a sectional view taken along a line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an enlarged view showing a portion C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a partial perspective view showing a band and an elastic member;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a sectional view taken along a line VI-VI in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is an exploded perspective view showing the band and the elastic member;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a sectional view showing a holding member of a tank holding device according to a third embodiment; and</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a sectional view showing a holding member of a tank holding device according to a fourth embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Hereinafter, tank holding devices according to embodiments of the present disclosure will be described with reference to the drawings.

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>3</b></figref>, a tank held by the tank holding device is also shown to facilitate understanding of the structure of the tank holding device. A tank holding device <b>10</b> of the first embodiment is a device for holding, for example, a hydrogen tank <b>1</b> mounted on a fuel cell electric vehicle (not shown) and fixing the hydrogen tank <b>1</b> to the body of the fuel cell electric vehicle. Prior to description of the tank holding device <b>10</b>, the structure of the hydrogen tank <b>1</b> will briefly be described.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">Hydrogen Tank</heading><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the hydrogen tank <b>1</b> is a substantially cylindrical container with both ends rounded in a dome shape. The hydrogen tank <b>1</b> includes a liner <b>2</b> having a storage space for storing high-pressure hydrogen, and a reinforcing layer <b>4</b> provided in close contact with the outer peripheral surface of the liner <b>2</b>. The liner <b>2</b> includes a cylindrical body <b>2</b><i>a </i>and substantially hemispherical domes <b>2</b><i>b </i>provided at both right and left ends of the body <b>2</b><i>a. </i>Openings are formed at the top of the two domes <b>2</b><i>b, </i>and metal caps <b>3</b> are internally inserted into these openings.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The liner <b>2</b> is made of, for example, a resin material having a gas barrier property against hydrogen gas. Examples of the resin material include thermoplastic resins such as polyamide, polyethylene, ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer resin (EVOH), and polyester, and thermosetting resins such as epoxy. The cap <b>3</b> is made of a metal material such as aluminum. A member such as a valve is attached to the cap <b>3</b>. The reinforcing layer <b>4</b> is formed, for example, such that fibers impregnated with a thermosetting resin are wound around the outer peripheral surface of the liner <b>2</b> by a plurality of turns. The fiber is made of a composite material in which, for example, carbon fiber, glass fiber, or aramid fiber is put in plastic to improve the strength.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The hydrogen tank <b>1</b> having such a structure is held by the tank holding device <b>10</b> at two points in a direction of an axis L of the hydrogen tank <b>1</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>). The number of points where the hydrogen tank <b>1</b> is held by the tank holding device <b>10</b> is not limited to two, and may be, for example, three or more. When the tank holding device <b>10</b> and a neck mount member for fixing each cap <b>3</b> are used in combination, the hydrogen tank <b>1</b> may be held by the tank holding device <b>10</b> only at one point.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">Tank Holding Device</heading><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The tank holding device <b>10</b> includes a pair of upper and lower holding members (first holding member <b>11</b><i>a </i>and second holding member <b>11</b><i>b</i>), and holds the hydrogen tank <b>1</b> by using these holding members.

In this state, the ends of the first holding member <b>11</b><i>a </i>and the second holding member <b>11</b><i>b </i>are fastened to each other by fastening members <b>30</b>. By tightening the hydrogen tank <b>1</b> between the first holding member <b>11</b><i>a </i>and the second holding member <b>11</b><i>b </i>in this way, the tank holding device <b>10</b> holds the hydrogen tank <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The first holding member <b>11</b><i>a </i>and the second holding member <b>11</b><i>b </i>have the same structure.

The pressing portion <b>15</b> can apply a pressing force to the outer peripheral surface of the hydrogen tank <b>1</b> by elastically deforming in abutment against the outer peripheral surface of the hydrogen tank <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Specifically, the pressing portions <b>15</b> arranged on the right and left sides of the base portion <b>14</b> are bent obliquely downward from the base portion <b>14</b> (that is, toward the hydrogen tank <b>1</b>).

The ridge portions <b>17</b> are formed by bending the base portion <b>14</b> little by little at predetermined intervals in conformity with the curvature of the outer peripheral surface of the hydrogen tank <b>1</b>.

The closed cell urethane is relatively inexpensive and has high stretchability.
