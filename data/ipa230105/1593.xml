level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a personal care device, in particular a hair removal device such as an electric shaver, comprising a working head for effecting a personal care treatment to a body surface, a handle for moving the working head along the body surface, and an adjustment device for adjusting a mechanical setting and/or a mechanical function of the working head and/or of a part thereof.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Personal care devices are widely used to apply different types of personal care treatments to users, wherein such personal care devices may include hair removal devices such as epilators, shavers or razors, which may be electric or manual and/or wet or dry, or beard trimmers. Furthermore, other personal care devices having such working heads may include dental care appliances such as electric or manual tooth brushes, interdental cleaners or gum massaging devices, or skin treatment devices such as massaging devices or vibrators.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">So as to improve the efficiency and work result of the personal care treatment, the working head and/or parts thereof such as the cutting tools, shaving blades or cartridges may be supported movably relative to the handle and/or relative to other components of the working head so as to allow for a better adaption to the skin contour. For example, the entire working head may pivot and/or swivel and/or dive about/along various axes relative to the handle. It also has been suggested to allow for additional pivoting and/or swiveling and/or diving movements of the cutter cartridges relative to each other and/or relative to a working head frame so as to further enhance contour adaption. Similar movability is known for other personal care devices.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Depending on the personal preferences of a user and depending on the working/operation scenario, however, it may be desired to modify the mechanical setting and/or the mechanical function of the working head such as restricting the pivoting/swiveling range or increasing/decreasing stiffness. For example, prior art reference EP 3 546 153 A1 discloses an electric shaver having a plurality of sensors for detecting the user's behavior so as to differentiate between natural behavior and non-natural behavior, wherein, in response to such detection of the user's behavior, the mechanical setting of the working head is adjusted to better fit the shaver's operational behavior to the user's preferences.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Such adaption of the mechanical setting in response to detected user patterns is of course helpful to improving work results but may be detrimental to other goals such as safety, wear and tear of the personal care device, or energy efficiency.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is an objective underlying the present invention to provide for an improved personal care device, avoiding at least one of the disadvantages of the prior art and/or further developing the existing solutions.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A more particular objective underlying the invention is to provide for an improved personal care device having an increased resiliency and an extended life cycle.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A further objective underlying the invention is an improved endurance of structural components of the personal care device such as the working head or the drive unit or other mechanical actuating units.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In order to achieve at least one of the aforementioned objectives, it is suggested to make use of the adjustability of the mechanical setting and/or mechanical function of the working head and the parts thereof not only for adjusting the working treatment to the user's preferences and user behavior, but to follow the personal care device's needs when adjusting such mechanical settings and/or mechanical functions. More particularly, the mechanical setting and/or mechanical function of the working head and/or parts thereof and/or an electronic or motor setting are modified to protect the personal care device from damages and/or premature wear and tear.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to an aspect, the personal care device may include a hazard determination device for determining hazards for the personal care device, wherein the adjustment device may be configured to adjust the working head and/or a part thereof into a save mechanical setting and/or save mechanical function in response to a hazard signal from the hazard determination device.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">When a hazardous situation is determined, the adjustment device is automatically activated and/or deactivated and/or controlled to achieve a protective configuration of the mechanical setting and/or mechanical function of the working head.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">For example, the hazard determination device may include a drop or freefall determination module for determining a drop or freefall of the personal care device onto the floor or other surfaces which, when hitting them, would likely damage the personal care device.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In addition or in the alternative, the hazard determination device may be configured to issue the hazard signal when the personal care device is subject to unusually high or unusually low temperatures and/or one of the components of the personal care device becomes unusually hot and/or unusually cold.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">These and other advantages become more apparent from the following description giving reference to a drawing and possible examples.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>: a side view of a personal care device in terms of an electric shaver comprising a handle and a shaver head pivotably connected thereto, wherein the allowed pivoting or swiveling range of the shaver head can be adjusted and restricted, respectively.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to an aspect, the adjustability of the mechanical setting and/or mechanical function of the working head and/or a part thereof is used for safeguarding the working head and/or the entire personal care device against risky scenarios and protecting the personal care device against damages from external impacts and/or operational hazards. The personal care device may include a hazard determination device for automatically determining hazards for the personal care device, wherein the adjustment device may be configured to adjust the working head and/or a part thereof into a save mechanical setting and/or a safe mechanical function in response to a hazard signal from the hazard determination device indicative of a scenario posing a risk to the intactness and/or structural integrity of the device. When a hazardous situation is determined, the adjustment device is automatically brought into a protective configuration and the working head is automatically adjusted into a safeguarding mechanical setting and/or safeguarding mechanical function to protect the working head and/or a part of the personal care device against damages.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">So as to bring the working head into such safeguarding mechanical setting and/or function, the adjustment device may be activated or deactivated and/or controlled in a specific way, depending on the structure and functioning of the adjustment device. For example, when the adjustment device is configured to provide for a safeguarding mechanical setting in its non-operative state, the adjustment device may be deactivated in response to a hazard signal. Such deactivation may be effected during use of the personal care device, i.e. when the personal care device is switched on, and/or despite a request for a different setting by the user which may be overruled in response to the hazard signal. On the other hand, when the adjustment device needs to be energized to provide for a safeguarding setting, it may be activated. More generally, the adjustment device is controlled to provide for a safeguarding setting and/or safeguarding function upon receipt of a hazard signal from the hazard determination device.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The adjustment device may adjust at least one working parameter of the personal care device and/or a setting thereof may be changed so as to provide for a safeguard mechanical setting and/or mechanical function in response to a hazard signal. Such mechanical settings or functions may include the movability of the working head relative to the handle and/or the movability of a part of the working head relative to a working head base part or other elements of the working head. In addition or in the alternative, the mechanical setting and/or function to be influenced by the adjustment device, may include the operation of one or more working tools such as a long hair cutter or short hair cutter or groups thereof, and/or the position of a working tool relative to other tools, and/or the operation of a lubricant applicator for applying a lubricant to the body portion to be treated.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">More particularly, the personal care device may have a pivotable suspension of its working head to allow for pivoting and/or swiveling of the working head relative to the handle about at least one axis, wherein the adjustment mechanism may be configured to adjust the pivoting stiffness of the working head's suspension and/or the resistance and/or unwillingness of the working head against pivoting and/or swiveling movements so as to give the personal care device a less contour adaptable handling on the one hand and a more comfortable, smoother handling on the other hand. More particularly, the adjustment mechanism may vary the torque and/or force necessary to pivot the working head relative to the handle and/or to achieve a certain pivot angle of the working head variating from a neutral position thereof.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In a similar way, one or more elements of the working head such as a hair cutter cartridge may be pivotably suspended by the working head in addition or in the alternative to the pivotable suspension of the entire working head relative to the handle. The adjustment mechanism may vary the pivoting stiffness of such pivotable element and/or its resistance and/or unwillingness against pivoting movements.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">So as to achieve a safeguarding setting for such pivotably suspended working head and/or pivotable supported working head element, the adjustment mechanism may be controlled, for example deactivated in response to a hazard signal from the hazard determination device so as to provide for a reduced pivoting stiffness and/or an increased willingness to pivot.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the alternative or in addition to a pivotable suspension, the working head and/or an element thereof such as a cutter cartridge may be supported relative to the handle and/or relative to other elements of the working head so that the working head may dive relative to the handle and/or the working head element may dive relative to other working head elements along an axis substantially perpendicular to a skin contact contour of the working head and/or perpendicular to the skin surface to be treated. For such diving movement, the adjustment device may be configured to modify the diving stiffness and/or the resistance against diving movements. More particularly, the adjustment device may change the force necessary to make the working head and/or an element thereof dive along such axis and/or achieve a certain diving distance.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">When the working head is provided with such diving suspension, the adjustment device may be controlled, in particular deactivated so as to bring the diving suspension into a most resilient or most flexible configuration allowing for easy diving with minimum forces necessary, in response to a hazard signal.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the alternative or in addition to adjusting pivoting and/or diving stiffness, the adjustment device may be configured to adjust the angular pivoting range and/or diving range of the working head and/or of the movable element thereof to allow a larger or smaller maximum angular displacement and/or a larger or smaller maximum diving displacement. Such variable pivoting range and/or diving range may be used during operation to provide the personal care device with a lower contour adaptation ability to the user's skin contour when the maximum available pivoting angle or diving displacement is smaller or with higher swivel resistance whereas, on the other hand, a more comfortable, smoother feeling is provided with a larger maximum pivoting angle and/or a larger maximum diving range.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">So as to achieve a safeguarding mechanical setting, the adjustment device may be controlled, in particular deactivated so as to make the largest possible angular displacement and/or the largest possible diving displacement available to the working head and/or to the movable element thereof, when the hazard determination device issues the hazard signal.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">So as to protect not only the working head, but also the adjustment mechanism, another possible reaction of the hazard signal may include bringing the adjustment mechanism into a save harbor configuration. More particularly, an actuator of the adjustment mechanism may be brought into a save position when a hazard scenario is determined. For example, the adjustment mechanism or an adjustment element thereof such as the actuator may be decoupled from the working head and/or from the adjustable working head element. When the adjustment mechanism is decoupled from the working head and/or from the handle and/or from the adjustable working head element, no destructive forces can be transferred to the adjustment elements and as a consequence, they are protected.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In addition to such measures, a passive overload protection may be provided for the adjustment mechanism to achieve additional safety of the involved mechanical parts. For example, an overload clutch may be provided between the adjustment train between the actuator of the adjustment device and the working head and the working head element, respectively, wherein such overload clutch may open the mechanical connection and protect the previously mentioned adjustment elements. As soon as the overload event has gone, the connection may be reestablished and the overload clutch may close again and/or get into engagement.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In addition or in the alternative, it may help the personal care device to survive hazardous scenarios when the adjustment device is able to modify other operational parameters in response to a hazard signal from the hazard determination device. For example, a drive speed and/or a reciprocating frequency and/or amplitude may be reduced, and/or a trading intensity and/or cutting speed is reduced when a formal hazard is detected. More particularly, the adjustment device may be configured to change a mechanical function of at least one of the aforementioned operational parameters in response to a hazard signal from the hazard determination device.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Depending on the type of hazard and/or the intensity of the hazard detected, the adjustment device may provide for only one of the aforementioned measures or a combination thereof. For example, when the personal care device faces a hard hit onto the floor, the adjustment device may reduce mechanical stiffness of the working head's suspension. On the other hand, when the drive unit and/or the energy storage such as a battery faces harm due to very low or very hot environmental conditions, the driving speed of the working tool of the working head may be reduced. In the alternative, the driving speed may be reduced and pivoting/diving stiffness may be reduced (to reduce skin contract pressure and thus, driving resistance) when a thermal hazard to the drive unit is detected.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">So as to determine various types of hazard, the hazard determination means may include various sensors of different types, wherein, basically, it may be sufficient when the hazard determination device includes at least one sensor.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">More particularly, the hazard determination device may include a drop or freefall determination module for determining a drop or freefall of the personal care device and issuing the hazard signal upon determination of a drop of the personal care device.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In response to such determination of a freefall scenario, the adjustment device may provide for the most flexible mechanical setting of the working head, such as a reduced pivoting and/or diving stiffness and/or may provide for the maximum available pivoting range and/or diving displacement. When the personal care device hits the ground or any other surface at the end of such freefall scenario, it may help the personal care device to survive such hit onto the ground when the working head may pivot away and/or dive away to absorb at least some of the mechanical energy due to hitting the ground.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Said drop determination module may include at least one sensor or detector for detecting at least one parameter indicative of a drop or freefall. For example, the drop determination module may include an acceleration sensor for detecting a freefall of the personal care device. Such acceleration sensor may be mounted in or at least near to the center of gravity of the device. In a freefall scenario, such sensor is subject to an acceleration which is zero or at least close to zero in all three directions.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Irrespective of the mounting position of such sensor, it may be a multiaxial acceleration sensor able to detect accelerations in two or three axes. In the alternative or in addition to such multiaxial sensor, a plurality of sensors may be provided for detecting accelerations in different axes. For example, a first sensor may be provided to detect accelerations along two axes or directions perpendicular to each other and perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the handle. A second sensor may be provided for detecting accelerations along said longitudinal axis of the handle. On the other hand, so as to have a reduced number of parts and an easy manufacturing process, it may be advantageous to have only one sensor able to detect accelerations along three different axes perpendicular to each other.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The output signal of the at least one acceleration sensor may be fed to an evaluation unit which may be included in an electronic controller of the personal care device. Such evaluation or analysis unit may be configured to compare the acceleration signal to at least one threshold value or to threshold values for the different acceleration axes. More particularly, the evaluation unit may be configured to recognize an acceleration value, which is smaller than a predefined threshold in all three dimensions for a defined minimum time of duration. In such case, i.e. when the acceleration signal and/or acceleration value is smaller than the threshold in all three dimensions over a period longer than said time threshold, freefall is assumed or determined.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The limit for the acceleration values may be set to a threshold value, which is significantly lower than the gravitational acceleration. Irrespective of the threshold for the amount of acceleration, the time threshold in terms of the predefined minimum time duration or time interval may be set to a time value significantly shorter than the time the device needs to fall from a typical working height to the ground. For example, the time threshold may be set to a time value which the device needs to fall down onto the ground from a height of a quarter of a meter or from half a meter or from one meter.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In addition or in the alternative to such acceleration sensor, the freefall determination module may include a gyroscopic sensor and/or a gyrometer for determining rotatory acceleration and/or rotatory speed of the personal care device about one or more axis. Such gyroscopic sensor and/or gyrometer may be positioned close to the gravitational center of the personal care device. For example, such gyroscopic sensor and/or gyrometer may be combined with the aforementioned acceleration sensor to form a sensor unit, and/or may be accommodated within the housing of the acceleration sensor.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The sensor signal of such gyrosensor may be fed to an evaluation unit which may be the same evaluation unit as for the acceleration signal, wherein such evaluation unit may compare the rotatory angle and/or rotatory acceleration and/or rotatory speed with a threshold value, wherein the hazard signal may be triggered when such threshold is exceeded. In addition or in the alternative, the gyrosignal overtime may be analyzed to determine, for example, a trend of the gyrosignal. For example, when rotatory acceleration shows a steep increase, a hazard signal may be issued.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In particular, the evaluation unit may be configured to issue the hazard signal when rotations are observed that combine a rotation speed and a rotation angle and/or a rotatory acceleration of the personal care device beyond defined values, justifying the assumption of a freefall.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In addition or in the alternative, the evaluation unit may be configured to assume a freefall of the device and thus, issue a hazard signal for the adjustment device when the acceleration signal of the acceleration sensor and/or the gyrosignal of the gyrosensor shows suddenly a large value and/or a sudden, significant increase. Such suddenly large acceleration and/or suddenly large gyrosignal usually appears when the personal care device, on its way falling down, hits an object or a surface on its way to the ground.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">For example, a threshold value for such sudden large acceleration may be set significantly higher than the gravitational acceleration. For example, when the acceleration value exceeds 125% or 150% or 200% of the gravitational acceleration, it may be assumed that the personal care device hits onto the ground or an object on its way to the ground so the evaluation unit may issue the hazard signal to bring the working head and/or the adjustment device into a save mechanical setting and/or into a save harbor function.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In addition or in the alternative to the aforementioned freefall determination module, the hazard determination device may include a temperature sensor for determining temperature loads onto temperature sensitive elements of the personal care device. The temperature signal of such temperature sensor may be fed to an evaluation unit to determine, for example, very low environmental temperatures and/or very low temperatures of an element of the device and/or very high environmental temperatures and/or very high temperatures of one or more elements of the personal care device.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">For example, the temperature sensor may be configured for determining the temperature of a battery or accumulator and/or the temperature of a driving unit. A very low temperature of the battery, for example, may be detrimental to the battery performance so energy should be saved when the battery is too cold and only basic functions of the personal care device may remain active. In addition or in the alternative, a very low temperature of the drive unit may mean increased driving resistance so driving modes with high energy consumption may be prevented. On the other hand, also high temperatures exceeding a certain threshold may trigger a hazard signal to switch-off at least one function or reduce intensity of a function to protect the personal care device.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">More particularly, the aforementioned adjustment device for adjusting the mechanical setting and/or mechanical function of the working head may be activated or deactivated or controlled to assume a save harbor configuration and/or an energy saving configuration. For example, upon detection of a temperature below a lower threshold or above an upper threshold, the adjustment device may be brought into a predefined position if it is not already in such position anyway. As soon as such configuration is given, the adjustment device may not be used anymore until the temperature comes back into a non-hazardous temperature window. Another option could be to deactivate the adjustment mechanism irrespective of its current position to save energy, upon detection of a temperature outside a predefined temperature window.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">On the other hand, when the adjustment device is controlled to provide for a predefined save harbor mechanical setting and/or mechanical function, the working head and/or the adjustable element thereof may be brought into a configuration in which a maximal head movability is given and/or a minimum stiffness for pivoting and/or diving is given.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In addition or in the alternative issuing a hazard signal in response to a temperature load determination module, the hazard determination device may also include a battery charge module for determining the charging level of the battery, wherein a hazard signal may be issued upon determination of a charging level below a certain threshold value.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The battery charging level may be determined in different ways. For example, the battery charge determination module may include a voltage sensor and/or a voltage determination circuit for determining battery voltage. In addition or in the alternative, relevant parameters of a charger device may be detected and analyzed to determine the charging level of the battery. For example, any charging current and also discharging current may be determined to calculate the charge level of the battery.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Upon detection of a low charge scenario, the aforementioned measures may be taken, for example the adjustment mechanism may be brought into a save harbor configuration and then possibly deactivated. In addition or in the alternative, other energy saving measures may be taken such as reducing driving frequency and/or amplitude or driving speed.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">These and other features become more apparent from the example shown in the drawings.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the personal care device <b>20</b> may be configured as a shaver such as an electric shaver.

Such restrictor <b>6</b> may cooperate with a restrictor counterpart <b>7</b> which may be provided at the working head and/or which may include a contour in terms of, for example, a tapered recess into which the wedge-shaped restrictor <b>6</b> may enter.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The adjustment device <b>15</b> may include an actuator <b>4</b> for moving and/or driving the restrictor <b>6</b> into a more restrictive position and a less restrictive position, wherein the actuator <b>4</b> may be configured to drive the restrictor <b>6</b> only into a fully restrictive position and a minimum restrictive position. In the alternative, the actuator <b>4</b> may be configured to drive the restrictor <b>6</b> into one or more intermediate positions providing for an intermediate restriction of the swiveling range of the working head <b>2</b>, wherein such intermediate positions may be variable step by step or continuously.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The actuator <b>4</b> may include a driving motor such as an electric motor for driving the restrictor <b>6</b> into the desired position.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">During normal operation of the personal care device <b>20</b>, the adjustment device <b>15</b> may be responsive to one or more operational parameters indicative of use of the personal care device and/or indicative of a user's behavior. In addition to such normal use of the adjustment device <b>15</b>, it may be part of a hazard prevention system of the personal care device <b>20</b> to prevent the personal care device from damages and/or hazardous situations.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">More particularly, the personal care device <b>20</b> includes a hazard determination device <b>16</b> for automatically determining hazards for the personal care device, wherein the adjustment device <b>15</b> is configured to adjust the working head <b>2</b> into a save harbor configuration in response to a hazard signal from the hazard determination device <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">As shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the hazard determination device <b>16</b> may include a freefall determination module <b>17</b> to automatically determine a freefall scenario in which the personal care device <b>20</b> drops unintentionally.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Such freefall determination module <b>17</b> may include an acceleration sensor <b>8</b> which may be mounted in or near the center of gravity of the personal care device <b>20</b>. For example, the acceleration sensor <b>8</b> may be accommodated inside the handle <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In the freefall case, the acceleration sensor <b>8</b> may issue a signal indicative of an acceleration which is 0 or at least close to 0 in all three directions.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The output signal of the acceleration sensor <b>8</b> may be fed to an evaluation unit <b>18</b> which may include or be implemented by an electronic controller <b>9</b> which may include a microprocessor and/or a storage for storing data processing results and/or software such as an evaluation algorithm inside the electronic controller of the device or outside within e.g a smartphone software app.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">When the evaluation unit <b>18</b> recognizes an acceleration value smaller than a predefined threshold in all three dimensions for a predefined minimum time duration, a freefall event may be assumed and the hazard determination device <b>16</b> may issue a hazard signal to the adjustment device <b>15</b> which is configured responsive to such hazard signal.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The threshold for the acceleration values may be set to a value significantly lower than the gravitational acceleration. The length of the time interval may be set to a time value significantly shorter than the time the device needs to fall from a typical working height to the ground.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Moreover, the freefall determination module <b>17</b> may include a gyrosensor <b>10</b> to determine rotatory movements in terms of a rotation angle and/or a rotatory speed and/or a rotatory acceleration. Such gyrosensor <b>10</b> may feed its gyrosignal to the aforementioned evaluation unit <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The gyrosensor <b>10</b> may be accommodated in the handle <b>1</b> and/or may be combined with the aforementioned acceleration sensor <b>18</b>. For example, the gyrosensor <b>10</b> may be accommodated in the same sensor housing as the acceleration sensor <b>8</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The evaluation unit <b>18</b> may be configured to analyze the gyrosignal of the gyrosensor <b>10</b> for characteristics indicative of a freefall scenario. For example, when rotations are observed that combine a rotation speed and a rotation angle of the personal care device <b>20</b> beyond a predefined threshold value, a freefall scenario may be assumed, wherein the hazard determination device <b>16</b> may issue the hazard signal in such case.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Another option for determining the freefall event may include determination of a sudden increase or a suddenly large value of acceleration, for example a sudden increase of the acceleration signal of the acceleration sensor <b>8</b> and/or the gyrosignal of the gyrosensor <b>10</b>. When the personal care device <b>20</b> drops and hits an object on its way to the ground, a sudden increase of the sensor signal of the acceleration sensor <b>8</b> and/or of the gyrosensor <b>10</b> will occur. The evaluation unit <b>18</b> may analyze the sensor signal for such characteristic. For example, the sensor signal may be compared to a threshold, wherein such threshold may be set significantly higher than the gravitational acceleration. Yet another option which can be also combined with the others is that the hazard determination device <b>16</b> analyzes an electronic setting or a motor setting. Such electronic setting may be e.g. whether shaver is on or off, which swivel inclination the shaver head may have and the motor setting may be whether the motor is running or not.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">When the hazard determination device <b>16</b> issues the hazard signal, for example upon detection of a freefall scenario, the adjustment device <b>15</b> is controlled to provide for a save harbor configuration. More particularly, the adjustment device <b>15</b> may drive the restrictor <b>6</b> into its minimum restrictive position to allow for maximum movement of the working head <b>2</b>. More particularly, the restrictor <b>6</b> may be brought into a position in which no mechanical coupling is given between the working head <b>2</b> and the adjustment device <b>15</b> so no destructive forces can be transferred to the elements of the adjustment device and as a consequence, they are protected.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In addition to such measures and for additional safety of the involved mechanical parts, a passive overload protection may be built in as well, wherein such overload protection may include, for example, an overload clutch automatically opening when subject to excessive loads and/or excessive torques. For example, when the force and/or torque acting on the actuator <b>4</b> of the adjustment device <b>15</b> reaches or exceeds a certain predetermined threshold level, such overload clutch may react and may open the mechanical connection to protect the previously mentioned adjustment elements. Such overload clutch may be mounted to the wedge-like restrictor <b>6</b> for example. More particularly, the overload clutch may hold the wedge-like restrictor <b>6</b> in a predetermined position relative to the driving arm during normal operation and normal loads, whereas it may allow for flexing and/or pivoting away of the wedge-like restrictor <b>6</b> upon excessive loads and/or torques.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Furthermore, as can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the hazard determination device <b>16</b> may include a temperature sensor <b>11</b> to determine temperature loads onto temperature sensitive elements of the personal care device <b>20</b>. For example, the temperature sensor <b>11</b> may be placed in the interior of the handle <b>1</b> and/or close to a battery <b>12</b> which is a temperature sensitive component.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The temperature signal of the temperature sensor <b>11</b> may be fed to the evaluation unit <b>18</b> which may trigger a certain action of the adjustment device <b>15</b>, for example. More particularly, when the temperature of the battery <b>12</b> is too low and/or too high, energy should be saved and only basic functions of the personal care device <b>20</b> may be allowed. More particularly, the adjustment device <b>15</b> may be brought into a save harbor configuration in terms of an energy saving configuration. More particularly, the actuator <b>4</b> may be driven into a predefined position which may be a position allowing for maximum head movability. After bringing the adjustment device <b>15</b> into such configuration, it may be deactivated and/or not used any longer until the temperature gets back into a predefined temperature window.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Moreover, the hazard determination device <b>16</b> may include a charging level detector <b>19</b> and may be configured to issue a hazard signal upon detection of a charging level of the battery <b>12</b> below a certain threshold value. When the battery <b>12</b> is almost empty or below the aforementioned threshold value, the remaining energy should be kept for the main function of the device and additional consumption due to adjustment action of the adjustment device <b>15</b> should be avoided. More particularly, when the battery level is below the predefined threshold, the adjustment device <b>15</b> may be deactivated or, in the alternative, it may be brought into a predefined configuration such as the position of the restrictor <b>6</b> allowing for maximum movability of the working head <b>2</b> and thereafter, it may be deactivated.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The charging level detector <b>19</b> may include a voltage sensor for detecting battery voltage of the battery <b>12</b>. In addition or in the alternative, the charging level detector <b>19</b> may be configured to analyze information from a charging system. For example, a current detector may detect loading current.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
