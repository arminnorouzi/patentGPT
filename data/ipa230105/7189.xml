The in-vehicle display is sometimes used as, for example, a rear-view monitor for assisting the driver when parking the vehicle. In addition, there is a case where this type of moving body such as a vehicle is equipped with an electronically driven rear-view mirror (hereinafter, referred to as an electronic rear-view mirror) having a function of displaying a captured rear-view image. Under such circumstances, in view of cost reduction and the like, there has been a demand for sharing an imaging apparatus between the use for a rear-view monitor and the use for an electronic rear-view mirror.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, an imaging apparatus for an electronic rear-view mirror and an imaging apparatus for a rear-view monitor are different in field angles. Specifically, an image capturing range of the imaging apparatus for an electronic rear-view mirror is located in a peripheral portion of an image capturing range of the imaging apparatus for a rear-view monitor, that is, located in a region deviating from the optical axis. Additionally, in some cases regarding the optical characteristics of the optical system to be used, the angular intervals of the image forming positions between the optical axis and an edge of the field angle is uniform. Therefore, when one imaging apparatus is shared between the rear-view monitor and the electronic rear-view mirror, the resolution of an image for the electronic rear-view mirror may be degraded. On the other hand, in order to reliably obtain good resolution of the image for the electronic rear-view mirror, it has been necessary to increase the size of the imaging plane, that is, the size of the image sensor.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An imaging apparatus according to the present disclosure includes an imaging element and an optical system. On the imaging element, a plurality of pixels is arranged in a two-dimensional manner. The imaging element is configured to generate image data on the basis of output of the plurality of pixels. The optical system is configured to form, on an imaging plane of the imaging element, an image of light from a field at a magnification factor varying with a field angle. An optical axis of the optical system on the imaging plane is positioned away from a center of the imaging plane.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a configuration of an automobile to which a display system according to an embodiment is applied;</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a configuration of an imaging apparatus in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating an example of a relationship between relative positions of an imaging plane of an imaging element and an image forming position on the imaging plane of an optical system in the imaging apparatus in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a field angle in a vertical direction in the imaging apparatus in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating another example of a relationship between relative positions of an imaging plane of an imaging element and an image forming position on the imaging plane of an optical system in the imaging apparatus in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating an example of a configuration of each part in the case of a positive offset and in the case of a negative offset in the imaging apparatus in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a field angle in a vertical direction in a case where an imaging apparatus with no offset is mounted on an automobile;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a field angle in a vertical direction in a case where an imaging apparatus with a positive offset is mounted on an automobile;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a field angle in a vertical direction in a case where an imaging apparatus with a negative offset is mounted on an automobile;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a field angle in a vertical direction in a case where an imaging apparatus with a negative offset is mounted on a front of an automobile;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a field angle in a vertical direction in a case where an imaging apparatus with no offset is mounted on a side of an automobile;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a field angle in a vertical direction in a case where an imaging apparatus with a negative offset is mounted on a side of an automobile;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a field angle in a vertical direction in a case where an imaging apparatus with a positive offset is mounted on a side of an automobile;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a field angle in a vertical direction in a case where an imaging apparatus with no offset is mounted on a side pillar of an automobile;
