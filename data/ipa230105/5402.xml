More particularly, the present invention relates to an image display device having a motion detection function and to a method of controlling the image display device.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In general, an image display device displays an image on a display module, such as a cathode ray tube, a liquid crystal panel, an electroluminescent panel, a light emitting diode panel, a plasma display panel, and the like.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Recently, image display devices have become larger and more advanced in functionality. With this trend, the sizes of display panels of image display devices have been increased. However, the larger and advanced display devices have a problem in that power consumption increases with the size of the display panel.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">To solve this problem, technology development has been focused on enhancing the performance of a power saving function. However, there is a limit in power saving because the size of the display in a display device is not variable. For this reason, quite recently, an image display device in which a display size is variable according to settings has been proposed and has attracted great attention as a next generation image display device.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">On the other hand, there is a conventional power saving technique in which an image display device is equipped with a camera module to detect a motion of a user in front of the image display device. The image display device switches to a power saving mode when there is no user motion detected. However, the conventional technique has a problem in that a sudden change in ambient illuminance or a movement of a periodically moving object is erroneously detected as a motion of a user, resulting in an unexpected activation of the image display device.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">An objective of the present invention is to provide an image display device that detects a motion of a user and outputs at least one of light (i.e., visual signal) and sound (i.e., audio signal) as welcome feedback. Another objective of the present invention is to provide an image display device capable of detecting a motion of a user and switching a display panel from a partial view state to a zero view state. A further objective of the present invention is to provide a motion detection method for an image display device, the method being capable of preventing a sudden change in illuminance or a movement of a periodically moving object which is not a human being from being recognized as a motion of a user, thereby preventing erroneous detection of a user motion, which contributes to power saving.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Solution</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to solve the above problems, according to one exemplary embodiment of the present invention, there is provided an image display device equipped with a motion detection unit for detecting a motion of a user. When a user motion is detected by the motion detection unit with a display panel being in a zero-view state, a light emitting unit and/or an audio output unit is controlled to output light and/or sound as their welcome feedback signal.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In order to solve the above problems, according to one exemplary embodiment of the present invention, there is provided an image display device equipped with a motion detection unit for detecting a motion of a user. When the motion of a user is not detected by the motion detection unit for a predetermined period of time while a display panel is in a partial view state, the display panel is switched from the partial view state to a zero-view state.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In order to solve the problems occurring in the related art, according to one exemplary embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a motion detection method of an image display device. The method includes a motion exclusion process of determining whether it is a motion exclusion condition on the basis of an overall change, a local change, or both in pixel brightness value between two temporally adjacent frames each being composed of a plurality of blocks, thereby preventing erroneous detection in detecting a motion of a user.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Advantageous Effects</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">As described above, the image display device according to the present invention can draw user's attention by outputting light, sound, or both as welcome feedback after detecting a user motion. In addition, the image display device according to the present invention can save power and maximize space utilization by detecting a motion of a user and switching a display panel from a partial view state to a zero view state when no user motion is detected. In addition, the motion detection method of the image display device according to the present invention can prevent erroneous user motion detection by preventing a sudden change in illuminance or a movement of a periodically moving object from being recognized as a user motion.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0008" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> are schematic views illustrating an image display device <b>100</b> according to one exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a block diagram of the image display device <b>100</b> according to one exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref> are schematic views illustrating a welcome feedback mode of the image display device <b>100</b> according to one exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a view illustrating a control flow when a welcome feedback signal is provided according to the results of a motion detection in the image display device <b>100</b> according to one exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a view illustrating a control flow when a display panel is switched from a partial view state to a zero-view state according to the results of a motion detection in the image display device <b>100</b> according to one exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a schematic view illustrating a control flow when the display panel is switched from the partial view state to the zero-view state according to the results of a motion detection in the image display device <b>100</b> according to one exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a block diagram of a motion detection unit <b>160</b> of the image display device <b>100</b> according to one exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating a motion detection method of the image display device <b>100</b> according to one exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating a motion detection method of the image display device <b>100</b> according to one exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0009" level="1">BEST MODE</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Hereinafter, specific embodiments of the present disclosure will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The advantages and features of the present invention and the manner of achieving them will become apparent with reference to the embodiments described in detail below and the accompanying drawings.

In addition, the controller <b>170</b> may have a plurality of welcome feedbacks.

In this case, the motion is determined as an exception of motion.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0086">On the other hand, it is determined whether the number of blocks each of which is determined to be a motion block m or more consecutive times is n or more in each frame (S<b>46</b>). When the number is less than n, it is determined that there is no motion of a user in a corresponding one of the frames.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0087">In Step S<b>46</b>, when it is determined that there is a motion of a user, a difference in overall pixel brightness value (i.e., the average of brightness values of all the pixels in one image frame) between the image frame and the subsequent image frame is calculated (S<b>47</b>). When the difference in the overall pixel brightness value between the image frame and the subsequent image frame is equal to or greater than a predetermined threshold value Th<sub>2 </sub>(S<b>48</b>), it is determined that there is no motion of a user. That is, this case is determined as an exception of motion detection. On the contrary, when the difference is less than the predetermined threshold value Th<sub>2 </sub>(S<b>48</b>), it is determined that there is a motion of a user, and a motion detection signal is output (S<b>49</b>).</p><p id="p-0090" num="0088">As described above, according to the present invention, in order to reduce the power consumption of the image display device <b>100</b>, a motion of a user existing in front of the image display device <b>100</b> is detected, and then a welcome feedback is provided to the user or the image display device is switched to the zero view state. In addition, during detection of a motion of a user, motion exception events in which a change in pixel brightness value attributable to a sudden change in illuminance or a periodic movement of an object is regarded as an exception of motion detection are determined. This has an advantage of preventing unexpected activation of the image display device.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0089">On the other hand, the operation method of the image display device <b>100</b> according to the present invention may be implemented in the form of a code that is stored in a processor-readable recording medium provided in the image display device <b>100</b>. Examples of the processor-readable recording medium include all kinds of recording devices that can store data that can be read by a processor. Specific examples of the processor-readable recording medium include a ROM, a RAM, a CD-ROM, a magnetic tape, a floppy disk, an optical data storage device, and the like. The processor-readable recording medium may be implemented in the form of a carrier wave for transmission of a signal over the Internet. The processor-readable recording medium may also be distributed over computer systems connected via a network, and the code may be stored and executed in the distributed processor-readable recording medium.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0090">Although the exemplary embodiments of the present invention have been described for illustrative purposes, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications, additions, and substitutions are possible, without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention as defined in the appended claims.
