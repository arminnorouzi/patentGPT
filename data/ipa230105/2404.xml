to the field of organic chemistry, and in particular, relates to an ACC inhibitor and use thereof.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Obesity is a health crisis for a large group of people. The health burden of obesity, measured by quality-adjusted life-years lost per adult, has surpassed that of smoking to become the most serious preventable cause of death. In the United States, about 34% of adults suffer from obesity, up from 31% in 1999 and about 15% in the years 1960 through 1980. Obesity increases the rate of mortality from all causes for both men and women at all ages and in all racial and ethnic groups. Obesity also leads to social stigmatization and discrimination, which decreases the quality of life dramatically. The chronic diseases that result from obesity cost the US economy more than 150 billion dollars in weight-related medical bills each year. In addition, about half of the obese population and 25% of the general population have metabolic syndrome, a disorder associated with abdominal obesity, hypertension, increased plasma triglycerides, decreased HDL cholesterol, and insulin resistance, which increases the risk for type-2 diabetes (T2DM), stroke and coronary heart disease. (Harwood, Expert Opin. Ther. Targets 9: 267, 2005).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Diet and exercise, even when used in combination with the current pharmacotherapy, do not provide sustainable weight loss required for long-term health benefits. At present, only a few anti-obesity drugs are approved in the United States, including the fat absorption inhibitor orlistat, the 5-HT2C antagonist lorcaserin, and the combination therapy of phentermine/topiramate. Unfortunately, poor efficacy and adverse gastrointestinal side effects limits the use of orlistat. Surgery can be effective, but is limited to patients with extremely high body-mass indices (BMI). Moreover, the low throughput of surgery restricts the impact of this approach to about 200,000 patients per year. The majority of obesity drugs (for example, anorectics and satiety agents) in clinical development are designed to reduce caloric intake via a central action in the central nervous system (CNS). However, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has taken an objection against CNS-active agents due to their modest efficacy and observed/potential side-effect profiles.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The continuing and increasing problem of obesity and the current lack of safe and effective drugs for treating obesity highlight the urgent need for a new drug to treat this disorder and its underlying cause.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a silent disease defined as a clinical pathological syndrome, which is mainly characterized by excessive fat deposition in liver cells caused by factors other than alcohol (alcohol consumption less than 20 g/day). NAFLD ranges from benign simple fatty liver (SFL) to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis associated therewith. Specifically, the accumulation of lipid droplets (LD) in the cytoplasm of more than 5% of liver cells in the normal liver is defined as hepatic steatosis, i.e., SFL; with the further development of hepatic steatosis, lobular inflammation, cell damage, etc. would occur to liver tissues, and then steatohepatitis, i.e., NASH, would be developed; and when steatohepatitis continuously aggravates, stellate cells are activated, and collagen fibers are deposited in the liver to lead to liver fibrosis, which continuously aggravates to result in liver cirrhosis. A necrosis/inflammatory process would accelerate the gradual accumulation of fibrosis in the liver, and eventually lead to liver failure, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), liver transplantation and liver death in addition to cirrhosis. From the perspectives of epidemiology and pathophysiology, NAFLD, in particular NASH, is closely related to metabolic disorders, such as obesity, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and Type 2 diabetes. Over the past few decades, with the global prevalent trend of obesity and metabolic syndrome associated therewith, the prevalence of NAFLD, in particular NASH, has increased sharply. In particular, NASH has become an important cause of chronic liver disease in developed countries in Europe and the United States and in rich regions in China; and NASH has become the leading cause of liver transplantation in the United States. NASH represents an important stage during the development from SFL to liver fibrosis and liver cirrhosis. It is mainly characterized by hepatocyte steatosis, inflammatory cell infiltration and hepatic lobular fibrosis. NASH is considered to be an increasingly serious public health problem across the world. However, the current therapeutic protocol for NASH around the world is only limited to changing daily lifestyles, and there is no optimal diagnostic solution and approved therapeutic approach for NASH. Discovering and exploiting effective therapeutic drugs for NAFLD is one of the effective methods for preventing and treating NAFLD, in particular NASH, and it is also a scientific problem that needs to be solved urgently.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another persistent problem is the lack of an antifungal drug that is active against a broad spectrum of fungal pathogens. Generally, a given antifungal drug shows activity against one fungal species, but lacks activity against other (and even closely related) specifies, such as <i>Candida albicans, Candida krusei</i>, and <i>Candida parapsilosis. </i></p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A compound of Gilead can be effectively used as an inhibitor of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and is suitable for the treatment of various diseases, disorders or conditions related to the regulation of fatty acid production or oxidation.

This reaction, which proceeds in two half-reactions, a biotin carboxylase (BC) reaction and a carboxyltransferase (CT) reaction, is the first key step in fatty acid (FA) biosynthesis and is the rate-limiting reaction for the pathway. In addition to its role as a substrate in FA biosynthesis, malonyl-CoA, the product of the ACC-catalyzed reaction, also plays an important regulatory role in controlling mitochondrial FA uptake through allosteric inhibition of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT-I), the enzyme catalyzing the first committed step in mitochondrial FA oxidation. Malonyl-CoA, therefore, is a key metabolic signal for the control of FA production and utilization in response to dietary changes and altered nutritional requirements in animals, for example during exercise, and therefore plays a key role in controlling the switch between carbohydrate and fat utilization in the liver and skeletal muscle (Harwood, 2005).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0059">In mammals, ACC exists as two tissue-specific isozymes, ACC1 which is present in lipogenic tissues (liver, adipose) and ACC2, which is present in oxidative tissues (liver, heart, skeletal muscle). ACC1 and ACC2 are encoded by separate genes, display distinct cellular distributions, and share 75% overall amino acid sequence identity, except for an extension at the N-terminus of ACC2 that direct ACC2 to the mitochondrial membrane. ACC1, which lacks this targeting sequence, is localized to the cytoplasm. In the heart and skeletal muscle, which have a limited capacity to synthesize fatty acids, the malonyl-CoA formed by ACC2 functions to regulate FA oxidation. In the liver, the malonyl-CoA formed in the cytoplasm through the actions of ACC1 is utilized for FA synthesis and elongation leading to triglyceride formation and VLDL production, whereas the malonyl-CoA formed at the mitochondrial surface by ACC2 acts to regulate FA oxidation (Tong and Harwood, J. Cellular Biochem. 99: 1476, 2006). This compartmentalization of malonyl-CoA results from a combination of synthesis proximity (Abu-Elheiga et al., PNAS (USA) 102: 12011, 2005) and the rapid action of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (Cheng et al., J. Med. Chem. 49:1517, 2006).</p><p id="p-0054" num="0060">Simultaneous inhibition of the enzymatic activities of ACC1 and ACC2 offers the ability to inhibit de novo FA production in lipogenic tissues (e.g. liver &#x26; adipose) while at the same time stimulating FA oxidation in oxidative tissues (e.g. liver &#x26; skeletal muscle) and therefore offers an attractive modality for favorably affecting, in a concerted manner, a multitude of cardiovascular risk factors associated with obesity, diabetes, insulin resistance, and the metabolic syndrome.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0061">Several lines of evidence strongly support the concept of direct inhibition of ACC activity as an important therapeutic target for treating obesity, diabetes, insulin resistance, and the metabolic syndrome.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0062">Abu-Elheiga et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 100:10207-10212, 2003) demonstrated that ACC2 knock-out mice exhibit reduced skeletal and cardiac muscle malonyl-CoA, increased muscle FA oxidation, reduced hepatic fat, reduced total body fat, elevated skeletal muscle uncoupling protein-3 (UCP3) which is indicative of increased energy expenditure, reduced body weight, reduced plasma free FAs, reduced plasma glucose, and reduced tissue glycogen, and are protected from diet-induced diabetes and obesity.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0063">Savage et al. (J. Clin. Invest. 116: 817, 2006), using ACC1 and ACC2 antisense oligonucleotides, demonstrated stimulation of FA oxidation in isolated rat hepatocytes and in rats fed high-fat diets, and lowering of hepatic triglycerides, improvements in insulin sensitivity, reductions in hepatic glucose production, and increases in UCP1 mRNA in high fat-fed rats. These effects were greater when both ACC1 and ACC2 expressions were suppressed than when either ACC1 or ACC2 expression alone was suppressed.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0064">Harwood et al. (J. Biol. Chem. 278: 37099, 2003) demonstrated that the isozyme-nonselective ACC inhibitor, CP-640186, which equally inhibits ACC1 and ACC2 (IC<sub>50</sub>=about 60 nM) isolated from rat, mouse, monkey and human without inhibiting either pyruvate carboxylase or propionyl-CoA carboxylase, reduced FA synthesis, triglyceride synthesis and secretion in Hep-G2 cells without affecting cholesterol synthesis, and reduced apoB secretion without affecting apoA1 secretion. CP-640186 also stimulated FA oxidation in C2Cl2 cells and in rat muscle slices and increased CPT-I activity in Hep-G2 cells. In experimental animals, CP-640186 acutely reduced malonyl-CoA concentration in both lipogenic and oxidative tissues in both the fed and fasted state, reduced liver and adipose tissue FA synthesis, and increased whole body FA oxidation. In sucrose-fed rats treated with CP-640186 for three weeks, CP-640186 time- and dose-dependently reduced liver, muscle and adipose triglycerides, reduced body weight due to selective fat reduction without reducing lean body mass, reduced leptin levels, reduced the hyperinsulinemia produced by the high sucrose diet without changing plasma glucose levels, and improved insulin sensitivity.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0065">Saha et al. (Diabetes 55:A288, 2006) demonstrated stimulation of insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant rat muscle tissue by CP-640186 within 30 min of compound administration, and studies by Furler et al. (Diabetes 55:A333, 2006) used dual tracer analysis to show that acute (46 min) treatment of rats with CP-640186 stimulated FA clearance without decreasing glucose clearance.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0066">ACC is the rate-limiting enzyme in fatty acid synthesis and its product, malonyl CoA, serves as an important regulator of fatty acid oxidation. Hence, the ACC inhibitor both reduces de novo lipid synthesis and promotes the oxidation of existing fat. This dual effect on lipid metabolism raises the possibility that ACC inhibitors will be substantially more effective in reducing excess fat than other mechanisms. Furthermore, the ACC inhibitor will impact insulin sensitivity, plasma and tissue triglycerides, and fasting plasma glucose as a consequence of whole-body and tissue-specific fat mass reduction without the need for poly-pharmacy.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0067">The ACC inhibitor need only access the liver and muscle in the peripheral compartment. Avoiding the CNS will address many of side effects associated with the late-stage obesity programs targeting CNS receptors. The ACC inhibitor is also expected to have a superior safety profile to existing metabolic disease agents. For instance, it is unlikely that an ACC inhibitor will precipitate life-threatening hypoglycemia as is often seen with insulin mimetics, insulin secretagogues, and insulin degradation inhibitors. Also, since the ACC inhibitor will reduce whole-body fat mass, it will be superior to the glitazone that increases whole-body fat mass as part of their mechanism of action.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0068">A peripherally acting agent that causes significant weight loss and improves other metabolic endpoints fits well within the US FDA's requirements for approval of a new obesity agent. However, if an approval for obesity continues to be challenging in 5-7 years, the ACC inhibitor could be approved for familial combined hyperlipidemia and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). There are currently no marketed ACC inhibitors, so an isozyme-nonselective ACC inhibitor would represent a first-in-class therapy for treating obesity and metabolic syndrome.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0069">The activity of a compound utilized in the present invention as an inhibitor of ACC or treatment for obesity or metabolic syndrome, may be assayed in vitro or in vivo. An in vivo assessment of the efficacy of the compound of the present invention may be made using an animal model of obesity or metabolic syndrome, e.g., a rodent or primate model. Cell-based assays may be performed using, e.g., a cell line isolated from a tissue that expresses ACC. Additionally, biochemical or mechanism-based assays, e.g., transcription assays using a purified protein, RNA Northern blot, RT-PCR, etc., may be performed. In vitro assays include assays that determine cell morphology, protein expression, and/or the cytotoxicity, enzyme inhibitory activity, and/or the subsequent functional consequences of treatment of cells with the compound of the present invention. Alternate in vitro assays quantitate the ability of the inhibitor to bind to protein or nucleic acid molecules within the cell. Inhibitor binding may be measured by radiolabelling the inhibitor prior to binding, isolating the inhibitor/target molecule complex and determining the amount of radiolabel bound. Alternatively, inhibitor binding may be determined by running a competition experiment where new inhibitors are incubated with purified proteins or nucleic acids bound to known radioligands.

The specific effective dose level for any particular patient or organism will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder; the activity of the specific compound employed; the specific composition employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; the time of administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion of the specific compound employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination or coincidental with the specific compound employed, and like factors well known in the medical arts.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0088">The pharmaceutically acceptable composition of the present invention can be administered to humans and other animals orally, rectally, parenterally, intracisternally, intravaginally, intraperitoneally, topically (as by powders, ointments, or drops), bucally, as an oral or nasal spray, or the like, depending on the severity of the infection being treated. In a particular embodiment, the compound of the present invention may be administered orally or parenterally at a dosage level of about 0.01 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg and preferably from about 1 mg/kg to about 25 mg/kg of subject body weight per day, one or more times a day, to obtain the desired therapeutic effect.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0089">Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include, but are not limited to, pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active compounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethylformamide, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0090">Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution, suspension or emulsion in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. The acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed include water, Ringer's solution, U.S.P. and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose, any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or di-glycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid are used in the preparation of injectables.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0091">The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter, and/or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable medium prior to use.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0092">In order to prolong the effect of the compound of the present invention, it is often desirable to slow the absorption of the compound from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the compound then depends upon its rate of dissolution that, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered compound form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the compound in an oil vehicle. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the compound in biodegradable polymers (such as polylactide-polyglycolide). Depending upon the ratio of compound to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of compound release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the compound in liposomes or microemulsions that are compatible with body tissues.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0093">A composition for rectal or vaginal administration is preferably a suppository which can be prepared by mixing the compound of the present invention with suitable non-irritating excipients or carriers (such as cocoa butter and polyethylene glycol) or a suppository wax, which is solid at ambient temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melts in the rectum or vaginal cavity and releases the active compound.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0094">Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules. Among such solid dosage forms, the active compound is mixed with at least one of the following inert pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carriers: sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate; and/or a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and silicic acid; b) binders such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidinone, sucrose, and acacia; c) humectants such as glycerol; d) disintegrating agents such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate; e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin; f) absorption accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds; g) wetting agents such as, for example, cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate; h) absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite clay; and i) lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage form may also include buffering agents.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0095">Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells (such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art). They may optionally contain opacifying agents, and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polethylene glycols and the like.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0096">The active compounds can also be in micro-encapsulated form with one or more excipients as noted above. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings, release controlling coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound may be admixed with at least one inert diluent such as sucrose, lactose or starch. Such dosage forms may also include, as is normal practice, additional substances other than inert diluents, e.g., tableting lubricants and other tableting aids such a magnesium stearate and microcrystalline cellulose. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage forms may also include buffering agents. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include polymeric substances and waxes.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0097">Dosage forms for topical or transdermal administration of the compound of the present invention include ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, powders, solutions, sprays, inhalants or patches. The active component is admixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and any needed preservatives or buffers as may be required. Ophthalmic formulations, ear drops, and eye drops are also contemplated as being within the scope of the present invention. Additionally, the present invention encompasses the use of transdermal patches, which have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of a compound to the body. Such dosage forms can be made by dissolving or dispensing the compound in a proper medium.
