id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present application relates to the field of connectors, and in particular, to a board-to-board socket and a board-to-board connector assembly.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Board-to-board connector assemblies are widely used in the field of consumer electronics, such as smart phones, tablets, and wearable devices. Current smart phones and wearable devices have extremely high requirements on space, with components in reduced sizes. A minimum height of a board-to-board plug of front-line board-to-board manufacturers has reached an ultra-low height of 0.6 mm after fitting with a socket, and a pitch between terminals has reached a distance of 0.25 mm. Such a tiny connector puts forward a high requirement on structural strength of the connector. Moreover, compared with conventional board-to-board connector assemblies, large-scale functional integration of existing smart phones puts forward a higher requirement on current carrying capacity. For example, liquid crystal displays require current transfer capacity to be up to 5 A. The design of the conventional board-to-board connector assemblies is incapable of adapting to current market requirements on strength and current transfer.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In view of the above, there is a need to provide a board-to-board socket and a board-to-board connector assembly to meet the requirements that the product still has good strength and can transfer large current after being lightweight.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to solve the above technical problem, the present application provides a board-to-board socket, including a socket body, a socket terminal and a socket strengthener, wherein the socket body includes a bottom wall, socket side walls formed by protruding upwards from two longitudinal ends of the bottom wall, socket guide parts formed at two lateral ends of the socket body, and an island part formed by protruding upwards from the bottom wall; each of the socket guide parts includes a plug guide part receiving cavity, a longitudinal outer peripheral wall located at the lateral outer side of the plug guide part receiving cavity, and a pair of lateral outer peripheral walls located at two longitudinal sides of the plug guide part receiving cavity; the socket strengthener includes a main body part covering the upper surface of the longitudinal outer peripheral wall, lateral outer peripheral wall covering parts which extend from the main body part and cover the lateral outer peripheral walls, and elastic arm parts extending from the lateral outer peripheral wall covering parts to the sides of the lateral outer peripheral walls close to the plug guide part receiving cavities; and the tops of the elastic arm parts bend and extend towards longitudinal outer sides to form hitching parts hitched on the top faces of the lateral outer peripheral walls.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to solve the above technical problem, the present application further provides a board-to-board connector assembly, including a socket and a plug engaged therewith, the plug including a plug body, a plug terminal, and a plug strengthener, the plug body including a top wall, plug side walls formed by extending downwards from two longitudinal ends of the top wall, plug guide parts formed at two lateral ends of the plug body, and an island part receiving cavity located between the plug side walls and the plug guide parts, the socket including a socket body, a socket terminal and a socket strengthener, the socket body including a bottom wall, socket side walls formed by protruding upwards from two longitudinal ends of the bottom wall, socket guide parts formed at two lateral ends of the socket body, an island part formed by protruding upwards from the bottom wall, and a plug side wall receiving cavity formed between the island part and the socket side walls, wherein each of the socket guide parts includes a plug guide part receiving cavity, a longitudinal outer peripheral wall located at the lateral outer side of the plug guide part receiving cavity, and a pair of lateral outer peripheral walls located at two longitudinal sides of the plug guide part receiving cavity, the socket strengthener includes a main body part covering the surface of the longitudinal outer peripheral wall, lateral outer peripheral wall covering parts which extend from the main body part and cover the lateral outer peripheral walls, and elastic arm parts extending from the lateral outer peripheral wall covering parts to the sides of the lateral outer peripheral walls close to the plug guide part receiving cavities, the tops of the elastic arm parts bend and extend towards longitudinal outer sides to form hitching parts hitched on the top faces of the lateral outer peripheral walls, and when the plug is engaged with the socket, the plug strengthener is electrically contacted with the elastic arm parts.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to the present application, the elastic main arms bend and extend toward longitudinal outer sides to form hitching parts hitched on the support shoulder, and the top ends of the lateral outer peripheral wall covering parts bend toward longitudinal inner sides to form protection parts higher than the hitching parts to prevent damages to the elastic main arms caused by downward hitching of the plug strengthener when the elastic main arms are inserted into the plug.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The accompanying drawings illustrated herein are intended to provide further understanding of the present application and form part of the present application, and schematic embodiments of the present application and the descriptions thereof are intended to explain the present application and do not constitute improper limitations on the present application.
