Such a vehicle typically includes one or more sensors that are configured to sense information about the environment. The vehicle may use the sensed information to navigate through the environment. For example, if the sensors sense that the vehicle is approaching an obstacle, the vehicle may navigate around the obstacle.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a first aspect, a method is provided. The method includes obtaining sensor data from one or more sensors observing one or more aspects of an environment of a vehicle. The one or more sensors are operationally associated with the vehicle. The vehicle is configured to operate in an autonomous mode. The method further includes using an inference system to infer, based on the sensor data, at least one aspect of the environment of the vehicle that is not observed by the one or more sensors. The method also includes controlling the vehicle in the autonomous mode based on the at least one inferred aspect of the environment of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a second aspect, a vehicle is provided. The vehicle includes one or more sensors, an inference system, and a control system. The one or more sensors are configured to acquire sensor data. The sensor data relates to one or more aspects of an environment of a vehicle observed by the one or more sensors. The vehicle is configured to operate in an autonomous mode. The inference system is configured to infer, based on the sensor data, at least one aspect of the environment of the vehicle that is not observed by the one or more sensors. The control system is configured to control the vehicle in the autonomous mode based on the at least one inferred aspect of the environment of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a third aspect, a non-transitory computer readable medium having stored instructions is provided. The instructions are executable by a computer system to cause the computer system to perform functions. The functions include obtaining sensor data from one or more sensors observing one or more aspects of an environment of a vehicle. The one or more sensors are operationally associated with the vehicle. The vehicle is configured to operate in an autonomous mode. The functions further include inferring, based on the sensor data, at least one aspect of the environment of the vehicle that is not observed by the one or more sensors. The functions also include controlling the vehicle in the autonomous mode based on the at least one inferred aspect of the environment of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a fourth aspect, a method is provided. The method includes obtaining sensor data from one or more sensors observing at least one light source in an environment of the vehicle. The one or more sensors are operationally associated with the vehicle and a state of a controlling traffic signal is not directly observable using the one or more sensors. The vehicle is configured to operate in an autonomous mode.

In some embodiments, such modes of operation could include manual, semi-autonomous, and autonomous modes. In the autonomous mode, the vehicle could be driven with little or no user interaction. In the manual and semi-autonomous modes, the vehicle could be driven entirely and partially, respectively, by a user.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Some methods disclosed herein could be carried out in part or in full by a vehicle configured to operate in an autonomous mode with or without external interaction (e.g., such as from a user of the vehicle). In one such example, a vehicle could obtain sensor data from one or more sensors operationally associated with the vehicle. The sensors could be located on-board the vehicle or the sensors could be elsewhere. An inference system, which could be located fully or partially on-board the vehicle, may be used to infer, based on the sensor data, at least one aspect of the environment of the vehicle that is not observed by the one or more sensors. In an example embodiment, the at least one aspect of the environment of the vehicle that is not observed by the one or more sensors could be related to traffic flow (e.g., an unobservable accident ahead) and/or traffic regulation (e.g., state of an unobservable traffic light, order of vehicles proceeding at a four-way stop, etc.). Other aspects of the environment of the vehicles that are not observed by the one or more sensors are possible. The inference system could include, for example, a computer system (e.g., a processor and a memory). The vehicle could be controlled based on the at least one inferred aspect of the environment of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Other methods disclosed herein could be carried out in part or in full by a server.

The algorithms could include, for example, one or more of a Bayesian network, a hidden Markov model, and a decision tree. Other types of inference systems are possible within the context of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The control system could be configured to control the vehicle in the autonomous mode based on the at least one inferred aspect of the environment of the vehicle.

Furthermore, each sensor of sensor unit <b>202</b> could be configured to be moved or scanned independently of other sensors of sensor unit <b>202</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The wireless communication system <b>204</b> could be located on a roof of the vehicle <b>200</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Alternatively, the wireless communication system <b>204</b> could be located, fully or in part, elsewhere. The wireless communication system <b>204</b> may include wireless transmitters and receivers that could be configured to communicate with devices external or internal to the vehicle <b>200</b>. Specifically, the wireless communication system <b>204</b> could include transceivers configured to communicate with other vehicles and/or computing devices, for instance, in a vehicular communication system or a roadway station. Examples of such vehicular communication systems include dedicated short range communications (DSRC), radio frequency identification (RFID), and other proposed communication standards directed towards intelligent transport systems.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The camera <b>210</b> may be any camera (e.g., a still camera, a video camera, etc.) configured to capture a plurality of images of the environment of the vehicle <b>200</b>. To this end, the camera <b>210</b> may be configured to detect visible light, or may be configured to detect light from other portions of the spectrum, such as infrared or ultraviolet light. Other types of cameras are possible as well.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The camera <b>210</b> may be a two-dimensional detector, or may have a three-dimensional spatial range. In some embodiments, the camera <b>210</b> may be, for example, a range detector configured to generate a two-dimensional image indicating a distance from the camera <b>210</b> to a number of points in the environment. To this end, the camera <b>210</b> may use one or more range detecting techniques. For example, the camera <b>210</b> may use a structured light technique in which the vehicle <b>200</b> illuminates an object in the environment with a predetermined light pattern, such as a grid or checkerboard pattern and uses the camera <b>210</b> to detect a reflection of the predetermined light pattern off the object. Based on distortions in the reflected light pattern, the vehicle <b>200</b> may determine the distance to the points on the object. The predetermined light pattern may comprise infrared light, or light of another wavelength. As another example, the camera <b>210</b> may use a laser scanning technique in which the vehicle <b>200</b> emits a laser and scans across a number of points on an object in the environment. While scanning the object, the vehicle <b>200</b> uses the camera <b>210</b> to detect a reflection of the laser off the object for each point. Based on a length of time it takes the laser to reflect off the object at each point, the vehicle <b>200</b> may determine the distance to the points on the object. As yet another example, the camera <b>210</b> may use a time-of-flight technique in which the vehicle <b>200</b> emits a light pulse and uses the camera <b>210</b> to detect a reflection of the light pulse off an object at a number of points on the object. In particular, the camera <b>210</b> may include a number of pixels, and each pixel may detect the reflection of the light pulse from a point on the object. Based on a length of time it takes the light pulse to reflect off the object at each point, the vehicle <b>200</b> may determine the distance to the points on the object. The light pulse may be a laser pulse. Other range detecting techniques are possible as well, including stereo triangulation, sheet-of-light triangulation, interferometry, and coded aperture techniques, among others. The camera <b>210</b> may take other forms as well.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The camera <b>210</b> could be mounted inside a front windshield of the vehicle <b>200</b>. Specifically, as illustrated, the camera <b>210</b> could capture images from a forward-looking view with respect to the vehicle <b>200</b>. Other mounting locations and viewing angles of camera <b>210</b> are possible, either inside or outside the vehicle <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The camera <b>210</b> could have associated optics that could be operable to provide an adjustable field of view. Further, the camera <b>210</b> could be mounted to vehicle <b>200</b> with a movable mount that could be operable to vary a pointing angle of the camera <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Within the context of the present disclosure, the components of vehicle <b>100</b> and/or vehicle <b>200</b> could be configured to work in an interconnected fashion with other components within or outside their respective systems. For instance, in an example embodiment, the camera <b>130</b> could capture a plurality of images that could represent sensor data relating to an environment of the vehicle <b>100</b> operating in an autonomous mode. The environment could include another vehicle blocking a known traffic signal location ahead of the vehicle <b>100</b>. Based on the plurality of images, an inference system (which could include the computer system <b>112</b>, sensor system <b>104</b>, and control system <b>106</b>) could infer that the unobservable traffic signal is red based on sensor data from other aspects of the environment (for instance images indicating the blocking vehicle's brake lights are on). Based on the inference, the computer system <b>112</b> and propulsion system <b>102</b> could act to control the vehicle <b>100</b>.

The vehicle <b>306</b> could include a sensor system <b>310</b>. The large truck <b>304</b> could be obscuring a traffic signal <b>302</b> such that the sensor system <b>310</b> may not be able to directly sense the state of the traffic signal <b>302</b>. In other words, in scenario <b>300</b>, none of the sensors in sensor system <b>310</b> may be able to observe, image, transduce or otherwise detect the state of the traffic signal <b>302</b> due to the presence of large truck <b>304</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In such a case, sensor system <b>310</b> could be operable to obtain sensor data regarding other aspects of an environment of vehicle <b>306</b> in an effort to determine the state of the traffic signal <b>302</b> or any other relevant unobservable aspect of its environment. In an example embodiment, a camera associated with sensor system <b>310</b> could capture a plurality of images. The plurality of images could include information about one or more brake lights <b>308</b> of the large truck <b>304</b>. The plurality of images could be an input to an inference system.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The inference system could determine from the images that the one or more brake lights <b>308</b> of the large truck <b>304</b> are lit. The inference system could also include other sensor data that may confirm that the large truck <b>304</b> is stopped. For instance, the inference system could obtain information about the environment of the vehicle <b>306</b> from RADAR and/or LIDAR sensor systems.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The inference system could compare the sensor data to a set of predetermined scenarios in an effort to match the present sensor data with a particular predetermined scenario. The predetermined scenarios could be saved in data storage on-board the vehicle. Alternatively, the predetermined scenarios could be stored elsewhere, such as in a server network.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">If a substantial match exists between a particular predetermined scenario and the present sensor data, an inference could be made regarding a possible state of the unseen traffic signal <b>302</b>. For instance, in scenario <b>300</b>, the inference could be that the state of traffic signal <b>302</b> is &#x201c;red&#x201d; (because large truck <b>304</b> is stopped due to obeying the traffic signal <b>302</b>).</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Within the context of the disclosure, a substantial match could be made based on any one of, or a combination of, a similar arrangement of stopped vehicles, a similar roadway, a similar location/intersection, a similar route, a similar time of day, or any other similar aspect of the environment of vehicle <b>306</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Inferences could be made by the inference system based on other algorithms. For instance, the inference could be made based on a Bayesian network, a hidden Markov model, and/or a decision tree. Other algorithms could be used individually or in combination in order to infer about an aspect of the environment.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Based on the inferred aspect of the environment of the vehicle <b>306</b>, the vehicle <b>306</b> may be controlled to perform actions. In scenario <b>300</b>, the action could constitute staying stopped until the large truck <b>304</b> begins to move again.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In some scenarios, one or more subsequent inferences could be made by the inference system if conditions in the environment change, or if conditions in the environment stay the same. For example, in scenario <b>300</b>, if the vehicle <b>306</b> stays stopped behind the large truck <b>304</b> for longer than an expected traffic signal delay time, the vehicle <b>306</b> could make a subsequent inference that the large truck <b>304</b> is stopped due to a break down and not obeying the traffic signal <b>302</b>. In response to the subsequent inference, the vehicle <b>306</b> may take action, for instance, to move into an adjacent lane so as to move around the large truck <b>304</b>. Subsequent inferences could be made on an on-going basis, at specific predetermined intervals, or upon sensing specific triggering events, such as scenario-specific sensor data.

Similar to scenario <b>300</b>, a large truck <b>324</b> may be blocking a view of a north-bound traffic signal <b>326</b> for vehicle <b>322</b>, which may be operating in an autonomous mode. As such, sensor system <b>323</b> of vehicle <b>322</b> may be impeded from directly observing or otherwise sensing the state of the north-bound traffic signal <b>326</b>.

For instance, sensor system <b>323</b> could use one or a combination of its associated sensors (e.g., a camera, a RADAR, a LIDAR, an acoustic sensor, an ultrasonic sensor, etc.) to observe other traffic or non-traffic indicators that could be used as inputs to the inference system.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In scenario <b>320</b>, one or more sensors associated with sensor system <b>323</b> could observe car <b>328</b> turning right onto a south-bound roadway and truck <b>332</b> proceeding on a west-bound roadway. The sensor data related to actions of the car <b>328</b> and the truck <b>332</b> could be used as an input to the inference system. Based on the sensor data, the inference system could infer that the state of the traffic signal <b>326</b> is &#x201c;red&#x201d; for north- and south-bound traffic, and the state of the traffic signal <b>334</b> is &#x201c;green&#x201d; for east- and west-bound traffic. As described above, the inference system could compare the sensor data and other data to a set of predetermined scenarios.

In scenario <b>340</b>, a vehicle <b>342</b> could be stopped at a four-way stop intersection, obeying north-bound stop sign <b>344</b>. The vehicle <b>342</b> could be operating in an autonomous mode.

Truck <b>346</b> may also be stopped at the intersection due to east-bound stop sign <b>348</b>. In such a scenario, the vehicle <b>342</b> may want to determine a state of a traffic progression of the four-way stop intersection. However, such a state of traffic progression may not be observable.

Example Methods</heading><p id="p-0093" num="0092">A method <b>400</b> is provided for obtaining sensor data from one or more sensors observing one or more aspects of an environment of a vehicle. The one or more sensors are operationally associated with the vehicle. The method further includes using an inference system to infer, based on the sensor data, at least one aspect of the environment of the vehicle that is not observed by the one or more sensors and controlling the vehicle based on the at least one inferred aspect of the environment of the vehicle. The method could be performed using any of the apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> and described above, however, other configurations could be used. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> illustrates the steps in an example method, however, it is understood that in other embodiments, the steps may appear in different order and steps could be added or subtracted.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Step <b>402</b> includes obtaining sensor data from one or more sensors observing one or more aspects of an environment of a vehicle. The one or more sensors are operationally associated with the vehicle. The vehicle is configured to operate in an autonomous mode. The vehicle described in this method could be the vehicle <b>100</b> and/or vehicle <b>200</b> as illustrated and described in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, respectively.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Obtaining sensor data could include using one or more of a camera, a radar system, a lidar system, and an acoustic-sensing system. Other sensors and sensor systems are possible in the context of the disclosure. The sensor data could be received by wired and/or wireless signals from the aforementioned sensors. In some embodiments, the sensor data could be obtained by a server network and communicated to the vehicle. Alternatively or additionally, the sensor data could be obtained by a computer system incorporated in the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Step <b>404</b> includes using an inference system to infer, based on the sensor data, at least one aspect of the environment of the vehicle that is not observed by the one or more sensors. The inference system could be provided by the computer system <b>112</b> as shown and described in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In other embodiments, the inference system could be partially or wholly provided by one or more computer systems external to the vehicle, such as in a server network.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">The inference system could be operable to make inferences about any number of aspects of the environment of the vehicle not directly observed by the one or more sensors associated with the vehicle. For instance, the inference system could make an inference about a state of an unseen traffic signal or four-way stop. In other embodiments, the inference system could make an inference about a traffic density on a roadway, a speed limit, a road condition, a behavior of another vehicle, a road route, and/or an accident or obstacle impeding a roadway. Other aspects of the environment could be inferred.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">The inference system could make inferences based on sensor data from one of, or any combination of, sensors operationally-associated with the vehicle. The sensors could be located on-board the vehicle. Alternatively, some of the sensors could be located apart from the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">The inferences made by the inference system could be based on any aspect of the environment of the vehicle observable to the sensors. In an example embodiment, inferences could be made from sensor data regarding the other vehicles. The sensor data could relate to, for instance, the speed, heading, and/or position of other vehicles. For example, inferences could be made based on the acceleration and/or deceleration (with or without brake lights) of other vehicles when approaching an intersection with an occluded traffic signal. Deceleration of the other vehicles may imply a &#x2018;red&#x2019; traffic signal, while acceleration may imply a &#x2018;green&#x2019; traffic signal. Other examples are possible with regards to using sensor data based on other vehicles.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Inferences could also be made based on the sensed position of obstacles, changes in the observed roadway compared to a known map, condition of the roadway, etc. Further, sensor data from more than one sensor could be used by the inference system to make an inference.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">The inference system could include artificial intelligence and/or a learning algorithm. In such cases, the inference system could infer about an aspect of the environment of the vehicle based on obtained sensor data. The sensor data could be compared against a set of representative sensor input scenarios or predetermined scenarios that could represent a set of similar scenarios with a set of possible outcomes. That is, for a given a set of sensor inputs, a set of possible outcomes could be associated to the given set of sensor inputs. Each possible outcome associated with the given set of sensor inputs could be associated with a probability. The probability could relate to the possible outcome actually occurring.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">The inference made by the inference system could relate to a &#x2018;best guess&#x2019; for the outcome, which may include one of the possible outcomes. If the inference is confirmed (e.g., the &#x2018;best guess&#x2019; was correct), the possible outcome within the set of representative sensor input scenarios could be reinforced by, for instance, increasing the probability that the possible outcome will occur. If the inference is determined to be incorrect, the probability could be decreased for the given possible outcome among the set of representative sensor input scenarios or predetermined scenarios. Other types of learning algorithms are possible.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Each predetermined scenario or inference could include an associated confidence level based on how confident the inference system may be in the predicted outcome. The confidence level may or may not directly correlate with the respective probability of the most-likely outcome in each predetermined scenario. The confidence level could be based on, for instance, one or more actual outcomes following one or more previous inferences. In such an example, if a previous inference incorrectly predicted the actual outcome, the confidence level of the predetermined scenario could be subsequently decreased. Conversely, if a previous inference correctly predicted the actual outcome, the confidence level of the predetermined scenario could be increased.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Within the context of the disclosure, inferences could be made using a fail-safe approach. In other words, the inference system could make inferences that may be correct or incorrect representations of an unobservable aspect of the environment. In a fail-safe approach, incorrect inferences (e.g., inferring that a traffic light is &#x201c;red&#x201d; when it is actually &#x201c;green&#x201d;) could be carried out within the context of safe vehicle operation so as to avoid unsafe operation.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">For example, various traffic rules could be used or modified by the inference system in an effort to provide fail-safe operation. An actual traffic rule could be: &#x2018;Unless you know a traffic signal is green, do not proceed through the intersection.&#x2019; The inference system could use a modified version of the rule such as: &#x2018;Unless you directly observe a traffic signal as being green or unless other vehicles in your lane are proceeding through the intersection, do not proceed through the intersection.&#x2019; The inference system may also add additional limitations to various actions for safer operation. Such additional limitations could include redundant sensor data checks (so the vehicle does not move based on a sensor glitch), heterogeneous sensor checks (e.g., radar and optical sensor inputs should agree), additional wait times, etc. The additional limitations may be added to provide more reliable and safe operation of the vehicle while in the autonomous mode.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">In some scenarios, the inference system could request vehicle driver/occupant input to confirm or reject an inference. For example, when approaching an intersection where the traffic signal is flashing red, the inference system could infer that the traffic signal is non-functional and may ask for input from an occupant of the vehicle. The inference system could ask, &#x201c;This traffic light appears broken, can you please confirm?&#x201d; The vehicle occupant could respond, &#x201c;Yes, it looks broken,&#x201d; or &#x201c;No, I think it normally flashes red.&#x201d; Such input from the vehicle occupant could be used alone or in combination with sensor data to make further inferences about the aspect of the environment and/or to control the vehicle. The interaction between the inference system and the vehicle occupant could be carried out using voice, text, or other forms of communication.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">In another example embodiment, while approaching an intersection, a traffic signal could be occluded from the vehicle sensor system. The vehicle may come to a stop at the intersection. After waiting at least one cycle time of the traffic light and failing to receive other appropriate sensor data to proceed through the intersection, the inference system could ask the vehicle occupant &#x201c;Is it safe to proceed through this intersection?&#x201d; The vehicle occupant could respond with &#x201c;Go&#x201d; or &#x201c;Don't Go&#x201d;. The vehicle could be controlled based on the response from the vehicle occupant. In other embodiments, the vehicle occupant could take manual control of the vehicle to negotiate the intersection. Other interactions between the inference system and the vehicle occupant are possible.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">In some embodiments, inferences could be transmitted to one or more other vehicles configured to operate in an autonomous mode. For instance, an inference about a state of a traffic signal could be transmitted to vehicles behind the inferring vehicle as an &#x2018;early warning&#x2019; to avoid abrupt braking or other emergency conditions.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">Inferences could also be transmitted in the form of a query to nearby autonomous vehicles that may be operable to support or disprove the inference. For example, a vehicle stopped behind a large truck that could be blocking a traffic signal may infer that the large truck is stopped due to the state of the traffic signal being &#x201c;red&#x201d;. In some embodiments, the vehicle may broadcast the inference in an effort to obtain further information about the state of the traffic signal. In response, other vehicles may respond with other information to support or disprove the inference.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">Based on the inference made by the inference system, a control instruction or a set of control instructions could be generated by the inference system and transmitted or otherwise communicated to the vehicle or another computer system operable to control part or all of the functions of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">Step <b>406</b> includes controlling the vehicle in the autonomous mode based on the at least one inferred aspect of the environment of the vehicle. Controlling the vehicle could represent the vehicle following the control instruction(s) in order to perform one or more of the vehicle accelerating, decelerating, changing heading, changing lane, shifting position within a lane, providing a warning notification (e.g., vehicle-to-vehicle communication message, horn signal, light signal, etc.), and changing to a different driving mode (e.g., semi-automatic or manual mode). Other actions involving controlling the vehicle are possible within the context of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">The vehicle could be controlled based at least partially on the confidence level of the inference or predetermined scenario.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">The vehicle and any on-board computer systems could control the vehicle in the autonomous mode. Alternatively, computer systems, such as a server network, could be used to control some or all of the functions of the vehicle in the autonomous mode.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">The methods and apparatus disclosed herein could be applied to a situation in which the vehicle operating in the autonomous mode approaches a freeway metering light (e.g., at a highway on-ramp). In the example situation, while the vehicle is stopped alongside the metering light, the field of view of the camera may not be sufficient to directly observe the metering light. The vehicle may receive information (e.g., from a highway administrator or other roadway information service) about the particular metering light. The received information could include whether metering is on at the particular metering light as well as the current metering interval. The information could be received via a wireless communication interface. As such, in situations where the vehicle may not be able to directly observe the metering light, there are several ways the vehicle could infer a proper interval time and/or a state of the metering light in order to proceed from the metering light.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">For example, the vehicle may observe other cars and infer an interval time from movements of the other vehicles. In such an example, the vehicle could observe other vehicles advancing at a certain rate (e.g., approximately one every five seconds). Based on the observation of other vehicles, the vehicle may infer that the interval is approximately five seconds and proceed from the metering light after waiting the inferred interval time.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">If the interval information is known (e.g., based on prior historical data or received information), the vehicle may infer the proper metering interval based on that interval information. For instance, the highway authority may provide metering interval information to the vehicle (e.g., the interval at the current metering light is seven seconds). Based on the interval information, the vehicle may infer the interval to be seven seconds and proceed from the metering light after waiting seven seconds after a previous vehicle departure. However, if the vehicle observes other vehicles are waiting much more time (or less time) than the interval information indicates, a new interval may be inferred based on real-time observations.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">In a scenario that includes a two-lane metering light, the vehicle may observe other vehicles proceed from the metering light in an alternating fashion (e.g., right lane, left lane, right lane . . . ). Based on the departure interval, the vehicle could infer an appropriate time to wait at the metering light. Further, based on the departure interval and the present lane of the vehicle, the vehicle could infer the proper order in which to depart from the metering light.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">In another example embodiment, the vehicle may make an inference about the state of the metering light based on previous observations of the metering light. For instance, as the vehicle is approaching the metering light, it may observe the state of the metering light. However, the view of the metering light may become occluded by another vehicle or the metering light may be outside the camera field of view. In such a situation, the vehicle may infer a current state of the metering light based on the previously observed state of the metering light. In particular, the vehicle may observe a transition of the metering light (e.g., red to green or green to red) while moving towards the metering light, which may then become unobservable. If the interval information is known to the vehicle, the vehicle could make an inference regarding the current state of the metering light based on the interval information and the elapsed time since the previously observed transition.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">The vehicle may deliberately approach the metering light slowly when metering is on to assure that a whole metering cycle (or at least one metering light transition) is observed before the vehicle enters a location where the metering light is unobservable. Thus, the vehicle may be able to make a more confident inference about the current state of the metering light.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">In yet another embodiment, the vehicle may approach an unobservable metering light with no other vehicles waiting at it or proceeding through it. If the vehicle has information that metering is on as well as information about the interval for the metering light, the vehicle may just wait at the metering light for the duration of the interval. Thus, despite not directly observing the metering light, the vehicle could make inferences about the metering light and control the vehicle in an effort to be safe and also to be in accordance with the spirit of traffic laws and regulations.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">A method <b>410</b> is provided in which sensor data may be obtained from at least one sensor observing at least one light source in an environment of the vehicle when a state of a controlling traffic signal is not directly observable. Based on the sensor data, an inference system could infer an inferred state of the controlling traffic signal. The vehicle may be controlled based on the inferred state of the controlling traffic signal. The method could be performed using any of the apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> and described above, however, other configurations could be used. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> illustrates the steps in an example method, however, it is understood that in other embodiments, the steps may appear in different order and steps could be added or subtracted.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">Step <b>412</b> includes obtaining sensor data from one or more sensors observing at least one light source in an environment of a vehicle while a state of a controlling traffic signal is not directly observable using the one or more sensors. The vehicle could be configured to operate in an autonomous mode and the one or more sensors may be operationally associated with the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">The one or more sensors could include any type of sensor as described elsewhere in the present disclosure. The one or more sensors could be attached to the vehicle or could be located elsewhere.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">The at least one light source could include one or more brake lights of another vehicle. Other light sources are possible.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">The controlling traffic signal could represent any traffic-regulating device, such as a traffic light, a stop sign, or a metering light. For example, the vehicle could be approaching an intersection. In such a case, the controlling traffic signal could be a traffic light that regulates traffic flow through the intersection. Other types of controlling traffic signals are possible. In an example embodiment, the controlling traffic signal could be obstructed by another vehicle, a building, a tree, or any other type of obstruction such that the controlling traffic signal is not directly observable using the one or more sensors of the vehicle. In other embodiments, the controlling traffic signal could be outside the observable range of the one or more sensors of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">Step <b>414</b> includes using an inference system to infer an inferred state of the controlling traffic signal based on the sensor data. In an example embodiment, the inference system could be a computer system associated with the vehicle, such as computer system <b>112</b> described in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In other embodiments, the inference system could be associated in full or in part with another computer system (e.g., a server network).</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">As described elsewhere in the present disclosure, the inference system could be operable to make inferences based on sensor data. In some embodiments, the inference system could make inferences about an unobservable state of a controlling traffic signal. For example, a vehicle may be approaching an intersection with a controlling traffic signal. In such a case, a truck may prevent one or more sensors associated with the vehicle from directly observing a state of the controlling traffic signal. The vehicle could acquire sensor data related to one or more light sources in the environment of the vehicle, such as brake lights of other vehicles. If the brake lights of other vehicles are on, the inference system could infer that the state of the controlling traffic signal is red or &#x2018;stop&#x2019;. If the brake lights of the other vehicles are not on, the inference system could infer that the state of the controlling traffic signal is green or &#x2018;go&#x2019;. Other types of inferences are possible.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">Step <b>416</b> includes controlling the vehicle in the autonomous mode based on the inferred state of the controlling traffic signal. In an example embodiment, if the inferred state of the controlling traffic signal is green or &#x2018;go&#x2019;, the vehicle could be controlled to &#x2018;go through intersection&#x2019; or &#x2018;proceed with caution&#x2019;. If the inferred state of the controlling traffic signal is red or &#x2018;stop&#x2019;, the vehicle could be controlled to stop. In some embodiments, the vehicle may be controlled to alert the driver and/or to enter a semiautomatic or manual mode. Other ways of controlling the vehicle in the autonomous mode based on the inferred state of the controlling traffic signal are possible.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">Example methods, such as method <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> and method <b>410</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, may be carried out in whole or in part by the vehicle and its subsystems.
