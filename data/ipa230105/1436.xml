Most aerosol containers have one chamber containing both a propellant and an active composition. Some aerosol containers dispense the propellant and the active composition from separate containers. Further, many more types of liquid applicating containers have been devised for dispensing the aerosols.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Many traditional dispensing containers are configured to contain only one product, and therefore can only distribute one product. In the case of perfume-dispensing containers, the constant dispensing of a single perfume can quickly become tiresome for a user, especially as the desire for a specific perfume can vary throughout the day, or from one day to the next.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, there is a need for implementation of improved method and system for efficient and reliable package delivery, while ensuring the privacy of the customer and the customer's trusted individual.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Embodiments in accordance with the present invention provide a multiple nozzle perfume dispensing container.
