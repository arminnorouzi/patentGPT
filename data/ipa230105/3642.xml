In the use of such a conventional imaging device, electromagnetic waves that transmit through people's clothes or the like are specularly reflected by a human body, a metal, or the like. The conventional imaging device can therefore image only an area, of a human body, a metal, or the like that specularly reflects the electromagnetic waves emitted from the point light source, which is defined by an angle at which the reflected waves are incident on the detector. Accordingly, with the conventional imaging device, it is difficult to image, with high accuracy, the shape of a human body, a metal, or the like that is hidden under people's clothes or the like and cannot be visually identified directly.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In view of this, the present invention provides an imaging device capable of imaging more accurately, than the conventional imaging device, the shape of an object that is hidden under people's clothes or the like and cannot be visually identified directly.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">An imaging device according to an aspect of the present disclosure includes: an area light source including an emission surface from which a sub-terahertz wave is emitted to a measurement target; and a detector including an image sensor that receives a reflected wave generated by the measurement target reflecting the sub-terahertz wave emitted from the emission surface.

Therefore, utilizing sub-terahertz waves as electromagnetic waves to be emitted to a human body does not cause any problems in terms of safety.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0049">On the other hand, sub-terahertz waves specularly reflect off a human body, a metal, or the like. Therefore, in imaging utilizing electromagnetic waves (sub-terahertz waves in this case) emitted from a point light source, it is difficult to image, with high accuracy, the shape of a human body, or a metallic hazardous object such as a knife, as has conventionally been the case. In order to solve this problem, the inventors have studied on the shape of a light source that emits sub-terahertz waves. As a result, the inventors have obtained the knowledge that if a light source that emits sub-terahertz waves is an area light source, it is possible to irradiate an object to be imaged with sub-terahertz waves from various angles, thereby enabling more accurate imaging, than that performed by a conventional imaging device, of the shape of an object such as a human body, a metal, or the like which specularly reflects sub-terahertz waves.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0050">Based on all of the knowledge described above, the inventors have arrived at the following imaging device.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0051">An imaging device according to an aspect of the present disclosure includes: an area light source including an emission surface from which a sub-terahertz wave is emitted to a measurement target; and a detector including an image sensor that receives a reflected wave generated by the measurement target reflecting the sub-terahertz wave emitted from the emission surface. The area light source includes: at least one point light source that emits a sub-terahertz wave; and a reflector that diffusely reflects the sub-terahertz wave emitted from the at least one point light source, to generate a sub-terahertz wave to be emitted from the emission surface, the reflector including a reflection surface that is a bumpy surface which includes two or more frequency components in a spatial frequency range and whose roughness curve element mean length RSm is at least 0.3 mm. The diffuse reflection here means that a ray of a sub-terahertz wave incident on the reflection surface at an angle of incidence when viewed at a macro level is reflected at multiple angles of reflection due to the structure of a bumpy surface having multiple bumps at a micro level.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0052">The imaging device utilizes sub-terahertz waves emitted from an area light source, to perform imaging. With the imaging device, it is therefore possible to image more accurately, than a conventional imaging device, the shape of an object such as a human body, a metal, or the like that is hidden under people's clothes or the like and cannot be visually identified directly. In addition, roughness curve element mean length RSm of the reflection surface is at least the wavelength of sub-terahertz waves. According to the imaging device described above, the generation of interference fringes in sub-terahertz waves emitted from the emission surface would be suppressed even if sub-terahertz waves emitted from each of at least one point light source were coherent electromagnetic waves.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0053">The detector may include an optical system that forms an image on the image sensor by an optical focus of the reflected wave.
