A subscriber may subscribe to television programming services, e.g., services provided by companies like Comcast&#x2122;, Verizon&#x2122;, DirecTV&#x2122;, or Dish Network&#x2122;. At the same time, a subscriber may subscribe to premium packages within a television programming service such as HBO&#x2122; or Showtime&#x2122;. In recent years, online streaming services, e.g., HBO Now&#x2122;, Netflix&#x2122;, and Amazon Prime&#x2122; Video, have become popular with media consumers. And users often subscribe to one or more online streaming services at the same time as subscribing to a television programming service including, at times, premium packages. Still other content sources, for example, online video sharing platforms like YouTube&#x2122;, are available to users under free, ad-based, and subscription models. Therefore, users are often oversubscribed to media content services, and inefficiently maintain subscriptions to services for media content they cannot consume. Furthermore, media content from one service may be available on another service at the same time or become available on another service later in time. And users may not realize they are oversubscribed to media content subscriptions. For example, a subscriber may maintain a premium subscription to HBO along with a television programming service, even though the shows the subscriber watches from HBO are offered for free in another media content subscription the subscriber maintains, such as Amazon Prime Video. Furthermore, a subscriber may find the they are primarily interested in a subset of content from a media content subscription. For example, a subscriber may only be interested in a particular show on HBO and does not watch HBO except when new episodes of that show are released. Thus, maintaining a subscription to HBO when the show is on hiatus, i.e., new episodes will not soon be released, is an inefficient use of the subscriber's resources. Various systems exist to track what media content users consume, and other systems exists to track what media content will be released in an upcoming release schedule. However, these systems are not effective to manage several media content subscriptions based on efficiently subscribing a subscriber to several media content subscriptions.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Therefore systems and methods for managing a plurality of subscriptions to a plurality of media packages are provided herein. A media guidance application obtains viewing patterns of a subscriber that has a plurality of subscriptions to media content, i.e., media content subscriptions. For example, the media guidance application may receive a listing of dates, times, channels, program metadata, ratings information, duration of viewing, channel change indications, or other data associated with a subscriber's consumption of media content. In a multi-subscriber home, the media guidance application may obtain view patterns for each subscriber in the home as a single collection of patterns per subscriber or a combined collection of patterns for all users.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">While media guidance applications may collect viewing patterns and media content subscriptions, current systems lack the functionality to interpret this information into a form that is useable for predicting future use. Specifically, current systems fail to create records of both the amount of time a subscriber will likely spend consuming media content as well as the amount of time the subscriber will likely spend consuming media content from a particular subscription; thus, these systems cannot apportion the amount of time a subscriber will likely spend consuming media in a given time period (e.g., a month) between media content subscriptions when each subscription is associated with a unique amount of time the subscriber will likely spend consuming media content. Because current systems fail to create records for this information, this information, and the resulting functionality to manage media content subscriptions, is unavailable to these systems. In contrast, by creating records of this specific information, and using these records to apportion the amount of time a subscriber will likely spend consuming media in a given time period between media content subscriptions when each subscription is associated with a unique amount of time the subscriber will likely spend consuming media content, the present embodiments generate recommendations for particular media content subscriptions during particular time periods based on the recorded information. These improvements allow a system to efficiently manage a subscriber's resources both along time and budget as subscriptions are automatically added and removed from a subscriber's set of active subscriptions. As a result, the overall viewing experience of the subscriber is improved as well as the subscriber's efficient use of subscriptions.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The media guidance application determines, based on the viewing patterns of the subscriber, a first media package of interest to the subscriber from the plurality of media packages. The first media package of interest is related to a first subscription. For example, the media guidance application may receive viewing patterns that indicate that a subscriber is subscribed to HBO, a premium television package. From the viewing patterns, the media guidance application may determine that a subscriber watches the HBO program Game of Thrones&#x2122;, an episodic show released through HBO's premium service. The media guidance application may further determine that the subscriber watches new Game of Thrones episodes as soon as a new episode is released on HBO. In this example, Game of Thrones is a media package of interest related to the HBO subscription based on the subscriber's viewing patterns.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">As used herein, &#x201c;viewing patterns&#x201d; is defined to mean a collection of information that indicates a viewer's or multiple viewers' media content consumption. In some embodiments, the viewing patterns are stored as a log of dates, times, channels, and program metadata that identifies which shows a viewer watched, how long the shows were watched, and/or whether the viewer interrupted his/her viewing experience. In some embodiments, the viewing patterns contain unprocessed data that can be analyzed to understand the viewer's habits for watching media, e.g. the viewer watched Season 1 Episode 1 of Game of Thrones on Channel 65 from timecode 00:00 to timecode 32:04 on Apr. 6, 2017 from 9:53 PM until 10:25 PM. In some embodiments, the viewing patterns contain high level summary information related to the viewer's consumption of media, e.g., the viewer has watched 84% of Game of Thrones and the viewer's consumption of Game of Thrones accounts for 2.3% of all viewer's media consumption. In some embodiments, the viewing patterns are stored in database entries associated with the viewer. In some embodiments, the viewing patterns are transmitted from a server that stores, collects, and analyzes viewing patterns.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some embodiments, the media guidance application determines the first media package of interest to the subscriber from a plurality of media packages using the total viewing time of a subscription and viewing time associated with a candidate media package. For example, the media guidance application may determine that the subscriber subscribes to HBO and HBO is releasing a new season of Game of Thrones and a new season of Westworld&#x2122;. Both Game of Thrones and Westworld are media packages related to a first subscription, HBO. The media guidance application determines a total viewing time associated with the subscriber and the plurality of media packages based on the viewing patterns of the subscriber. For example, the media guidance application may determine that the subscriber historically spends approximately 300 minutes viewing HBO shows in July and August. The media guidance application determines a candidate media package from the plurality of media packages. For example, the media guidance application may determine that Game of Thrones is a potential media package of interest because the subscriber historically watches Game of Thrones during the upcoming time period, perhaps July and August. The media guidance application determines a candidate media package viewing time associated with the subscriber and the candidate media package. Continuing the example, the media guidance application may determine that the upcoming run time of Game of Thrones for July and August is 445 minutes. The media guidance application identifies the candidate media package as the first media package of interest, based on a comparison of the total viewing time and the first package viewing time. For example, the media guidance application may determine that Game of Thrones is an important media package from the HBO subscription because its run time accounts for a large amount of time in comparison to the subscriber's historical consumption of HBO for the same time period.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The media guidance application continues by determining, based on the viewing patterns of the subscriber, a second media package of interest to the subscriber from the plurality of media packages, the second media package of interest being related to a second subscription. For example, the media guidance application may determine that a subscriber is subscribed to Netflix, an online streaming service. From the subscriber's viewing history, the media guidance application may determine that the subscriber watches episodes of Mindhunter&#x2122;, an episodic show released through Netflix's service. In this example, the media guidance application may determine that the subscriber watched an entire season of Mindhunter in one sitting, a behavior sometimes referred to as &#x201c;binge watching.&#x201d; Based on this viewing pattern, the media guidance application may determine that Mindhunter is a media package of interest related to the Netflix subscription. For example, the media guidance application may determine the second media package of interest to the subscriber based on the total viewing time of a subscription and viewing time associated with a candidate media package.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The media guidance application obtains a first release schedule related to media content in the first media package to be released in an upcoming time period. Carrying through with the example above, new seasons of Game of Thrones were historically released during the summer months. In this example, the media guidance application may obtain a schedule of new episodes of Game of Thrones from an upcoming season that will be released in the summer. The media guidance application also obtains a second release schedule related to media content in the second media package to be released in the upcoming time period. In this case, the media guidance application may determine that a new season of Mindhunter will be released all at once in the fall, perhaps October.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">As used herein, &#x201c;release schedule&#x201d; is defined to mean a collection of information related to the availability of media content. For example, a release schedule for Game of Thrones may indicate the channel, date, and time when new episodes of the show will be released in an upcoming season. For example, Game of Thrones historically has been released in July and August each year. A release schedule associated with a Game of Thrones season may indicate the dates in July and August on which new episodes will be released along with the time and channel on which the episodes will be released. The media guidance application can use this information to correlate upcoming episodes with related media content subscriptions. A release schedule may contain information related to a single show, a collection of shows, a channel, and/or a collection of channels, and it may contain information for various time periods, e.g., the upcoming week, upcoming month, or upcoming year.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The media guidance application predicts, using the first release schedule and the viewing patterns of the subscriber, a first viewing impact of the first subscription for the upcoming time period. The media guidance application predicts the first viewing impact to indicate a total predicted amount of time that a subscriber will spend viewing the first media package in the upcoming time period. For example, the media guidance application may determine that the upcoming season of Game of Thrones will run 445 minutes and, based on the fact that the subscriber's viewing history indicates the subscriber watches the entirety of each Game of Thrones episode, the media guidance application predicts the subscriber will watch the entirety of each new episode of Game of Thrones as it is released in July and August. Therefore, the media guidance application predicts that the viewing impact of Game of Thrones will be 445 minutes in the July and August time period. In other examples, the media guidance application may predict the impact of the media package at different granularities. For example, the media guidance application predicts the viewing impact on daily, weekly, monthly, seasonally, or yearly basis. The media guidance application may also determine viewing impact based on a subscription period related to the corresponding media content subscription. For example, the media guidance application may determine that the subscriber is billed for HBO every month on the ninth, and determine the viewing impact associated with an upcoming release of Game of Thrones between July 9th and August 9th.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">As used herein, &#x201c;viewing impact&#x201d; is defined to mean information corresponding to the amount of time a viewer, or a group of viewers, has spent, or is predicted to spend, consuming media content. A viewing impact may be associated with a show, a season within a series, an entire series, a movie, a channel, or a group of channels. Furthermore, a viewing impact may be stored as an amount of time, e.g., seconds, minutes, or hours, related to the consumption of media. Further, a viewing impact may be stored as a percentage of total viewing, e.g., 2%. Still further, a viewing impact may be associated with a specific time period in the past or future, or may be indicative the viewer's recorded viewing history.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The media guidance application predicts, using the second release schedule and the viewing patterns of the subscriber, a second viewing impact of the second subscription for the upcoming time period. The media guidance application predicts the second viewing impact to indicate a total predicted amount of time spent viewing the second media package in the upcoming time period. Continuing the prior example, the media guidance application may predict that the subscriber will consume all of Mindhunter on the day the new season is released, perhaps October 10th. Therefore, the media guidance application predicts the viewing impact of Mindhunter on October 10th will be, for example, 325 minutes. But the media guidance application also determines that the viewing impact of Mindhunter outside of October 10th will be nothing.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The media guidance application determines an available amount of time for viewing media in the upcoming time period. For example, the media guidance application may determine that a subscriber spends 100 minutes each month viewing media content across all services. And if the upcoming time period is July and August, then the media guidance application may determine that the available amount of time for viewing media is 200 minutes. In other examples, the media guidance application may use historical viewing patterns to more accurately determine the available amount of time. For example, the media guidance application may analyze the subscriber's viewing patterns and determine that, historically, the subscriber consumes 165 minutes of content in July and 120 minutes of content in August. In that example, the available amount of time for viewing media content in July and August is 285 minutes.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The media guidance application then generates a subscription recommendation for the upcoming time period. The media guidance application generates the subscription recommendation according to the following process. The media guidance application selects the first subscription and compares the first viewing impact to the available amount of time. For example, the media guidance application selects the HBO subscription as a subscription it will recommend the subscriber maintains. The media guidance application then compares the amount of time available to consume media, perhaps 285 minutes in July and August, with the viewing impact of the upcoming seasons of Game of Thrones in July and August, perhaps 445 minutes. In response to determining that the first viewing impact is less than the available amount of time, the media guidance application selects the second subscription and compares a sum of the first viewing impact and the second viewing impact to the available amount of time. For example, the media guidance application selects the Netflix subscription as a subscription it will recommend the subscriber maintains. The media guidance application also compares the total viewing impact of Game and Thrones (445 minutes) and Mindhunter (0 minutes) for the months of July and August, 445 minutes total, with the available amount of time for viewing media content, 285 minutes in this example. The media guidance application determines whether the sum of the viewing impacts exceeds the available amount of time. If the sum of the viewing impacts exceeds the available amount of time, the media guidance application selects the first subscription and does not select the second subscription. In other words, the media guidance application changes its recommendation to recommend that the subscriber cancels the Netflix subscription as the subscription is inefficient because the subscriber will not have time to consume media from Netflix based on the predictions made by the media guidance application. In another example, the media guidance application may determine that the subscriber should cancel a subscription because the viewing impact associated with that subscription is zero for the relevant time period.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some embodiments, the media guidance application may predict that a show that hadn't been watched previously by a user is correlated with the user's viewing history and viewing preferences. For example, the media guidance application may determine that other users with similar preferences are watching a newly released show that is likely to be watched by the user. As such, the media guidance application may allocate a viewing impact for content not previously watched. The viewing impact of that content may also be considered in making subscription recommendations and, as discussed later, content purchase recommendations.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">As used herein, media content subscriptions may encompass many forms of content subscription. For example, a subscriber may subscribe to television programming services, e.g., services provided by companies like Comcast&#x2122;, Verizon&#x2122;, DirecTV&#x2122;, or Dish Network&#x2122;. At the same time, a subscriber may subscribe to premium packages within a television programming service such as HBO&#x2122; or Showtime&#x2122;. In recent years, online streaming services, e.g., HBO Now&#x2122;, Netflix&#x2122;, and Amazon Prime&#x2122; Video, have become popular with media consumers and the subscriber may subscribe to such services. Media content subscriptions may also encompass spot subscriptions, such as pay-per-view events, pay-per-view movies, or video on demand.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">While the embodiments herein are described primarily with reference to media content subscriptions. One of skill in the art would recognize that these techniques could be applied to other content as well. For example, a user may purchase television, movie, or audio programs outside of a subscription model. For example, movies, television shows, and audiobooks are regularly released by content providers for purchase through programs such as iTunes, a registered trademark of Apple, and Amazon. The media guidance application may consider the user's past purchases and predict upcoming purchases and use the viewing impact of those purchases in making subscription recommendations in a similar manner as done for a user's content subscriptions. Therefore, the media guidance application may determine that the user has purchased, or is likely to purchase, 200 minutes of content for an upcoming time period. When determining subscription recommendations for that time period, the media guidance application may use the viewing impact of the purchased content to make the subscription recommendations. Furthermore, the media guidance application may make content purchase recommendations and automate content purchases in similar manner to making subscription recommendations. For example, the media guidance application may determine that, based on the user's viewing history or input from the user, the user is should purchase a movie that will be released in the upcoming time period on iTunes. The media guidance application may allocate a portion of the user's media consumption budget to the purchase of the movie and calculate a viewing impact associated with the movie, e.g., 120 minutes. The media guidance application can use this information to recommend a content purchase to the user and to influence the subscription recommendations the media guidance application will make. In some embodiments, the media guidance application can automate the purchase of the content and ensure the content is available for viewing on the user's devices once the content is released.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some embodiments, the media guidance application predicts the first viewing impact of the first subscription for the upcoming time period based on the amount of time that a subscriber spent viewing content in the first subscription. The media guidance application identifies a set of viewed media assets associated with the first media package that the subscriber previously viewed. The media guidance application identifies the set of viewed media assets so that each media asset in the set of viewed media assets is related to the other media assets in the set of viewed media assets based on one or more characteristics associated with the set of viewed media assets. For example, using the viewing patterns of the subscriber, the media guidance application may identify that the subscriber previously watched four episodes of Game of Thrones associated with a subscription to HBO. The media guidance application determines a total run time of the set of viewed media assets. For example, the media guidance application may determine that the run time of the four Game of Thrones episodes was 200 minutes. The media guidance application determines a viewed run time associated with the subscriber and the set of viewed media assets. Continuing the example, the media guidance application may determine that the subscriber didn't watch all of the run time of the four episodes; instead the subscriber only watched 160 minutes out of the 200 total minutes. The media guidance application determines an upcoming run time of media assets related to the first media package of interest that also share one or more of the characteristics associated with the set of viewed media assets. For example, the media guidance application may determine that the new season of Game of Thrones contains 445 minutes of run time. The media guidance application determines the first viewing impact of the first subscription based on the total run time, the viewed run time, and upcoming run time. For example, the media guidance application determines that the subscriber previously watched 80% of the run time of the Game of Thrones episodes they started. The media guidance application may, therefore, determine that the first viewing impact should only account for 80% of the upcoming run time, or 356 minutes, based on the subscriber's viewing history.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some embodiments, the media guidance application provides an interface that allows the subscriber to configure the amount of time the media guidance application assumes the subscriber will spend watching media content. The media guidance application generates, for display in a media guidance application, a subscription management interface. For example, the media guidance application may present subscriber interface screens that comprise textual representation of options for configuration. The media guidance application may generate textboxes, sliders, numerical input boxes, combination text-icon input, wheels, or other input elements appropriate for receiving input from the subscriber. The media guidance application obtains, from the subscriber, a time budget input. The time budget input representative of the amount of time the media guidance application should use for the amount of media content the subscriber can consume when determining whether the subscriber is over-subscribed to media content subscriptions. The media guidance application adjusts the available amount of time based on the time budget input.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some embodiments, the media guidance application modifies the subscriber's subscriptions to media content subscriptions. In these embodiments, the media guidance application responds to selecting the first subscription and not selecting the second subscription by generating a subscription modification message associated with the second subscription. The media guidance application transmits the subscription modification message to a subscription management server. For example, the media guidance application generates the subscription modification message to indicate the second subscription should be cancelled and transmits the subscription modification message to a server associated with the second subscription. It may be that the media guidance application determined that Netflix should be cancelled for the upcoming time period. Therefore, the media guidance application generates a message to send to Netflix's servers that tells Netflix to cancel the subscriber's subscription to Netflix. For example, the media guidance application may contact a web service using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) formatted requests to send to a subscription management server. The media guidance application also generates, for display to the subscriber, a notification indicating the subscription modification message was transmitted to the subscription management server.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some embodiments, the subscriber can confirm or reject the recommendations made by the media guidance application. When the media guidance application determines that a subscription should be cancelled, it presents the option to the subscriber with an appropriate input to confirm the recommendation. The media guidance application generates, for display to a subscriber, a subscription modification confirmation based on not selecting the second subscription. The media guidance application receives, from a subscriber, input indicating whether to cancel the second subscription. If the subscriber confirms the recommendation, the media guidance application leaves the second subscription unselected. If the subscriber rejects the recommendation, the media guidance application changes the selection state of the second subscription by selecting the second subscription.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some embodiments, the media guidance application also bases subscription recommendations on whether media content will become available at a later time. The media guidance application determines whether the media content related to the first release schedule will be available during a second time period that is subsequent to the upcoming time period. In response to determining that the media content related to the first release schedule will be available during a second time period, the media guidance application will modify the selection of the first subscription by not selecting the first subscription. For example, the media guidance application may determine that Game of Thrones will be available at a later time on Amazon Prime. And because the subscriber has Amazon Prime for shopping, the media guidance application considers this to be a free, or relatively inexpensive, media content subscription. Therefore, the media guidance application may determine that it will be far more efficient for the subscriber to wait additional time to watch Game of Thrones through Amazon Prime instead of paying for an HBO subscription. In some embodiments, the media guidance application may receive a preference from the subscriber for whether to cancel subscriptions in lieu of later release. In still other embodiments, the media guidance application may analyze the subscriber's viewing patterns to determine whether to cancel the subscription in lieu of a later release of content on another service.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some embodiments, the media guidance application makes recommendations, based in part on the amount of money the subscriber spends on subscriptions. The media guidance application generates, for display to a subscriber, a subscription management interface. The media guidance application obtains, from the subscriber using the subscription management interface, a subscription resources threshold. For example, the media guidance application may receive a budget from the subscriber for the subscriber's period expenditures on media content subscriptions, e.g., $165/month. The media guidance application determines a first subscription resources impact associated with the first subscription. For example, the media guidance application may determine that HBO costs the subscriber $15/month. The media guidance application determines a second subscription resources impact associated with the second subscription. For example, the media guidance application may determine that Netflix costs the subscriber $10/month. The media guidance application modifies the subscription recommendation based on comparing the first subscription resources impact, the second subscription resources impact, and the subscription resources threshold. For example, the media guidance application may determine that the subscriber's budget for monthly media consumption is $165. The media guidance application may also determine that subscriptions to services beyond HBO and Netflix, perhaps the subscriber's cable and internet bill, account for $155. Thus, the subscriber may have only $10 of remaining budget to allocate between HBO and Netflix in this example. The media guidance application may, therefore, determine that the subscriber does not have resources to maintain the HBO subscription and will determine, instead, to cancel the HBO subscription.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some embodiments, the media guidance application may optimize entertainment spending for the subscriber. For example, the media guidance application may work with a set entertainment budget (e.g., $100 a month), to optimize spending for purchasing content and content subscriptions. As discussed herein, the media guidance application may track the subscriber's viewing habits to determine what media content the subscriber watches and when. For example, the media guidance application may determine that the subscriber watches Game of Thrones on HBO and doesn't watch any other shows on HBO. The media guidance application may recommend subscribing to HBO during the time period when new episodes of Game of Thrones are released and recommend cancelling the HBO subscription during other times. The media guidance application may also add and cancel subscriptions based on the currently available catalogue of content on a certain subscription service. For example, the media guidance application may add Netflix to the subscriber's subscriptions when determining that the subscriber's favorite show is available on Netflix. The media guidance application may also determine whether it is more efficient, from a budget perspective, to buy content (e.g., the full series of Game of Thrones) rather than carry a monthly subscription for content of limited interest to the user.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some embodiments, the media guidance application may manage the subscriber's content purchases. For example, the media guidance application may determine whether content providers create a spot market for content. For example, content providers may provide dynamic pricing for movies and television shows. The media guidance application may determine that pricing for media content may be lower if the subscriber buys the media content far in advance of the release date (e.g., before any reviews about the content are out). The media guidance application may also determine whether the media content price will be lower if the subscriber buys a season pass versus buying episodes individually.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some embodiments, the media guidance application may also allow subscribers to sell their own content. For example, the media guidance application may allow the subscribers to sell their Facebook&#x2122; live videos, Periscopes&#x2122;, created content, etc. The media guidance application may create an interface where the subscriber can upload, edit, and release content. The media guidance application may also allow the subscriber to sell advertising space within his/her released content, as well as sell the media content itself.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some embodiments, the media guidance application may defragment subscriptions and allow multiple subscribers, not within the same household, to share subscriptions. The media guidance application may manage the subscription sharing using a payment application, such as Venmo&#x2122;. The media guidance application may split up the cost of the subscription evenly between the subscribers sharing the subscription, or may take a more dynamic approach and split up the subscription based on the percentage of use from each subscriber (e.g., a first subscriber watched 90 hours of Netflix for the month, while a second subscriber only watched 10 hours, so the first subscriber may pay 90% of the subscription cost while the second subscriber may pay 10% of the subscription cost).</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments, the media guidance application may also manage and optimize the entertainment budget for all of the subscriber's entertainment needs (e.g., concerts, plays, etc.).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0000">The media guidance application may also provide a summary of the subscriber's viewing history. For example, the media guidance application may display a pie chart representing the use based on the services and subscriptions that the subscriber used in a previous time period (e.g., a month) of time. The media guidance may also display the cost associated with each service and determine whether the subscriber is efficiently subscribing to services depending on how frequently the subscriber uses the services.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0031" num="0029">The above and other objects and advantages of the disclosure will be apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like reference characters refer to like parts throughout, and in which:</p><p id="p-0032" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts an illustrative embodiment of a display screen that may be used to manage a plurality of subscriptions to a plurality of media packages in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0033" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts an illustrative embodiment of a display screen that may be used to manage subscription time allocations in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0034" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> depicts an illustrative embodiment of a display screen that may be used to manage a subscription budget in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0035" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows an illustrative embodiment of a display screen that may be used to provide media guidance application listings and other media guidance information, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0036" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows another illustrative embodiment of a display screen that may be used to provide media guidance application listings, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0037" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a block diagram of an illustrative user equipment (UE) device in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0038" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a block diagram of an illustrative media system in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0039" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> depicts an illustrative flowchart of a process for managing a plurality of subscriptions to a plurality of media packages, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0040" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> depicts an illustrative flowchart of a process for determining a media package of interest, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0041" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> depicts an illustrative flowchart of a process for predicting a viewing impact associated with a media content subscription, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0042" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> depicts an illustrative flowchart of a process for modifying the subscription recommendation based on subscription resources impact, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0043" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> depicts an illustrative flowchart of a process for generating a subscription recommendation, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0044" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> depicts an illustrative flowchart of a process for modifying a subscription recommendation, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0045" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> depicts an illustrative flowchart of a process for receiving confirmation of subscription modifications, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure; and</p><p id="p-0046" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> depicts an illustrative flowchart of a process for adjusting the available viewing time based on subscriber input, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0047" num="0045">Accordingly, systems and methods for managing a plurality of subscriptions to a plurality of media packages are provided herein. For example, a media guidance application may determine that a subscription period is near completion and that the subscriber will need to make a new payment on the upcoming media content subscription to maintain it. For example, the subscriber's HBO subscription may bill out in 3-days. The media guidance application may then determine whether the subscriber is likely to watch media content associated with the upcoming media content subscription during the next billing cycle. For example, the media guidance application may determine whether new episodes of shows the subscriber has watched in the past are being released in the next month. The media guidance application may also, based on the subscriber's viewing history, determine how much time the subscriber typically spends watching media content in the upcoming period, i.e., in the next billing cycle, and how much of that time the media guidance application predicts the subscriber will spend watching media content outside of the upcoming media content subscription. If the media guidance application predicts that the subscriber will spend a significant amount of time watching content on other subscriptions, for example, the media guidance application may determine that the subscriber should cancel the upcoming media content subscription for the next billing cycle. In some embodiments, the media guidance application may also transmit a message to a subscription management server to cancel the upcoming media content subscription on behalf of the subscriber.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts an illustrative embodiment of a display screen that may be used to manage a plurality of subscriptions to a plurality of media packages in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts a media guidance application <b>100</b> which may be implemented on user equipment by control circuitry. The functionality of user equipment,</p><p id="p-0049" num="0000">control circuitry, and the media guidance application is described in further detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0047">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the media guidance application <b>100</b> is generating playback of a media asset. For example, the media guidance application <b>100</b> may be showing an episode of Mr. Roger's Neighborhood. The media guidance application <b>100</b> may generate a subscription recommendation including a recommendation that the subscriber cancel a media content subscription. For example, the media guidance application <b>100</b> obtains viewing patterns of a subscriber that has a plurality of subscriptions to media content, i.e., media content subscriptions. The media guidance application <b>100</b> may receive a listing of dates, times, channels, program metadata, ratings information, duration of viewing, channel change indications, or other data associated with a subscriber's consumption of media content. In a multi-subscriber home, the media guidance application <b>100</b> may obtain view patterns for each subscriber in the home as a single collection of patterns per subscriber or a combined collection of patterns for all users.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0048">The media guidance application <b>100</b> determines, based on the viewing patterns of the subscriber, a first media package of interest to the subscriber from the plurality of media packages. The first media package of interest is related to a first subscription. For example, the media guidance application <b>100</b> may receive viewing patterns that indicate that a subscriber is subscribed to HBO, a premium television package. From the viewing patterns, the media guidance application <b>100</b> may determine that a subscriber watches the HBO program Game of Thrones&#x2122;, an episodic show released through HBO's premium service. The media guidance application <b>100</b> may further determine that the subscriber watches Game of Thrones episodes as soon as a new episode is released on HBO. In this example, Game of Thrones is a media package of interest related to the HBO subscription based on the subscriber's viewing patterns.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0049">In some embodiments, the media guidance application <b>100</b> determines the first media package of interest to the subscriber from a plurality of media packages using the total viewing time of a subscription and viewing time associated with a candidate media package. For example, the media guidance application <b>100</b> may determine that the subscriber subscribes to HBO and HBO is releasing a new season of Game of Thrones and a new season of Westworld&#x2122;. Both Game of Thrones and Westworld are media packages related to a first subscription, HBO. The media guidance application <b>100</b> determines a total viewing time associated with the subscriber and the plurality of media packages based on the viewing patterns of the subscriber. For example, the media guidance application <b>100</b> may determine that the subscriber historically spends approximately 300 minutes viewing HBO shows in July and August. The media guidance application <b>100</b> determines a candidate media package from the plurality of media packages. For example, the media guidance application <b>100</b> may determine that Game of Thrones is a potential media package of interest because the subscriber historically watches Game of Thrones during the upcoming time period, perhaps July and August. The media guidance application <b>100</b> determines a candidate media package viewing time associated with the subscriber and the candidate media package. Continuing the example, the media guidance application <b>100</b> may determine that the upcoming run time of Game of Thrones for July and August is 445 minutes. The media guidance application <b>100</b> identifies the candidate media package as the first media package of interest based on a comparison of the total viewing time and the first package viewing time. For example, the media guidance application <b>100</b> may determine that Game of Thrones is an important media package from the HBO subscription because its run time accounts for a large amount of time in comparison to the subscriber's historical consumption of HBO for the same time period.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0050">The media guidance application <b>100</b> continues by determining, based on the viewing patterns of the subscriber, a second media package of interest to the subscriber from the plurality of media packages, the second media package of interest related to a second subscription. For example, the media guidance application <b>100</b> may determine that a subscriber is subscribed to Netflix, an online streamlining service. From the subscriber's viewing history, the media guidance application <b>100</b> may determine that the subscriber watches episodes of Mindhunter&#x2122;, an episodic show released through Netflix's service. In this example, the media guidance application <b>100</b> may determine that the subscriber watched an entire season of Mindhunter in one sitting, a behavior sometime referred to as binge watching. Based on this viewing pattern, the media guidance application <b>100</b> may determine that Mindhunter is a media package of interest related to the Netflix subscription. For example, the media guidance application <b>100</b> may determine the second media package of interest to the subscriber based on the total viewing time of a subscription and viewing time associated with a candidate media package.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0051">The media guidance application <b>100</b> obtains a first release schedule related to media content in the first media package to be released in an upcoming time period. Carrying through with the example above, new seasons of Game of Thrones were historically released during the summer months. In this example, the media guidance application <b>100</b> may obtain a schedule of new episodes of Game of Thrones from an upcoming season that will be released in the summer. The media guidance application <b>100</b> also obtains a second release schedule related to media content in the second media package to be released in the upcoming time period. In this case, the media guidance application <b>100</b> may determine that a new season of Mindhunter will be released all at once in the fall, perhaps October.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0052">The media guidance application <b>100</b> predicts, using the first release schedule and the viewing patterns of the subscriber, a first viewing impact of the first subscription for the upcoming time period. The media guidance application <b>100</b> predicts the first viewing impact to indicate a total predicted amount of time that a subscriber will spend viewing the first media package in the upcoming time period. For example, the media guidance application <b>100</b> may determine that the upcoming season of Game of Thrones will run 445 minutes and, based on the fact that the subscriber's viewing history indicates the subscriber watches the entirety of each Game of Thrones episode, the media guidance application <b>100</b> predicts the subscriber will watch the entirety of each new episode of Game of Thrones as it is released in July and August. Therefore, the media guidance application <b>100</b> predicts that the viewing impact of Game of Thrones will be 445 minutes in the July and August time period. In other examples, the media guidance application <b>100</b> may predict the impact of the media package at different granularities. For example, the media guidance application <b>100</b> predicts the viewing impact on daily, weekly, monthly, seasonally, or yearly basis. The media guidance application <b>100</b> may also determine viewing impact based on a subscription period related to the corresponding media content subscription. For example, the media guidance application <b>100</b> may determine that the subscriber is billed for HBO every month on the ninth, and determine the viewing impact associated with an upcoming release of Game of Thrones between July 9th and August 9th.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0053">The media guidance application <b>100</b> predicts, using the second release schedule and the viewing patterns of the subscriber, a second viewing impact of the second subscription for the upcoming time period. The media guidance application <b>100</b> predicts the second viewing impact to indicate a total predicted amount of time spent viewing the second media package in the upcoming time period. Continuing the prior example, the media guidance application <b>100</b> may predict that the subscriber will consume all of Mindhunter on the day the new season is released, perhaps October 10th. Therefore, the media guidance application <b>100</b> predicts the viewing impact of Mindhunter on October 10th will be, for example, 325 minutes. But the media guidance application <b>100</b> also determines that the viewing impact of Mindhunter outside of October 10th will be nothing.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0054">The media guidance application <b>100</b> determines an available amount of time for viewing media in the upcoming time period. For example, the media guidance application <b>100</b> may determine that a subscriber spends 100 minutes each month viewing media content across all services. And if the upcoming time period is July and August, then the media guidance application <b>100</b> may determine that the available amount of time for viewing media is 200 minutes. In other examples, the media guidance application <b>100</b> may use historical viewing patterns to more accurately determine the available amount of time. For example, the media guidance application <b>100</b> may analyze the subscriber's viewing patterns and determine that, historically, the subscriber consumes 165 minutes of content in July and 120 minutes of content in August. In that example, the available amount of time for viewing media content in July and August is 285 minutes.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0055">The media guidance application <b>100</b> then generates a subscription recommendation for the upcoming time period. The media guidance application <b>100</b> generates the subscription recommendation according to the following process. The media guidance application <b>100</b> selects the first subscription and compares the first viewing impact to the available amount of time. For example, the media guidance application <b>100</b> selects the HBO subscription as a subscription it will recommend the subscriber maintains. The media guidance application <b>100</b> then compares the amount of time available to consume media, perhaps to 285 minutes in July and August, with the viewing impact of the upcoming seasons of Game of Thrones in July and August, perhaps 445 minutes. In response to determining that the first viewing impact is less than the available amount of time, the media guidance application <b>100</b> selects the second subscription and compares a sum of the first viewing impact and the second viewing impact to the available amount of time. For example, the media guidance application <b>100</b> selects the Netflix subscription as a subscription it will recommend the subscriber maintains. The media guidance application <b>100</b> also compares the total viewing impact of Game and Thrones (445 minutes) and Mindhunter (0 minutes) for the months of July and August, 445 minutes total, with the available amount of time for viewing media content, 285 minutes in this example. The media guidance application <b>100</b> determines whether the sum of the viewing impacts exceeds the available amount of time. If the sum of the viewing impacts exceeds the available amount of time, the media guidance application <b>100</b> selects the first subscription and does not select the second subscription. In other words, the media guidance application <b>100</b> changes its recommendation to recommend that the subscriber cancels the Netflix subscription as the subscription is inefficient because the subscriber will not have time to consume media from Netflix based on the predictions made by media guidance application <b>100</b>. In another example, the media guidance application <b>100</b> may determine that the subscriber should cancel a subscription because the viewing impact associated with that subscription is zero for the relevant time period.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0056">As used herein, media content subscriptions may encompass many forms of content subscription. For example, a subscriber may subscribe to television programming services, e.g., services provided by companies like Comcast&#x2122;, Verizon&#x2122;, DirecTV&#x2122;, or Dish Network&#x2122;. At the same time, a subscriber may subscribe to premium packages within a television programming service such as HBO&#x2122; or Showtime&#x2122;. In recent years, online streaming services, e.g., HBO Now&#x2122;, Netflix&#x2122;, and Amazon Primer&#x2122; Video, have become popular with media consumers and the subscriber may subscribe to such services. Media content subscriptions may also encompass spot subscriptions, such as pay-per-view events, pay-per-view movies, or video on demand.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0057">In some embodiments, the media guidance application <b>100</b> predicts the first viewing impact of the first subscription for the upcoming time period based on the amount of time that a subscriber spent viewing content in the first subscription. The media guidance application <b>100</b> identifies a set of viewed media assets associated with the first media package that the subscriber previously viewed. The media guidance application <b>100</b> identifies the set of viewed media assets so that each media asset in the set of viewed media assets is related to the other media assets in the set of viewed media assets based on one or more characteristics associated with the set of viewed media assets. For example, using the viewing patterns of the subscriber, the media guidance application <b>100</b> may identify that the subscriber previously watched four episodes of Game of Thrones associated with a subscription to HBO. The media guidance application <b>100</b> determines a total run time of the set of viewed media assets. For example, the media guidance application <b>100</b> may determine that the run time of the four Game of Thrones episodes was 200 minutes. The media guidance application <b>100</b> determines a viewed run time associated with the subscriber and the set of viewed media assets. Continuing the example, the media guidance application <b>100</b> may determine that the subscriber didn't watch all of the run time of the four episodes, instead the subscriber only watched 160 minutes out of the 200 total minutes. The media guidance application <b>100</b> determines an upcoming run time of media assets related to the first media package of interest that also share one or more of the characteristics associated with the set of viewed media assets. For example, the media guidance application <b>100</b> may determine that the new season of Game of Thrones contains 445 minutes of run time. The media guidance application <b>100</b> determines the first viewing impact of the first subscription based on the total run time, the viewed run time, and upcoming run time. For example, the media guidance application <b>100</b> determines that the subscriber previously watched 80% of the run time of the Game of Thrones episodes they started. The media guidance application <b>100</b> may, therefore, determine that the first viewing impact should only account for 80% of the upcoming run time, or 356 minutes, based on the subscriber's viewing history.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0058">In some embodiments, the media guidance application <b>100</b> provides an interface that allows the subscriber to input media packages of interest. For example, the media guidance application <b>100</b> may be unable to detect media packages of interest based on viewing history or the media guidance application <b>100</b> may not have access to viewing history because the user is new to the system. In some embodiments, the user may want to supplement the media guidance application <b>100</b> determination of media packages of interest. Therefore, the media guidance application <b>100</b> may provide a user interface that allows a user to input the names of media packages, shows, series, movies, and other content of interest to be treated similarly to media packages of interest determined by the media guidance application <b>100</b>. Similarly, the media guidance application <b>100</b> may provide user interface elements that allow the user to provide priority values, e.g., numerical values representing the importance of content to the user, to media packages of interest and manually input content. The media guidance application <b>100</b> may use the priority values when making subscription recommendations. For example, media guidance application <b>100</b> may initially determine that a subscription to HBO should be maintained and a subscription to Netflix should be cancelled. But the media guidance application <b>100</b> may also determine that the user has given priority values to content in the Netflix subscription that are higher than priority values for content in the HBO subscription. Based on the priority values, the media guidance application <b>100</b> may recommend that the HBO subscription is cancelled and the Netflix subscription is maintained.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0059">In some embodiments, the media guidance application <b>100</b> provides detailed information of the value of the user's content subscriptions and purchases. The media guidance application <b>100</b> may rank the relative values of all existing media subscriptions as a pie chart of total viewing hours in a month/year. For example, the media guidance application <b>100</b> may use the user's viewing history to determine the user consumed 4000 minutes of content in the year, 3000 minutes from Netflix, 400 minutes from HBO, and 600 minutes from movie purchases. The media guidance application may present a pie chart of the user's viewing habits to visualize this consumption. The media guidance application <b>100</b> may also combine viewing time with the percentage of entertainment costs to make a value determination. For example, if the user spends $15/month ($180/year) and only watches new episodes of Game of Thrones which account for 400 minutes of the user's yearly media consumption, then the media guidance application may determine the user spends $0.45/minute on HBO. The media guidance application <b>100</b> may also determine the user spends $10/month on Netflix and watches a total of 3000 minutes across different content on Netflix, e.g. movies and series. Therefore, the media guidance application <b>100</b> may determine a perceived value for Netflix of $0.04/minute. Thus, Netflix is a greater value per dollar spent in this example. In some embodiments, the media guidance application <b>100</b> may track the perceived value of various subscriptions overtime and provide information to the user demonstrating the change of value over time, e.g., a line graph of value across different time periods. Therefore, the media guidance application <b>100</b> provides the user with unparalleled visibility into the amount of time the user spends consuming along with the value the user receives from various content subscriptions and purchases.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0060">In some embodiments, the media guidance application <b>100</b> provides an interface that allows the subscriber to configure the amount of time the media guidance application <b>100</b> assumes the subscriber will spend watching media content. The media guidance application <b>100</b> generates, for display in a media guidance application, a subscription management interface. For example, the media guidance application <b>100</b> may present subscriber interface screens that comprise textual representation of options for configuration. The media guidance application <b>100</b> may generate textboxes, sliders, numerical input boxes, combination text-icon input, wheels, or other input elements appropriate for receiving input from the subscriber. The media guidance application <b>100</b> obtains, from the subscriber, a time budget input. The time budget input representative of the amount of time the media guidance application <b>100</b> should use for how much media content the subscriber can consume when determining whether the subscriber is over-subscribed to media content subscriptions. The media guidance application <b>100</b> adjusts the available amount of time based on the time budget input.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts an illustrative embodiment of a display screen that may be used to manage subscription time allocations in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure. In some embodiments, the media guidance application <b>100</b> provides a subscription time allocation interface <b>210</b> that allows the subscriber to adjust the amount of time the media guidance application <b>100</b> predicts the user will spend viewing media content associated with various media content subscriptions. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, for example, the subscription time allocation interface <b>210</b> generates a user interface for adjusting the predicted viewing time associated with HBO and Netflix. In some embodiments, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the media guidance application <b>100</b> generates several user interface elements for each media content subscription: an information label, a predicted time input element, a time allocation increase element, and a time allocation decrease element. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the subscriber's Netflix subscription is associated with informational label <b>215</b>, a predicted time input element <b>217</b>, a time allocation increase element <b>220</b> and a time allocation decrease element <b>222</b>. The subscriber's HBO subscription is associated with informational label <b>223</b>, a predicted time input element <b>225</b>, a time allocation increase element <b>227</b> and a time allocation decrease element <b>229</b>. The media guidance application <b>100</b> also generates a complete input element <b>230</b>. During the prediction of the viewing impact of a subscription, the media guidance application <b>100</b> may adjust the predicted viewing impact of the subscription based on the predicted time input element associated with that subscription in the subscription time allocation interface <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0062">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in some embodiments, the media guidance application <b>100</b> modifies the subscriber's subscriptions to media content subscriptions. In these embodiments, the media guidance application <b>100</b> responds to selecting the first subscription and not selecting the second subscription by generating a subscription modification message associated with the second subscription. The media guidance application <b>100</b> transmits the subscription modification message to a subscription management server. For example, the media guidance application <b>100</b> generates the subscription modification message to indicate the second subscription should be cancelled and transmits the subscription modification message to a server associated with the second subscription. It may be that the media guidance application <b>100</b> determined that Netflix should be cancelled for the upcoming time period. Therefore, the media guidance application <b>100</b> generates a message to send to Netflix's servers that tells Netflix to cancel the subscriber's subscription to Netflix. For example, the media guidance application may contact a web service using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) formatted requests to send to a subscription management server. The media guidance application <b>100</b> also generates, for display to the subscriber, a notification indicating the subscription modification message was transmitted to the subscription management server.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0063">In some embodiments, the subscriber can confirm or reject the recommendations made by the media guidance application <b>100</b>. When the media guidance application <b>100</b> determines that a subscription should be cancelled, it presents the option to the subscriber with an appropriate input to confirm the recommendation. The media guidance application <b>100</b> generates, for display to a subscriber, a subscription modification confirmation based on not selecting the second subscription.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0064">For example, the media guidance application <b>100</b> may generate information screen <b>110</b> for display to the subscriber. Information screen <b>110</b> contains information that informs the subscriber that the media guidance application recommends the subscriber cancel the second subscription, e.g., Netflix. The media guidance application generates input elements that allow a user to accept the recommendation, input button <b>115</b>, and allow a user to decline the recommendation, input button <b>117</b>. In some embodiments, the media guidance application <b>100</b> monitors the subscriber's interactions with the system to determine when to generate information screen <b>110</b>. For example, the media guidance application <b>100</b> may detect that a commercial is being displayed to a subscriber and generate information screen <b>110</b> during the commercial. Or the media guidance application <b>100</b> may detect when the subscriber pauses playback of a media asset and generate the information screen <b>100</b> during the pause. In other embodiments, the media guidance application <b>100</b> generates the information screen <b>110</b> in response to the subscriber invoking a subscription management option from a menu system generated by the media guidance application <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0065">In some embodiments, the media guidance application <b>100</b> provides additional details regarding a user's subscriptions and content purchases. For example, the media guidance application <b>100</b> may indicate, in information screen <b>110</b>, that the user can spend 80% of his predicted viewing time watching content in HBO for a cost of $15 for the month. The media guidance application <b>100</b> may also indicate that, based on current budget constraints, that choice would require the user forego his Netflix subscription, at a cost of $10 for the month, and that the Netflix could account for 70% of his predicted viewing time for the month. In some embodiments, the media guidance application <b>100</b> may further call out programming specific to the relevant content subscriptions. For example, the media guidance application <b>100</b> may indicated that the user will have access to Game of Thrones via the recommended HBO subscription and the user will have to forego new episodes of Netflix's Mindhunter for the month. After presenting this information, the media guidance application <b>100</b> may provide fine grain control of each subscription including allowing the user to override the subscription recommendations by, for example, choosing to maintain (i.e., keep active) subscriptions to all media content.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0066">The media guidance application <b>100</b> receives, from a subscriber, input indicating whether to cancel the second subscription. If the subscriber confirms the recommendation, e.g., by clicking input button <b>115</b>, the media guidance application <b>100</b> leaves the second subscription unselected. If the subscriber rejects the recommendation, e.g., by clicking input button <b>117</b>, the media guidance application <b>100</b> changes the selection state of the second subscription by selecting the second subscription.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0067">In some embodiments, the media guidance application <b>100</b> also bases subscription recommendations on whether media content will become available at a later time. The media guidance application <b>100</b> determines whether the media content related to the first release schedule will be available during a second time period that is subsequent to the upcoming time period. In response to determining that the media content related to the first release schedule will be available during a second time period, the media guidance application <b>100</b> will modify the selection of the first subscription by not selecting the first subscription. For example, the media guidance application <b>100</b> may determine that Game of Thrones will be available at a later time on Amazon Prime. And because the subscriber has Amazon Prime for shopping, the media guidance application <b>100</b> considers this to be a free, or relatively inexpensive, media content subscription. Therefore, the media guidance application <b>100</b> may determine that it will be far more efficient for the subscriber to wait additional time to watch Game of Thrones through Amazon Prime instead of paying for an HBO subscription. In some embodiments, the media guidance application <b>100</b> may receive a preference from the subscriber for whether to cancel subscriptions in lieu of later release. In still other embodiments, the media guidance application <b>100</b> may analyze the subscriber's viewing patterns to determine whether to cancel the subscription in lieu of a later release of content on another service.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> depicts an illustrative embodiment of a display screen that may be used to manage a subscription budget in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure. In some embodiments, the media guidance application <b>100</b> makes recommendations, based, in part on the amount of money the subscriber spends on subscriptions. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the media guidance application <b>100</b> generates, for display to a subscriber, a subscription management interface <b>310</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the media guidance application generates the subscription management interface <b>310</b> along with a subscription resources threshold input element <b>317</b> and an informational label <b>315</b>. In some embodiments, the media guidance application <b>100</b> also generates an increase threshold input <b>320</b> and a decrease threshold input <b>322</b> along with a complete input element <b>330</b>. Using the input elements, the media guidance application <b>100</b> obtains, from the subscriber using the subscription management interface, a subscription resources threshold. For example, the media guidance application <b>100</b> may receive a budget from the subscriber for the subscriber's period expenditures on media content subscriptions, e.g., $165/month. The media guidance application <b>100</b> determines a first subscription resources impact associated with the first subscription. For example, the media guidance application <b>100</b> may determine that HBO costs the subscriber $15/month. The media guidance application <b>100</b> determines a second subscription resources impact associated with the second subscription. For example, the media guidance application <b>100</b> may determine that Netflix costs the subscriber $10/month. The media guidance application <b>100</b> modifies the subscription recommendation based on comparing the first subscription resources impact, the second subscription resources impact, and the subscription resources threshold. For example, the media guidance application <b>100</b> may determine that the subscriber's budget for monthly media consumption is $165. The media guidance application <b>100</b> may also determine that subscriptions to services beyond HBO and Netflix, perhaps the subscriber's cable and internet bill, account for $155. Thus, the subscriber may have only $10 of remaining budget to allocate between HBO and Netflix in this example. The media guidance application <b>100</b> may, therefore, determine that the subscriber does not have resources to maintain the HBO subscription and will determine, instead, to cancel the HBO subscription.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0069">As noted above, the media guidance application described herein controls playback of a media asset, particularly in response to receiving a suspend command close in time to an event from calendar information in a user's profile. The amount of content available to users in any given content delivery system can be substantial. Consequently, many users desire a form of media guidance through an interface that allows users to efficiently navigate content selections and easily identify content that they may desire. An application that provides such guidance is referred to herein as an interactive media guidance application or, sometimes, a media guidance application or a guidance application.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0070">Interactive media guidance applications may take various forms depending on the content for which they provide guidance. One typical type of media guidance application is an interactive television program guide. Interactive television program guides (sometimes referred to as electronic program guides) are well-known guidance applications that, among other things, allow users to navigate among and locate many types of content or media assets. Interactive media guidance applications may generate graphical user interface screens that enable a user to navigate among, locate and select content. As referred to herein, the terms &#x201c;media asset&#x201d; and &#x201c;content&#x201d; should be understood to mean an electronically consumable user asset, such as television programming, as well as pay-per-view programs, on-demand programs (as in video-on-demand (VOD) systems), Internet content (e.g., streaming content, downloadable content, Webcasts, etc.), video clips, audio, content information, pictures, rotating images, documents, playlists, websites, articles, books, electronic books, blogs, chat sessions, social media, applications, games, and/or any other media or multimedia and/or combination of the same. Guidance applications also allow users to navigate among and locate content. As referred to herein, the term &#x201c;multimedia&#x201d; should be understood to mean content that utilizes at least two different content forms described above, for example, text, audio, images, video, or interactivity content forms. Content may be recorded, played, displayed or accessed by user equipment devices, but can also be part of a live performance.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0071">The media guidance application and/or any instructions for performing any of the embodiments discussed herein may be encoded on computer readable media.

Various devices and platforms that may implement media guidance applications are described in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0073">One of the functions of the media guidance application is to provide media guidance data to users. As referred to herein, the phrase &#x201c;media guidance data&#x201d; or &#x201c;guidance data&#x201d; should be understood to mean any data related to content or data used in operating the guidance application. For example, the guidance data may include program information, guidance application settings, user preferences, user profile information, media listings, media-related information (e.g., broadcast times, broadcast channels, titles, descriptions, ratings information (e.g., parental control ratings, critic's ratings, etc.), genre or category information, actor information, logo data for broadcasters' or providers' logos, etc.), media format (e.g., standard definition, high definition, 3D, etc.), on-demand information, blogs, websites, and any other type of guidance data that is helpful for a user to navigate among and locate desired content selections.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>5</b></figref> show illustrative display screens that may be used to provide media guidance data.

A personalized media guidance application allows a user to customize displays and features to create a personalized &#x201c;experience&#x201d; with the media guidance application. This personalized experience may be created by allowing a user to input these customizations and/or by the media guidance application monitoring user activity to determine various user preferences. Users may access their personalized guidance application by logging in or otherwise identifying themselves to the guidance application. Customization of the media guidance application may be made in accordance with a user profile. The customizations may include varying presentation schemes (e.g., color scheme of displays, font size of text, etc.), aspects of content listings displayed (e.g., only HDTV or only 3D programming, user-specified broadcast channels based on favorite channel selections, re-ordering the display of channels, recommended content, etc.), desired recording features (e.g., recording or series recordings for particular users, recording quality, etc.), parental control settings, customized presentation of Internet content (e.g., presentation of social media content, e-mail, electronically delivered articles, etc.) and other desired customizations.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0081">The media guidance application may allow a user to provide user profile information or may automatically compile user profile information. The media guidance application may, for example, monitor the content the user accesses and/or other interactions the user may have with the guidance application. Additionally, the media guidance application may obtain all or part of other user profiles that are related to a particular user (e.g., from other web sites on the Internet the user accesses, such as www.Tivo.com, from other media guidance applications the user accesses, from other interactive applications the user accesses, from another user equipment device of the user, etc.), and/or obtain information about the user from other sources that the media guidance application may access. As a result, a user can be provided with a unified guidance application experience across the user's different user equipment devices. This type of user experience is described in greater detail below in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.

Video mosaic display <b>500</b> includes selectable options <b>502</b> for content information organized based on content type, genre, and/or other organization criteria. In display <b>500</b>, television listings option <b>504</b> is selected, thus providing listings <b>506</b>, <b>508</b>, <b>510</b>, and <b>512</b> as broadcast program listings. In display <b>500</b> the listings may provide graphical images including cover art, still images from the content, video clip previews, live video from the content, or other typcs of contcnt that indicate to a user the content being described by the media guidance data in the listing. Each of the graphical listings may also be accompanied by text to provide further information about the content associated with the listing. For example, listing <b>508</b> may include more than one portion, including media portion <b>514</b> and text portion <b>516</b>. Media portion <b>514</b> and/or text portion <b>516</b> may be selectable to view content in full-screen or to view information related to the content displayed in media portion <b>514</b> (e.g., to view listings for the channel that the video is displayed on).</p><p id="p-0086" num="0083">The listings in display <b>500</b> are of different sizes (i.e., listing <b>506</b> is larger than listings <b>508</b>, <b>510</b>, and <b>512</b>), but if desired, all the listings may be the same size.

Control circuitry <b>604</b> may be used to send and receive commands, requests, and other suitable data using I/O path <b>602</b>. I/O path <b>602</b> may connect control circuitry <b>604</b> (and specifically processing circuitry <b>606</b>) to one or more communications paths (described below). I/O functions may be provided by one or more of these communications paths, but are shown as a single path in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> to avoid overcomplicating the drawing.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0085">Control circuitry <b>604</b> may be based on any suitable processing circuitry such as processing circuitry <b>606</b>. As referred to herein, processing circuitry should be understood to mean circuitry based on one or more microprocessors, microcontrollers, digital signal processors, programmable logic devices, field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), etc., and may include a multi-core processor (e.g., dual-core, quad-core, hexa-core, or any suitable number of cores) or supercomputer. In some embodiments, processing circuitry may be distributed across multiple separate processors or processing units, for example, multiple of the same type of processing units (e.g., two Intel Core 17 processors) or multiple different processors (e.g., an Intel Core i5 processor and an Intel Core i7 processor). In some embodiments, control circuitry <b>604</b> executes instructions for a media guidance application stored in memory (i.e., storage <b>608</b>). Specifically, control circuitry <b>604</b> may be instructed by the media guidance application to perform the functions discussed above and below. For example, the media guidance application may provide instructions to control circuitry <b>604</b> to generate the media guidance displays. In some implementations, any action performed by control circuitry <b>604</b> may be based on instructions received from the media guidance application.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0086">In client-server based embodiments, control circuitry <b>604</b> may include communications circuitry suitable for communicating with a guidance application server or other networks or servers. The instructions for carrying out the above mentioned functionality may be stored on the guidance application server. Communications circuitry may include a cable modem, an integrated services digital network (ISDN) modem, a digital subscriber line (DSL) modem, a telephone modem, Ethernet card, or a wireless modem for communications with other equipment, or any other suitable communications circuitry. Such communications may involve the Internet or any other suitable communications networks or paths (which is described in more detail in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>). In addition, communications circuitry may include circuitry that enables peer-to-peer communication of user equipment devices, or communication of user equipment devices in locations remote from each other (described in more detail blow).</p><p id="p-0090" num="0087">Memory may be an electronic storage device provided as storage <b>608</b> that is part of control circuitry <b>604</b>. As referred to herein, the phrase &#x201c;electronic storage device&#x201d; or &#x201c;storage device&#x201d; should be understood to mean any device for storing electronic data, computer software, or firmware, such as random-access memory, read-only memory, hard drives, optical drives, digital video disc (DVD) recorders, compact disc (CD) recorders, BLU-RAY disc (BD) recorders, BLU-RAY 3D disc recorders, digital video recorders (DVR, sometimes called a personal video recorder, or PVR), solid state devices, quantum storage devices, gaming consoles, gaming media, or any other suitable fixed or removable storage devices, and/or any combination of the same. Storage <b>608</b> may be used to store various types of content described herein as well as media guidance data described above. Nonvolatile memory may also be used (e.g., to launch a boot-up routine and other instructions). Cloud-based storage, described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, may be used to supplement storage <b>608</b> or instead of storage <b>608</b>.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0088">Control circuitry <b>604</b> may include video generating circuitry and tuning circuitry, such as one or more analog tuners, one or more MPEG-2 decoders or other digital decoding circuitry, high-definition tuners, or any other suitable tuning or video circuits or combinations of such circuits. Encoding circuitry (e.g., for converting over-the-air, analog, or digital signals to MPEG signals for storage) may also be provided. Control circuitry <b>604</b> may also include scaler circuitry for upconverting and downconverting content into the preferred output format of the user equipment <b>600</b>. Circuitry <b>604</b> may also include digital-to-analog converter circuitry and analog-to-digital converter circuitry for converting between digital and analog signals. The tuning and encoding circuitry may be used by the user equipment device to receive and to display, to play, or to record content. The tuning and encoding circuitry may also be used to receive guidance data. The circuitry described herein, including for example, the tuning, video generating, encoding, decoding, encrypting, decrypting, scaler, and analog/digital circuitry, may be implemented using software running on one or more general purpose or specialized processors. Multiple tuners may be provided to handle simultaneous tuning functions (e.g., watch and record functions, picture-in-picture (PIP) functions, multiple-tuner recording, etc.). If storage <b>608</b> is provided as a separate device from user equipment <b>600</b>, the tuning and encoding circuitry (including multiple tuners) may be associated with storage <b>608</b>.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0089">A user may send instructions to control circuitry <b>604</b> using user input interface <b>610</b>. User input interface <b>610</b> may be any suitable user interface, such as a remote control, mouse, trackball, keypad, keyboard, touch screen, touchpad, stylus input, joystick, voice recognition interface, or other user input interfaces. Display <b>612</b> may be provided as a stand-alone device or integrated with other elements of user equipment device <b>600</b>. For example, display <b>612</b> may be a touchscreen or touch-sensitive display. In such circumstances, user input interface <b>610</b> may be integrated with or combined with display <b>612</b>. Display <b>612</b> may be one or more of a monitor, a television, a liquid crystal display (LCD) for a mobile device, amorphous silicon display, low temperature poly silicon display, electronic ink display, electrophoretic display, active matrix display, electro-wetting display, electrofluidic display, cathode ray tube display, light-emitting diode display, electroluminescent display, plasma display panel, high-performance addressing display, thin-film transistor display, organic light-emitting diode display, surface-conduction electron-emitter display (SED), laser television, carbon nanotubes, quantum dot display, interferometric modulator display, or any other suitable equipment for displaying visual images. In some embodiments, display <b>612</b> may be HDTV-capable. In some embodiments, display <b>612</b> may be a 3D display, and the interactive media guidance application and any suitable content may be displayed in 3D. A video card or graphics card may generate the output to the display <b>612</b>. The video card may offer various functions such as accelerated rendering of 3D scenes and 2D graphics, MPEG-2/MPEG-4 decoding, TV output, or the ability to connect multiple monitors. The video card may be any processing circuitry described above in relation to control circuitry <b>604</b>. The video card may be integrated with the control circuitry <b>604</b>. Speakers <b>614</b> may be provided as integrated with other elements of user equipment device <b>600</b> or may be stand-alone units. The audio component of videos and other content displayed on display <b>612</b> may be played through speakers <b>614</b>. In some embodiments, the audio may be distributed to a receiver (not shown), which processes and outputs the audio via speakers <b>614</b>.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0090">The guidance application may be implemented using any suitable architecture. For example, it may be a stand-alone application wholly-implemented on user equipment device <b>600</b>. In such an approach, instructions of the application are stored locally (e.g., in storage <b>608</b>), and data for use by the application is downloaded on a periodic basis (e.g., from an out-of-band feed, from an Internet resource, or using another suitable approach). Control circuitry <b>604</b> may retrieve instructions of the application from storage <b>608</b> and process the instructions to generate any of the displays discussed herein. Based on the processed instructions, control circuitry <b>604</b> may determine what action to perform when input is received from input interface <b>610</b>. For example, movement of a cursor on a display up/down may be indicated by the processed instructions when input interface <b>610</b> indicates that an up/down button was selected.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0091">In some embodiments, the media guidance application is a client-server based application. Data for use by a thick or thin client implemented on user equipment device <b>600</b> is retrieved on-demand by issuing requests to a server remote to the user equipment device <b>600</b>. In one example of a client-server based guidance application, control circuitry <b>604</b> runs a web browser that interprets web pages provided by a remote server. For example, the remote server may store the instructions for the application in a storage device. The remote server may process the stored instructions using circuitry (e.g., control circuitry <b>604</b>) and generate the displays discussed above and below. The client device may receive the displays generated by the remote server and may display the content of the displays locally on equipment device <b>600</b>. This way, the processing of the instructions is performed remotely by the server while the resulting displays are provided locally on equipment device <b>600</b>. Equipment device <b>600</b> may receive inputs from the user via input interface <b>610</b> and transmit those inputs to the remote server for processing and generating the corresponding displays. For example, equipment device <b>600</b> may transmit a communication to the remote server indicating that an up/down button was selected via input interface <b>610</b>. The remote server may process instructions in accordance with that input and generate a display of the application corresponding to the input (e.g., a display that moves a cursor up/down). The generated display is then transmitted to equipment device <b>600</b> for presentation to the user.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0092">In some embodiments, the media guidance application is downloaded and interpreted or otherwise run by an interpreter or virtual machine (run by control circuitry <b>604</b>). In some embodiments, the guidance application may be encoded in the ETV Binary Interchange Format (EBIF), received by control circuitry <b>604</b> as part of a suitable feed, and interpreted by a user agent running on control circuitry <b>604</b>. For example, the guidance application may be an EBIF application. In some embodiments, the guidance application may be defined by a series of JAVA-based files that are received and run by a local virtual machine or other suitable middleware executed by control circuitry <b>604</b>. In some of such embodiments (e.g., those employing MPEG-2 or other digital media encoding schemes), the guidance application may be, for example, encoded and transmitted in an MPEG-2 object carousel with the MPEG audio and video packets of a program.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0093">User equipment device <b>600</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> can be implemented in system <b>700</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> as user television equipment <b>702</b>, user computer equipment <b>704</b>, wireless user communications device <b>706</b>, or any other type of user equipment suitable for accessing content, such as a non-portable gaming machine. For simplicity, these devices may be referred to herein collectively as user equipment or user equipment devices, and may be substantially similar to user equipment devices described above. User equipment devices, on which a media guidance application may be implemented, may function as a standalone device or may be part of a network of devices. Various network configurations of devices may be implemented and are discussed in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0094">A user equipment device utilizing at least some of the system features described above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> may not be classified solely as user television equipment <b>702</b>, user computer equipment <b>704</b>, or a wireless user communications device <b>706</b>. For example, user television equipment <b>702</b> may, like some user computer equipment <b>704</b>, be Internet-enabled allowing for access to Internet content, while user computer equipment <b>704</b> may, like some television equipment <b>702</b>, include a tuner allowing for access to television programming. The media guidance application may have the same layout on various different typcs of user equipment or may be tailored to the display capabilities of the user equipment. For example, on user computer equipment <b>704</b>, the guidance application may be provided as a web site accessed by a web browser. In another example, the guidance application may be scaled down for wireless user communications devices <b>706</b>.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0095">In system <b>700</b>, there is typically more than one of each type of user equipment device but only one of each is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> to avoid overcomplicating the drawing. In addition, each user may utilize more than one type of user equipment device and also more than one of each type of user equipment device.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0096">In some embodiments, a user equipment device (e.g., user television equipment <b>702</b>, user computer equipment <b>704</b>, wireless user communications device <b>706</b>) may be referred to as a &#x201c;second screen device.&#x201d; For example, a second screen device may supplement content presented on a first user equipment device. The content presented on the second screen device may be any suitable content that supplements the content presented on the first device. In some embodiments, the second screen device provides an interface for adjusting settings and display preferences of the first device. In some embodiments, the second screen device is configured for interacting with other second screen devices or for interacting with a social network. The second screen device can be located in the same room as the first device, a different room from the first device but in the same house or building, or in a different building from the first device.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0097">The user may also set various settings to maintain consistent media guidance application settings across in-home devices and remote devices. Settings include those described herein, as well as channel and program favorites, programming preferences that the guidance application utilizes to make programming recommendations, display preferences, and other desirable guidance settings. For example, if a user sets a channel as a favorite on, for example, the web site www.Tivo.com on their personal computer at their office, the same channel would appear as a favorite on the user's in-home devices (e.g., user television equipment and user computer equipment) as well as the user's mobile devices, if desired. Therefore, changes made on one user equipment device can change the guidance experience on another user equipment device, regardless of whether they are the same or a different type of user equipment device. In addition, the changes made may be based on settings input by a user, as well as user activity monitored by the guidance application.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0098">The user equipment devices may be coupled to communications network <b>714</b>. Namely, user television equipment <b>702</b>, user computer equipment <b>704</b>, and wireless user communications device <b>706</b> are coupled to communications network <b>714</b> via communications paths <b>708</b>, <b>710</b>, and <b>712</b>, respectively. Communications network <b>714</b> may be one or more networks including the Internet, a mobile phone network, mobile voice or data network (e.g., a 4G or LTE network), cable network, public switched telephone network, or other types of communications network or combinations of communications networks. Paths <b>708</b>, <b>710</b>, and <b>712</b> may separately or together include one or more communications paths, such as, a satellite path, a fiber-optic path, a cable path, a path that supports Internet communications (e.g., IPTV), free-space connections (e.g., for broadcast or other wireless signals), or any other suitable wired or wireless communications path or combination of such paths. Path <b>712</b> is drawn with dotted lines to indicate that in the exemplary embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> it is a wireless path and paths <b>708</b> and <b>710</b> are drawn as solid lines to indicate they are wired paths (although these paths may be wireless paths, if desired).

(The different types of each of these sources are discussed below.) If desired, content source <b>716</b> and media guidance data source <b>718</b> may be integrated as one source device. Although communications between sources <b>716</b> and <b>718</b> with user equipment devices <b>702</b>, <b>704</b>, and <b>706</b> are shown as through communications network <b>714</b>, in some embodiments, sources <b>716</b> and <b>718</b> may communicate directly with user equipment devices <b>702</b>, <b>704</b>, and <b>706</b> via communication paths (not shown) such as those described above in connection with paths <b>708</b>, <b>710</b>, and <b>712</b>.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0101">Content source <b>716</b> may include one or more types of content distribution equipment including a television distribution facility, cable system headend, satellite distribution facility, programming sources (e.g., television broadcasters, such as NBC, ABC, HBO, etc.), intermediate distribution facilities and/or servers, Internet providers, on-demand media servers, and other content providers. NBC is a trademark owned by the National Broadcasting Company, Inc., ABC is a trademark owned by the American Broadcasting Company, Inc., and HBO is a trademark owned by the Home Box Office, Inc. Content source <b>716</b> may be the originator of content (e.g., a television broadcaster, a Webcast provider, etc.) or may not be the originator of content (e.g., an on-demand content provider, an Internet provider of content of broadcast programs for downloading, etc.). Content source <b>716</b> may include cable sources, satellite providers, on-demand providers, Internet providers, over-the-top content providers, or other providers of content. Content source <b>716</b> may also include a remote media server used to store different types of content (including video content selected by a user), in a location remote from any of the user equipment devices. Systems and methods for remote storage of content, and providing remotely stored content to user equipment are discussed in greater detail in connection with Ellis et al., U.S. Pat. No. 7,761,892, issued Jul. 20, 2010, which is herby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0102">Media guidance data source <b>718</b> may provide media guidance data, such as the media guidance data described above. Media guidance data may be provided to the user equipment devices using any suitable approach. In some embodiments, the guidance application may be a stand-alone interactive television program guide that receives program guide data via a data feed (e.g., a continuous feed or trickle feed). Program schedule data and other guidance data may be provided to the user equipment on a television channel sideband, using an in-band digital signal, using an out-of-band digital signal, or by any other suitable data transmission technique. Program schedule data and other media guidance data may be provided to user equipment on multiple analog or digital television channels.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0103">In some embodiments, guidance data from media guidance data source <b>718</b> may be provided to users' equipment using a client-server approach. For example, a user equipment device may pull media guidance data from a server, or a server may push media guidance data to a user equipment device. In some embodiments, a guidance application client residing on the user's equipment may initiate sessions with source <b>718</b> to obtain guidance data when needed, e.g., when the guidance data is out of date or when the user equipment device receives a request from the user to receive data. Media guidance may be provided to the user equipment with any suitable frequency (e.g., continuously, daily, a user-specified period of time, a system-specified period of time, in response to a request from user equipment, etc.). Media guidance data source <b>718</b> may provide user equipment devices <b>702</b>, <b>704</b>, and <b>706</b> the media guidance application itself or software updates for the media guidance application.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0104">In some embodiments, the media guidance data may include viewer data. For example, the viewer data may include current and/or historical user activity information (e.g., what content the user typically watches, what times of day the user watches content, whether the user interacts with a social network, at what times the user interacts with a social network to post information, what typcs of content the user typically watches (e.g., pay TV or free TV), mood, brain activity information, etc.). The media guidance data may also include subscription data. For example, the subscription data may identify to which sources or services a given user subscribes and/or to which sources or services the given user has previously subscribed but later terminated access (e.g., whether the user subscribes to premium channels, whether the user has added a premium level of services, whether the user has increased Internet speed). In some embodiments, the viewer data and/or the subscription data may identify patterns of a given user for a period of more than one year. The media guidance data may include a model (e.g., a survivor model) used for generating a score that indicates a likelihood a given user will terminate access to a service/source. For example, the media guidance application may process the viewer data with the subscription data using the model to generate a value or score that indicates a likelihood of whether the given user will terminate access to a particular service or source. In particular, a higher score may indicate a higher level of confidence that the user will terminate access to a particular service or source. Based on the score, the media guidance application may generate promotions that entice the user to keep the particular service or source indicated by the score as one to which the user will likely terminate access.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0105">Media guidance applications may be, for example, stand-alone applications implemented on user equipment devices. For example, the media guidance application may be implemented as software or a set of executable instructions which may be stored in storage <b>608</b>, and executed by control circuitry <b>604</b> of a user equipment device <b>600</b>. In some embodiments, media guidance applications may be client-server applications where only a client application resides on the user equipment device, and server application resides on a remote server. For example, media guidance applications may be implemented partially as a client application on control circuitry <b>604</b> of user equipment device <b>600</b> and partially on a remote server as a server application (e.g., media guidance data source <b>718</b>) running on control circuitry of the remote server. When executed by control circuitry of the remote server (such as media guidance data source <b>718</b>), the media guidance application may instruct the control circuitry to generate the guidance application displays and transmit the generated displays to the user equipment devices. The server application may instruct the control circuitry of the media guidance data source <b>718</b> to transmit data for storage on the user equipment. The client application may instruct control circuitry of the receiving user equipment to generate the guidance application displays.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0106">Content and/or media guidance data delivered to user equipment devices <b>702</b>, <b>704</b>, and <b>706</b> may be over-the-top (OTT) content. OTT content delivery allows Internet-enabled user devices, including any user equipment device described above, to receive content that is transferred over the Internet, including any content described above, in addition to content received over cable or satellite connections. OTT content is delivered via an Internet connection provided by an Internet service provider (ISP), but a third party distributes the content. The ISP may not be responsible for the viewing abilities, copyrights, or redistribution of the content, and may only transfer IP packets provided by the OTT content provider. Examples of OTT content providers include YOUTUBE, NETFLIX, and HULU, which provide audio and video via IP packets. YouTube is a trademark owned by Google Inc., Netflix is a trademark owned by Netflix Inc., and Hulu is a trademark owned by Hulu, LLC. OTT content providers may additionally or alternatively provide media guidance data described above. In addition to content and/or media guidance data, providers of OTT content can distribute media guidance applications (e.g., web-based applications or cloud-based applications), or the content can be displayed by media guidance applications stored on the user equipment device.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0107">Media guidance system <b>700</b> is intended to illustrate a number of approaches, or network configurations, by which user equipment devices and sources of content and guidance data may communicate with each other for the purpose of accessing content and providing media guidance. The embodiments described herein may be applied in any one or a subset of these approaches, or in a system employing other approaches for delivering content and providing media guidance. The following four approaches provide specific illustrations of the generalized example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0108">In one approach, user equipment devices may communicate with each other within a home network. User equipment devices can communicate with each other directly via short-range point-to-point communication schemes described above, via indirect paths through a hub or other similar device provided on a home network, or via communications network <b>714</b>. Each of the multiple individuals in a single home may operate different user equipment devices on the home network. As a result, it may be desirable for various media guidance information or settings to be communicated between the different user equipment devices. For example, it may be desirable for users to maintain consistent media guidance application settings on different user equipment devices within a home network, as described in greater detail in Ellis et al., U.S. Patent Publication No. 2005/0251827, filed Jul. 11, 2005. Different types of user equipment devices in a home network may also communicate with each other to transmit content. For example, a user may transmit content from user computer equipment to a portable video player or portable music player.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0109">In a second approach, users may have multiple types of user equipment by which they access content and obtain media guidance. For example, some users may have home networks that are accessed by in-home and mobile devices. Users may control in-home devices via a media guidance application implemented on a remote device. For example, users may access an online media guidance application on a website via a personal computer at their office, or a mobile device such as a PDA or web-enabled mobile telephone. The user may set various settings (e.g., recordings, reminders, or other settings) on the online guidance application to control the user's in-home equipment. The online guide may control the user's equipment directly, or by communicating with a media guidance application on the user's in-home equipment. Various systems and methods for user equipment devices communicating, where the user equipment devices are in locations remote from each other, is discussed in, for example, Ellis et al., U.S. Pat. No. 8,046,801, issued Oct. 25, 2011, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0110">In a third approach, users of user equipment devices inside and outside a home can use their media guidance application to communicate directly with content source <b>716</b> to access content. Specifically, within a home, users of user television equipment <b>702</b> and user computer equipment <b>704</b> may access the media guidance application to navigate among and locate desirable content. Users may also access the media guidance application outside of the home using wireless user communications devices <b>706</b> to navigate among and locate desirable content.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0111">In a fourth approach, user equipment devices may operate in a cloud computing environment to access cloud services. In a cloud computing environment, various types of computing services for content sharing, storage or distribution (e.g., video sharing sites or social networking sites) are provided by a collection of network-accessible computing and storage resources, referred to as &#x201c;the cloud.&#x201d; For example, the cloud can include a collection of server computing devices, which may be located centrally or at distributed locations, that provide cloud-based services to various types of users and devices connected via a network such as the Internet via communications network <b>714</b>. These cloud resources may include one or more content sources <b>716</b> and one or more media guidance data sources <b>718</b>. In addition or in the alternative, the remote computing sites may include other user equipment devices, such as user television equipment <b>702</b>, user computer equipment <b>704</b>, and wireless user communications device <b>706</b>. For example, the other user equipment devices may provide access to a stored copy of a video or a streamed video. In such embodiments, user equipment devices may operate in a peer-to-peer manner without communicating with a central server.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0112">The cloud provides access to services, such as content storage, content sharing, or social networking services, among other examples, as well as access to any content described above, for user equipment devices. Services can be provided in the cloud through cloud computing service providers, or through other providers of online services. For example, the cloud-based services can include a content storage service, a content sharing site, a social networking site, or other services via which user-sourced content is distributed for viewing by others on connected devices. These cloud-based services may allow a user equipment device to store content to the cloud and to receive content from the cloud rather than storing content locally and accessing locally-stored content.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0113">A user may use various content capture devices, such as camcorders, digital cameras with video mode, audio recorders, mobile phones, and handheld computing devices, to record content. The user can upload content to a content storage service on the cloud cither directly, for example, from user computer equipment <b>704</b> or wireless user communications device <b>706</b> having content capture feature. Alternatively, the user can first transfer the content to a user equipment device, such as user computer equipment <b>704</b>. The user equipment device storing the content uploads the content to the cloud using a data transmission service on communications network <b>714</b>. In some embodiments, the user equipment device itself is a cloud resource, and other user equipment devices can access the content directly from the user equipment device on which the user stored the content.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0114">Cloud resources may be accessed by a user equipment device using, for example, a web browser, a media guidance application, a desktop application, a mobile application, and/or any combination of access applications of the same. The user equipment device may be a cloud client that relies on cloud computing for application delivery, or the user equipment device may have some functionality without access to cloud resources. For example, some applications running on the user equipment device may be cloud applications, i.e., applications delivered as a service over the Internet, while other applications may be stored and run on the user equipment device. In some embodiments, a user device may receive content from multiple cloud resources simultaneously. For example, a user device can stream audio from one cloud resource while downloading content from a second cloud resource. Or a user device can download content from multiple cloud resources for more efficient downloading. In some embodiments, user equipment devices can use cloud resources for processing operations such as the processing operations performed by processing circuitry described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0115">As referred herein, the term &#x201c;in response to&#x201d; refers to initiated as a result of.

For example, process <b>800</b> may be executed by control circuitry <b>604</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) as instructed by a media guidance application implemented on a user device (e.g., user equipment devices <b>702</b>, <b>704</b>, and/or <b>706</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>)) in order to manage a plurality of subscriptions to a plurality of media packages. In addition, one or more steps of process <b>800</b> may be incorporated into or combined with one or more steps of any other process or embodiment described herein.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0117"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> depicts an illustrative flowchart of a process for managing a plurality of subscriptions to a plurality of media packages, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure. Process <b>800</b> may be executed by control circuitry <b>604</b> (e.g., in a manner instructed to control circuitry <b>604</b> by the media guidance application). Control circuitry <b>604</b> may be part of user equipment (e.g., user equipment <b>100</b>, which may have any or all of the functionality of user television equipment <b>702</b>, user computer equipment <b>704</b>, and/or wireless communications device <b>706</b>), or of a remote server separated from the user equipment by way of communication network <b>714</b>, or distributed over a combination of both.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0118">Process <b>800</b> begins at <b>805</b>, where control circuitry <b>604</b>, using a media guidance application, obtains viewing patterns of a subscriber to the plurality of subscriptions. For example, the control circuitry <b>604</b> may receive a listing of dates, times, channels, program metadata, ratings information, duration of viewing, channel change indications, or other data associated with a subscriber's consumption of media content. In a multi-subscriber home, the control circuitry <b>604</b> may obtain view patterns for each subscriber in the home as a single collection of patterns per subscriber or a combined collection of patterns for all users.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0119">Process <b>800</b> continues to <b>810</b>, where the control circuitry <b>604</b> determines, based on the viewing patterns of the subscriber, a first media package of interest to the subscriber from a plurality of media packages, the first media package of interest related to a first subscription. For example, the control circuitry <b>604</b> may receive viewing patterns that indicate that a subscriber is subscribed to HBO, a premium television package. From the viewing patterns, the control circuitry <b>604</b> may determine that a subscriber watches the HBO program Game of Thrones&#x2122;, an episodic show released through HBO's premium service. The control circuitry <b>604</b> may further determine that the subscriber watches the Game of Thrones episodes as soon as a new episode is released on HBO. In this example, Game of Thrones is a media package of interest related to the HBO subscription based on the subscriber's viewing patterns. One exemplary embodiment for determining the first media package of interest is described later with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. Process <b>800</b> continues to <b>815</b>.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0120">At <b>815</b>, the control circuitry <b>604</b> determines, based on the viewing patterns of the subscriber, a second media package of interest to the subscriber from the plurality of media packages, the second media package of interest related to a second subscription; obtaining a first release schedule related to media content in the first media package to be released in an upcoming time period. As with <b>810</b>, the control circuitry <b>604</b> may determine the second media package of interest as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0121">Process <b>800</b> continues at <b>820</b>, where the control circuitry <b>604</b> obtains a first release schedule related to media content in the first media package to be released in an upcoming time period. At <b>825</b>, process <b>800</b> obtains a second release schedule related to media content in the second media package to be released in the upcoming time period. For example, new seasons of Game of Thrones have been historically released during summer each year. Thus, the control circuitry <b>604</b> may obtain a schedule of new episodes of Game of Thrones from an upcoming season that will be released in the summer. The control circuitry <b>604</b> may also obtains a second release schedule related to media content in the second media package to be released in the upcoming time period. In this case, the control circuitry <b>604</b> may determine that a new season of Mindhunter will be released all at once in the fall, perhaps October, on Netflix.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0122">The control circuitry <b>604</b> continues process <b>800</b> at <b>830</b>, where the control circuitry <b>604</b> predicts, using the first release schedule and the viewing patterns of the subscriber, a first viewing impact of the first subscription for the upcoming time period, wherein the first viewing impact indicates a total predicted amount of time spent viewing the first media package in the upcoming time period.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0123">Process <b>800</b> continues at <b>835</b>, where the control circuitry <b>604</b> predicts, using the second release schedule and the viewing patterns of the subscriber, a second viewing impact of the second subscription for the upcoming time period, wherein the second viewing impact indicates a total predicted amount of time spent viewing the second media package in the upcoming time period.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0124">At <b>840</b>, the control circuitry <b>604</b> determines an available amount of time for viewing media in the upcoming time period.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0125">Process <b>800</b> continues at <b>845</b>, where the control circuitry <b>604</b> generates a subscription recommendation for the upcoming time period based on the viewing impact of the first subscription, the viewing impact of the second subscription, and the amount of time the subscriber has available to consume media content. One exemplary embodiment for generating the subscription recommendation is described later with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0126">In some embodiments, the control circuitry <b>604</b> may continue process <b>800</b> by generating a subscription modification message associated with the second subscription. The control circuitry <b>604</b> may then transmit that subscription modification message to a subscription management server. Furthermore, the control circuitry <b>604</b> may generate, for display in a media guidance application, a notification indicating the subscription modification message was transmitted to the subscription management server. For example, the control circuitry <b>604</b> may generate a subscription modification message to indicate a second subscription should be cancelled and transmit that subscription modification message to a server associated with the second subscription. It may be that the control circuitry <b>604</b> determined that Netflix should be cancelled for the upcoming time period. Therefore, the control circuitry <b>604</b> generates a message to send to Netflix's servers that tells Netflix to cancel the subscriber's subscription to Netflix. For example, the media guidance application may contact a web service using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) formatted requests to send to a subscription management server.

Both Game of Thrones and Westworld are media packages related to a first subscription, HBO. The control circuitry <b>604</b> determines a total viewing time associated with the subscriber and the plurality of media packages based on the viewing patterns of the subscriber.

Further, the control circuitry <b>604</b> may allow the subscriber to configure the subscription maintenance threshold, e.g., the control circuitry <b>604</b> may provide a user interface for setting the imminence threshold. In some embodiments, the subscription maintenance threshold may provide a ratio or formula that is used by the control circuitry <b>604</b> to compare a predicted impact of a subscription with cost associated with a subscription. For example, if a subscription costs $65/month and has a predicted impact of 6 hours for the upcoming period, that may be considered an inefficient subscription that should be cancelled.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0150"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> depicts an illustrative flowchart of a process for modifying a subscription recommendation, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure. Process <b>1300</b> may be executed by control circuitry <b>604</b> (e.g., in a manner instructed to control circuitry <b>604</b> by the media guidance application). Control circuitry <b>604</b> may be part of user equipment (e.g., user equipment <b>100</b>, which may have any or all of the functionality of user television equipment <b>702</b>, user computer equipment <b>704</b>, and/or wireless communications device <b>706</b>), or of a remote server separated from the user equipment by way of communication network <b>714</b>, or distributed over a combination of both.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0151">Process <b>1300</b> begins at <b>1305</b>, where control circuitry <b>604</b>, using a media guidance application, determines whether the media content related to the first release schedule will be available during a second time period that is subsequent to the upcoming time period. If the content will not be available later, the control circuitry <b>604</b> concludes process <b>1300</b>. If the content will be available at a later time, the control circuitry <b>604</b> continues at <b>1310</b>, where the control circuitry <b>604</b> modifies the selection of the first subscription by not selecting the first subscription. In some embodiments, the control circuitry <b>604</b> further considers subscription cost associated with the first release schedule and the subscription cost associated with the content in the second time period. For example, the control circuitry <b>604</b> may determine that Game of Thrones will be available at a later time on Amazon Prime. And because the subscriber has Amazon Prime for shopping, the control circuitry <b>604</b> considers this to be a free, or relatively inexpensive, media content subscription. Therefore, the control circuitry <b>604</b> may determine that it will be far more efficient for the subscriber to wait additional time to watch Game of Thrones through Amazon Prime instead of paying for an HBO subscription. In some embodiments, the control circuitry <b>604</b> may receive a preference from the subscriber for whether to cancel subscriptions in lieu of later release. In still other embodiments, the control circuitry <b>604</b> may analyze the subscriber's viewing patterns to determine whether to cancel the subscription in lieu of a later release of content on another service.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0152"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> depicts an illustrative flowchart of a process for receiving confirmation of subscription modifications, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure. Process <b>1400</b> may be executed by control circuitry <b>604</b> (e.g., in a manner instructed to control circuitry <b>604</b> by the media guidance application). Control circuitry <b>604</b> may be part of user equipment (e.g., user equipment <b>100</b>, which may have any or all of the functionality of user television equipment <b>702</b>, user computer equipment <b>704</b>, and/or wireless communications device <b>706</b>), or of a remote server separated from the user equipment by way of communication network <b>714</b>, or distributed over a combination of both.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0153">Process <b>1400</b> begins at <b>1405</b>, where control circuitry <b>604</b> may, using a media guidance application, generate for display to a subscriber a subscription modification confirmation based on not selecting the second subscription. At <b>1410</b>, the control circuitry <b>604</b> receives, from a subscriber, input indicating whether to cancel the second subscription. The control circuitry <b>604</b> determines whether the input indicates that the control circuitry <b>604</b> should cancel the second subscription. If the input indicates that the second subscription should be cancelled, the control circuitry <b>604</b> concludes process <b>1400</b>. If the input indicates that the second subscription should not be cancelled, process <b>1400</b> continues at <b>1420</b>. At <b>1420</b>, control circuitry <b>604</b> changes the selection state of the second subscription by selecting the second subscription. Therefore, when the control circuitry <b>604</b> determines that a subscription should be cancelled, it may present an option to the subscriber with an appropriate input to confirm the recommendation.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0154"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> depicts an illustrative flowchart of a process for adjusting the available viewing time based on subscriber input, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure.

The control circuitry <b>604</b> may generate textboxes, sliders, numerical input boxes, combination text-icon input, wheels, or other input elements appropriate for receiving input from the subscriber. At <b>1510</b>, the control circuitry <b>604</b> obtains, from the subscriber, a time budget input representative of the amount of time the control circuitry <b>604</b> should use for the amount of media content the subscriber can consume when determining whether the subscriber is over-subscribed to media content subscriptions.
