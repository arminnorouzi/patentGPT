Recent years witness an increasing number of people dissatisfied with sleep quality due to life rhythm disturbance, stress, or aging, for example. A reduction in sleep quality involves symptoms such as a longer sleep latency (having trouble with falling asleep), early morning awakening (waking up early in the morning), wake after sleep onset (frequent nocturnal awakenings), and deep sleep failure (not feeling well asleep or feeling shallow sleep).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Sleeping pills are used for treatment to improve sleep quality. However, sleeping pills have side effects and some people have anxiety about taking sleeping pills, for example, so that food-derived substances that can improve sleep quality have been developed. For example, Patent Literature 1 discloses an oral sleeping improver containing at least one selected from the group consisting of menthol and a glycoside thereof as an active ingredient.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Ergothioneine is an amino acid found in mushrooms and the like.

id="p-0038" num="0038">The composition for sleep improvement of the present invention contains L-ergothioneine or a salt thereof as an active ingredient.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0039">In the present invention, the term &#x201c;sleep improvement&#x201d; refers to improving sleep quality and/or increasing sleep duration. The composition for sleep improvement of the present invention, which contains L-ergothioneine or a salt thereof as an active ingredient, can improve sleep quality. In one embodiment, L-ergothioneine or a salt thereof is effective in increasing sleep duration. The composition for sleep improvement of the present invention can be used for improving sleep quality and/or increasing sleep duration. In one embodiment, the composition for sleep improvement of the present invention is preferably used for improving sleep quality. L-ergothioneine or a salt thereof is present in natural products and food and beverages, and it is a compound that has been used as a food ingredient. Thus, continuous ingestion of L-ergothioneine or a salt thereof, for example, is less likely to cause problems in terms of safety.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0040">The salt of L-ergothioneine is not limited as long as it is a pharmacologically acceptable salt or a dietary acceptable salt, and it may be either an acid salt or a basic salt. Examples of the acid salt include inorganic acid salts such as hydrochloride, sulfate, nitrate, and phosphate, and organic acid salts such as acetate, citrate, maleate, malate, oxalate, lactate, succinate, fumarate, and propionate. Examples of the basic salt include alkali metal salts such as sodium salt and potassium salt, and alkaline earth metal salts such as calcium salt and magnesium salt.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0041">L-ergothioneine or a salt thereof that can be used may be a chemically synthesized product or a purified extract of a natural product. L-ergothioneine is abundantly present in golden/yellow oyster mushrooms (binomial name: <i>Pleurotus cornucopiae </i>var. <i>citrinopileatus</i>) belonging to the genus <i>Pleurotus </i>of the family Pleurotaceae. L-ergothioneine is also present in mushrooms such as common mushrooms (binomial name: Agaricusbisporus) including white mushroom, cremini mushroom, and portabella mushroom; grey oyster mushroom (binomial name: <i>Pleurotus ostreatus</i>), shiitake (binomial name: <i>Lentinula edodes</i>), hen-of-the-wood (binomial name: <i>Grifola Frondosa</i>), <i>reishi </i>mushuroom (binomial name: <i>Ganoderma lucidum</i>), lion's mane mushroom (binomial name: <i>Hericium erinaceus</i>), <i>Yanagi</i>-<i>matsutake </i>(binomial name: <i>Agrocybe aegerita</i>), girolle (binomial name: <i>Cantharellus cibarius</i>), porcini (binomial name: <i>Boletus edulis</i>), and common morel (binomial name: <i>Morchella esculenta</i>). When L-ergothioneine is obtained from a natural product, preferably, it is extracted from a golden/yellow oyster mushroom, for example. L-ergothioneine or a salt thereof can also be produced by microbial fermentation. An extract containing L-ergothioneine or a salt thereof produced by microbial fermentation or a purified product thereof may be used. L-ergothioneine can be extracted and purified from natural products by known methods. L-ergothioneine or a salt thereof may be in an isolated form. In the present invention, a mushroom extract containing L-ergothioneine or a salt thereof, for example, may be added to the composition of the present invention, as long as the effect of the present invention is obtained.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0042">In the present invention, examples of the sleep quality improvement include reducing sleep latency (time from wakefulness to falling asleep), reducing the number and duration of wake after sleep onset, and increasing the ratio of non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM sleep) duration to total sleep time. In the present invention, for example, the sleep latency, the number and duration of wake after sleep onset, or the ratio of NREM sleep duration to total sleep time can be used as an index for evaluation of sleep quality. NREM sleep latency (latency until the first episode of NREM sleep) can also be used as an index for evaluation of sleep quality. In the case of humans, the NREM sleep duration or sleep latency may be evaluated, for example, by a non-invasive measurement method using an electroencephalograph or the like. The sleep improving effect of the present invention can be evaluated, for example, by orally feeding or orally administering a human or animal subject (e.g., a mouse or rat) with the composition for sleep improvement of the present invention and examining sleep quality or sleep duration after the oral feeding or oral administration by the above-described method or the like.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0043">As shown in Examples described later, stress-induced rats showed a lower sleep quality, a longer sleep latency, increased number and duration of wake after sleep onset, and a reduced NREM sleep duration relative to total sleep time (longer rapid eye movement sleep (REM sleep) time). Rats orally fed with L-ergothioneine showed a reduction in sleep latency which had been increased by stress induction. Ingestion of L-ergothioneine also reduced the number and duration of wake after sleep onset. L-ergothioneine increased the ratio of NREM sleep duration to total sleep time.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0044">In Examples described later, subjects were fed with a food containing L-ergothioneine, and their brain waves during sleep were measured to evaluate sleep quality and sleep duration. According to the results, the ratio of NREM sleep duration to total sleep time was increased by ingestion of L-ergothioneine, compared to non-ingestion. Ingestion of L-ergothioneine also reduced the number and duration of wake after sleep onset. L-ergothioneine acted to reduce NREM sleep latency so as to reduce sleep latency. Further, ingestion of L-ergothioneine resulted in an increased ratio of deep sleep with a tendency of an increase in ratio of NREM sleep stage 3 and a tendency of an increase in 5 power in the first sleep cycle. Ingestion of L-ergothioneine also improved sleep efficiency, for example. Ingestion of L-ergothioneine also increased sleep duration.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0045">Thus, L-ergothioneine or a salt thereof acts to improve sleep, and can be used as an active ingredient of a composition for sleep improvement.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0046">In one embodiment, the composition for sleep improvement of the present invention can be used for at least one sleep improvement selected from the group consisting of reduction in sleep latency, reduction in duration and number of wake after sleep onset, increase in ratio of NREM sleep duration to total sleep time, and increase in sleep duration.

The ratio of NREM sleep stage 1 which was increased in the control food group was significantly suppressed by the intervention of L-ergothioneine. The ratios of NREM sleep stages 2 and 3 which were reduced in the control food group were increased by the intervention of L-ergothioneine. Generally, the intervention of L-ergothioneine increased the ratio of deep sleep.

The number of wake after sleep onset in two hours before waking up is used as an index of early morning awakening, and is known that a smaller number leads to easier waking up. While the control food group showed an increased number of wake after sleep onset, and an increased number of wake after sleep onset in two hours before waking up, which resulted in an increased sleep fragmentation, the intervention of L-ergothioneine significantly suppressed sleep fragmentation.
