When an object including a finger is disposed between a door opening of an automobile body of an automobile and a panel which moves between at least two positions to open and close the opening, and makes contact with a hollow part of the protector when the panel is moved towards a closed position, an electric signal provides an indication that the object is in the opening. The panel includes doors such as a sliding door, a back door, and a sunroof, for example, of a wagon and a station wagon.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A protector <b>10</b> with a sensor couples to a flange F of a sliding door <b>1</b> or the back door, for example, of the wagon illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>.

The protector <b>10</b> includes an installation base member <b>11</b> and a hollow part <b>12</b>. The installation base member <b>11</b> couples to the flange F on the front edge of the sliding door <b>1</b>, and has a substantially U-shaped cross section including an inner-cabin side wall <b>11</b><i>a, </i>an outer-cabin side wall <b>11</b><i>b, </i>and a connecting wall <b>11</b><i>c. </i>The hollow part <b>12</b> is integrally formed with the installation base member <b>11</b>.

The hollow part has the first and second core wires, the first and second conductive parts, and the space. Each of the first and second conductive parts have the respective one of the first and second core wires embedded. The space is positioned between the first and second conductive parts. The first end of the insert is inserted in the hollow part. The second end of the insert includes the insulator that has the tabular shape and protrudes from the hollow part after the insert is fixed in the hollow part. This insulator is easier to hold for die-molding operators, and improves operability. In addition, merely touching the hollow part and this insulator allows the operators to understand the angle of the insert without the need for visual confirmation and to position the insert on the die at once.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In addition, the die-molding material covers the insulator, the first and second core wires, the resistor, the first and second legs, and the first and second wire connection parts on the second end of the insert. The insulator that has the tabular shape reduces the thickness, or dimension, covered with the die-molding material as compared with a conventional protector illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b> to <b>18</b></figref>. This prevents thermal shrinkage after die molding from spoiling appearance, including sink marks on an outer surface. In addition, the insulator that has the tabular shape is simple in configuration and reduces volume.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In addition, the insulator has merely the left side end and the right side end exposed from the part covered with the die-molding material. This configuration improves appearance of the protector as compared with the conventional protector illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b> to <b>18</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In addition, the inner surface of the insulator has the concave part to position the resistor. This configuration simplifies positioning of the insulator relative to the resistor.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In addition, the outer surface of the insulator is closer to the outer side part than the outer surface of the first end of the insert by the distance. Alternatively, the outer surface of the insulator is flush with the outer surface of the first end of the insert, the insert includes the first protrusion on the connection part between the first and second ends of the insert, and the first protrusion is closer to the outer side part than the outer surface of the insulator. Alternatively, the insert includes the second protrusion on the connection part between the first and second ends of the insert, and the second protrusion is closer to the inner side part than the inner surface of the insulator.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The distance, the first protrusion, or the second protrusion functions as a stopper of the insert when the first end of the insert is inserted in the hollow part, and simplifies positioning of the insert.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">This configuration prevents the first end of the insert from advancing too deep inside the space when the first end is inserted from an end of the extrusion molded part and positions the insert on an appropriate position.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In addition, the space has the substantially U-shaped cross section, the opening of the U-shaped cross section faces the installation base member, and the first end of the insert has the substantially same shape as the space. This configuration achieves smooth insertion of the first end and prevents the inserted first end from coming off easily.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In addition, the method includes: forming the insulator into the tabular shape; positioning the insulator on the die with the left side end and the right side end of the insulator abutted on the inner surface of the die; pouring die-molding material into the die; and die molding the second end of the insert. The insulator subjected to the die molding has merely the left side end and the right side end exposed from the surface of the protector. This improves appearance of the protector. In addition, the die in contact with the left side end and the right side end supports the insulator under the die molding, to achieve stable die molding of the insulator.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In addition, the method further includes: providing the inner die that has the first and second projections between the upper die and the lower die of the die; abutting the top ends of the first and second projections on the inner surface of the insulator; positioning the second leg of the resistor between the first and second projections with the entire circumference of the second leg surrounded by the space; and pouring the die-molding material into the space. In other words, the die-molding material flows into the space between the insulator and the resistor as well and stably supports the resistor.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In addition, the inner die that has the first and second projections and are provided between the upper and lower dies achieves downgage of a thick part of a die-molded part. This further prevents the thermal shrinkage after the die molding from spoiling the appearance, including the sink marks on the outer surface.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of the principal components of an upper terminal part of a protector according to an embodiment of the present invention with a sensor;</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an enlarged perspective view of an insert of the protector illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is an enlarged front view of the insert of the protector illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;

Examples of TPE, which includes olefinic resin, include thermoplastic styrenic elastomer (TPS).
