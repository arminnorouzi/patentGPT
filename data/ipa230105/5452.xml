id="p-0002" num="0001">This document relates to the field of pixel matrix display devices, and applies advantageously to the production of screens with large dimensions.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">PRIOR ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Generally, a display device such as a television screen or a computer monitor receives a video signal through a video cable, for example an HDMI cable. The video signal corresponds to a digital signal encoding, without compression, light values to be displayed by each pixel of the device (generally at least three values for each pixel, i.e. one for each colour in the case of RGB pixels). This video signal is calculated by a graphics card for example.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The video signal received by the display device is in practice received by a video card which performs various data decoding, conversion and distribution operations to a pixel matrix of the display device. The video card can perform all or part of a digital-to-analogue conversion of data intended for the pixel matrix. In most cases where the digital-to-analogue conversion is performed in the video card, the latter outputs analogue values that can be displayed by the pixel matrix. In the event that the video card sends digital values to the pixels, the video card has to ensure the generation of a set of pixel control signals for controlling the display time of each pixel, for example with PWM (pulse width modulation) or BCM (binary code modulation) control signals. In these examples of pixel control signals, there is no digital-to-analogue conversion as each pixel is controlled in an &#x201c;on/off&#x201d; manner, in other words &#x201c;transmits/does not transmit&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Each pixel of the display device generally comprises a plurality of light elements for displaying a pixel of each image to be displayed by the device. A pixel generally includes at least three intensity-modulated light elements, each dedicated to one of the colours red, green and blue. Each light element can include either a light emitter modulated in intensity directly in the target colour of this element (in the case of OLED) or composed of a blue light source which is filtered and/or has added phosphors to obtain the target colour (in the case of other types of LED), or a light modulator (in the case of liquid crystals) coupled to an adequately coloured filter to obtain the target colour from a white light emitted by a source common to the pixels.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The analogue values obtained after digital-to-analogue conversion or the emission times for each pixel are proportional to the intensity of the light levels to be displayed by each of the light elements of the pixels. Each light element can be coupled to a selection transistor for controlling the display of the light signal by the light element. The display device also includes row drivers for controlling the selection transistors, column drivers supplying the pixels with values corresponding to the data to be displayed.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The increase in the resolution of display devices results in an increase in the number of rows and columns of the pixel matrix of the device (7680 columns and 4320 rows in the 8K format), which results in the multiplication of the number of electronic chips (forming in particular the row and column drivers) around the pixel matrix, as well as the number of wires needed to address the light elements of the pixels.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Moreover, in the case of a device for displaying videos or 3D images, i.e. a multiscope display, the number of items of information sent for each pixel is even greater given the multitude of points of view of the image to be displayed by the device, which requires a multiplication of the number of light elements per pixel, and therefore a larger number of wires are needed to address the light elements of the pixels. The energy required for the light elements and which is to be transmitted to the pixels is also significant.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">PRESENTATION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore there is a need to propose a display device with an architecture that reduces the complexity of the cabling and the number of wires necessary for addressing the light elements of the pixels of the display device.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">To achieve this one embodiment proposes a display device including at least:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0010">a pixel matrix comprising a plurality of groups of pixels, each group of pixels comprising a plurality of pixel blocks each including a plurality of pixels distributed over a plurality of neighbouring, or consecutive or adjacent, rows of pixels, and over a plurality of neighbouring, or consecutive or adjacent, columns of pixels, and each pixel comprising at least one light element;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0011">a video card comprising at least one input configured to receive a digital signal to be displayed by the pixel matrix, and a plurality of outputs each coupled to a group of pixels by an associated primary data distribution network or bus, the video card being configured to decode the digital signal and send to each of the outputs digital data encoded in a format suitable for the pixel matrix and intended for display by the group of pixels coupled to said output;</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0011" num="0012">and wherein:<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0013">each group of pixels includes a plurality of control circuits each associated with a pixel block of the pixel group and coupled to the associated primary data distribution network, each control circuit including a primary memory circuit configured to store a portion of the digital data for display by the associated pixel block and being configured to send to the associated pixel block, via an associated secondary data distribution network, said portion of digital data intended to be displayed by the associated pixel block;</li>        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0014">each pixel includes at least one driver circuit configured to generate control signals for the one or more light elements of the pixel from digital data to be displayed by the one or more light elements of the pixel.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0012" num="0015">This display device proposes replacing the traditional row/column addressing by addressing with pixel groups themselves divided into blocks of pixels. This is made possible by the use of electronic circuits within the pixel matrix, namely control circuits associated with the pixel blocks and driving circuits configured to generate the control signals of the light element(s) of the pixel formed within each pixel. Due to this configuration making it possible to group together certain operations performed previously (in the prior art) outside the pixel matrix, the cabling needed to address the light elements of the pixels is simplified and requires fewer wires, the electronic chips at the periphery are eliminated and the cabling of the rows or columns can disappear, which makes this configuration particularly advantageous for obtaining screens with large dimensions.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0016">Furthermore, with such a device, it is possible to address the different groups of pixels in parallel, which makes it possible to avoid having to successively address each row of pixels of the matrix.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0017">A major difference between a conventional display device and the present display device is that the data sent to the pixels are digital here, and the generation of control signals for the light elements of the pixels is carried out within each pixel.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0018">The division of the matrix into groups of pixels and the formation of certain functions within the pixel matrix makes it possible to limit the rate of data to be sent to the pixels, thus making these transfers easier to carry out.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0019">The video card, which can also be referred to as a driver card, of the display device can receive the digital data from outside the display device for example via a cable such as an HDMI cable. The video card does not correspond to a graphics card which is for defining and sending the complete digital image data to the display device.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0020">The video card corresponds to an electronic card including one or more integrated circuits and which is dedicated to driving the pixel matrix. The video card performs various data decoding, conversion and distribution operations for the pixel matrix on the basis of the digital signal received as input. In the display device here described, the video card does not perform the digital-to-analogue conversion of the data intended for the pixel matrix. The video card may ensure the generation of a set of pixel control signals to control the digital-to-analogue transformation in the pixels, for example with PWM (pulse width modulation) or BCM (binary coded modulation) control signals. In addition, the video card may only include digital integrated circuits, which makes it easier to implement.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0021">The video card is configured to decode the received digital signal, then re-encode the digital data obtained in a format adapted to the pixel matrix, i.e. for the digital data intended for each group of pixels, in a format suitable for the control circuits, the type of pixels and the elements used for the distribution of data in the group of pixels.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0022">The control signals of the light elements of the pixels control each of the light elements of the pixels, the display of a certain brightness value during a display reference period corresponding to duration of the display of an image by the pixel matrix.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0023">A data distribution network comprises at least electrical connections, preferably shared, between a transmitter circuit and a plurality of receiver circuits. This definition applies to both primary and secondary data distribution networks.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0024">Each primary data distribution network is used for the distribution of data from one of the outputs of the video card to the control circuits of the group of pixels coupled to said video card output.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0025">Each secondary data distribution network is used for the distribution of data from one of the control circuits to the pixels of the pixel block associated with said control circuit.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0026">In the present application, a pixel block corresponds to a group of adjacent pixels, each block including a plurality of pixels distributed over a plurality of neighbouring, or adjacent, rows of pixels and a plurality of neighbouring, or adjacent, columns of pixels. Thus, each pixel block forms, within each group of pixels, a &#x201c;sub-matrix&#x201d; with a minimum dimension of 2&#xd7;2 pixels (but may have larger dimensions).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0027">In an advantageous manner, each pixel may correspond to a module distinct from other pixels and may be transferred onto a pixel matrix support on which all or part of the primary data distribution networks and control circuits are located. Such pixels are very advantageous because they are particularly suitable for making screens of large dimensions which for cost reasons requires the use of a support which is not a semiconductor wafer. The formation of pixels in the form of such modules also makes it possible to have more space for electric power supply rows of pixels due to the available support surface between the modules, which makes it possible to reduce the access resistance. This configuration also makes it possible to consider the formation of conductive rows of the device in a single level.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0028">In a particular configuration, the display device may be such that each control circuit includes at least one data receiving circuit configured to identify on the associated primary data distribution network the portion of digital data intended to be displayed by the pixel block with which the control circuit is associated, for example by means of an address associated with the data receiving circuit on the associated primary data distribution network comprising a data bus.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0029">In this particular configuration, in each group of pixels, the routing of different portions of digital data in the different pixel blocks may be achieved by addressing on the primary data distribution network. This configuration may be used regardless of the size of the digital data portions, i.e. regardless of the amount of digital data intended for each block of pixels, whether or not this size is constant from one pixel block to the other of the group of pixels. In each control circuit, once identified by the data receiving circuit, the portion of digital data intended to be displayed by the pixel block to which the control circuit is associated may be stored in the primary memory circuit of the control circuit. In each control circuit, an output of data from the data receiving circuit may be coupled to an input of the primary memory circuit so that the data receiving circuit can transfer this data to the primary memory circuit.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0030">In another particular configuration, in each group of pixels, the control circuits may include primary shift registers coupled in series from one control circuit to the other and distinct from the primary memory circuits, the primary shift register of a control circuit being configured to receive, over the primary data distribution network, the portion of digital data intended to be displayed by the pixel block with which the control circuit is associated. Such a configuration may be used when the size of the sub-portions of the digital data is constant for each group of pixels. In each control circuit, a data output of the primary shift register may be coupled to a data input of the primary memory circuit so that the primary shift register can transfer this data to the primary memory circuit.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0031">Each pixel may further include a secondary memory circuit coupled to the secondary data distribution network, the secondary memory circuit able to be configured to store digital data to be displayed by the light element(s) of the pixel, the pixel driver circuit comprising an input coupled to an output of the secondary memory circuit of the pixel and at least one output coupled to the light element(s) of the pixel.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0032">According to a first embodiment, in each block of pixels, the secondary memory circuits may include secondary shift registers coupled in series from one pixel to another and configured to pass the digital data intended to be displayed by the pixels of a same block from one pixel to the other. This configuration has the advantage of being simple to achieve and inexpensive given the small number of transistors required for the shift registers, and therefore the small semi-conductor surfaces necessary to obtain the shift registers. This configuration is used when the number of bits to be transmitted to each pixel of the same block is identical. This configuration also makes it possible to form all of the pixels in an identical manner without a specific address.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0033">In this first embodiment, in each pixel, each secondary memory circuit may further include a latch comprising at least one input coupled to an output of the secondary shift register of the secondary memory circuit, and at least one output coupled to the input of the driver circuit of the pixel.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0034">In a second embodiment, the display device may be such that:<ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0035">each pixel includes at least one secondary address decoding circuit coupled to the associated secondary data distribution network, the secondary address decoding circuit being able to identify digital data intended to be displayed by the pixel;</li>        <li id="ul0008-0002" num="0036">each pixel block includes at least one secondary data connection of the data bus type to which at least one input of the secondary address decoding circuit of each pixel of the pixel block is coupled.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0032" num="0037">In this second embodiment, each secondary memory circuit may include:<ul id="ul0009" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0009-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0010" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0010-0001" num="0038">at least one register comprising at least one input coupled to an output of the secondary address decoding circuit of the pixel comprising the secondary memory circuit, and</li>        <li id="ul0010-0002" num="0039">at least one latch comprising at least one input coupled to an output of the register of the secondary memory circuit, an output of the latch being coupled to an input of the driver circuit of the pixel comprising the secondary memory circuit.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0033" num="0040">The device may further include voltage reduction circuits configured to electrically power the pixels.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0041">The driver circuits may include PWM or BCM modulators or digital-to-analogue converters.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0042">Each group of pixels may form a plurality of complete rows of the pixel matrix.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0043">Each control circuit may be formed by a chip separate from the pixels of the pixel block with which the control circuit is associated (which has the advantage that all of the pixels can be identical), or each control circuit may be integrated into one of the pixels of the pixel block with which the control circuit is associated, which reduces the number of chips to be carried on the support (all pixels other than those integrating the control circuits may be identical).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0044">The video card and/or the control circuits and/or the pixels may include at least one digital data processing circuit.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0045">At least a portion of the pixels may each include at least one photodetector coupled to an analogue-digital converter.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0046">In this case, and when the display device is implemented according to the first embodiment:<ul id="ul0011" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0011-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0012" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0012-0001" num="0047">in each pixel, at least one output of the analogue-to-digital converter may be coupled to an input of the shift register of the pixel (i.e. the one for receiving digital data to be displayed by the pixel);</li>        <li id="ul0012-0002" num="0048">in each block of pixels, an output of the shift register of one of the pixels in the pixel block may be coupled electrically to an input of the control circuit associated with the pixel block.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0040" num="0049">Throughout the text of this application, the term &#x201c;coupled&#x201d;

Templier et al., SID Symposium Digest of Technical Papers, Volume 50 (1), Jun. 1, 2019. For example, the LED corresponding to the light elements and the electronic circuits of the pixels may be made on different substrates, then cut out, assembled and finally transferred to a support, corresponding for example to one or more printed circuits, also intended to be used as a support for the other elements of the device <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows schematically the implementation of such an integration of the pixels. In the example of this figure, the light elements intended to each emit the colours red, green and blue are produced on different semiconductor wafers, referenced <b>103</b><i>a</i>, <b>103</b><i>b </i>and <b>103</b><i>c</i>, for each of these colours. The electronic circuits (here the secondary memory circuits and the driver circuits) are made by CMOS technology on another semi-conductor wafer <b>103</b><i>d</i>. The light elements made on the wafers <b>103</b><i>a</i>, <b>103</b><i>b </i>and <b>103</b><i>c </i>are cut out and then assembled on the wafer <b>103</b><i>d</i>. The pixels obtained are cut into independent modules <b>105</b>. Alternatively, the light elements may be made on a single wafer, and the emission of different colours by these light elements is achieved by adding phosphors to the light elements intended to emit a red or green light colour. In this case, the wafer on which the light elements are formed may be attached to the wafer <b>103</b><i>d </i>without previously cutting out the light elements.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0073">Each module <b>105</b> forms a pixel comprising the different light elements of the pixel (however it is possible that each module <b>105</b> includes a single light element) arranged on a CMOS portion in which the electronic circuits of the pixel are formed.

Thus, each module <b>105</b> comprises a monolithic chip or an assembly of a plurality of monolithic chips connected electrically, and a plurality of modules, for example identical or similar, are mounted on a single transfer substrate, each module corresponding for example to a pixel of the display device. For example, the elementary modules of the described display devices each include a plurality of LEDs and a transistor-based driver circuit, and may be manufactured according to identical or similar processes as described in patent application WO2017089676.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0075">Each pixel of the matrix <b>102</b> is intended to display one pixel of the image or each image to be displayed by the device <b>100</b>. In the embodiment described here, each pixel of the matrix <b>102</b> includes three distinct light elements, each intended to emit a light signal of one of the colours red, green or blue. Alternatively, each pixel of the matrix <b>102</b> may include more than three distinct light elements, such as for example when the device <b>100</b> is a multiscopic device intended to display simultaneously an image according to a plurality of viewpoints (with the aim of displaying this image in 3D), with for example in this case each pixel of the matrix <b>102</b> which includes as many sets of three distinct light elements as there are viewpoints of the image to be displayed.

Furthermore, in this example, the groups <b>104</b> are arranged in rows, and the blocks <b>106</b> correspond to blocks of 8&#xd7;8 pixels. Other sizes of pixel block <b>106</b> are possible: 16&#xd7;16 pixels, 32&#xd7;32 pixels, etc. More generally, each pixel block <b>106</b> corresponds to a submatrix of pixels of at least 2&#xd7;2 pixels, i.e. comprising pixels arranged in at least two consecutive rows of pixels and in at least two consecutive columns of pixels.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0077">For example, considering that the device <b>100</b> corresponds to a 75 inch screen, and that the pixel pitch, i.e. the distance between the centres of two neighbouring pixels, is for example equal to 865 &#x3bc;m, each pixel block <b>106</b> has dimensions equal to 55.36&#xd7;55.36 mm<sup>2</sup>, each group of pixels <b>104</b> has dimensions equal to 55.36&#xd7;1660 mm<sup>2</sup>, and the pixel matrix <b>102</b> has dimensions equal to 1.66&#xd7;0.93 m<sup>2</sup>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0078">Also by way of example, the device <b>100</b> may correspond to a screen with a so-called &#x201c;full HD&#x201d; resolution of 1920&#xd7;1080 pixels, configured to achieve a display of 100 images/s. This device <b>100</b> may be configured to display digital data with an image coding of 24 bits, or 3 bytes, per pixel, i.e. one byte for each RGB colour to be displayed by each pixel. In this case, the minimum throughput of data received at the input of the device <b>100</b> is equal to 4.98 Gbits/s. By considering the distribution into pixel groups <b>104</b> and pixel blocks <b>106</b> as indicated above, the minimal throughput of digital data sent to each pixel group <b>104</b> from the video card <b>108</b> is 36.9 Mbit/s.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0079">The device <b>100</b> may correspond to screen with any other resolution, and for example a resolution corresponding to a 4K or 8K format.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0080">The device <b>100</b> includes a video card <b>108</b> comprising an input <b>109</b> configured to receive a digital signal corresponding to the images, or to the video, intended to be displayed by the pixel matrix <b>102</b>.

These addresses may be similar from one group of pixels <b>104</b> to another. For example, the circuit addresses <b>110</b> may be defined in hardware by conductor elements formed on the support on which the pixels are transferred, these conductor elements being connected either to the power supply (defining in this case a binary &#x201c;1&#x201d;) or to ground (defining in this case a binary &#x201c;0&#x201d;). The number of conductor elements used to define the address of each circuit <b>110</b> depends in particular on the number of circuits <b>110</b> to which an address has to be assigned within each group of pixels <b>104</b>.

In the embodiment described here, the frequency of this primary clock signal is for example in the order of 40 MHz when the throughput of digital data sent to each group of pixels <b>104</b> is 36.9 Mbit/s. The network <b>112</b> also includes a third wire <b>122</b> on which a main display trigger signal is transmitted, the purpose of which is to trigger the display by the light elements of the pixels of data received by the pixels. Alternatively, the display of data received by the pixels may be triggered by a specific message transmitted on the first wire <b>118</b> of the network <b>112</b> and addressed to all the control circuits <b>110</b> via the use of a specific address dedicated to this display.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0085">All the pixel blocks <b>106</b> forming part of a same group of pixels <b>104</b> are coupled to the same primary data distribution network <b>112</b>, or in other words to a same data bus in this example.

The retrieved data is stored in a primary memory circuit <b>126</b> of the circuit <b>110</b>, the retrieved digital data corresponding to data to be displayed by the pixels of the associated block <b>106</b>. Due to the fact that the circuit <b>110</b> identifies the digital data intended for the associated block <b>106</b> by means of an addressing system, the fact that the quantity of digital data intended for this block <b>106</b> is similar or not similar to that intended for other blocks <b>106</b> of the group of pixels <b>104</b>, the order in which the data are transmitted and their possible cutting into a plurality of messages are not significant.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0087">It should be noted that the primary memory circuit <b>126</b> does not form part of the data receiving circuit of the circuit <b>110</b> as such.

In the embodiment described here, each circuit <b>128</b> includes a shift register <b>132</b> of 8 bits coupled to a latch <b>134</b> (circuit &#x201c;latch&#x201d;). The registers <b>132</b> are coupled in series forming chain of registers within each pixel block <b>106</b>, the output of a register associated with a pixel being connected to a next register in this same pixel or being connected to the input of a register of a &#x201c;following&#x201d; pixel. Alternatively, it is possible to have a single register common to the secondary memory circuits <b>128</b> of the same pixel, or in another embodiment, a plurality of register chains, for example each associated with a pixel colour.

At the rate of a clock signal clocking the serial movement of the data through the chain of registers, the data initially present in the memory circuit <b>126</b> are positioned in all of the registers of the chain. An amplifier <b>136</b>, or buffer, may be present at the output of each pixel to ensure if necessary the maintenance of the amplitude level of the data transmitted from one pixel to the other. The registers <b>132</b> of all of the pixels of the block <b>106</b> receive as input a shift clock signal generated by the circuit <b>110</b>, transmitted to the registers <b>132</b> by another wire of the network <b>152</b> and controlling the shift of data in the registers. Considering the embodiment described here, the frequency of the shift clock signal is greater than or equal to 153 kHz (to transmit 100 times per second 1536 bits). The shift clock signal may be generated by the control circuit <b>110</b> from the primary clock signal transmitted over the network <b>112</b>. Lastly, the latches <b>134</b> of all of the pixels of the block <b>106</b> receive a storage trigger signal generated by the circuit <b>110</b>, transmitted on another wire of the network <b>152</b> and which controls the storage, in the latches <b>134</b>, of digital values present in the registers <b>132</b>. This storage trigger signal is for example generated from the display trigger signal transmitted on the third wire <b>122</b>, for example when the transmission of data in all the control circuits <b>110</b> is completed in the group of pixels.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0092">Due to the fact that shift registers <b>132</b> are used within the pixels of the block <b>106</b>, the quantity of digital data intended for each pixel is identical for all of the pixels of the block <b>106</b>. Conversely, the use of a quantity of identical digital data for all the pixels of the block <b>106</b> allows the use of shift registers <b>132</b> within the pixels inexpensive in the surface of the semiconductor.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0093">Each pixel also includes at least one drive circuit <b>138</b> configured to generate drive signals of the pixel light elements <b>130</b> from the digital data stored in the associated latch <b>134</b>. When the light elements <b>130</b> correspond to LEDs, the driver circuit comprises for example a transistor placed in series with an LED between two power supply terminals; this transistor then being controlled by an &#x201c;all or nothing&#x201d; signal. In the embodiment described here, each circuit <b>138</b> comprises a PWM (pulse width modulation) modulator generating from the data present in the latch <b>134</b>, an on-off PWM control signal of the transistor in series with the associated LED. Such a PWM control signal forms in a known way a signal alternating between two voltage levels which lead respectively to the conduction or the non-conduction of the transistor and consequently of the LED. The duration of the voltage level leading to the conduction of the LED is determined by the value to be displayed by the light element <b>130</b>. Compared to a digital-to-analogue converter, a PWM modulator occupies a much smaller semiconductor area. Furthermore, it is possible to consider correcting possible technological dispersions between the LEDs or non-linearity problems of light elements, by adapting the digital values used for controlling the transistor in series with the LED.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0094">It should be noted that the prior art includes various more or less complex &#x201c;adjustment/control&#x201d; circuits for the LED, the single transistor mentioned above being able to be associated with a cascode assembly or any other electronic device allowing the current flowing through the LED to be properly controlled.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0095">The output of each circuit <b>138</b> is thus coupled to one of the light elements <b>130</b>. The generation of the PWM control signal by the circuit <b>138</b> is driven by a control clock signal generated by the circuit <b>110</b> and transmitted to one of the wires of the network <b>152</b>. The frequency of the control clock signal is selected to be sufficiently high to avoid flicker problems, and for example between 100 and 1000 times the image display frequency of the device <b>100</b>, or even higher, such as for example equal to several MHz or several tens of MHz (the use of a high frequency has the advantage of reducing the need for precision with the frequency of this signal, but leads to a higher consumption of the circuit <b>138</b>, a compromise having to be found). The control clock signal may be derived from the primary clock signal transmitted on the bus <b>112</b> or locally created.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0096">As an alternative to the PWM modulator described above, it is possible that each circuit <b>138</b> corresponds to a BCM (binary code modulation) modulator.
