In addition, the meniscus and the articular cartilage in human joints also often fail to heal after an injury. Tissues found outside of joints heal by forming a fibrin clot, which connects the ruptured tissue ends and is subsequently remodeled to form scar, which heals the tissue. Inside a synovial joint, a fibrin clot either fails to form or is quickly lysed after injury to the knee, thus preventing joint arthrosis and stiffness after minor injury. Joints contain synovial fluid which, as part of normal joint activity, naturally prevent clot formation in joints. This fibrinolytic process results in premature loss of the fibrin clot scaffold and disruption of the healing process for tissues within the joint or within intra-articular tissues.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The current treatment method for human anterior cruciate ligament repair after rupture involves removing the ruptured fan-shaped ligament and replacing it with a point-to-point tendon graft (ACL reconstruction). While this procedure can initially restore gross stability in most patients, longer follow-up demonstrates many post-operative patients have abnormal structural laxity, suggesting the reconstruction may not withstand the physiologic forces applied over time (Dye, 325 Clin. Orthop. 130-139 (1996)). The loss of anterior cruciate ligament function has been found to result in early and progressive radiographic changes consistent with joint deterioration (Hefti et al., 73A(3) J. Bone Joint Surg. 373-383 (1991)), and over 70% of patients undergoing ACL reconstruction develop osteoarthritis at only 14 years after injury (von Porat et al., Ann Rheum Dis. 63(3):269-73 (2004)). As anterior cruciate ligament rupture is most commonly an injury of a young athletes in their teens and twenties, early osteoarthritis in this group has difficult consequences.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Current ACL repair methods may include a repair construct having a tibial attachment or both a femoral and tibial attachment. Tibial attachment configurations, however, can result in breakage of the construct and washing away of any clot formation in the ACL.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The invention relates, in some aspects, to methods and products that facilitate anterior cruciate ligament regeneration or healing using only a femoral attachment.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Each of the limitations of the invention can encompass various embodiments of the invention.

The system includes a scaffold configured for the repair of the ruptured ligament, a fixation device, and includes a suture. The scaffold allows the subject's body to develop a network of capillaries, arteries, and veins. Well-vascularized connective tissues heal as a result of migration of fibroblasts into the scaffold. The methods and systems of the present disclosure provides a connection between the ruptured ligament, or forms around the torn ligament, and promotes the repair of the ruptured or torn ligament while maintaining the integrity and structure of the ligament.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The present disclosure provides a three-dimensional (3-D) scaffold for repairing a ruptured or torn ACL. The scaffold provides a connection between the ruptured ends of the ligament and fibers, or forms around the torn ligament, after injury, and encourages the migration of appropriate healing cells to form scar and new tissue in the scaffold. The scaffold is a bioengineered substitute for a fibrin clot and is implanted, for example, between the ruptured ends of the ligament fascicles, or placed around the torn ligament. This substitute scaffold is designed to stimulate cell proliferation and extracellular matrix production in the gap between the ruptured ends of the ligament or the tear in the ligament, thus facilitating healing and regeneration.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">As used herein, the injury may be a torn ligament or a ruptured ligament. A torn ligament may be a partial tear. A torn ligament may also refer to a complete tear. A partial tear is one where a portion of the ligament is damaged, but the ligament remains connected. The tear may be of any length or shape. A ruptured ligament, also known as a complete tear, is one where the ligament has been completely severed providing two separate ends of the ligament. A ruptured ligament may provide two ligament ends of similar or different lengths. The rupture may be such that a ligament stump is formed at one end. For example, there may be a tibial stump connected to the tibia and a femoral stump connected to the femur.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">An example of a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>. The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) <b>2</b> is one of four strong ligaments that connects the bones of the knee joint. The function of the ACL is to provide stability to the knee and minimize stress across the knee joint. It restrains excessive forward movement of the lower leg bone, the tibia <b>6</b>, in relation to the thigh bone, the femur <b>4</b>, and limits the rotational movements of the knee.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>, the anterior cruciate ligament <b>2</b> is ruptured such that it no longer forms a connection between the femur bone <b>4</b> and the tibia bone <b>6</b>. The resulting ends of the ruptured ACL <b>2</b> may be of any length. The ends may be of a similar length, or one end may be longer in length than the other. The end on the femur <b>4</b> includes the femoral ACL stump <b>7</b>. The end on the tibia <b>6</b> includes a tibial stump <b>9</b>. In some instances, it is believed that a repair is desirable when the tibial stump length SL is less than about 75% of the effective ligament length LL but greater than 5% of a total length LL of the ACL. The total length of the ACL is considered to be the length of ligament from femoral footprint to the tibial footprint along a linear axis.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The knee joint includes tibial spines on the tibia <b>6</b> and the intercondylar notch of the femur <b>4</b>. In some instances, the methods as described herein may include performing a notchplasty of the intercondylar notch of the femur to provide space for larger ligament to form after surgical repair using a scaffold. Such a notchplasty improves the size of the healing ligament, specifically resulting in a larger cross-sectional area of the ligament. As the mechanical strength of a ligament, and subsequently its ability to maintain the distance between the femur and tibia, is directly correlated with its cross sectional area, enlarging the notch with a notchplasty can help make a stronger repaired ACL and has been found by the inventors to be beneficial in ACL repair using a scaffold as described in the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">A scaffold of the present disclosure can be any shape that is useful for implantation into a subject. The scaffold, for instance, can be tubular, semi-tubular, cylindrical, including either a solid cylinder or a cylinder having hollow cavities, a tube, a flat sheet rolled into a tube so as to define a hollow cavity, liquid, an amorphous shape which conforms to that of the repair space, a &#x201c;Chinese finger trap&#x201d; design, a trough shape, or square. Other shapes suitable for the scaffold of the device as known to those of ordinary skill in the art are also contemplated in the invention.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The present disclosure includes a scaffold <b>14</b>, such that the scaffold <b>14</b> is configured for repair. The scaffold <b>14</b> is capable of being inserted into an area requiring repair and promotes regeneration of the ligament. The scaffold <b>14</b> is capable of insertion into a repair site and either forming a connection between the ends of the ruptured ligament, between bone, or forming around the torn ligament such that the integrity and structure of the ligament is maintained. Regeneration offers several advantages over reconstruction, previously used in ligament repair, including maintenance of the complex insertion sites and fan-shape of the ligament, and preservation of remaining proprioceptive fibers within the ligament substance.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Examples of methods and systems according to the present disclosure are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>. An example of a device is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>B and <b>1</b>C</figref>. For example, the scaffold <b>14</b> is attached to a suture <b>12</b> and a fixation device <b>8</b>. The fixation device <b>8</b> may, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>B and <b>1</b>C</figref>, be attached to the suture <b>12</b> through an eyelet <b>10</b> of the fixation device <b>8</b>. In this configuration, the fixation device <b>8</b> is attached into the femur <b>4</b> and not the tibia <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The scaffold <b>14</b> may function either as an insoluble or biodegradable regulator of cell function or simply as a delivery vehicle of a supporting structure for cell migration or synthesis. Numerous matrices made of either natural or synthetic components have been investigated for use in ligament repair and reconstruction. Natural matrices are made from processed or reconstituted tissue components (such as collagens and GAGs). Because natural matrices mimic the structures ordinarily responsible for the reciprocal interaction between cells and their environment, they act as cell regulators with minimal modification, giving the cells the ability to remodel an implanted material, which is a prerequisite for regeneration.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Synthetic matrices are made predominantly of polymeric materials. Synthetic matrices offer the advantage of a range of carefully defined chemical compositions and structural arrangements. Some synthetic matrices are not degradable. While the non-degradable matrices may aid in repair, non-degradable matrices are not replaced by remodeling and therefore cannot be used to fully regenerate ligament. It is also undesirable to leave foreign materials permanently in a joint due to the problems associated with the generation of wear particles, thus degradable materials are preferred for work in regeneration. Degradable synthetic scaffolds can be engineered to control the rate of degradation.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The scaffold <b>14</b> is preferably made of a compressible, resilient material which has some resistance to degradation by synovial fluid. Synovial fluid as part of normal joint activity, naturally prevents clot formation. This fibrinolytic process would result in the premature degradation of the scaffold and disrupt the healing process of the ligament. The material may be either permanent or biodegradable material, such as polymers and copolymers. The scaffold <b>14</b> can be composed, for example, of collagen fibers, collagen gel, foamed rubber, natural material, synthetic materials such as rubber, silicone and plastic, ground and compacted material, perforated material, or a compressible solid material.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The scaffold <b>14</b> may be a solid material such that its shape is maintained, or a semi-solid material capable of altering its shape and or size. The scaffold <b>14</b> may be made of expandable material allowing it to contract or expand as required. The material can be capable of absorbing plasma, blood, other body fluids, liquid, hydrogel, or other material the scaffold either comes into contact with or is added to the scaffold.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The scaffold material can be protein, lyophilized material, or any other suitable material. A protein can be synthetic, bioabsorbable or a naturally occurring protein. A protein includes, but is not limited to, fibrin, hyaluronic acid, elastin, extracellular matrix proteins, or collagen. The scaffold material may be plastic or self-assembling peptides. The scaffold material may incorporate therapeutic proteins including, but not limited to, hormones, cytokines, growth factors, clotting factors, anti-protease proteins (e.g., alpha1-antitrypsin), angiogenic proteins (e.g., vascular endothelial growth factor, fibroblast growth factors), antiangiogenic proteins (e.g., endostatin, angiostatin), and other proteins that are present in the blood, bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs), osteoinductive factor (IFO), fibronectin (FN), endothelial cell growth factor (ECGF), cementum attachment extracts (CAE), ketanserin, human growth hormone (HGH), animal growth hormones, epidermal growth factor (EGF), interleukin-1 (IL-1), human alpha thrombin, transforming growth factor (TGF-beta), insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), platelet derived growth factors (PDGF), fibroblast growth factors (FGF, bFGF, etc.), and periodontal ligament chemotactic factor (PDLGF), for therapeutic purposes. A lyophilized material is one that is capable of swelling when liquid, gel or other fluid is added or comes into contact with it.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Many biological materials are available for making the scaffold, including collagen compositions (either collagen fiber or collagen gel), compositions containing glycosaminoglycan (GAG), hyaluronan compositions, and various synthetic compositions. Collagen-glycosaminoglycan (CG) copolymers have been used successfully in the regeneration of dermis and peripheral nerve. Porous natural polymers, fabricated as sponge-like and fibrous scaffolds, have been investigated as implants to facilitate regeneration of selected musculoskeletal tissues including ligaments. In one embodiment, the scaffold <b>14</b> is a sponge scaffold made from tendon (xenograft, allograft, autograft) or ligament or skin or other connective tissue which could be in the native state or processed to facilitate cell ingrowth or other biologic features.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the illustrated embodiment the scaffold <b>14</b> is composed of a sponge or sponge-like material. The sponge scaffold <b>14</b> may be absorbable or nonabsorbable. The sponge scaffold <b>14</b> may include collagen, elastin, extracellular matrix protein, plastic, or self-assembling peptides. The sponge scaffold <b>14</b> may be hydrophilic. The sponge scaffold <b>14</b> is capable of compression and expansion as desired. For example, the sponge scaffold <b>14</b> may be compressed prior to or during implantation into a repair site. A compressed sponge scaffold allows for the sponge scaffold to expand within the repair site. The sponge may be lyophilized and/or compressed when placed in the repair site and expanded once in place. The expansion of the sponge scaffold <b>14</b> may occur after contact with blood or other fluid in the repair site or added to the repair site.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The sponge scaffold <b>14</b> may also be porous. The sponge scaffold <b>14</b> may be saturated or coated with a liquid, gel, or hydrogel repair material prior to implantation into a repair site. Coating or saturation of a sponge scaffold may ease implantation into a relatively undefined defect area as well as help to fill a particularly large defect area. The sponge scaffold <b>14</b> may be composed of collagen. In a preferred embodiment, the sponge scaffold <b>14</b> is treated with hydrogel. Examples of scaffolds and repair materials useful according to the invention are found in U.S. Pat.

Collagen can be of the soluble or the insoluble type. Preferably, the collagen is soluble, e.g., acidic or basic. For example, the collagen can be type I, II, III, IV, V, IX or X. Preferably the collagen is type I. More preferably the collagen is soluble type I collagen. Type I collagen is the predominant component of the extracellular matrix for the human ACL and provides an example of a choice for the basis of a bioengineered scaffold. Collagen occurs predominantly in a fibrous form, allowing design of materials with very different mechanical properties by altering the volume fraction, fiber orientation, and degree of cross-linking of the collagen. The biologic properties of cell infiltration rate and scaffold degradation may also be altered by varying the pore size, degree of cross-linking, and the use of additional proteins, such as glycosaminoglycans, growth factors, and cytokines. In addition, collagen-based biomaterials can be manufactured from a patient's own skin, thus minimizing the antigenicity of the implant (Ford et al., 105 Laryngoscope 944-948 (1995)).</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The present disclosure may also include one or more fixation devices <b>8</b>.

The scaffold <b>14</b> may be placed into the repair site <b>26</b> during surgery using techniques known to those of ordinary skill in the art. The scaffold <b>14</b> can either fill the repair site <b>26</b> or partially fill the repair site <b>26</b>.

In yet another embodiment, the scaffold <b>14</b> may be a &#x201c;Chinese finger trap&#x201d; design where one end is placed over a stump of a ruptured ligament and the second end placed over the other end of the ruptured ligament.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Aspects of the invention provide methods of repairing the ruptured ligament <b>2</b> involving drilling a hole <b>20</b> at or near the repair site <b>26</b> of the ruptured ligament <b>2</b>. The hole <b>20</b> can be drilled into the femur <b>4</b> using a device such as a Kirschner wire (for example a small Kirschner wire) and drill, or microfracture pics or awls. One or more holes may be drilled into the femur <b>4</b> surrounding the repair site <b>26</b> to promote bleeding into the repair site <b>26</b>. The repair can be supplemented by drilling holes into the surrounding bone to cause bleeding. Encouraging bleeding into the repair site may promote the formation of blood clots and enhance the healing process of the injury.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The hole <b>20</b> may be drilled into the femur <b>4</b> on the opposite side to the repair site <b>26</b>.

The scaffold <b>14</b> may be soaked in a repair material prior to or during implantation into the repair site <b>26</b>. The repair material may be injected directly into the scaffold <b>14</b> prior to or during implantation. The repair material may be injected within a tubular scaffold at the time of repair. Repair material includes, but is not limited to, a gel, for example a hydrogel, a liquid, or collagen. A liquid includes any material capable of forming an aqueous material, a suspension or a solution. The repair material may include additional materials, such as growth factors, antibiotics, insoluble or soluble collagen (in fibrous, gel, sponge or bead form), a cross-linking agent, thrombin, stem cells, a genetically altered fibroblast, platelets, water, plasma, extracellular proteins and a cell media supplement. The additional repair materials may be added to affect cell proliferation, extracellular matrix production, consistency, inhibition of disease or infection, tonicity, cell nutrients until nutritional pathways are formed, and pH of the repair material. All or a portion of these additional materials may be mixed with the repair material before or during implantation, or alternatively, the additional materials may be implanted proximate to the defect area after the repair material is in place.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In certain embodiments, the repair material may include collagen and platelets. In some embodiments, platelets are derived from the subject to be treated. In other embodiments, platelets are derived from a donor that is allogeneic to the subject. In certain embodiments, platelets may be obtained as platelet rich plasma (PRP). In a non-limiting example, platelets may be isolated from a subject's blood using techniques known to those of ordinary skill in the art. As an example, a blood sample may be centrifuged at 700 rpm for 20 minutes and the platelet-rich plasma upper layer removed. Platelet density may be determined using a cell count as known to those of ordinary skill in the art. The platelet rich plasma may be mixed with collagen and used as a scaffold. The platelet rich plasma may be mixed with any one or more of the scaffold materials of the invention.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In one embodiment, the gel is a hydrogel. A hydrogel is a substance that is formed when an organic polymer (natural or synthetic) is crosslinked via covalent, ionic, or hydrogen bonds to create a three-dimensional open-lattice structure which entraps water molecules to form a gel. A polymer may be crosslinked to form a hydrogel either before or after implantation into a subject. For instance, a hydrogel may be formed in situ, for example, at a repair site. In certain embodiments, a polymer forms a hydrogel within the repair site upon contact with a crosslinking agent. Naturally occurring and synthetic hydrogel forming polymers, polymer mixtures and copolymers may be utilized as hydrogel precursors. See for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,709,854. In certain embodiments, a hydrogel is a gel and begins setting immediately upon mixture and takes approximately 5 minutes to sufficiently set before closure of the defect and surgery area. Setting time may vary depending on the mixture of gel used and environmental factors.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">For instance, certain polymers that can form ionic hydrogels which are malleable may be used to form the hydrogel. For example, a hydrogel can be produced by cross-linking the anionic salt of alginic acid, a carbohydrate polymer isolated from seaweed, with calcium cations, whose strength increases with either increasing concentrations of calcium ions or alginate. Modified alginate derivatives, for example, which have an improved ability to form hydrogels or which are derivatized with hydrophobic, water-labile chains, e.g., oligomers of &#x2208;-caprolactone, may be synthesized. Additionally, polysaccharides which gel by exposure to monovalent cations, including bacterial polysaccharides, such as gellan gum, and plant polysaccharides, such as carrageenans, may be crosslinked to form a hydrogel. Additional examples of materials which can be used to form a hydrogel include polyphosphazines and polyacrylates, which are crosslinked ionically, or block copolymers such as PLURONICS&#x2122; (polyoxyalkylene ether) or TETRONICS&#x2122; (nonionic polymerized alkylene oxide), polyethylene oxide-polypropylene glycol block copolymers which are crosslinked by temperature or pH, respectively. Other materials include proteins such as fibrin, polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, hyaluronic acid and collagen. Polymers such as polysaccharides that are very viscous liquids or are thixotropic and form a gel over time by the slow evolution of structure, are also useful.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In another embodiment, the gel is hyaluronic acid. Hyaluronic acid, which forms an injectable gel with a consistency like a hair gel, may be utilized. Modified hyaluronic acid derivatives are particularly useful. Hyaluronic acid is a linear polysaccharide. Many of its biological effects are a consequence of its ability to bind water, in that up to 500 ml of water may associate with 1 gram of hyaluronic acid. Esterification of hyaluronic acid with uncharged organic moieties reduces the aqueous solubility. Complete esterification with organic alcohols such as benzyl renders the hyaluronic acid derivatives virtually insoluble in water, these compounds then being soluble only in certain aprotic solvents. When films of hyaluronic acid are made, the films essentially are gels which hydrate and expand in the presence of water.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">As used herein, the term &#x201c;pharmaceutically acceptable&#x201d; means a non-toxic material that does not interfere with the effectiveness of the biological activity of the scaffold material or repair material. The term &#x201c;physiologically acceptable&#x201d; refers to a non-toxic material that is compatible with a biological system such as a cell, cell culture, tissue, or organism. The characteristics of the carrier will depend on the route of administration. Physiologically and pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include diluents, fillers, salts, buffers, stabilizers, solubilizers, and other materials which are well known in the art.
