end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0049" num="0048">As discussed in the BACKGROUND, in a current semiconductor structure, in one aspect, because a contact surface between a bit line and a transistor is planar, a contact area is relatively small, and in another aspect, because a feature size of a MOS transistor is reduced, the contact area between the bit line and the transistor is further reduced. As a result, a contact resistance between the bit line and the transistor is increased, leading to the decrease of signal transmission performance and the decrease of semiconductor structure performance.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In view of this, the disclosure provides a bit line contact structure with a concave structure and/or a convex structure, so that when a vertical transistor is electrically connected to a bit line by the bit line contact structure, a contact area of the bit line contact structure can be effectively increased, a contact resistance at the bit line contact structure can be reduced, and a charge transmission speed can be increased, thereby improving a signal transmission speed. In addition, in the semiconductor structure provided in the disclosure and a method for manufacturing a semiconductor structure, by forming a bit line groove in a substrate, the bit line can be arranged in the bit line groove to facilitate the formation of a buried bit line structure, which helps to improve the stability of the semiconductor structure. Meanwhile, compared with a planar transistor, the vertical transistor in the disclosure can effectively improve the level of integration of devices and increase a storage capacity while occupying the same area on the substrate.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In order to make the objectives, technical solutions, and advantages of the disclosure clearer, the technical solutions in the embodiments of the disclosure are described in detail hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings of the preferred embodiments of the disclosure. In the accompanying drawings, the same or similar numerals represent the same or similar parts or parts having the same or similar functions throughout the specification. The described embodiments are merely some rather than all of the embodiments of the disclosure. The embodiments described below with reference to the accompanying drawings are exemplary, and are used to explain the disclosure but should not be construed as a limitation to the disclosure. All other embodiments obtained by persons of ordinary skill in the art based on the embodiments of the disclosure without creative efforts fall within the protection scope of the disclosure. The embodiments of the disclosure are described below in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">According to the first aspect, the embodiments of the disclosure provide a semiconductor structure. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the semiconductor structure <b>100</b> includes: a substrate <b>10</b>, having a bit line groove <b>11</b>; a bit line <b>20</b>, located in the bit line groove <b>11</b>, and extending in a first direction; a vertical transistor <b>40</b>, located on the bit line <b>20</b>. The bit line <b>20</b> includes a bit line contact structure <b>30</b>, and the bit line contact structure <b>30</b> is a concave structure and/or a convex structure. The vertical transistor <b>40</b> is electrically connected to the bit line <b>20</b> by the bit line contact structure <b>30</b>. Through the arrangement of the bit line contact structure <b>30</b>, the vertical transistor <b>40</b> is electrically connected to the bit line <b>20</b> by the bit line contact structure <b>30</b>. Through setting the bit line contact structure <b>30</b> as the concave structure and/or the convex structure, the contact area between the vertical transistor <b>40</b> and the bit line <b>20</b> can be increased, the contact resistance between the bit line <b>20</b> and the vertical transistor <b>40</b> can be reduced, and the charge transmission speed can be increased, thereby increasing a signal transmission speed and improving the use stability of the semiconductor structure <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">It should be noted that, &#x201c;a concave structure and/or a convex structure&#x201d; herein means that the overall structure of the bit line contact structure <b>30</b> is the concave structure, the convex structure, or a combination of the concave structure and the convex structure. The bit line contact structure <b>30</b> provided in the embodiments of the disclosure has a larger contact area than a planar contact structure in the related art.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">It should be noted that, by forming the bit line groove <b>11</b> in the substrate <b>10</b>, the bit line <b>20</b> can be arranged in the bit line groove <b>11</b>, to facilitate the formation of a buried bit line structure. By setting the vertical transistor <b>40</b>, while the same area on the substrate <b>10</b> is occupied, the level of integration of the semiconductor structure <b>100</b> can be effectively improved, and a storage capacity can be increased, compared with a planar transistor.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">It should be noted that, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, a direction a denotes the first direction, and a direction b denotes the second direction. The material of the substrate <b>10</b> may be monocrystalline silicon, polycrystalline silicon, amorphous silicon, a silicon-germanium compound, silicon-on-insulator (abbreviated as SOI) or the like, or other materials known to a person skilled in the art. The substrate <b>10</b> may provide a support basis for a structural layer on the substrate <b>10</b>. The semiconductor structure <b>100</b> may be a storage device or a non-storage device. The storage device may include, for example, a Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM), a Static Random Access Memory (SRAM), a flash memory, an Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EEPROM), a Phase Change Random Access Memory (PRAM) or a Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory (MRAM). The non-storage device may be a logic device (for example, a microprocessor, a digital signal processor, or a microcontroller) or similar devices thereof.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">It should be noted that, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>, the bit line groove <b>11</b> has a height ranging from 50 nm to 200 nm. In this figure, H denotes this height. The height may be specifically 50 nm, 100 nm, 150 nm, 180 nm, or 200 nm. The bit line groove <b>11</b> with the height within the above range, can in one aspect reduce the vertical height of the semiconductor structure <b>100</b>, and in another aspect, enables both the bit line <b>20</b> and the vertical transistor <b>40</b> to be firmly connected to the substrate <b>10</b>, thereby improving the stability of the semiconductor structure <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the bit line <b>20</b> includes a first conductive layer <b>21</b> and a second conductive layer <b>22</b>. The first conductive layer <b>21</b> is located on an inner wall surface of the bit line groove <b>11</b>. The second conductive layer <b>22</b> is located on the first conductive layer <b>21</b>. The second conductive layer <b>22</b> may be made by a material with a relatively low resistance such as W, TiN, TaN, Al, Ru or Cu. The material of the first conductive layer <b>21</b> may include TiN. In one aspect, TiN has a certain barrier effect and can effectively prevent the metal material of the second conductive layer <b>22</b> from diffusing to the substrate. In another aspect, TiN has good interface compatibility with the metal material, which can effectively reduce structural defects at interfaces and improve the yield of semiconductor structures.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Specifically, the bit line contact structure <b>30</b> includes a transition layer <b>31</b> and a seed layer <b>32</b>. The seed layer <b>32</b> is located on a side of the transition layer <b>31</b> away from the substrate <b>10</b>. The transition layer <b>31</b> may be a TiN layer. TiN has good interface compatibility with the metal material of the second conductive layer <b>22</b>, which can effectively reduce structural defects at interfaces. The seed layer <b>32</b> may be made by polycrystalline silicon. Polycrystalline silicon can be converted into monocrystalline silicon by using an annealing process, so that the vertical transistor <b>40</b> is epitaxially grown based on monocrystalline silicon.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Specifically, the vertical transistor <b>40</b> is located on the bit line contact structure <b>30</b>, and embedded with the bit line contact structure <b>30</b>. In this way, in one aspect, a contact resistance at the bit line contact structure <b>30</b> can be reduced, and in another aspect, because the vertical transistor <b>40</b> has relatively higher vertical height, the vertical transistor <b>40</b> and the bit line contact structure <b>30</b> can be connected in an embedded manner, which is beneficial to improve the structural stability of the semiconductor structure <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Specifically, the vertical transistor <b>40</b> includes a first doped region <b>41</b>, a channel region <b>42</b>, and a second doped region <b>43</b> that are sequentially stacked. The first doped region <b>41</b> contacts the bit line <b>20</b>. The same type of doped ions is used in the first doped region <b>41</b>, the channel region <b>42</b>, and the second doped region <b>43</b>. For example, the doped ions may be N-type ions or P-type ions.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The vertical transistor <b>40</b> further includes a capacitor (not shown). The second doped region <b>43</b> of the vertical transistor <b>40</b> is electrically connected to the capacitor. In the embodiments of the disclosure, the first doped region constitutes one of a source and a drain of the vertical transistor, and the second doped region constitutes the other of the source and the drain of the vertical transistor. In this way, when a voltage is applied between the first doped region and the second doped region, a current may flow through the channel region <b>42</b>, and the first doped region is electrically connected to the bit line <b>20</b>, so that a current path can be formed.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Specifically, the semiconductor structure <b>100</b> further includes a word line <b>50</b> and an isolation structure. The word line <b>50</b> is arranged surrounding the channel region <b>42</b>, and extends in the second direction. In this way, a plurality of channel regions may be electrically connected in the second direction by the word line <b>50</b>. The isolation structure is located between adjacent bit lines <b>20</b>, and can prevent short circuit between the adjacent bit lines <b>20</b>, thereby avoiding the effect on the stability of the semiconductor structure <b>100</b>. In the embodiments of the disclosure, the substrate <b>10</b> between the adjacent bit lines <b>20</b> constitutes the isolation structure.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Specifically, the word line <b>50</b> includes a gate dielectric layer <b>51</b> and a gate conductive layer <b>52</b>. The gate dielectric layer <b>51</b> is arranged surrounding the channel region <b>42</b>. The gate conductive layer <b>52</b> is arranged surrounding the channel region <b>42</b>, and is located on a side surface of the gate dielectric layer <b>51</b> corresponding to the channel region <b>42</b>. The gate dielectric layer <b>51</b> and the gate conductive layer <b>52</b> together constitute the word line <b>50</b>. Each word line <b>50</b> may surround at least one channel region <b>42</b>. The material of the gate dielectric layer <b>51</b> may be an oxide, for example, silicon oxide. The material of the gate conductive layer <b>52</b> may be metal or a metal compound such as W, TiN, TaN, Al, Ru or Cu.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Specifically, the bit line contact structure <b>30</b> includes three structures. The first structure includes one concave structure. The second structure includes one convex structure. The third structure includes at least one concave structure and at least one convex structure.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In some embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the bit line contact structure <b>30</b> includes one concave structure <b>62</b>. The concave structure <b>62</b> may be directly formed through etching, which simplifies the manufacturing process while increasing the contact area of the bit line.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In other embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the bit line contact structure <b>30</b> includes two concave structures <b>62</b> and one convex structure <b>61</b>. The convex structure <b>61</b> is arranged between the two concave structures <b>62</b>, thereby further increasing the bit line contact area, reducing the bit line contact resistance, and increasing the charge transmission speed.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In some embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the bit line contact structure may further include one convex structure <b>61</b>. It should be noted that, compared with the structure in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the height of the bit line groove shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is further reduced, so that while the bit line contact area is increased, the height of the semiconductor structure is also reduced, thereby improving the stability of the semiconductor structure.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In the embodiments of the disclosure, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the surface of the bit line contact structure <b>30</b> may be a curved surface, which can avoid a right-angle structure in the bit line contact structure <b>30</b>, causing the bit line contact structure <b>30</b> more smooth, and thus reducing the bit line contact resistance.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">It should be noted that, the convex structure and/or the concave structure of the bit line contact structure <b>30</b> may have the same height. In the embodiments of the disclosure, the concave structure <b>62</b> is taken as an example for description. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>, the convex structure, and/or the concave structure may have the height ranging from 1 nm to 10 nm. In this figure, h denotes the height. Specifically, the height may be 1 nm, 3 nm, 4 nm, 6 nm, 7 nm, 9 nm or 10 nm. When the convex structure and/or the concave structure has the height within the above range, it is ensured that the bit line contact area is increased, improving the structural stability of the vertical transistor.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The embodiments of the disclosure further provide a method for manufacturing a semiconductor structure.

After the second doped region <b>43</b> is formed, the dielectric layer <b>12</b> may be further arranged on the word line <b>50</b>, so that the word line <b>50</b> can be prevented from contacting other structures.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In the method for manufacturing the semiconductor structure <b>100</b> according to an embodiment of the disclosure, by forming the bit line contact structure <b>30</b> with the concave structure and/or the convex structure on the bit line <b>20</b>, the contact area of the bit line contact structure <b>30</b> is effectively increased when the vertical transistor <b>40</b> is electrically connected to the bit line <b>20</b> by the bit line contact structure <b>30</b>, the bit line contact resistance is reduced, and the charge transmission speed is increased, thereby increasing a signal transmission speed. By forming the bit line <b>20</b> in the bit line groove <b>11</b>, it is beneficial to the formation of a buried bit line structure. In addition, compared with a planar transistor, the vertical transistor <b>40</b> in the disclosure can effectively improve the level of integration of devices and increase a storage capacity, while occupying the same area on the substrate.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In the description, it should be noted that unless otherwise expressly specified and defined, terms &#x201c;mounted&#x201d;, &#x201c;connected&#x201d;, and &#x201c;connection&#x201d; should be understood in a broad sense, for example, two elements are fixedly connected, or are connected through an intermediate, or are communicated internally, or are interacting with each other.
