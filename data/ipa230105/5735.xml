III nitride-based semiconductor devices include a semiconductor layer epitaxially grown on a substrate. In order to evaluate the performance of a semiconductor layer, it is effective to measure a sheet resistance value of the semiconductor layer. This is because the sheet resistance value correlates highly with the operation characteristics (e.g. the maximum forward drain current Ifmax) of the semiconductor element. The sheet resistance value is measured by, for example, an eddy current method. In order to accurately evaluate the performance of a semiconductor device, it is desirable to accurately measure the sheet resistance value. However, when a semiconductor layer is grown and a substrate is taken out from a growth furnace, various substances contained in an environment outside the growth furnace are bonded to a group III atom (e.g. Ga). These substances gradually leave the group III atom, and instead an oxygen atom is bonded to the group III atom. Therefore, the degree of oxidation of the surface of the semiconductor layer is initially low and gradually increases with time. Since the sheet resistance value depends on the degree of oxidation of the surface of the semiconductor layer, in order to accurately measure the sheet resistance value of the semiconductor layer, it is necessary to take out the substrate on which the semiconductor layer has been grown to the outside of the growth furnace, then leave the semiconductor layer for a long time (empirically, about 48 hours), and measure the sheet resistance value after oxidation has sufficiently progressed and the sheet resistance value has stabilized. This leads to an increase in production lead time and a decrease in production efficiency.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Advantageous Effects of the Present Disclosure</heading><p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to the present disclosure, a sheet resistance value of an epitaxial substrate can be stabilized in a shorter time.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS OF THE PRESENT DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0032" num="0031">First, embodiments of the present disclosure will be listed and described. A method for manufacturing an epitaxial substrate according to an embodiment of the present disclosure includes the steps of: epitaxially growing a group III nitride semiconductor layer on a substrate; removing the substrate from a growth furnace; irradiating a surface of the group III nitride semiconductor layer with ultraviolet light while exposing the surface to an atmosphere containing oxygen; and measuring a sheet resistance value of the group III nitride semiconductor layer.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">When ultraviolet light is irradiated onto the surface of the group III nitride semiconductor layer while exposing the surface of the group III nitride semiconductor layer to an atmosphere containing oxygen, oxidation of the surface of the group III nitride semiconductor layer is accelerated as compared with a case where the substrate is left as it is. This is believed to be due to the following effects. When ultraviolet light is irradiated to the surface of the group III nitride semiconductor layer, the surface of the group III nitride semiconductor layer generates heat. The bonds between various substances contained in the environment outside the growth furnace and group III atoms are broken by this heat. Alternatively, various substances are oxidized into low-density substances. By these actions, various substances are desorbed from the group III nitride semiconductor layer. Immediately after that, oxygen atoms in the atmosphere are combined with group III atoms on the surface of the group III nitride semiconductor layer to oxidize the group III atoms. In this way, oxidation of the surface of the group III nitride semiconductor layer is accelerated, and the sheet resistance value can be stabilized in a shorter time. Therefore, the production lead time can be shortened and the production efficiency can be improved.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the manufacturing method, the surface of the group III nitride semiconductor layer may contain Ga. In this case, upon irradiating ultraviolet light to the surface of the group III nitride semiconductor layer, Ga is changed to GaO<sub>x </sub>due to bonding of an oxygen atom to a Ga atom. Therefore, oxidation of the surface of the group III nitride semiconductor layer is accelerated, and the sheet resistance value can be stabilized in a shorter time.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the manufacturing method, when a Gaussian function is fitted to a Ga 3d peak of the surface of the group III nitride semiconductor layer obtained by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy after the surface is irradiated with ultraviolet light having a center wavelength of 320 nm to 330 nm, a ratio (I<sub>GaO</sub>/I<sub>GaN</sub>) of a GaO intensity I<sub>GaO </sub>to a GaN intensity I<sub>GaN </sub>may be 0.15 or more. According to the experience of the present inventors, when a group III nitride semiconductor layer is epitaxially grown on a substrate and then the substrate is taken out from a growth furnace and left to stand, the sheet resistance value is stabilized in about 48 hours. The ratio (I<sub>GaO</sub>/I<sub>GaN</sub>) indicating the degree of oxidization at that time is about 0.15. According to the measurement method, it is possible to accelerate the degree of oxidation of the group III nitride semiconductor layer to the same degree or more in a short time.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the manufacturing method, the sheet resistance value of the group III nitride semiconductor layer may be measured within 0.2 hours after the substrate is removed from the growth furnace. As described above, according to the described measurement method, the sheet resistance value of the group III nitride semiconductor layer can be measured within an extremely short time after the substrate is taken out from the growth furnace, which can contribute to improvement in production efficiency.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the manufacturing method, the ultraviolet light may have a center wavelength of 422 nm or less. In this case, bonds between the various substances and group III atoms are more rapidly broken by strong energy of ultraviolet light, and oxidation of the surface of the group III nitride semiconductor layer can be more effectively accelerated. The ultraviolet light may be, for example, He&#x2014;Cd laser light. In this case, ultraviolet light UV having a center wavelength in the range from 190 nm to 422 nm can be emitted.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the manufacturing method, an irradiation energy density in the step of irradiating the surface with the ultraviolet light may be 2.4 W&#xb7;s/m<sup>2 </sup>or more. The irradiation energy density is a product of an intensity and an irradiation time of the ultraviolet light. In this case, oxidation of the surface of the group III nitride semiconductor layer is further accelerated, and the sheet resistance value can be stabilized in a shorter time.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The manufacturing method may further include a step of forming an insulating film on a Ga surface of the group III nitride semiconductor layer. In this case, the Ga surface is stabilized, and the sheet resistivity can be stabilized early.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">An epitaxial substrate according to an embodiment of the present disclosure includes a channel layer, a barrier layer, and a capping layer.

The inside of gas pipe <b>51</b> is heated to 250&#xb0; C. or higher, and He and Cd are vaporized into atoms.

This change in the shear resistance value is related to the degree of oxidation of surface <b>12</b><i>a </i>of group III nitride semiconductor layer <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0050">Here, the reason why the sheet resistance value changes depending on the degree of oxidation of surface <b>12</b><i>a </i>of group III nitride semiconductor layer <b>12</b> will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> is a potential schematic diagram (band diagram) of group III nitride semiconductor layer <b>12</b> obtained by simulation.

Therefore, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>, the valley of the conduction band potential at the boundary between AlGaN barrier layer <b>14</b> and GaN channel layer <b>13</b> becomes deeper. As a result, the carrier density of the two dimensional electron gas generated near the interface with AlGaN barrier layer <b>14</b> in GaN channel layer <b>13</b> increases, and the sheet resistance value decreases. For this reason, the sheet resistance value decreases as the oxidation of surface <b>12</b><i>a </i>progresses.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0052">It is considered that the oxidation of surface <b>12</b><i>a </i>takes time for the following reason. When substrate <b>11</b> is taken out of growth furnace GR after group III nitride semiconductor layer <b>12</b> is formed, surface <b>12</b><i>a </i>is exposed to the air atmosphere, and various substances (e.g. hydrocarbon, halogen, sulfur oxide, and nitrogen carbide) contained in the air are physically adsorbed on surface <b>12</b><i>a</i>.

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A to <b>8</b>C</figref>, the vertical axis represents the number of ions, and the horizontal axis represents atomic weight or molecular weight. It is thought that the bonds between these substances and the group III atoms mainly arise from intermolecular forces. Since these bonds are more unstable than the covalent bonds between the group III atoms and oxygen, these substances gradually replace oxygen atoms. Through such a process, it takes a long time to oxidize surface <b>12</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0055" num="0053">In the conventional measurement method, substrate <b>11</b> is taken out from growth furnace GR and then substrate <b>11</b> is left in the atmosphere as it is, pending until the substances of surface <b>12</b><i>a </i>are replaced with oxygen atoms and sufficiently oxidized, and after that, measurement of the sheet resistance value is performed. However, this method requires a long time until surface <b>12</b><i>a </i>is sufficiently oxidized (e.g. about 48 hours), and thus the production lead time is prolonged and the production efficiency is reduced. The method also requires to measure the sheet resistance value a plurality of times before the sheet resistance value is stabilized, which leads to an increase in manufacturing man-hours.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0054">To solve this problem, in the present embodiment, substrate <b>11</b> on which group III nitride semiconductor layer <b>12</b> is formed is taken out from growth furnace GR, and then surface <b>12</b><i>a </i>of group III nitride semiconductor layer <b>12</b> is irradiated with ultraviolet light UV while surface <b>12</b><i>a </i>is exposed to the atmosphere.

When substrate <b>11</b> is taken out from growth furnace GR, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>, various substances <b>61</b> such as hydrocarbon, halogen, sulfur oxide, and nitrogen carbide are bonded to group III atoms (in this example, Ga atoms) <b>60</b> of surface <b>12</b><i>a </i>to inhibit the bonding between a group III atom <b>60</b> and an oxygen atom <b>62</b>. Thus, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref>, when surface <b>12</b><i>a </i>is irradiated with ultraviolet light UV, surface <b>12</b><i>a </i>generates heat. The bonding between each substance <b>61</b> and group III atom <b>60</b> is broken by this heat. Alternatively, each substance <b>61</b> is oxidized and changed into a low-density substance.

In this way, oxidation of surface <b>12</b><i>a </i>is accelerated, and the sheet resistance value can be stabilized in a shorter time. Therefore, according to the present embodiment, it is possible to shorten the production lead time and improve the production efficiency. After that, by growing an insulating film on the Ga surface, it is possible to suppress the variation of the stable sheet resistance value. The insulating film can be grown by Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD). For example, the insulating film may be any one of a silicon nitride film, a silicon oxide film, and a silicon nitride oxide film formed by a growth method such as P-CVD, ALD-CVD, thermal CVD, or LP-CVD.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a graph illustrating the ratio of a sheet resistance value with reference to the sheet resistance value (100%) after 48 hours have passed since substrate <b>11</b> on which group III nitride semiconductor layer <b>12</b> was formed was taken out from growth furnace GR.
