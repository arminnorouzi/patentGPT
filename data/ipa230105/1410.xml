APPLICATION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present description relates to a device, a system and an assembly for performing field genetic analyses, and the related method of use.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In particular, the present description refers to a device, a system and an assembly which allow a non-specialized operator to be able to perform field genetic analyses.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is known in the state of the art to use devices which allow a specialized operator, such as a biotechnologist, to be able to carry out genetic analyses in a specialized laboratory. In the field of molecular biology, genetic analyses are carried out in specialized laboratories to allow qualified operators to be able to safely perform all the procedures for analysing genetic material (DNA and RNA).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Genetic analyses, carried out with molecular biology techniques, are increasingly used in various fields and sectors, such as in the agri-food sector for verifying the varietal authenticity of plants and species of animal raw materials used for the production of finished products. Genetic analyses are also used in the health sector for the diagnosis of genetically determined diseases, and in the veterinary field for the detection of microorganisms responsible for pathologies in animals and for the recognition of animal species.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It should be specified that the procedures in use, through which it is possible to perform genetic analyses, are characterized by the execution of mandatory operations. In particular, all the genetic analysis procedures known in the state of the art include three mandatory steps: a) a first step of extracting the nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) from a sample, b) a second step of amplifying the nucleic acid extract, c) a third step of detecting and interpreting the result. It should be noted that all the devices necessary to perform genetic analyses are present in any specialized laboratory, whereas the necessary reagents and materials are available on the market, sometimes integrated and proposed in the form of laboratory kits for the performance of a specific genetic analysis. By way of example, think of the kit for the performance of a genetic analysis to determine a pathology.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In detail, step a) of extracting the nucleic acid is performed by using reagents that need to be stored at a controlled temperature (for example minus twenty degrees centigrade or four degrees centigrade), or alternatively that must be ready for use and stable at room temperature. In the latter case, the operations of extracting the genetic material take only a few minutes and are considerably simplified. The extraction systems are also available on the market in special kits for genetic analyses, both in the human and in the agri-food sector. In the state of the art, kits for the genetic analyses provide for the nucleic acid to be extracted in the laboratory, by qualified staff and with the aid of devices such as for example micropipettes, benchtop centrifuges and vortexes. The known kits comprise the reagents necessary to perform step a) of extracting the nucleic acid, such reagents comprise for example solutions for the cell lysis of the sample by chemical reaction.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Step b) of amplifying the nucleic acid is carried out by means of the polymerase chain reaction technique, also known as PCR, which allows a specific genetic sequence to be replicated in vitro in order to obtain a sufficient quantity of genetic material for detection. The known kits comprise reagents, such as a solution composed of taq polymerase (enzyme), buffer, nucleotides and magnesium chloride. Said reagents are required to let the gene amplification reaction take place by means of PCR. Furthermore, kits are known which comprise reagents for performing step b) of amplifying the nucleic acid by using reagents and materials ready for use and stored in a stable manner at room temperature, for example lyophilized and vacuum-packed. Step b) of amplifying the nucleic acid must also take place in the laboratory, by qualified staff and with the aid of devices such as micropipettes, mini-centrifuges, thermocyclers and vortexes.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The step c) of detecting and interpreting the result provides that the detection of the result can be performed in different ways, for example through horizontal electrophoresis on agarose gel or, alternatively, by detecting the fluorescence emitted by the analysed sample. In the first case, the known kits comprise for example the precast agarose gel, the electrophoretic miming buffer pre-dosed in a pouch, the molecular weight marker, and the interpretation of the results is entrusted to the operator. The detection takes place in the laboratory, by qualified staff and with the aid of micropipettes, cells and power supplies for electrophoresis, ultraviolet gel readers. As an alternative to ultraviolet gel readers, for example a fluorescence stress and detection system can be used. In this case, known kits provide for the detection to take place through a fluorescence reader, which is also responsible for the automatic interpretation of the results.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Miniaturized laboratories are known in the state of the art which use a device in which, thanks to microfluidic systems (also called lab-on-chip), particularly rapid genetic analyses are carried out. In particular, such microfluidic devices are able to perform steps a) of extracting the nucleic acid and b) of amplifying the nucleic acid in a semi-automatic and simplified manner. That is to say that a specialized operator inserts the materials necessary for the genetic analysis into the device and obtains as a result the amplified DNA on which to perform the step c) of detection and interpretation. However, it should be pointed out that for said genetic analysis to be performed it is necessary that the microfluidic device is used in the laboratory and in combination with instruments such as pumps, syringes, thermocyclers, microscopes and fluorescence readers. Also in this case, genetic testing must be performed by a specialised operator in a suitable laboratory or facility.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Automatic devices called PCR workstations are also known in the state of the art. These are open work platforms containing part of the instrumentation and the consumables necessary to perform genetic tests, structured in a modular way according to the operator's needs. These PCR workstations work through an automatic dispensing system that distributes the reagents, used to carry out the genetic analyses, into special tubes in the appropriate quantities. The PCR workstations are also equipped with a software, which can be installed in an external PC or on a special device (for example a touch screen control panel) that guides the operator in the performance of the various operating steps and allows the operating status of the instrumentation and any graphs obtained at the end of the genetic test to be displayed. Inside the workstation there are also optical sensors that check the work surface before carrying out the various operations by evaluating the presence of consumables and the liquid level of the reagents. The workstations also comprise a barcode reader that recognizes the consumables used by the operator (e.g., tubes, plates, tips) and the samples analysed. The workstation may also comprise accessories such as a thermoblock that allows the sample or reagents to be cooled and heated (between 0-90&#xb0; C.) and a vessel to eliminate separately solid and liquid waste. Inside the workstation it is possible to automatically carry out all the operations necessary to perform a genetic test, from the extraction of the nucleic acid to the detection of the final result.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Documents US 2016/054343 A1 and US 2013/115607 A1 describe systems and methods for carrying out genetic analyses on a sample through a device configured to carry out various operations, including receiving the sample, preparing the same sample and carrying out the analysis thereof. This device can be designed to accommodate more than one sample in order to carry out various analyses simultaneously.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Problem of the Prior Art</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Genetic analyses are currently performed exclusively in specialized laboratories, equipped with highly qualified equipment and professionalism, to which the samples are to be sent in order to be analysed. The costs of the analyses and the waiting times for the results, aggravated by the shipping times of the samples, are in some cases incompatible with the needs of industries (for example the agri-food industry) which require speed and simplicity of execution. Therefore, the companies cannot carry out field genetic analyses, and it is not possible to obtain results in a short time.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">As mentioned above, there are also miniaturized systems, that is microfluidic systems, which thanks to the small size and the multiplicity of functions that they can perform on a single chip, are currently identified as miniaturized laboratories. It should be noted that microfluidic systems can only be used by specialized staff in an environment suitable for performing genetic analyses. Furthermore, microfluidic systems are small-sized devices and therefore easy to transport, but for them to be used for genetic analyses they need to operate in combination with instruments that are normally present in a specialized laboratory only.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">As mentioned above, there are also PCR workstations, for which it should be noted that although they make all the operations necessary for performing a genetic test fully automatic and controlled, they are very cumbersome and are not suitable for carrying out in situ tests, since they require an organized facility, such as specialized laboratories, and large working spaces. It should be noted that this type of platform requires the presence of a specialized operator for interpreting the results and for selecting the type of operations required for the performance of a genetic test.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In summary, the known systems presuppose the use by operators with in-depth knowledge of the devices and of the common molecular biology operations, as well as in-depth knowledge of the steps of nucleic acid extraction, of amplification of the extracted nucleic acid and of detection and interpretation of the result.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Therefore, known systems can only be used by specialized staff inside suitable laboratories. In fact, the skills of a specialized operator are demanded in order to have a correct interpretation and validation of the results. Such systems are complex and require long usage times. Therefore, known systems do not allow to perform in situ genetic analyses.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The object of the present invention is to realise a portable device complete with all the necessary instrumentation in order to be able to perform genetic analyses outside a suitable facility, such as for example a specialized laboratory.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">A further object of the present invention is to realise a system capable of guiding and monitoring an operator during the performance of all the steps necessary for a genetic analysis.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">A further object of the present invention is therefore to realise a system capable of providing an automatic detection and interpretation of the result.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">A further object of the present invention is to realise a system equipped with mechanisms for the automatic check of the correct performance of the activities carried out by the operator for the automatic validation of the result.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">A further object of the present invention is to realise an assembly in order to be able to perform genetic analyses together with the reagents, too.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">A further object of the present invention is to realise a method for performing a genetic analysis by using an assembly for genetic analyses within the scope of the present invention.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Advantages of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Thanks to an embodiment, it is possible to realise a device for genetic analyses that can be used in situ in order to be able to perform field genetic analyses in a short time.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Thanks to a further embodiment, it is possible to realise a system for genetic analyses which allows a non-specialized operator to be able to perform genetic analyses autonomously and safely.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Thanks to a further embodiment, it is possible to realise a method for using an assembly for genetic analyses of the present invention, which allows a non-specialized operator to be able to autonomously perform field genetic analyses.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The characteristics and advantages of the present disclosure will become clear from the following detailed description of a possible practical embodiment, illustrated by way of non-limiting example in the set of drawings, wherein:</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a schematic representation of a device inserted in a system according to the present invention;</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a schematic representation of an embodiment of a system according to the present invention;</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a schematic representation of an embodiment of an assembly according to the present invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Even when not explicitly highlighted, the individual features described with reference to the specific embodiments must be considered as accessories and/or exchangeable with other features, described with reference to other embodiments.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The present invention relates to a device <b>1</b> for performing genetic analyses conformed so as to be transportable manually by a user <b>4</b>. Advantageously, the user <b>4</b> can carry out the in situ genetic analysis. In the following, for brevity's sake, reference will be made in a non-limiting way to an in situ genetic analysis as a genetic analysis carried out in the field, that is to say in the specific place where it is intended to carry out a genetic analysis in a rapid and timely manner, and outside a specialized laboratory. A place where it is possible to carry out field genetic analysis is for example the building of an agri-food industry, a medical-veterinary clinic, customs offices or a pharmacy. The device <b>1</b> can be contained in a suitcase or bag or similar container to allow the user <b>4</b> to be able to transport the entire device <b>1</b> to the place where a genetic analysis is to be carried out. Advantageously, the user <b>4</b> can transport the device <b>1</b> to an agricultural site, a company, a medical or veterinary surgery and in general to the place where an in situ genetic analysis is to be performed.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The device <b>1</b> comprises a casing <b>12</b> defining an internal compartment <b>13</b>. The device <b>1</b> comprises at least one analysis unit <b>5</b> housed in the internal compartment <b>13</b>. The analysis unit <b>5</b> is configured to perform a genetic analysis of at least one sample and comprises a sample holder compartment <b>14</b> which is accessible by the user <b>4</b> and adapted to accommodate the at least one sample. Preferably, the sample holder compartment <b>14</b> comprises a plurality of seats <b>19</b> each of them configured to house a respective sample. Preferably, the sample holder compartment <b>14</b> extends longitudinally defining a groove in which several seats are aligned, preferably twelve seats <b>19</b>. Advantageously, it is possible to carry out the genetic analysis of several samples simultaneously in order to have a reliable result.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The device <b>1</b> comprises a plurality of analysis units <b>5</b> arranged in the internal compartment <b>13</b>. Each analysis unit <b>5</b> is configured to perform a respective and independent genetic analysis.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the following, for brevity's sake, reference will be made in a non-limiting way to a genetic analysis as the procedure through which it is possible to obtain a genetic identification of at least one biological sample to be analysed. In particular, reference will be made to a plurality of steps necessary for the performance of a genetic analysis as the set of all the passages that are necessary for preparing and genetically analysing at least one sample. The genetic analysis is conducted through a plurality of steps, among which three are mandatory for each type of genetic analysis: a) a first step of extracting the nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) from a sample, b) a second step of amplifying the extracted nucleic acid, c) a third step of detecting and interpretation the result.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Preferably, the technology used to perform step b) of amplifying the nucleic acid preferably comprises the LAMP (Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification) technology.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The LAMP technology is a type of DNA amplification that allows obtaining numerous copies of DNA using a single reaction temperature, thanks to the use of a specific enzyme (i.e., Bst polymerase). Compared to traditional gene amplification techniques, LAMP is much faster and easier to perform, besides having lower costs for both reagents and instrumentation necessary for the analyses. This technology is suitable for performing genetic analyses quickly, without using particular laboratory equipment and with no need for specialized staff.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Each analysis unit <b>5</b> comprises a command and control unit <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The analysis unit <b>5</b> comprises at least one sensor <b>8</b>. Each sensor <b>8</b> is in signal communication with the command and control unit <b>6</b>.

In particular, the sensor <b>8</b> is configured to detect a first physical quantity relative to the genetic analysis of the sample and to transduce said first physical quantity into a first signal S<b>1</b>. The first signal S<b>1</b> is indicative of the state of progress of the genetic analysis.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In other words, each sensor <b>8</b> is capable of monitoring a respective first physical quantity associated with the genetic analysis, in order to provide a live monitoring of the genetic analysis being executed. By way of example, think of an optical sensor capable of detecting the level of the solution in a test tube, or a temperature sensor for monitoring the temperature in the analysis unit <b>5</b> or a chemical sensor for detecting the pH of a solution.
