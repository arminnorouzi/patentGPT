The method includes moving the indexing pin along the indexing track from the first indexing position to a second upper index position. The second upper index position is on the pass-through indexing path. The method includes moving the indexing pin along the indexing track from the second upper index position to a second indexing position.

In some embodiments, a downhole tool may be actuated using an indexing track and pin assembly. An increase in hydraulic pressure may cause a piston to move longitudinally. An indexing pin may be inserted into an indexing channel. At an actuation pressure, the indexing pin may follow an indexing path to an actuating position or a pass-through position. By following one of a plurality of indexing paths, the indexing pin may actuate the downhole tool.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some embodiments, the indexing track may be reset to a known position (e.g., the pre-actuating position or the pre-pass-through position) by following a shifting indexing path. The shifting indexing path may include cycling from a low flow rate to an indexing flow rate and back to the low flow rate. The shifting indexing path may reset the indexing track and pin assembly to the known position without having to determine the position using pressure measurements, either at the surface or downhole. For example, at the low flow rate, the indexing track and pin assembly may be in a pre-actuating position (e.g., a position where, when the flow rate is increased, the indexing track and pin assembly will follow an actuating path to an actuating position in which the downhole tool is actuated). By cycling through the shifting indexing path, the indexing track and pin assembly may change positions to a pre-pass-through position (e.g., a position where, when the flow rate is increased, the indexing track and pin assembly will follow a pass-through path to a pass-through position in which the flow rate is high, but the downhole tool is not actuated).</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Cycling through the shifting indexing path starting in the pre-pass-through position may result in the indexing track and pin assembly remaining in the pre-pass-through position. Therefore, regardless of the position of the indexing track and pin assembly, cycling through the shifting indexing path may cause the indexing track and pin assembly to revert to a pre-pass-through position, without the need for pressure or volumetric flow rate measurements at the downhole tool. This may allow the operator to set the indexing track and pin assembly to the pre-pass-through position, which may help to prevent unintended actuation of the downhole tool and ensure that the operator knows in what state the indexing track and pin assembly is positioned.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows one example of a drilling system <b>100</b> for drilling an earth formation <b>101</b> to form a wellbore <b>102</b>. The drilling system <b>100</b> includes a drill rig <b>103</b> used to turn a drilling tool assembly <b>104</b> which extends downward into the wellbore <b>102</b>. The drilling tool assembly <b>104</b> may include a drill string <b>105</b>, a bottomhole assembly (&#x201c;BHA&#x201d;) <b>106</b>, and a bit <b>110</b>, attached to the downhole end of drill string <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The drill string <b>105</b> may include several joints of drill pipe <b>108</b> connected end-to-end through tool joints <b>109</b>. The drill string <b>105</b> transmits drilling fluid through a central bore and transmits rotational power from the drill rig <b>103</b> to the BHA <b>106</b>. In some embodiments, the drill string <b>105</b> may further include additional components such as subs, pup joints, etc. The drill pipe <b>108</b> provides a hydraulic passage through which drilling fluid is pumped from the surface. The drilling fluid discharges through selected-size nozzles, jets, or other orifices in the bit <b>110</b> for the purposes of cooling the bit <b>110</b> and cutting structures thereon, and for lifting cuttings out of the wellbore <b>102</b> as it is being drilled.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The BHA <b>106</b> may include the bit <b>110</b> or other components. An example BHA <b>106</b> may include additional or other components (e.g., coupled between to the drill string <b>105</b> and the bit <b>110</b>). Examples of additional BHA components include drill collars, stabilizers, measurement-while-drilling (&#x201c;MWD&#x201d;) tools, logging-while-drilling (&#x201c;LWD&#x201d;) tools, downhole motors, underreamers, section mills, hydraulic disconnects, jars, vibration or dampening tools, other components, or combinations of the foregoing. The BHA <b>106</b> may further include a rotary steerable system (RSS). The RSS may include directional drilling tools that change a direction of the bit <b>110</b>, and thereby the trajectory of the wellbore. At least a portion of the RSS may maintain a geostationary position relative to an absolute reference frame, such as gravity, magnetic north, and/or true north. Using measurements obtained with the geostationary position, the RSS may locate the bit <b>110</b>, change the course of the bit <b>110</b>, and direct the directional drilling tools on a projected trajectory.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In general, the drilling system <b>100</b> may include other drilling components and accessories, such as special valves (e.g., kelly cocks, blowout preventers, and safety valves). Additional components included in the drilling system <b>100</b> may be considered a part of the drilling tool assembly <b>104</b>, the drill string <b>105</b>, or a part of the BHA <b>106</b> depending on their locations in the drilling system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The bit <b>110</b> in the BHA <b>106</b> may be any type of bit suitable for degrading downhole materials. For instance, the bit <b>110</b> may be a drill bit suitable for drilling the earth formation <b>101</b>. Example types of drill bits used for drilling earth formations are fixed-cutter or drag bits. In other embodiments, the bit <b>110</b> may be a mill used for removing metal, composite, elastomer, other materials downhole, or combinations thereof. For instance, the bit <b>110</b> may be used with a whipstock to mill into casing <b>107</b> lining the wellbore <b>102</b>. The bit <b>110</b> may also be a junk mill used to mill away tools, plugs, cement, other materials within the wellbore <b>102</b>, or combinations thereof. Swarf or other cuttings formed by use of a mill may be lifted to surface, or may be allowed to fall downhole.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic representation of at least a portion of a BHA <b>206</b>, according to at least one embodiment of the present disclosure. The BHA <b>206</b> shown includes a downhole motor <b>212</b> and a downhole tool <b>214</b>. A fluid flow <b>216</b> may flow through the BHA <b>206</b>. In the embodiment shown, the downhole tool <b>214</b> is located downstream of the fluid flow <b>216</b> from the downhole motor <b>212</b>. In other words, the downhole tool <b>214</b> is located downhole of the downhole motor <b>212</b>. For example, the downhole tool <b>214</b> may be an expandable tool, such as a reamer, a stabilizer, a directional drilling steering pad, any other expandable tool, and combinations thereof. In some examples, the downhole tool <b>214</b> may be any other downhole tool, such as a mud pulse generator, downhole turbine, any other downhole tool, and combinations thereof. While the downhole tool <b>214</b> is shown as below the downhole motor <b>212</b>, it should be understood that the downhole tool <b>214</b> may be located in any location on a drilling assembly, including uphole (e.g., upstream) of the downhole motor <b>212</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some embodiments, the downhole tool <b>214</b> may be hydraulically actuated. Hydraulic actuation of a downhole tool <b>214</b> may change the pressure of the fluid flow <b>216</b>. In some embodiments, the difference in pressure between an actuated and a deactuated hydraulically actuated downhole tool <b>214</b> may be measurable at the surface. In other words, an operator at the surface may be able to determine whether the downhole tool <b>214</b> is actuated or deactuated based on the pressure of the fluid flow <b>216</b>. In some embodiments, the operator may not be able to determine whether the downhole tool <b>214</b> is actuated or deactuated because the pressure drop is not large enough to be reliably measured at the surface, or because other downhole tools, such as the downhole motor <b>212</b>, may prevent the pressure drop from reliably and measurably transmitting to the surface. In other words, the operator may not be able to determine whether the downhole tool <b>214</b> is actuated based on a pressure measurement of the downhole tool <b>214</b> at the surface or at the downhole tool <b>214</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">If the operator cannot determine the actuation status of the downhole tool <b>214</b>, the operator may erroneously actuate or deactuate the downhole tool <b>214</b>. This may cause the downhole tool <b>214</b> to operate at the wrong time or not to operate when intended. This may cause damage to the wellbore, damage to the downhole tool <b>214</b>, damage to the BHA <b>206</b>, reduce penetration rates, throw off the course of the wellbore, cause other challenges, and combinations thereof. An indexing track and pin assembly according to embodiments of the present disclosure may allow the operator to reset the downhole tool <b>214</b> to a known position. This may allow the operator to reliably operate the downhole tool, thereby reducing damage to downhole components, increasing the rate of penetration, and reducing costs.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a side view of a representation of an indexing track <b>318</b> of an indexing track and pin assembly, according to at least one embodiment of the present disclosure. The indexing track <b>318</b> includes an indexing channel <b>320</b> and a plurality of protrusions <b>322</b>. As discussed below, An indexing pin may be inserted into the indexing channel <b>320</b>. Longitudinal movement of the indexing track <b>318</b> relative to the indexing pin (e.g., by a hydraulic pressure and/or a resilient member) and may follow one of a plurality of indexing paths. When the indexing pin contacts one of the protrusions <b>322</b>, at least one of the indexing pin and indexing track <b>318</b> may rotate.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The indexing track <b>318</b> is connected to a valve shaft <b>324</b>. The valve shaft <b>324</b> includes an opening <b>326</b>. As the indexing track <b>318</b> moves longitudinally and rotates in response to the indexing pin contacting a protrusion <b>322</b>, the opening may rotationally and longitudinally align with a port in a surrounding piston, which may allow fluid to flow through the opening, into the port, and actuate the downhole tool (e.g., the downhole tool <b>214</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of a downhole tool <b>414</b>, including an indexing track and pin assembly <b>428</b>, according to at least one embodiment of the present disclosure. The indexing track and pin assembly <b>428</b> includes an indexing track <b>418</b> and an indexing pin <b>430</b>. The indexing pin <b>430</b> is inserted into an indexing channel <b>420</b> of the indexing track <b>418</b>. As the indexing track <b>418</b> moves longitudinally relative to the indexing pin <b>430</b>, the indexing pin may contact one or more protrusions <b>422</b> of the indexing track <b>418</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Depending on the rotational position of the indexing track <b>418</b> (as rotated by the indexing pin <b>430</b>), fluid flow may enter an actuation channel <b>432</b>. For example, the fluid may pass through the opening <b>426</b> of the indexing track <b>418</b>. The fluid flow may then actuate the downhole tool <b>414</b>. In the embodiment shown, a plurality of steering pads <b>434</b> may be actuated. The steering pads <b>434</b> may be used to point a drill bit during directional drilling. In the embodiment shown, the steering pads <b>434</b> may remain actuated during drilling. For example, the steering pads <b>434</b> may remain actuated during slide drilling. In some embodiments, a ramp, shim, or other element could directly actuate an expandable tool. For example, the steering pads <b>434</b> may be actuated by a ramp on the indexing track, and may not be hydraulically actuated directly.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>-<b>1</b></figref> is a representation of an indexing track and pin assembly <b>528</b> laid flat (e.g., the circumferential wall of a cylindrical indexing track <b>518</b> projected flat), according to at least one embodiment of the present disclosure. When deactuated (e.g., at low flow rates), the indexing pin <b>530</b> may be in a pre-actuating position <b>536</b> or a pre-pass-through position <b>538</b>. In the pre-actuating position <b>536</b>, the indexing track and pin assembly may follow an actuating indexing path (e.g., actuation path <b>540</b>-<b>1</b> and the return path <b>540</b>-<b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>-<b>1</b></figref>) to an actuating position <b>544</b> when the fluid flow is increased to the actuation flow rate.

In some embodiments, a downhole tool may be actuated using an indexing track and pin assembly. An increase in hydraulic pressure may cause a piston to move longitudinally. An indexing pin may be inserted into an indexing channel. At an actuation pressure, the indexing pin may follow an indexing path to an actuating position or a pass-through position. By following one of a plurality of indexing paths, the indexing pin may actuate the downhole tool.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some embodiments, the downhole tool may be deactuated at a low flow rate. As the flow rate increases to an actuating flow rate, the indexing pin may follow an actuating indexing path in the indexing track, which may cause the indexing track and pin assembly to move to an actuating position. In the actuating position, the downhole tool may be actuated. As the flow rate decreases from the actuating flow rate (e.g., the high flow rate) to the low flow rate, the indexing track and pin assembly may move to a pass-through position. In some embodiments, the indexing track and pin assembly may be cylindrical, and therefore the cycle of deactuated to actuated may be repeated indefinitely by cycling the flow rate between the deactuated flow rate and the actuating flow rate.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some embodiments, when the flow rate increases from the deactuated flow rate to the actuating flow rate, the indexing pin may follow a pass-through indexing path in the indexing channel. The pass-through indexing path may cause the indexing pin to move to a pass-through position. In the pass-through position, the downhole tool is deactuated while the fluid flow is at or higher than the high flow rate. In this manner, the downhole tool may be included on a BHA for use during downhole operations. In some embodiments, the indexing track and pin assembly may be cylindrical, and therefore the cycle of deactuated to pass-through may be repeated indefinitely.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some embodiments, the indexing track and pin assembly may change the indexing path from the actuating indexing path to the pass-through indexing path. In other words, the cycle of deactuated to actuated may be changed to the cycle of deactuated to pass-through. By changing the indexing path, the downhole tool may be selectively actuated when needed or desired. In some embodiments, changing the indexing path may be accomplished by changing the fluid flow from the high flow rate to an indexing flow rate, the indexing flow rate having a flow rate between the low flow rate and the high flow rate. The flow rate may then be increased from the indexing flow rate to the high flow rate. In this manner, the indexing path may be changed. In some embodiments, the indexing path may be changed by changing the indexing flow rate from the low flow rate to the indexing flow rate and back to the low flow rate.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In some embodiments, when the flow rate is increased to the high flow rate, the difference in pressure drop between the actuating position and the pass-through position may be different. In some embodiments, this difference in pressure drop may be detected by the operator at the surface. In this manner, the operator may be able to determine whether the downhole tool is actuated based on the measured pressure drop.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some embodiments, the pressure drop may not be detectable, or may be unreliably detectable, at the surface. For example, the downhole tool may be located downhole of a mud motor. The mud motor may mask or reduce the effects of pressure drops of any downhole tool downhole of the mud motor. In some embodiments, the pressure drop may be too low to be measured. In this situation, to determine whether the downhole tool is actuated, the operator may need to keep track of whether the indexing paths have been changed by cycling through the indexing flow. However, it is possible for the operator to lose track of the indexing path. For example, the operator may not pay attention, may forget to write down the initial indexing path, or may lose track of the indexing path through any other operator error. In some embodiments, even if the operator is careful and has not made any errors, the indexing path may change by accident, such as by a momentary loss or reduction in circulation not detected at the surface. Not knowing on which indexing path the indexing track and pin assembly is located may cause the downhole tool to unintentionally actuate and/or not to actuate when desired. This may damage the wellbore, damage the downhole tool, reduce the rate of penetration, increase costs, cause any other concern, and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">When deactuated (e.g., at low flow rates), the indexing track and pin assembly may be in a pre-actuating position or a pre-pass-through position. In the pre-actuating position, the indexing track and pin assembly may follow the actuating indexing path when the fluid flow is increased to the actuation flow rate. In the pre-pass-through position, the indexing track and pin assembly may follow the pass-through indexing path when the fluid flow is increased to the actuation flow rate.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some embodiments, the indexing track may be reset to a known position (e.g., the pre-actuating position or the pass-through position) by undergoing a track shift.

While the embodiment above has been discussed with the shifting indexing path starting at a low flow rate (e.g., the deactuated flow rate), and the changing indexing path starting at a high flow rate (e.g., the actuating flow rate), it should be understood that the shifting indexing path may start at the high flow rate and the changing indexing path may start at the low flow rate.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In some embodiments, the indexing track and pin assembly includes an indexing pin inserted into an indexing track. To follow the actuating indexing path, the indexing pin is inserted into the indexing track in a first pre-actuating position (e.g., a first upper position).

As the indexing pin contacts a wall of the indexing track, one or both of the indexing track and the indexing pin may rotate relative to each other. The combined rotational and longitudinal movement may cause the indexing pin to move into the actuating position to actuate the downhole tool (e.g., a first lower index position).</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The actuating indexing path may include moving the indexing track and/or the indexing pin longitudinally in a second direction opposite the first direction.

Thus, in some embodiments, the first pre-actuating position is the same as the second pre-actuating position. In some embodiments, the first actuating path is different from the second pre-actuating position.

The indexing pin may move from the pass-through position into a first changing position located longitudinally between the pre-actuating position and the actuating position (and between the pre-pass-through position and the pass-through position). The indexing pin may then move longitudinally in the first direction (with the corresponding rotational movement) to the actuating position. Similarly, the indexing pin may start in the actuating position, move to a second changing position, and back to the pass-through position. Thus, the indexing path may be changed between the actuating path and the pass-through path.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In some embodiments, the indexing paths (e.g., the actuating indexing path, the pass-through indexing path, the shifting indexing path, and the changing indexing path) may be directed by a plurality of protrusions in the indexing track. The plurality of protrusions may extend radially outward from the indexing track. The walls of the plurality of protrusions may be the walls that the indexing pin contacts while traveling one of the indexing paths.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In some embodiments, the plurality of protrusions may be non-symmetrical. A non-symmetrical protrusion may not have any axis of symmetry. In some embodiments, the plurality of protrusions may include a first protrusion, a second protrusion, a third protrusion, and a fourth protrusion. The indexing pin may move longitudinally from the pre-pass-through position and contact a first upper wall on the first protrusion. The first upper wall may direct (e.g., be angled toward) the indexing pin and/or the indexing path to rotate toward the pre-actuating position.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The second protrusion may include a second upper wall. When the indexing pin moves and rotates past the first upper wall, the indexing pin may contact the second upper wall on the second protrusion. The second upper wall may cause (e.g., be angled toward) the indexing pin and/or the indexing track to further rotate toward the pre-actuating position. In some embodiments, as the indexing pin moves and rotates past the second upper wall, the indexing pin may move contact a transition wall between the actuating position and the pass-through position. This may rotate and move the indexing pin into the pass-through position.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In some embodiments, after the indexing pin engages the second upper wall and before the indexing pin engages the transition wall, the indexing pin may move back toward the actuating path position (e.g., the fluid flow may be reduced at the indexing flow). The indexing pin may contact a first lower surface on the third protrusion. The first lower surface may cause the indexing pin and/or the indexing track to move circumferentially past the actuating position and toward the pass-through position.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In some embodiments, the indexing pin may move toward the third protrusion from the pre-actuating position. The indexing pin may contact a third upper wall on the third protrusion. The third upper wall may cause the indexing track and/or the indexing pin to move and rotate toward the pre-pass-through position. After the indexing pin moves past the third upper wall, the indexing pin may move toward and contact a fourth upper wall on the fourth protrusion. The fourth upper wall may further direct the indexing pin to move toward the pre-pass-through position. After the indexing pin moves past the fourth upper wall, the indexing pin may contact a second transition surface between the pass-through position and the actuating position and may be directed to the actuating position.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In some embodiments, after the indexing pin passes the third upper wall, the flow may be reduced from the indexing flow rate to the low flow rate. This may cause the indexing pin to move back toward the pre-pass-through position and be directed into the pass-through pass position. Thus, the shifting indexing path starting from the pre-actuating position may cause the indexing pin to be shifted back to the pre-pass-through position.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In some embodiments, to change from the pass-through position to the actuating position, the indexing pin may move from the pass-through position and contact a first lower wall on the fourth protrusion, which may cause (e.g., be angled toward) the indexing pin and/or the indexing track to move rotate toward the actuating position. After the indexing pin has moved from the first lower wall, the flow may be increased from an indexing flow to the actuating flow. This may cause the indexing pin to move longitudinally toward the actuating position, and the indexing pin may contact the second transition wall to move the indexing pin into the actuating position.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">To change from the actuating position to the pass-through position, the indexing pin may move out of the actuating position and contact a second lower wall of the first protrusion. The second lower wall may direct (e.g., be angled toward) the indexing pin and/or the indexing track to rotate toward the pass-through position. When the indexing pin moves from the second lower wall, the indexing pin may be moved to a third lower wall on the first protrusion, the third lower wall may further direct the indexing pin and/or the track to rotate toward the pass-through position. When the flow is increased from the indexing flow to the actuating flow, the indexing pin may contact the second upper surface on the second protrusion, which may direct the indexing pin to the pass-through position.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In some embodiments, a method for actuating a downhole tool includes moving an indexing pin from a first upper index position to a first indexing position. The first upper index position may be any upper index position, such as a pre-actuating position or a pre-pass-through position. The method may include moving the indexing pin from the first indexing position to a second upper index position. The second upper index position may be any upper index position, such as a pre-actuating position or a pre-pass-through position. The method may include moving the indexing pin from the second upper index position to a second indexing position and moving the indexing pin from the second indexing position to a third upper index position. The third upper index position may be the same position as the second upper index position. Or, in other words, the second upper index position and the third upper index position may both be positioned for the indexing pin to follow the same indexing path, such as the actuating indexing path or the pass-through indexing path.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In some embodiments, a method for actuating a downhole tool includes increasing a fluid flow from a low flow rate to an indexing flow rate. The method may further include decreasing the fluid flow rate from the indexing flow rate to the low flow rate. The method may include shifting an indexing track and pin assembly to a known position independent of a starting position of the indexing track and pin assembly. In some embodiments, shifting the indexing track and pin assembly may be based on the increase in fluid flow rate to the indexing flow rate and the decrease from the indexing flow rate. In some embodiments, the indexing track and pin assembly may be shifted to the known position without any pressure or volumetric flow rate measurements at the downhole tool.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Following are sections of the systems and methods of the present disclosure:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0075">1.
