PAES is a generic term used to describe any polymer containing at least one sulfone group (&#x2014;SO2-), at least one ether group (&#x2014;O&#x2014;) and at least one arylene group.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A commercially important group of PAES includes polysulfone polymers identified herein as polysulfones, in short PSU. PSU polymers contain recurring units derived from the condensation of the dihydroxy monomer bisphenol A (BPA) and a dihalogen monomer, for example 4,4&#x2032;-dichlorodiphenyl sulfone (DCDPS). Such PSU polymers are commercially available from Solvay Specialty Polymers USA LLC under the trademark UDEL&#xae;.

PES polymers derive from the condensation of the dihydroxy monomer bisphenol S (BPS) and a dihalogen monomer, for example 4,4&#x2032;-dichlorodiphenyl sulfone (DCDPS).

PSU and PES polymers, respectively based on BPA and BPS, are also frequently used to prepare membranes to be used in contact with biological fluids, for example blood. In recent years, concerns have been raised about BPA and BPS's safety. There is therefore a need for polymeric materials based on monomers distinct from BPS and BPA.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0008">The membrane described in the present invention is based on a PAES polymer which is BPA and BPS free. More precisely, the PAES of the present invention is preferably based on tetra-alkylated bisphenol F, for example tetra-methyl bisphenol F (TMBPF), which has low or no endocrine disruption potential.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0009">US 2014/0113093 (Solvay) describes PAES polymers derived from specific aromatic diols, which have weak binding affinity for estrogen receptors and are well-suited for the food and drugs industry, advantageously having a lower risk for human health. This document does not describe the use of tetra-alkylated bisphenol F.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0010">The article of Sundell et al.

(International Journal of Hydrogen Energy (2012), 37(12), 9873-9881) relates to self-crosslinked alkaline electrolyte membranes based on quaternary ammonium poly (ether sulfone) for high-performance alkaline fuel cells, and notably describes the synthesis of tetramethylbisphenol F polysulfone from TMBPF and DCDPS in the presence of potassium carbonate, dimethylsulfoxide and toluene.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0012">These articles however do not describe the use of such polymers to prepare membranes for purifying biological fluids. Notably these documents do not describe a method for purifying a biological fluid comprising at least a filtration step through such membranes.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0013">WO 2018/079733 (Mitsui) relates to a forward osmosis membrane comprising a semipermeable membrane and a porous substrate disposed on at least one side thereof. The semipermeable membrane comprises a protonic acid group-containing aromatic polyether resin. The copolymer of example 8 results from the condensation of 40 mol. % disulfonated DCDPS and 60 mol. % of DCDPS with TMBPF in a DMSO/toluene solvent blend. Such copolymer however presents a too low molecular weight which makes it unsuitable for the preparation of membranes.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0014">WO17096140 (GE) relates generally to polymer blends used for making hollow fiber membranes. The polymer blends comprise at least one polymer comprising zwitterionic groups. US 2019/106545 (Fresenius), relates to a polysulfone-urethane copolymer, as well as methods are disclosed for incorporating the copolymer in membranes (e g., spun hollow or flat membranes). US 2014/113093 (Solvay) relates to new polymers having reduced estrogenic activity. The invention further relates to compositions containing such polymers, and articles made from such polymers.
