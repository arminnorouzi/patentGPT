Dextran <b>70</b> is included in the WHO's &#x2018;Model List of Essential Medicines&#x2019; needed in any health system. More relevant from the point of view of this patent application is the fact that in biomedical applications dextran is effective in protecting metal nanoparticles from oxidation and improving biocompatibility. Dextrans, particularly the higher molecular weight representatives of the class, are also known as effective dispersing agents. For all these reasons, dextrans are excellent candidates as reducing dispersants in the preparation of silver nanoparticles for biomedical uses.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0023">Glucose, the building block of dextrans, has a reducing character due to the presence of the aldehydic group in the molecule. In acidic and neutral conditions its redox potential is slightly positive (+0.050V), which makes it a mild reductant inadequate for converting efficiently and completely silver ions to metallic silver (Eq. 1).</p><p id="p-0022" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>7</sub>+2H<sup>+</sup>+2<i>e</i><sup>&#x2212;</sup>&#x2192;C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>+H<sub>2</sub>O <i>E&#xb0;=+</i>0.05V &#x2003;&#x2003;(Eq. 1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0023" num="0024">In alkaline medium the redox potential drops to approximately &#x2212;1.00V and glucose becomes a strong reducing agent.

Consequently, the pH decreases gradually in the system and the reduction may stop before all silver ions are reduced. It has been previously demonstrated by the author' that the silver ions will not be reduced by dextrose (a sugar molecule with identical reducing properties) unless the pH is above 9.5 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). It was also shown that in order to have a faster reduction that leads to a faster nucleation and the formation of Ag nanoparticles, the pH has to be significantly higher than this value (preferably above 12.5).</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The control of pH is even more critical when attempting to produce concentrated dispersions of Ag since the pH drop can be very large. At a silver concentration of 1.0% (0.1 mol/L), for example, sufficient protons are released to cause the pH to drop from 12.0 to less than 8.0 during the reduction. It is imperative that a high pH is maintained throughout the reduction to ensure a complete silver reduction. This can be achieved either by adding an excess of base, by providing buffering conditions that maintain a high pH throughout the reduction, or both.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Dextrans are complex branched polysaccharides derived from the condensation of glucose molecules through glycosidic C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>3 </sub>and C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6 </sub>linkages (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). The condensation of monomers proceeds when lactic acid bacteria are added to glucose solutions, the molecular weight being controlled in a very wide range (from 1,000 to 40,000,000 daltons).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As they incorporate glucose molecules in their structure, dextrans display similar reducing behavior as the monomer (mild reducing agents in acidic medium and strong ones in alkaline). The reduction potential for dextran has not been precisely determined but is likely slightly more positive than that of glucose (Eq. 1) due to the sugar molecules interlinking. This makes dextrans weaker reducing agent than the individual sugars.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">There has been extensive debate whether the electrons are supplied by a single or (as it is possible for glucose) by multiple carbons in the pyranose ring. It was also debated whether only the end sugar molecules in dextran polymer participate in the reduction process or the intermediate ones as well. It is clear, however, that due to interlinking only the terminal glucose molecules can undergo complete oxidation to preserve the integrity of the macromolecule. This has several important consequences impacting the present patent application.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">First, the number of electrons released from molecular dextrans depends on molecular weight. Secondly, when silver ions and dextran are rapidly brought in contact the electrons involved in reduction are released by the reducing groups at the periphery of the macromolecule.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Dextrans have been used recently to reduce silver ions and form silver nanoparticles. The studies refer only to dilute systems (silver concentration less than 0.05%) in which the silver precursor and the dextran were combined together and let react. Due to the high dilution, the systems described do not pose the same challenges as the concentrated system (&#x2265;1.0% Ag) described in this patent application in regard to the evolution of pH during the reduction of silver ions. These works also do not disclose whether the silver ions have been reduced completely as the focus was only on the evaluation of the silver nanoparticles not the effectiveness of the reduction process.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The teachings of the present application differ from what is known in the art in several important aspects. Some examples are detailed below.<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0034">1. The silver concentration in the precipitation system is at least an order of magnitude higher than what has previously been taught (&#x2265;1.0% Ag). This is made possible by selecting conditions (pH, temperature, dispersant amount) which maintain a high reduction rate of silver throughout the precipitation process.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0035">2. The pH of the system is maintained between 12.5 and 13.5 at all times by adding a large excess of base to neutralize the protons released from the reaction and to keep the reduction kinetics unchanged.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0036">3. The temperature necessary for rapid and complete reduction must be between 50 and 75 degrees C., inclusive.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0037">4. Ammonia is used as a complexing agent to maintain a high and constant pH (12.5-13.5) through buffering. For example, silver nitrate is reacted with ammonium hydroxide to form the silver ammonia complex. The ammonia released from the reduction of the latter forms a buffer with a base (e.g., sodium hydroxide) maintaining the necessary high pH throughout the reduction.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0005" num="0038">5. The silver ions and dextran are prevented to get in contact before establishing conditions for a fast reduction to ensure that silver ions are reduced by the peripheral glucose molecules. Viewed from another perspective, the silver precursor and dextran should not be mixed before conditions for a rapid reaction exist such that the silver ions react with dextran before they have the chance to diffuse inside the macromolecules of dextran. This allows for the use of the molecular weight of dextran as an effective way to tailor the size of silver particles in dispersions (e.g., prepare a dispersion where all of the silver nanoparticles are about <b>15</b> nm (e.g., 15&#xb1;5 nm) using dextran of a first molecular weight, as well as a separate dispersion with all silver particles at about 60 nm (e.g., about 60&#xb1;10 nm) using dextran of a second molecular weight). As a result, the nucleation rate and thus the particle size can be varied in wide range by changing the molecular weight of dextran. The unexpected consequence of this finding is that, in contrast to what previous studies showed, the particle size decreases with the decrease in the molecular weight of dextran. The explanation of this surprising effect is captured in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>B</figref>.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0035" num="0039">When the silver precursor is mixed with the dextran before conditions for a fast reaction are established (pH below <b>9</b>.<b>0</b> and temperature below <b>40</b> C), the Ag+ ions have time to diffuse rapidly inside the dextran macromolecule (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>). When the reduction starts, the nucleation occurs not only at the periphery of the macromolecule but also inside as the silver ions are in the proximity of the internal reducing functional groups. Because most silver particles form inside the macromolecules in this case (more silver is inside than at the periphery), the final size for small and large Mw dextrans is not very different. The decrease in particle size with molecular weight observed in reference 16 is likely due to an increased number of nucleation sites in the case the larger polysaccharide macromolecules, which have a higher volume/external surface ratio.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0040">In contrast, in our process silver is added to the dextran in conditions already favoring a fast reduction (high pH, high temperature). The nucleation in this case occurs preponderantly at the periphery of the macromolecules. Since smaller molecular weight dextrans have a higher proportion of peripheral reducing group than larger macromolecules, concentration of silver ions in solution is higher and the immediately available reducing groups are more numerous (larger specific surface area). As a result, the nucleation is faster at lower Mw and the nanoparticles formed smaller. Considering that the molecular weight of dextran can differ by as much as <b>3</b> orders of magnitude, the process disclosed in this application is more effective in tailoring the particle size of silver. Indeed, the data provided demonstrate that silver dispersions with plasmon bad maxima from 406 to 460 nm (corresponding to approximate sizes from 15 to 60 nm) can be prepared following the teachings of this patent.<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0041">6. The disclosed process teaches the addition of silver precursor into the dextran solution over a controlled time. Changing the addition rate (from minutes to hours) provides an additional &#x2018;adjusting knob&#x2019; in tailoring the kinetics of the reduction and thus the particle size of silver nanoparticles. For the same molecular weight dextran, higher addition rates provide higher silver ions concentration in solution and a faster nucleation. At lower addition rates the slower nucleation yields larger silver nanoparticles.</li>        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0042">7. The present patent application teaches that an amount of dextran of at least 100% and up to at least 300% of the weight of precipitated silver should be used to provide good Ag particles uniformity and dispersion stability. Below this proportion not sufficient dextran unaltered in the reduction remains in the system and the silver nanoparticles aggregate due to the high ionic strength.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0037" num="0043">The inventive subject matter is directed to altering the reduction conditions (pH, temperature), the properties of the dextran molecule, and the silver precursor to prepare high concentration, highly stable dispersion of silver nanoparticles with controlled size and uniformity. The approach and product are unique as the approach exploits the cumulated roles as reductant and dispersing agent of dextran and its ability to control particles properties. The precipitation procedure described is simple, controllable, easily implementable, and environmentally friendly at the same time.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0044">The preparation method disclosed in this application surprisingly yields concentrated dispersions of uniform, highly dispersed nanoparticles.

The ammonium hydroxide, NH<sub>4</sub>OH, 28% and the sodium hydroxide 10.0N were supplied by Alfa Aesar.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0056">2.2 Reference Experiment</p><p id="p-0049" num="0057">3.5 g of dextran (Mw&#x2dc;20 k) were dissolved for 2 hours at room temperature in 300 ml DI water inside a 1.0 L glass beaker provided with an agitator connected to variable speed mixer. The silver solution was prepared by dissolving 5.5 g of silver nitrate (3.5 g Ag) in 25 ml DI water followed by the addition of ammonium hydroxide solution until the precipitate formed completely re-dissolved. The volume of silver solution was adjusted to 50 ml and 4.3 g NaOH 10N was added to the dextran solution. The temperature of the later was increased to 55&#xb0; C. and the silver solution was added with a peristaltic pump over 30 minutes under vigorous agitation. The final dispersion with a concentration of 1.0 wt. % Ag was dialyzed to pH 9.5 to obtain a highly stable dispersion suitable for biomedical applications.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0058">2.3. Characterization of Ag nanoparticles</p><p id="p-0051" num="0059">The TEM images of Ag nanoparticles (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>) formed in the reference experiment were obtained after transferring the dispersion into an ultracentrifuge tube containing the copper coated grid and spinning it to 10,000 RPM for 10 minutes. The inspection of the rinsed grid revealed the presence of uniform dispersed silver particles with a mean diameter of &#x2dc;21 nm. The UV-Vis spectrophotometry was performed on a dispersion aliquot diluted 50 times. The spectrum displayed a very narrow plasmon band with a maximum at 413 nm (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>). The lack of any background absorption above 500 nm indicated the absence of particles above &#x2dc;40 nm.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0060">Effect of Molecular Weight of Dextran</p><p id="p-0053" num="0061">Dextrans of different molecular weight (&#x2dc;20 k, 40 k, 250 k and 500 k) were used at the same concentration in the reference experiment. The effect on silver particle size and dispersion is illustrated by the UV-Vis plots in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0062">A small increase in dextran (from 20 k to 40 k) did not change the peak maximum (413 nm) or its shape. For significantly larger macromolecules (252 k and 500 k) the plasmon bands shifted toward higher wavelengths (to 432 and respectively 451 nm) indicating the presence of progressively larger nanoparticles. This is a surprising effect as in general increasing the molecular weight of the dispersants tends to favor the formation of smaller and better dispersed particles. For this widely accepted trend to be contradicted, the reaction kinetics and the ensuing nucleation must be faster for lower molecular weight dextrans. This appears to be the reason for the unexpected results as the reducing electrons are likely released only (or mostly) by the peripheral glucose molecules as discussed above. Indeed, an order of magnitude increase in the molecular weight of dextran decreases significantly (by a similar magnitude) the number of such reducing groups. Consequently, the reduction of silver will be slower and the particles would increase accordingly, as substantiated by the UV-Vis plots. The fact that in the case of dextran the reduction rate increases with the decrease in molecular weight represents an unexpected discovery. This is of significant practical importance since it makes possible the tailoring in a wide range of the silver nanoparticles size.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0063">Effect of Dextran Amount</p><p id="p-0056" num="0064">The effect of the dextran amount was investigated in the case of the 252 k polymer, which at 100% amount generated dispersions having a plasmon band at 432 nm. The conditions were otherwise those of the reference experiment and the UV-Vis data are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. When the amount of dextran was reduced by 50%, the position of the maximum did not change but the width of the band increased significantly and a background absorption was recorded even at 600 nm (red plot). This finding suggests that the amount of dextran was insufficient to provide effectively the colloid stabilization function. An increase in the amount by 50% did not alter either the position or the shape of the plasmon band (black plot <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) when compared to the plot in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. At 300% amount of Dextran, the plasmon band moved at 408 nm and its width narrowed. The particles in this case had an average size of 16 nm by SEM. The result can be attributed to a larger amount of dextran that does not react with silver and provides a better colloid stabilization role.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0065">Effect of Silver Concentration</p><p id="p-0058" num="0066">In an attempt to optimize the silver concentration at which a highly stable dispersion is still obtained, the concentration of the metal was decreased and respectively increased by a factor of 3 while maintaining the same dextran concentration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>). As expected, by decreasing the silver concentration to a third (0.33% Ag) the position of the plasmon band shifted toward lower wavelengths reflecting a decrease in the particle size from 20 to &#x2dc;15 nm. At three times higher Ag concentration, the dispersion was unstable and the UV-Vis plot showed extended background absorption up to 600 nm indicating the presence of larger aggregates.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0067">While the disclosure has been described in terms of exemplary embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize that the disclosure can be practiced with modifications in the spirit and scope of the appended claims.
