It is clear that the described embodiments are merely some rather than all of embodiments of this application. All other embodiments obtained by a person of ordinary skill in the art based on embodiments of this application without creative efforts shall fall within the protection scope of this application.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In embodiments of this application, &#x201c;at least one&#x201d; means one or more, and &#x201c;a plurality of&#x201d; means two or more. The term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; describes an association relationship between associated objects and may indicate three relationships. For example, A and/or B may indicate the following cases: Only A exists, both A and B exist, and only B exists. A and B may be singular or plural. The character &#x201c;I&#x201d; usually indicates an &#x201c;or&#x201d; relationship between the associated objects.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In addition, in embodiments of this application, the terms &#x201c;first&#x201d;, &#x201c;second&#x201d;, &#x201c;third&#x201d;, and the like (if any) are intended to distinguish between similar objects but do not necessarily indicate a specific order or sequence. It should be understood that data termed in such a way are interchangeable in proper circumstances, so that embodiments of this application described herein can be implemented in orders except the order illustrated or described herein.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Manners of obtaining a depth image by a terminal device may be classified into two types based on whether a laser source is required: passive ranging sensing and active depth sensing. In the manner of passive ranging sensing, the terminal device does not need to transmit light by using the laser source. In the manner of active depth sensing, the terminal device needs to transmit light by using the laser source.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In the passive ranging sensing, a binocular stereoscopic vision (or referred to as red green blue (RGB) binocular) technology may be used. In a possible implementation, two images in a same scenario may be simultaneously captured by using two cameras that are at a specific distance away from each other, corresponding pixels in the two images are found according to a stereoscopic matching algorithm, and parallax information is calculated according to a triangle principle. The parallax information may represent depth information of an object in the scenario through conversion. In another possible implementation, a depth image of a scenario may be obtained, according to the stereoscopic matching algorithm, by photographing a group of images at different angles in the same scenario. In addition, depth information may be obtained through indirect estimation by analyzing features such as a luminosity feature and a brightness feature of an image.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">It may be understood that, in the manner of passive ranging sensing, calculation of a depth image is usually related to a pixel of the image. Therefore, the depth image is usually obtained based on a color image.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In the manner of active depth sensing, a measurement principle may be described corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, and obtaining of a depth image may be independent of obtaining of a color image. Technologies, such as a time of flight (TOF) technology, a structured light technology, and the like, may be used in the manner of active depth sensing. The TOF technology may include an indirect time of flight (ITOF) technology and a direct time of flight (DTOF) technology.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Table 1 shows comparison between the ITOF

light technology that have low power consumption and small hardware sizes are short. The DTOF technology whose measurement distance is long has high power consumption and a large hardware size.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0065">Due to limitations of a size and power consumption of a mobile terminal such as a mobile phone, a current DTOF technology with high power consumption and a large hardware size cannot be applied to the mobile terminal such as the mobile phone.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0066">With development of the mobile terminal such as the mobile phone, the mobile terminal such as the mobile phone has an increasingly high requirement on a distance in a depth image. Therefore, it is expected that the DTOF technology is implemented in the mobile terminal such as the mobile phone, and a size and power consumption of hardware for implementing the DTOF technology need to be sufficiently small, in order to meet requirements of the mobile terminal such as the mobile phone on the hardware size and power consumption.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0067">In realization of the DTOF technology in an implementation, the more important part is to realize scanning of objects to be measured by a laser source.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0068">For example, when the DTOF technology is applied to depth ranging of a self-driving light detection and ranging (LIDAR) system, light emitted by a laser source needs to scan a specific spatial angle.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0069">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of an implementation of a DTOF technology in the LIDAR system. To implement scanning of the laser source, a light beam from the laser source first passes through an MEMS mirror, angle scanning is implemented by using the MEMS mirror, to-be-measured objects at different angles are irradiated by the light beam, and then the light beam returns to a receive-end sensor. In this way, depth ranging at a specific field of view is implemented.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0070">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of three times of scanning in a scanning process in a self-driving DTOF technology. In each time of scanning, it is assumed that a spatial angle scanned by the laser beam emitted by the laser source is &#x3b8;, and a divergence angle of the laser beam is &#x3c6;. Therefore, fields of view (FOV) of the laser and a DTOF system both are Ow.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0071">However, in the implementation of the DTOF technology in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, because the micro electro mechanical systems mirror needs to be disposed, a hardware size is large. In addition, because the micro electro mechanical systems mirror needs to rotate frequently, problems of high power consumption, low reliability, and a short service life of a device may further exist. Therefore, the DTOF technology cannot be applied to a device that has low requirements on both a hardware size and power consumption.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0072">Further, implementation of laser source scanning in the DTOF technology is analyzed. Essence of the laser source scanning is to implement block scanning on an irradiated scenario.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0073">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> are schematic diagrams of three scanning processes of the irradiated scenario.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0074">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, when M*N (both M and N are positive integers) blocks in an irradiated scenario <b>0300</b> are scanned, the M*N scenario blocks may be separately scanned by adjusting an angle of output light <b>005</b> emitted by a transmit end <b>006</b>. In each time of scanning, the output light <b>005</b> transmitted by a laser source at the transmit end <b>006</b> may scan and irradiate one of the M*N scenario blocks, and a receive end <b>013</b> may receive input light <b>012</b> returned from the one of the scenario blocks, to calculate a depth of the one of the scenario blocks based on round-trip duration of the output light <b>005</b> and the input light <b>012</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0075">A possible manner for implementing scanning of the M*N blocks in the irradiate scenario may be: separately turning on respective ones of M*N lasers in a laser array, where each laser may implement scanning and irradiation on one of the scenario blocks.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0076">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> are schematic diagrams of implementing scanning of the irradiated scenario based on the M*N laser array.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0077">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, a driver array <b>003</b> may separately drive one or more lasers in a laser array <b>002</b> to turn on, and each turned-on laser may implement scanning of an area corresponding to the laser. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, one laser may be turned on each time, to scan one scenario block. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, a row of lasers may be turned on at the same time, to implement scanning and irradiation on a row of scenario blocks. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, all lasers may be turned on at the same time, to implement complete scanning and irradiation on the irradiated scenario.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0078">That is, based on flexible selection of the lasers in the laser array, flexible scanning and irradiation on the irradiated scenario are implemented.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0079">When the flexible selection of the lasers is implemented, a solution that may be figured out is that the M*N lasers in the laser array are disposed independently. In a laser array shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, hollow connection points represent crosses without electrical connections, in other words, a P-electrode and an N-electrode of each laser are independent of each other. Therefore, different field-effect transistors may be used as switches to separately control the lasers, to implement the flexible selection of the lasers.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0080">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> shows a laser array and a drive circuit corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>. For one of lasers <b>130</b>, a field-effect transistor <b>131</b> and a gate driver <b>132</b> of the field-effect transistor <b>131</b> may be disposed in a discharge loop of the laser (due to a unidirectionally-conducted feature of a laser, a loop formed by electrical components connected to a positive electrode of the laser is generally referred to as a charge loop, and a loop formed by electrical components connected to a negative electrode of the laser is referred to as a discharge loop). The field-effect transistor <b>131</b> may be controlled to be turned on or off based on a control signal generated by a control signal generation module. When the field-effect transistor <b>131</b> is turned on, the laser <b>130</b> is grounded, and a current passes through the laser <b>130</b>, to turn on the laser.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0081">However, in the laser array and the drive circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, because independent lasers are used, sizes of the lasers and M*N field-effect transistors in M*N areas are extremely large. Therefore, the laser array and the drive circuit are not suitable for an application scenario in which a mobile phone has an extremely high requirement on a size (e.g., require that the size be small).</p><p id="p-0084" num="0082">For a laser array used in the mobile phone that has the high requirement on the size, generally, N electrodes of all lasers in the laser array are connected together. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> shows a laser array in which N electrodes are connected. Hollow connection points represent crosses without electrical connections, and solid connection points represent crosses with electrical connections.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0083">For the laser array in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, with reference to a laser control concept in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, a solution that may be figured out is that: As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, a field-effect transistor and a corresponding gate driver are disposed in a discharge loop of each laser, to control, based on a control signal, the field-effect transistor to be turned on or off.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0084">However, N electrodes of lasers are connected together. Therefore, if a field-effect transistor is turned on, a current passes through all the lasers, and all the lasers are turned on. Therefore, a drive solution in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> cannot implement flexible selection of a laser.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0085">Based on this, embodiments of this application provide a laser drive circuit. A laser is not controlled in a discharge loop. Instead, one or more control units are disposed in a charge loop of the laser drive circuit. A first switch module and a capacitive module in the control unit may form a charge-discharge loop, so that flexible selection of a laser is implemented. Therefore, a laser array can be scanned based on the laser drive circuit, and no scanning device such as a micro electro mechanical systems mirror needs to be additionally disposed. In this way, circuit support can be provided for implementing a small-sized, power-efficient, and cost-effective optical transmit end.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0086">In a specific application, setting the control unit in the charge loop not only can implement the flexible selection of the laser, but also can be better than controlling the laser in the discharge loop in other aspects.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0087">For example, in a DTOF implementation, a pulse current of the discharge loop is of a peak value (for example, up to 60 A), a high repetition rate (for example, up to 5 MHz), and a short rise/fall time period (for example, lower to 1 ns). This imposes very high requirements on an electrical switch disposed in the discharge loop. Due to these performance requirements, a GaN-based MOS transistor needs to be used for selection of the switch, which causes high costs and a large volume of the switch. Especially when the M*N array is large, the conflict is more prominent.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0088">However, a very high repetition rate (for example, typically 30 Hz to 120 Hz) is not required in the charge loop. A peak current of the charge loop can be adjusted to be far lower than an actual working pulse current. A charge time period does not need to be at a nanosecond level, and only needs to be at a millisecond level to meet the requirements. Therefore, setting the control unit in the charge loop can greatly reduce the requirements on the switch, and reduce a size and costs of a switch circuit.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0089">The following first describes terms in embodiments of this application.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0090">An electrical connection described in embodiments of this application may include a connection implemented through a wire, electromagnetic, an electrical component, or the like.
