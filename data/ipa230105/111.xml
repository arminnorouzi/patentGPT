Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is in the field of pet food as a treat preparation and pertains particularly to methods and apparatus for mixing and preparing a dog treat composition.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Discussion of the State of the Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the field of food preparation, there are many products that are meat-based that are commercially marketed as animal foods or treats. For example, freeze dried dog foods often contain meat-based products including lamb, turkey, duck, salmon, beef, and chicken along with bone meal and other components including preservatives, grains, vitamins, and other beneficial additives that may be deemed generally suitable for consumption by most dog breeds. Dog treats may be provided as dry dog treats, as wet dog food or as dog food or treat containing a percentage of moisture. In addition to stable dietary products like dog food and treats, there are many products or compositions that are not marketed as a stable dog food but more as a dog treat that may take the form of a freeze-dried product like dog biscuits, dog jerkies, dog chews, dog bones, and dried skins (dried pork skins), etc.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">While there are many different meats tapped for inclusion into dog food and dog treats in a general sense, often the percentage of meats to other non-nutritional binders and grain fillers is paltry enabling the compositions to be marketed cheaper. While a wide variety of meat-based products are marketed in the industry, products that include liver or other organ-based meats: animal hearts, kidney, or brains are not as prevalent in dog foods or treats as stock meats listed further above. One reason liver is a sought-after ingredient in dog food and dog treat manufacture is that it is relatively inexpensive but provides packed amounts of proteins, fats, vitamins, amino acids, and essential minerals that provide health benefit for the dog.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">While animal liver is considered safe and beneficial for dogs in general, care should be given to the frequency and amount of liver the dog receives. It is possible that too much liver in a dog's diet may overload the dog with too much vitamin A, which can be unhealthy at doses that the dog may not be able to process efficiently. Raw liver or other organ meats that are not cooked but are freeze-dried to preserve shelf life of the product can harbor bacterium like listeria or salmonella that was in the raw meat and may be preserved along with the product when freeze-dried. Another challenge with some baked products is that overcooking can reduce or eliminate some of the nutrients like vitamins and amino acids for example. A further challenge is producing a form of treat that does not crumble or break apart being too dry or not bound well with a suitable binder. Still a further challenge is packaging. Dog food or dog treats that are packaged together in one box or bag may invite contaminants including mold, bacterium, chemicals, pests, etc.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, what is clearly needed is a dog treat composition that is free of bacterium, holds together well, has a superior shelf life, and is compartmentalized into individual packaged servings so that it is not contaminated by open box or bag packaging that may allow moisture and contaminants to compromise the nutritional value of the product.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to an embodiment of the present invention, a composition of organ-based animal meat is reduced to a pulp, a grain free binder in some embodiments, and a percentage of liquid to enable creation of a homogeneous mixture with a viscosity similar to a batter upon blending the meat materials together. In a preferred embodiment, the organ-based meat is animal liver. In a variation of this embodiment, the animal liver is lamb liver, turkey liver, chicken liver, or any combination thereof In another embodiment, the organ-based meat is heart, kidney, brain, or any combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one embodiment, the binder is flour or a combination of more than one flour type.

It is a goal of the present invention to provide a nutritious dog treat in a presentation form that is resistant to crumbling or otherwise losing form. It is also a goal of the present invention to provide a dog treat that is safe from bacterium, mold, pests, and other contaminates. It is a further goal of the invention to shorten the length of drying time and cooking time for meat-based dog food products. One more goal is to provide an efficient space-saving design for shipping and storing with stackable and interlocking dog biscuit shapes. The present invention is described using the following examples, which may describe more than one relevant embodiment falling within the scope of the invention.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is an overhead view of a dog treat waffle form <b>100</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention. Waffle form <b>100</b> may be a composition of meat, a binder, and a liquid formed into a batter that may be poured into a waffle-iron mold plate and cooked to set the form. Waffle form <b>100</b> is, in a preferred embodiment, a dog treat that is further treated in a freeze-drying process to reduce moisture content to preserve shelf life (freshness) of the treat. Waffle form <b>100</b> may have a dry weight after freeze-drying of about three-quarters of an ounce representing a single serving as a treat for a dog. It is noted, however, that larger or smaller waffle forms may be provided for different dog breeds of varying sizes without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Dog treat waffle form <b>100</b> may be a molded product cooked in a waffle iron or baked in a waffle mold. Waffle pattern <b>101</b> is evident in this view and comprises a symmetrical arrangement of square indents on both sides of dog treat <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Dog treat waffle form <b>100</b> in this embodiment has a width dimension A of about 2 and one-half inches, and a length dimension B of about 3 and one-half inches; other embodiments may be created by increasing or decreasing the length and/or width of waffle form <b>100</b> and/or increasing or decreasing the number of indented squares in waffle pattern <b>101</b>. Dog treat <b>100</b> may include an organic animal organ meat such as liver, kidney, heart, or brain, of a combination thereof as a major ingredient in the composition of the present invention. In one embodiment, organic liver is the only meat in the composition. In this embodiment, liver may make up about sixty-five percent of volume of the total weight of the product. Also, in a variation of this embodiment, lamb liver, turkey liver, or chicken liver or a combination thereof may comprise the liver meat used in the dog treat waffle form <b>100</b>. In a further variation of the embodiment, liver may be combined with another organic meat like an animal muscle meat including ground beef, ground turkey, ground lamb, ground chicken, or any combination thereof, wherein the combined meat ingredient equals approximately <b>65</b> percent of the total weight by volume of the composition, which in this example is about three-quarter of ounce (post preparation).</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In a preferred embodiment, dog treat waffle form <b>100</b> may include a binder in the form of a flour type like arrowroot, potato flour, tapioca flour, milk powder, soy flour. In one embodiment, a grain free binder is used. In another embodiment, the flour may be white flour or wheat flower. The binder may make up about 27% of the total volume of the composition. A liquid like water, for example, may make up about 8% of the total volume of the composition. Other liquids may be considered such as chicken, beef, turkey, or lamb broths. In a variation of this embodiment, a broth may include an organic aid for the dog like a glucosamine, turmeric, or other organic powder that may help with joint comfort or inflammation in general. A liquid component percentage may be as low as 6% of the total volume of the composition.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In a preferred embodiment, the waffle form <b>100</b> does not include a binder and includes only meat and water. The meat may be pre-prepared into a pulp or finely chopped or pulverized state for addition to an electric mixing or blending apparatus. A goal of mixing the composition is that it be blended into a thick batter that is viscous but may be poured, squirted, or otherwise easily introduced into a waffle cooking apparatus like a waffle iron or a waffle mold form. Blending or mixing may be accomplished with electric apparatus like a commercial blender, or with electric mixing tools operated within a vessel containing the ingredients of the composition of the invention. In a preferred embodiment, the thick batter should be a homogeneous mixture (fine uniformly distributed and suspended ingredients).</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is an end view of dog treat waffle form <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Dog treat waffle form <b>100</b> has a thickness dimension C of about five eighths of an inch. Waffle iron pattern <b>101</b> produces an indent pattern depicted herein by broken boundary. In a preferred embodiment, a waffle iron pattern like pattern <b>101</b> produces a form that is less likely to crack, crumble, or otherwise become compromised in form due to packaging and handling. Another utility benefit of using a waffle iron pattern <b>101</b> is that a waffle pattern creates more surface area for the cooked dog treat <b>100</b>. Having more surface area contributes to a shorter period of time for freeze-drying the product during the vacuum phase of the freeze dry process. Waffle pattern <b>101</b> is produced by a raised pattern of symmetrically arranged square forms; however, other symmetrical waffle iron patterns having a different geometric shape may be utilized without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">A particular advantage of using waffle forms in the preparation of a dog treat, like waffle form <b>100</b> is that the indentions provide four additional walls and a floor in each the indentions which exponentially increases surface area for more efficient processing during cooking in the waffle irons and in the freeze drying process.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> is an end view of a dog treat waffle form <b>102</b> according to an alternate embodiment of the present invention. Dog treat waffle form <b>102</b> may be created by a waffle iron pattern that is an inverse pattern from the pattern used to create dog treat waffle form <b>100</b> wherein a waffle pattern <b>103</b> creates a raised form and the substrate is thinner. In this alternate embodiment, the thickness dimension C of about &#x215d; inches is the same as are dimensions A and B depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> for dog treat waffle form <b>100</b>. A raised form also produces a more physically resilient form less likely to crack, crumble, or otherwise become deformed of compromised during packaging and handling as well as creating more surface area for vacuum sublimation or reduction of moisture content in the product during the freeze dry process. An added benefit in raised waffle pattern <b>103</b> is that the product is more easily devisable by breaking it along a selected line of the waffle pattern <b>103</b>. It is also noted herein that both waffle forms <b>100</b> and <b>102</b> require less cooking time compared to a uniformly thick dog treat product by increasing the iron to batter surface area. In one embodiment, the waffle iron or waffle mold forms are treated with a non-stick surface so that the cooked product is easily removed from the waffle forms or waffle iron plates. In one embodiment, a small amount of vegetable oil may be mixed into the batter to help prevent the product from sticking to the waffle iron surfaces or waffle mold surfaces. In another embodiment, the square indentations in waffle pattern <b>101</b> may interlock with the protruding squares in waffle pattern <b>103</b> to provide a space saving stack of alternating waffle forms <b>100</b> and waffle forms <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a process flow chart <b>200</b> depicting steps for preparing a dog treat waffle form for consumption. At step <b>201</b>, an operator making dog treat waffle forms <b>101</b> or <b>102</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> may measure out the amount of organic meat, binder, and liquid by percentage that will be introduced to make a uniform batter. At step <b>202</b>, the operator may pre-prepare the organic meat for addition to the process. The actual process may be contingent upon the original form the meat before processing. For example, meat may be solid slabs that must be chopped, ground, or otherwise pulverized or mashed into a meat pulp before mixing with binder, water, or other liquid. It is also noted herein that organic meat may already be ground or already be reduced to a paste or pulp before use. Liverwurst is a product that may already be a paste before it is used, for example.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">At step <b>203</b>, the operator may add the measured amount of meat, binder, water, or other liquid into an electric blender. At step <b>204</b>, the operator may blend the ingredients until a relatively thick homogeneous batter is formed. This operation may be scaled up or down as required as long as the percentage of ingredients is stable according to percentage by volume of organic meat, binder, and water. In a preferred embodiment, the batter is used as soon as it is produced so that it does not settle or become a heterogeneous mixture. In one embodiment, batter may be created and frozen to be used at a later time. In a preferred embodiment it is used while freshly created and blended.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">At step <b>205</b>, the operator may pour batter mixture onto a waffle iron or into waffle forms at one half cup of batter per form. This process may be a manual process, a semi-automated process, or a wholly automated process depending upon the environment of use, for example, commercially created verses consumer created. In an embodiment using a waffle iron, an amount of batter may be poured or otherwise injected into a waffle iron or waffle mold form whereby the cooked material is a large sheet cut into individual forms after it is cooked or to the dimensions representing an individual dog treat like dog treat <b>100</b>. At step <b>206</b>, the batter may be allowed to cook at a temperature of about <b>370</b> degrees Fahrenheit for about five minutes. An acceptable temperature range window for cooking might be from about <b>355</b> degrees to about <b>375</b> degrees with <b>370</b> representing a nominal number.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">At step <b>207</b>, a process decision may be executed to determine when the batter is sufficiently cooked. For example, a visual or inner temperature indication that the batter is cooked sufficiently may be provided on the cooking apparatus via adding a light emitting diode (LED) indicator. If a determination is made at step <b>207</b> that the cooking cycle is not done or complete, the process resolves back to step <b>206</b>. If at step <b>207</b>, the determination is that the cooking cycle is done, the process moves to step <b>208</b> and the operator or mechanical automated process may remove the cooked product from the waffle iron or waffle mold(s). In one embodiment, a step may be added for cutting the sheets to the required length and width dimensions to produce individual dog treats.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">At step <b>209</b>, the operator or mechanical automated process may place the product before cutting, after cutting, or as individually cooked forms onto one or more cooling trays so the product may cool down to around room temperature. Cooling to room temperature aids in the product setting and holding form. At step <b>210</b>, it may be determined by an operator or automated process if the shelved product is cooled down to the desired temperature. In one embodiment, a temperature sensor may be used to determine when the product is cooled down to a desired temperature whereby an indicator LED may inform when the product has reached the desired temperature. If at step <b>210</b>, the cooked product has not yet cooled sufficiently, the process may revert back to step <b>209</b> for added cooling time. If at step <b>210</b> it is determined that the product has cooled sufficiently, the operator or automated process may load the product into a commercial freeze dryer at step <b>211</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">It is noted herein that the amount of moisture in the cooked product may be higher than 10 percent moisture by volume. The goal of freeze drying is to further reduce the amount of moisture in the product to as low as 1 to 5 percent moisture by volume. The freeze dry process is well known in the art and removes moisture from a product in three phases. The first stage is freezing the product below the triple point of the material so that the second phase, referred to herein as the primary drying phase (sublimation), may occur. Temperatures may be as low as between &#x2212;30 degrees and &#x2212;85 degrees F. (preferably about &#x2212;65 F degrees). The third stage is a secondary drying phase or the absorption phase. The goal is to achieve a dried product having 5% or less moisture content by volume.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">At step <b>212</b>, it may be determined if the product is successfully dried to the desired moisture content of below 10%. In one embodiment, it may be acceptable to have as much as 10% or more moisture content in the product. However, lower moisture content helps to preserve the product for longer periods of time. If at step <b>212</b>, the determination is that the product is not sufficiently dried, the process reverts back to the freeze-dry process at step <b>211</b>. If the determination is that the product is sufficiently dry at step <b>212</b>, then the product portions may be individually packaged at step <b>213</b> via an envelope type package or vacuum packaging machine operated by an operator or by automated process. In one embodiment, the individual dog treats may be placed in an envelope type package with a seal along the length and then sealing both ends. Another embodiment may provide a shrink wrap. In another embodiment, the individual dog treats may be placed into polymer bags, nitrogen sealed, or vacuum/heat sealed by an operator using a conventional vacuum packaging machine or a shrink wrap machine, or by automated robotic process if commercial scale. Also, if stackable option is chosen, the treats would be stacked between steps <b>212</b> and <b>213</b>. It is noted herein that cutting a sheet into individual forms may be a last step before packaging.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In one embodiment, individual dog treats may be individually packaged and put in a box or carton containing multiple packaged dog treats. In another embodiment, individual dog treats may be collectively placed in a larger poly bag and vacuum sealed therein. Individual packaging is preferred in this embodiment so that product is not exposed to the general environment long before use of the product. Shelf life for individual dog treats may be longer than six months and up to three years. Another utility benefit of using a waffle pattern in the individual dog treats is that an operator may use the offset of the waffle pattern to hold secondary substances like spread peanut butter, wet food, etc.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">It will be apparent to the skilled person that the arrangement of elements and functionality for the invention is described in different embodiments in which each is exemplary of an implementation of the invention.
