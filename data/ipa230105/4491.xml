id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">Methods, systems, and devices that support variable modulation schemes for memory are described. A device may switch between different modulation schemes for communication based on one or more operating parameters associated with the device or a component of the device. The modulation schemes may involve amplitude modulation in which different levels of a signal represent different data values. For instance, the device may use a first modulation scheme that represents data using two levels and a second modulation scheme that represents data using four levels. In one example, the device may switch from the first modulation scheme to the second modulation scheme when bandwidth demand is high, and the device may switch from the second modulation scheme to the first modulation scheme when power conservation is in demand. The device may also, based on the operating parameter, change the frequency of the signal pulses communicated using the modulation schemes.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure

Memory devices are widely used to store information related to various electronic devices such as computers, wireless communication devices, cameras, digital displays, and the like. Information is stored by programing different states of a memory cell.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Various types of memory devices exist, including magnetic hard disks, random access memory (RAM), read only memory (ROM), dynamic RAM (DRAM), synchronous dynamic RAM (SDRAM), ferroelectric RAM (FeRAM), magnetic RAM (MRAM), resistive RAM (RRAM), flash memory, phase change memory (PCM), and others. Memory devices may be volatile or non-volatile. Non-volatile memory, e.g., FeRAM, may maintain their stored logic state for extended periods of time even in the absence of an external power source. Volatile memory devices, e.g., DRAM, may lose their stored state over time unless they are periodically refreshed by an external power source. FeRAM may use similar device architectures as volatile memory but may have non-volatile properties due to the use of a ferroelectric capacitor as a storage device.</p><p id="p-0005"

Because higher frequencies may provide greater bandwidth, the device may increase frequency when bandwidth requirements are high, and decrease frequency when bandwidth requirements are low. And because lower frequencies may consume less power, a device may increase frequency when the device's available power supply is high, and decrease frequency when the device's available power supply is low. Thus, a device may select a frequency that provides sufficient bandwidth at the sufficient power consumption level.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">But in some cases, the frequencies at which at device is designed to communicate may not provide the target (e.g., required, sufficient) bandwidth and/or power consumption (or power conservation). For example, the device may be designed to communicate at different frequencies (e.g., multiple frequencies, N frequencies), but the lowest two frequencies may not provide enough bandwidth to satisfy the target bandwidth, while the third frequency may consume too much power to satisfy the power constraints. Thus, the device may have to choose between performing at an inadequate bandwidth or expending excess power, either of which may impair communications or operation.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">According to the techniques described herein, a device may switch between frequencies as well as modulation schemes in access or operating memory. Because different modulation schemes provide different bandwidths, and may consume different amounts of power, selecting between modulation schemes may allow a device to more closely match target metrics, demands, or requests. For example, a device may select a combination of modulation scheme and frequency so that the provided bandwidth and consumed power (among other possible or additional factors) are tailored to the operating parameters (e.g., bandwidth, power) of the device. The operating parameters may include other aspects associated with the operation of the device, such as the launch of high data rate applications and the temperature of one or more components of the device, among others.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Features of the disclosure introduced above are further described below in the context of an exemplary memory device and other various components.

For example, each memory cell may be programmed to store one or more logic states (e.g., a logic &#x2018;0&#x2019;, a logic &#x2018;1&#x2019;, a logic &#x2018;00&#x2019;, a logic &#x2018;01&#x2019;, a logic &#x2018;10&#x2019;, a logic &#x2018;11&#x2019;). The memory cells of the memory dies <b>105</b> may use any number of storage technologies to store data including DRAM, FeRAM, PCM, 3DXP memory, NAND memory, NOR memory, or a combination thereof. In some cases, a first memory die <b>105</b> of the system <b>100</b> may use a first memory technology (e.g., NAND flash memory) and a second memory die <b>105</b> of the system <b>100</b> may use second memory technology (e.g., FeRAM) different from the first memory technology.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some cases, the memory dies <b>105</b> may be an example of two-dimensional (2D) array of memory cells. Or, a memory die <b>105</b> may be an example of a three-dimensional (3D) array, where multiple 2D arrays of multiple memory cells are formed on top of one another. Such a configuration may increase the number of memory cells that may be formed on a single die or substrate as compared with 2D arrays. In turn, this may reduce production costs, or increase the performance of the memory array, or both. Each level of the array may be positioned so that memory cells across each level may be approximately aligned with one another, forming a memory cell stack. In some cases, the memory dies <b>105</b> may be stacked directly on one another.

In some cases, the one or more vias <b>130</b> may be part of the internal signal paths <b>115</b> and perform similar functions. The vias <b>130</b> may be used to communicate between memory dies <b>105</b>, for example, when the memory dies <b>105</b> are stacked on one another. Some vias <b>130</b> may be used to facilitate communication between the memory controller <b>110</b> and at least some of the memory dies <b>105</b>. In some cases, a single via <b>130</b> may be coupled with multiple memory dies <b>105</b>. In some cases, each memory die <b>105</b> may include a via <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The memory controller <b>110</b> may control the operation (e.g., read, write, re-write, refresh, discharge) of memory cells in the memory dies <b>105</b> through one or more various components (e.g., row decoders, column decoders, sense components). In some cases, the row decoder, the column decoder, or the sense component, or some combination may be co-located with the memory controller <b>110</b>. Memory controller <b>110</b> may generate row and column address signals to activate the desired word line and digit line. In other examples, the memory controller <b>110</b> may control various voltages, or currents, or both used during the operation of system <b>100</b>. For example, the memory controller <b>110</b> may apply discharge voltages to a word line or a digit line after accessing one or more memory cells. In general, the amplitude, shape, or duration of an applied voltage or current discussed herein may be adjusted or varied and may be different for the various operations discussed in relation to operating the system <b>100</b>. Furthermore, one, multiple, or all memory cells within a memory die <b>105</b> may be accessed concurrently. For example, multiple memory cells or all memory cells of the memory die <b>105</b> may be accessed simultaneously during a reset operation in which multiple memory cells or all memory cells may be set to a single logic state (e.g., logic &#x2018;0&#x2019;).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some cases, the memory controller <b>110</b> may be integrated as part of the computing device <b>120</b>.

The memory controller <b>110</b> may control the multi-symbol signal component <b>135</b> so that different signals are modulated using different combinations of modulation schemes, frequencies, or both. For example, the memory controller <b>110</b> may control the multi-symbol signal component <b>135</b> so that a first signal sent to memory die(s) <b>105</b> is modulated using a first modulation scheme (e.g., a modulation scheme with first number of levels) and a second signal sent to memory die(s) <b>105</b> is modulated using a second modulation scheme (e.g., a modulation scheme with a number of levels different than that of the first modulation scheme). The memory controller <b>110</b> may also communicate with the multi-symbol signal component <b>135</b> such that the signals are sent at the same or different frequencies.

The circuit <b>200</b> may illustrate an example of a memory cell <b>205</b> that may be part of one or more memory dies <b>105</b>. The circuit <b>200</b> may include a memory cell <b>205</b> coupled with a digit line <b>210</b> and a voltage source <b>215</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The memory cell <b>205</b> may implement any type of memory technology (e.g., DRAM, FeRAM, PCM, NAND, NOR). As such, some aspects of the circuit <b>200</b> may be based on the memory technology being implemented by the memory cell <b>205</b>. For example, if the memory cell <b>205</b> is a FeRAM memory cell, the voltage source <b>215</b> may be an example of a plate or a plate line coupled with a plate driver. If the memory cell <b>205</b> is a DRAM memory cell, the voltage source <b>215</b> may be an example of a ground or a virtual ground. A person of ordinary skill would understand and appreciate the differences in memory cells <b>205</b> between the different memory technologies.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The memory cell <b>205</b> may include a capacitor <b>220</b> and a selection component <b>225</b>. In some cases, the capacitor <b>220</b> may be or include a resistor type device, as in the case of a PCM memory cell. A memory cell <b>205</b> may store a charge representative of the programmable states in the capacitor <b>220</b>; for example, a charged and uncharged capacitor may represent two logic states, respectively. A DRAM memory cell may include a capacitor with a dielectric material as the insulating material. For example, the dielectric material may have linear or para-electric polarization properties and a ferroelectric memory cell may include a capacitor with a ferroelectric material as the insulating material. In instances where the storage medium includes FeRAM, different levels of charge of a ferroelectric capacitor may represent different logic states.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The memory cell <b>205</b> of the memory die <b>105</b> may be accessed (e.g., during a read operation, write operation, or other operation) using various combinations of word lines <b>230</b>, digit lines <b>210</b>, in some types of memory technologies, plate lines, or a combination thereof. In some cases, some memory cells <b>205</b> may share access lines (e.g., digit lines, word lines, plate lines) with other memory cells. For example, a digit line <b>210</b> may be shared with memory cells <b>205</b> in a same column and a word line <b>230</b> may be shared with memory cells in a same row. In some cases, a plate line may be shared with memory cells in a same section, tile, deck, or multiple decks. As described above, various states may be stored by charging or discharging the capacitor <b>220</b> of the memory cell <b>205</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The stored state of the capacitor <b>220</b> of the memory cell <b>205</b> may be read or sensed by operating various components. The capacitor <b>220</b> may be in electronic communication with a digit line <b>210</b>. The capacitor <b>220</b> may be isolated from digit line <b>210</b> when selection component <b>225</b> is deactivated, and the capacitor <b>220</b> can be coupled with the digit line <b>210</b> when selection component <b>225</b> is activated (e.g., by the word line <b>230</b>). Activating selection component <b>225</b> may, in some examples, be referred to as selecting a memory cell <b>205</b>. In some cases, the selection component <b>225</b> may be a transistor and its operation may be controlled by applying a voltage to the transistor gate, where the voltage magnitude is greater than the threshold magnitude of the transistor. The word line <b>230</b> may activate the selection component <b>225</b> based on instructions received from the memory controller <b>110</b>. For example, a memory controller <b>110</b> may control the biasing of the word line <b>230</b> to selectively activate/deactivate the selection component <b>225</b>, and thereby connect a capacitor <b>220</b> of a memory cell <b>205</b> with a digit line <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The change in voltage of a digit line <b>210</b> may, in some examples, depend on the digit line's intrinsic capacitance. That is, as charge flows through the digit line <b>210</b>, some finite amount of charge may be stored in the digit line <b>210</b> and the resulting voltage depends on the intrinsic capacitance. The intrinsic capacitance may depend on physical characteristics, including the dimensions, of the digit line. The digit line <b>210</b> may connect many memory cells of the memory die <b>105</b> so the digit line <b>210</b> may have a length that results in a non-negligible capacitance (e.g., on the order of picofarads (pF)). The resulting voltage of the digit line <b>210</b> may then be compared to a reference voltage by a sense component <b>240</b> in order to determine the stored logic state in the memory cell. Other sensing processes may be used. The sense component <b>240</b> may be coupled with the digit line <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The sense component <b>240</b> may include various transistors or amplifiers to detect and amplify a difference in signals, which may be referred to as latching. The sense component <b>240</b> may include a sense amplifier that receives and compares the voltage of the digit line <b>210</b> and a reference line <b>245</b>, which may be a reference voltage. The sense amplifier output may be driven to the higher (e.g., a positive) or lower (e.g., negative or ground) supply voltage based on the comparison. For instance, if the digit line has a higher voltage than reference line, then the sense amplifier output may be driven to a positive supply voltage.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In some cases, the sense amplifier may drive the digit line to the supply voltage. The sense component <b>240</b> may then latch the output of the sense amplifier and/or the voltage of the digit line <b>210</b>, which may be used to determine the stored state in the memory cell (e.g., logic &#x2018;1&#x2019;). Alternatively, for example, if the digit line <b>210</b> has a lower voltage than reference line <b>245</b>, the sense amplifier output may be driven to a negative or ground voltage. The sense component <b>240</b> may similarly latch the sense amplifier output to determine the stored state in the memory cell <b>205</b> (e.g., logic &#x2018;0&#x2019;). The latched logic state of the memory cell <b>205</b> may then be output to the memory controller <b>110</b>, for example, using one or more internal signal paths <b>115</b> or vias <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">To write a memory cell, a voltage may be applied across the capacitor <b>220</b> of the memory cell <b>205</b>. Various methods may be used to write a memory cell <b>205</b>. In one example, the selection component <b>225</b> may be activated through a word line <b>230</b> in order to electrically connect the capacitor <b>220</b> to the digit line <b>210</b>. A voltage may be applied across the capacitor <b>220</b> by controlling the voltage of a first cell plate (e.g., through voltage source <b>215</b>) and a second cell plate (e.g., through a digit line <b>210</b>). To write a logic &#x2018;0&#x2019;, the cell plate may be taken high (e.g., a voltage level may be increased above a predetermined voltage that is a &#x201c;high&#x201d; voltage). That is, a positive voltage may be applied to plate line, and the cell bottom may be taken low (e.g., virtually grounding or applying a negative voltage to the digit line). The opposite process may be performed to write a logic &#x2018;1&#x2019;, where the cell plate is taken low and the cell bottom is taken high.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">According to the techniques described herein, different signals may be sent using different combinations of modulation schemes and frequencies. The modulation scheme used to modulated a signal may affect the number of memory cells <b>205</b> that are selected to receive the signal. For example, compared to signals modulated using modulation schemes with low numbers of levels, more memory cells <b>205</b> may be selected to receive a signals that are modulated using modulation schemes with higher numbers of levels. This is because modulation schemes with higher numbers of levels may communicate larger amounts of data than modulation schemes with lower number of levels. In some cases, more memory cells <b>205</b> may be selected to receive a signal by increasing the page size of a memory die. Conversely, fewer memory cells <b>205</b> may be selected to receive a signal (e.g., a signal modulated using a modulation scheme having a low number of levels) by decreasing the page size of a memory die.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates an example of a circuit <b>300</b> in accordance with various examples of the present disclosure.

In some cases, the memory controller <b>310</b> may be configured to select a type of a modulation scheme (e.g., binary&#x2014;symbol or multi-symbol) applied to a signal based on one or more parameters. Such parameters may include power consumption parameter of the memory device, performance requirements of an application being implemented using the memory device, other parameters, or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In a binary-symbol signal <b>325</b>, the modulation scheme includes two symbols (e.g., two voltages levels) are used to represent up to two logic states (e.g., logic state &#x2018;0&#x2019; or logic state &#x2018;1&#x2019;). In a multi-symbol signal <b>320</b>, the modulation scheme may include a larger library of symbols may be used to represent three or more logic states. For example, if the multi-symbol signal <b>320</b> is modulated with a modulation scheme that includes four unique symbols, the multi-symbol signal <b>320</b> may be used to represent up to four logic states, &#x2018;00&#x2019;, &#x2018;01&#x2019;, &#x2018;10&#x2019;, and &#x2018;11&#x2019;. As a result, multiple bits of data may be included within a single symbol, thereby increasing the amount of data communicated using a given bandwidth.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">A multi-symbol signal <b>320</b> may be any signal that is modulated using a modulation scheme that includes three or more unique symbols to represent data (e.g., two or more bits of data). A M-ary signal is modulated using a modulation scheme where M represents the number of unique symbols (e.g., levels, or other conditions or combinations of conditions possible in the modulation scheme. The multi-symbol signal <b>320</b> may be an example of any M-ary modulation scheme where M is greater than or equal to 3. A multi-symbol signal <b>320</b> or a multi-symbol modulation scheme may be referred to as a non-binary signal or non-binary modulation scheme in some instances. Examples of multi-symbol (or M-ary) modulation schemes related to a multi-symbol signal may include, but are not limited to, pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) schemes, quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) schemes, quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) schemes, and/or others.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">A binary-symbol signal <b>325</b> may be any signal that is modulated using a modulation scheme that includes two unique symbols to represent one bit of data. The binary-symbol signal <b>325</b> may be an example of a M-ary modulation scheme where M equal to 2. Examples of binary-symbol modulation schemes related to a binary-symbol signal include, but are not limited to, non-return-to-zero (NRZ), unipolar encoding, bipolar encoding, Manchester encoding, PAM2, and/or others.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In some cases, the modulation schemes of the various signals may be amplitude modulation schemes such as PAM4 and/or NRZ that encode information in the amplitude (or level) of a signal (e.g., a voltage amplitude or a current amplitude). The symbols of the modulation schemes may be referred to as levels, amplitudes, or signal strengths. For example, a first level of a signal may represent &#x2018;00&#x2019;, a second level may represent &#x2018;01&#x2019;, a third level may represent &#x2018;10&#x2019;, and a fourth level may represent &#x2018;11&#x2019;. In some cases, a single symbol of the amplitude modulation scheme may be a constant level applied during a single symbol duration or two or more levels applied during a single symbol duration. The functions of features described herein may apply with other types of modulation schemes such as phase modulation schemes, phase-shift keying modulation schemes, frequency shift keying modulation schemes, amplitude-shift keying modulation schemes, on-off keying (OOK) modulation schemes, orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation schemes, spread-spectrum modulation schemes, time-based modulation schemes, or a combination thereof. As such, the symbols or levels of the modulation schemes may be related to signal parameters other than amplitude (e.g., phase, time, frequency).</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In some examples, some multi-symbol signaling schemes include symbols that are separated by a smaller difference in voltage (or other variable signal parameter measurement) than symbols in binary-symbol signaling schemes. The smaller voltage separation may, in some examples, make the multi-symbol signal <b>320</b> more susceptible to error caused by noise and other factors. The voltage separation of symbols in the multi-symbol signal <b>320</b>, however, may be expanded by increasing a peak-to-peak transmitted power of a transmitted signal. But in some situations, such an increase to peak-to-peak transmitted power may not be possible or may be difficult due to fixed power supply voltages, fixed signal power requirements, or other factors. Consequently, to implement multi-level signaling, a transmitter may utilize more power and/or a receiver may be susceptible to an increased error rate, when compared to a binary-symbol signal <b>325</b>. Despite this smaller voltage difference and related aspects, multi-level signaling facilitates distinct and advantageous implementations. For example, multi-level signaling communicates more information given a finite amount of communication resources than binary-level signals.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Additionally, use of different multi-level signaling schemes may allow a device to achieve target communication or operation metrics. A multi-level signal with a larger number of levels may provide more bandwidth than a multi-level signal with a smaller number of levels. But communicating a multi-level signal that has a larger number of levels may also consume more power than communication a multi-level signal that has a smaller number of levels. Accordingly, a device may select the number of levels in a multi-level signal to provide a target bandwidth or stay within a target power consummation level.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In some cases, the features and functions related to communicating multi-symbol signals <b>320</b> and binary-symbol signals <b>325</b> may be implemented in devices and contexts other than memory storage.

The first signal may be a binary-level signal (e.g., a NRZ signal, such as signal <b>1425</b>) or a multi-level signal (e.g., a PAM4 signal, such as signal <b>1420</b>). In some cases, the first signal may be based on the first number of bit streams. For example, the first signal may represent the first set of data conveyed by the first number of bit streams. In some cases, the number of levels may be based on the first number of bit streams. For example, the first number of levels may be twice the number of bit streams. In some cases, the first number of bit streams may be different from the first number of levels.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0199">After receiving the first set data, the memory controller <b>1401</b> may receive a second set of data in a second number of bit streams that is different from the first number of bit streams. For instance, the memory controller <b>1401</b> may receive the first number of bit streams from a data array or user input interface in electronic communication with the memory controller <b>1401</b>. The first number of bit streams may be the same as, or different from, the second number of bit streams. In some cases, the first set of data is associated with a first application and the second set of data may be associated with a second application.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0200">According to the techniques described herein, the memory controller <b>1401</b> may determine an operating parameter associated with device of which the memory controller <b>1401</b> is a part. For example, the memory controller <b>1401</b> may determine an operating parameter associated with the host <b>1430</b>. An operating parameter may be a requirement, request, condition, metric, demand, or value. Determination of the operating parameter may be based on receiving the second set of data, or it may be independent of receiving the second set of data (e.g., determination of the operating parameter may occur prior to receiving the second set of data). The operating parameter may be a temperature parameter, a bandwidth parameter, a power parameter, a data rate parameter, or the like, or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0201">After determining the operating parameter, the memory controller may generate a second signal having a second number of levels different from the first number of levels. Generating the second signal may be based on the determined operating parameter and the second number of bit streams. For example, the second signal may be representative of the second set of data conveyed in the second bit stream and/or the second number of levels may be a function of the second number of bit streams (e.g., may be twice the number of bit streams). In some cases, the second number of bit streams is different from the second number of levels.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0202">In some cases, the first signal is communicated over a channel (e.g., over an internal signal path <b>1415</b>) at a first frequency (e.g., a first clock frequency, first pulse frequency, or first data rate frequency) and the second signal is communicated over the channel (or a different channel) at a second frequency (e.g., a second clock frequency, second pulse frequency, or second data rate frequency). So the modulation scheme and the frequency may be different for two separate signals. The frequencies may be based on the clock pulses output by clock circuit <b>1410</b>. In other cases, the first signal is communicated over a channel (e.g., over an internal signal path <b>1415</b>) at a first frequency and the second signal is communicated over the channel (or a different channel) at the first frequency (e.g., at the same frequency). So the modulation scheme may be different for two separate signals, but the frequency may be the same.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0203">According to the techniques described herein, the memory controller <b>1401</b> may be configured to communicate a first signal to the memory die <b>1403</b>. The first signal may be modulated using a first modulation scheme that has a first number of levels. The memory controller <b>1401</b> may also be configured to determine an operating parameter associated with the apparatus of which the memory controller <b>1401</b> and memory die <b>1403</b> are a part. Based on the determined operating parameter, the memory controller <b>1401</b> may select a second modulation scheme different from the first modulation scheme. After selecting the second modulation scheme, the memory controller <b>1401</b> may communicate a second signal to the memory die <b>1403</b>. The second signal may be modulated using the second modulation scheme, which may have a second number of levels different from the first number of levels.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0204">In some cases, the memory controller <b>1401</b> may be configured to communicate the first signal based on a first frequency of a first clock signal generated by the clock circuit <b>1410</b>. In such cases, the memory controller <b>1401</b> may also be configured to communicate the second signal based on a second frequency of a second clock signal and based on the determined operating parameter. The second frequency is higher or lower than the first frequency.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0205">In some cases, the operating parameter is a bandwidth parameter (e.g., a current bandwidth requirement) or a power parameter (e.g., a parameter indicative of the current power consumption or conservation requirement). When the operating parameter is a power parameter, the memory controller <b>1401</b> may determine the power parameter by detecting whether an external power source is connected to the device of which the memory controller <b>1401</b> is a part. If the first modulation scheme is NRZ and the second modulation scheme is PAM4, the second modulation scheme may be selected when an external power source connection is detected. Using PAM4 rather than NRZ may provide more bandwidth for communication. If the first modulation scheme is PAM4 and the second modulation scheme is NRZ, the second modulation scheme may be selected when no external power source connection is detected. Using NRZ rather than PAM4 may decrease power consumption (e.g., increase power conservation).</p><p id="p-0207" num="0206">In some cases, determining the power parameter includes estimating a duration of time until an internal power source reaches a threshold value. Selection of the second modulation scheme may be based on the estimation. For instance, if the estimation indicates that the internal power supply will be exhausted within a threshold (e.g., short) period of time, the memory controller <b>1401</b> may switch from PAM4 to NRZ to conserve power. If the estimation indicates that the internal power supply will not be exhausted within a threshold period of time, the memory controller <b>1401</b> may switch from NRZ to PAM4 to provide more bandwidth for data communication.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0207">In some examples, the operating parameter is the launch of an application on the device that includes the memory controller <b>1401</b>. Some applications may define relatively low data rates for the transfer of its application data with a memory array, while other applications may define relatively high data rates. For example, a camera application may require high data rates, especially when it is in burst mode (e.g., a mode that captures multiple photos within a short period of time). A camera application may also require a relatively high data rate when, for example, it is in video mode, playback mode, 4k multi-shot mode, etc. Other applications with high data rates may include media consuming applications, virtual reality applications, augmented reality applications, artificial intelligence applications, machine learning applications, and the like.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0208">The operating parameter may be associated with the launch of an application. For example, the newly launched application may require a data rate greater than a threshold data rate. In such an example, the operating parameter may indicate the entry of an application into a certain mode that requires a data rate higher than a threshold data rate. When the data rate requested or required by an application is greater than the threshold rate, the memory controller <b>1401</b> may select a multi-symbol modulation scheme (e.g., PAM4, PAM8, PAM16, etc.) as the second modulation scheme. When the data rate requested or required by an application is less than the threshold rate, the memory controller <b>1401</b> may select a two-level modulation scheme (e.g., NRZ) as the second modulation scheme.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0209">In some cases, the memory controller <b>1401</b> may be configured to select a first number of memory cells in the memory die <b>1403</b> to receive a first signal modulated using a first modulation scheme to represent a first set of data. Said another way, the memory controller may be configured to modify the size of a page in the memory die <b>1403</b> based on modulation scheme being used to encode data.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0210">In such cases, the memory controller <b>1401</b> may also be configured to select a second number of memory cells in the memory die <b>1403</b> for receiving a second signal modulated using a second modulation scheme to represent a second set of data. The second number of memory cells accessed using the second signal may be different from the first number of memory cells access using the first signal. For example, if the first signal is modulated using NRZ (e.g., the first signal is a binary-level signal) and the second signal is modulated using PAM4 (e.g., the second signal is a multi-level signal), then the memory controller <b>1401</b> may select a small number of cells (e.g., a small page size) for receiving the first signal and may select a larger number of cells (e.g., a larger page size) for receiving the second signal. In some cases, the first set of memory cells may be selected to be over-written with new data (e.g., a third set of data) modulated using the second modulation scheme. In such cases, the new data may be modulated at a different data rate than the first data rate (e.g., the second data rate and/or a third data rate may be different from the first data rate and/or the second data rate).</p><p id="p-0212" num="0211">In some examples, the operating parameter is a temperature parameter (e.g., a temperature value of a component part of the same device as memory controller <b>1401</b>). Because high temperatures can damage components or cause impair performance, the memory controller <b>1401</b> may select modulation schemes for communication that prevent or mitigate such temperatures.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0212">For instance, the memory controller <b>1401</b> may determine the temperature parameter by detecting a temperature associated with the memory controller <b>1401</b>, or a component of the same device that includes the memory controller <b>1401</b>). If the memory controller <b>1401</b> detects that the temperature associated with the component (e.g., the memory controller <b>1401</b>) satisfies a temperature threshold (e.g., a high temperature threshold), the memory controller <b>1401</b> may select NRZ as the second modulation scheme to reduce the temperature. If the memory controller <b>1401</b> detects that the temperature associated with the component (e.g., the memory controller <b>1401</b>) does not satisfy a temperature threshold (e.g., the temperature is below the high temperature threshold), the memory controller <b>1401</b> may select PAM4 as the second modulation scheme to provide more bandwidth without the risking negative effects caused by high heat.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0213">In some cases, the operating parameter is a measure or a value that represents the ability or capability of an external device to receive data. For example, the operating parameter may indicate that the peripheral device is limited to certain bandwidth, data rate, modulation scheme, or frequency. In such cases, the memory controller <b>1401</b> may select the second modulation scheme based on the limitations of the peripheral device. In some examples, the operating parameter is a communication metric or requirement requested by the external device. For example, the operating parameter may be a requested data rate, bandwidth, frequency, modulation scheme, voltage level, etc.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0214">Thus, the device (e.g., a memory controller associated with a memory device) may select the second modulation scheme and/or frequency based on the external device's request for one or more communication metrics or requirements (e.g., the second modulation scheme and/or frequency may be selected to comply with or satisfy the requested communication metric or requirement). Additionally or alternatively, the operating parameter may be based on a characteristic of the data represented by the second signal. Although described with reference to a single operating parameter, a memory controller <b>1401</b> may select a combination of modulation scheme and frequency based on multiple operating factors. The operating parameter(s) used as the basis for the selection may be selected based on detection of a change in operation or condition of the device, or based on a request from another device.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0215">According to the techniques described herein, the memory controller <b>1401</b> may be configured to communicate a first signal over the signal paths <b>1415</b> (e.g., a data bus) using a first driver <b>1405</b>.

The first signal <b>1505</b> may be modulated using a first modulation scheme having a first number of levels and the second signal <b>1510</b> may be modulated using a first modulation scheme having a second number of signals. For example, the first signal <b>1505</b> may be modulated using NRZ and the second signal may be modulated using PAM4. Thus, a device may switch from communicating using a NRZ modulation scheme to communicating using a PAM4 modulation scheme (e.g., the device may switch modulation schemes). The switch may be based on an operating parameter determined for the device, or for a component of the device (e.g., a host, a memory controller, an SoC, a processor, etc.).</p><p id="p-0220" num="0219">The first signal <b>1505</b> may be communicated at a first frequency, which may be based on a clock frequency generated and sampled by the device. The first frequency may be related to the pulse duration <b>1515</b> (sometimes referred to as a symbol duration) of a pulse of the first signal <b>1505</b>. A single symbol may be communicated during a single pulse duration <b>1515</b>. One or more bits of data may be represented in each pulse duration <b>1515</b>. For example, when NRZ is used to modulate the first signal <b>1505</b>, the amplitude of the signal <b>1505</b> during a pulse duration <b>1515</b> may represent less than two bits of data (e.g., a logic &#x2018;0&#x2019; or a logic &#x2018;1&#x2019;). So, starting with the trailing pulse (i.e., reading left to right), the first signal <b>1505</b> may represent the data sequence: 1010010.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0220">The second signal <b>1510</b> may also be communicated at the first frequency. Thus, modulation schemes may be switched without switching frequencies. However, the second signal <b>1510</b> may represent a different number of bits per pulse duration <b>1515</b> than the first signal <b>1505</b>. For example, when PAM4 is used to modulate the second signal <b>1510</b>, the amplitude of the signal <b>1510</b> during a pulse duration <b>1515</b> may represent a two bits of data. So, starting with the trailing pulse (i.e., reading left to right), the second signal <b>1510</b> may represent the data sequence: 00101101000110110101.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0221">In some cases, a change in the operating parameter may be detected. Based on the change, the device may select the first modulation scheme for communicating a third signal (e.g., a signal that follows the second signal <b>1510</b>). So the device may communicate the third signal modulated using the first modulation scheme (e.g., NRZ) based on selecting the first modulation scheme. In some cases, prior to sending the second signal <b>1510</b>, the first signal <b>1505</b> may be sent at different frequency than the first frequency (e.g., the first signal <b>1505</b> may be sent at the first frequency for a period of time, then sent at another frequency for a subsequent period of time).</p><p id="p-0223" num="0222">Because different modulations schemes provide varying bandwidths and consume different amounts of power, a device may switch modulation schemes to optimize performance, efficiency, and power conservation. For example, if using NRZ at first frequency consumes less power than using PAM4 at the same frequency, then the device may generally use NRZ to conserve power, and may switch to PAM4 to accommodate bandwidth demands higher than a certain threshold. The device may switch back to NRZ once the bandwidth demands fall below the threshold level. Although described with reference to NRZ and PAM4 the techniques described herein are applicable to any combination of pulse-amplitude-modulation, including PAM2 (e.g., NRZ), PAM4, PAM8, PAM16, etc. The techniques described herein are also applicable to switching from PAM4 to NRZ. Additionally, although described with reference to two modulation schemes, any number of modulation schemes may be switched between.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0223">In some cases, a device may switch frequency based on an operating parameter. In other cases, the device may select a modulation and a frequency based on the operating parameter. In such cases, two variables about an encoded signal (modulation scheme and clock frequency) may be varied based on the operating parameter. For example, the device may determine that switching from NRZ to PAM4, but using the same frequency, provides excess bandwidth and/or consumes more power than the device can afford. In such cases, the device m switch clock frequencies of the encoded signal.</p><p id="p-0225" num="0224">In some cases, the device may switch both the modulation and scheme and the clock frequency of the encoded signal. For example, the device may switch from using NRZ at a first frequency to using PAM4 at a second frequency lower than the first frequency. In another example, the device may determine that switching from NRZ to PAM4, but using the same frequency, does not provide enough bandwidth to support the bandwidth requirement. In such a scenario, the device may switch from using NRZ at a first frequency to using PAM4 at a second frequency higher than the first frequency.

If the device is detected to be connected to an external power source, the device may, at <b>1815</b>, select a second modulation scheme (e.g., PAM4) different from the first modulation scheme based at least in part on the detection. The second modulation scheme may be used to modulate a second signal (which is representative of a second set of data) and may have a second number of levels (e.g., four levels) different from the first number of levels.</p><p id="p-0239" num="0238">If the device is not connected to an external power source, the device may, at <b>1820</b>, determine whether the battery life of the device (e.g., the charge of the battery) is greater than a threshold battery life (e.g., a threshold charge). For example, the device may estimate a duration of time until an internal power source (e.g., the battery) reaches a threshold value. If the device determines that the estimated duration of time is less than the threshold duration of time, the device may, at <b>1825</b>, maintain communicating using NRZ at the first frequency. If the device determines that the estimated duration of time is greater than a threshold duration of time (e.g., the device has more than x hours until the internal power source has y % remaining battery), the device may, at <b>1815</b>, select PAM4 for communication of a second signal. Thus, the device may select the second modulation scheme based on the estimation of the duration of time until the internal power source reaches the threshold value.</p><p id="p-0240" num="0239">In some cases, the device may, at <b>1830</b>, select a second frequency for communicating the second signal that is modulate using PAM4. The second frequency may be based on the determination(s) made at <b>1810</b> and/or <b>1815</b>. At <b>1835</b>, the device may communicate the second signal modulated using PAM4 at the selected second frequency. Alternatively, the device may communicate the second signal modulated using PAM4 at the first frequency. The second signal may be communicated between components of the device or between the device and another device. In some cases, the first signal and the second signal are communicated by a memory controller.

The second modulation scheme may have a second number of levels (e.g., four) different from the first number of levels. If the bandwidth parameter associated with a first application is less than a bandwidth parameter associated with a second application, or less than the bandwidth parameter associated with a second application, the device may, at <b>1920</b>, determine whether a launched application has a data rate (e.g., a target data rate or a required data rate) greater than a threshold data rate.
