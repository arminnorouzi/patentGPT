present disclosure is directed to an electric generator and motor transmission system that is capable of operating with high energy, wide operating range and extremely variable torque and RPM conditions. In accordance with various embodiments, the disclosed system is operable to: dynamically change the output &#x201c;size&#x201d; of the motor/generator by modularly engaging and disengaging rotor/stator sets as power demands increase or decrease; activate one stator or another within the rotor/stator sets as torque/RPM or amperage/voltage requirements change; and/or change from parallel to series winding configurations or the reverse through sets of 2, 4, 6 or more parallel, three-phase, non-twisted coil windings with switchable separated center tap to efficiently meet torque/RPM or amperage/voltage requirements.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="199.22mm" wi="158.33mm" file="US20230006593A1-20230105-D00000.TIF"

The first electrical generator demonstrated was a &#x201c;Faraday Disk&#x201d; developed by Michael Faraday between 1831 and 1832. Also in 1832 the &#x201c;Dynamo&#x201d; was introduced by Hippolyte Pixii and thus demonstrated the generator system used in industry having a field, rotor and commutator most of which are still common in modern generators, alternators and motors. During this same year 1832, a British inventor named William Sturgeon demonstrated the first direct current (DC) motor capable of turning machinery and soon after in 1837, Emily and Thomas Davenport patented the first commercialized version of the commutator type DC electric motor.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Most modern electrical generators and motors resemble the early ones with the exception of vast improvements in &#x201c;air gap&#x201d; distances where the older machines lost huge amounts of efficiency due to large &#x201c;air gaps&#x201d;. Other advancements have been made to improve efficiency and commercial value throughout the years.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A motor/generator/transmission can include one or more rotor/stator sets, where each rotor/stator set includes a rotor and two or more stators. In some embodiments, the rotor includes a ring of equally spaced magnets circumscribing a center axis, and the stators each include a ring of equally spaced cores with windings circumscribing a center axis coaxial with the magnet ring. In embodiments, the windings of the stator cores in the two or more stators are different and can produce different torque-to-revolutions per minute (torque/rpm) and/or amperage-to-voltage (amp/volt) ratios when energized by the magnetic field of the rotor. The rotor magnet ring may be radially inside a stator core ring or outside a stator core ring (e.g., so the magnets and the stator core faces are radially opposite one another and separated by a gap). The rotor and stators can be moved relative to one another in the axial direction to engage the magnetic field of the rotor magnets with the interactive field of first stator windings, second stator windings, possibly third or more stator windings, none of the stator windings, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In some embodiments, the stators and/or the magnet rings can be moved by actuators controlled by a common interconnected controller for the rotor/stator sets. In some embodiments, the magnets may be permanent magnets, electromagnets, and so forth. A magnet ring can be segmented, where each segment includes one or more magnets, and where the number of segments can be rotationally and/or magnetically balanced. Thus, the segments can be moved in balanced sets to engage an electromagnetic field of the first stator, the second stator, or possibly additional stators, increasing or decrease the power of a rotor/stator set. In some embodiments, the stator cores can be wound in multi-phases, were the wires at a center tap are separated and connected to a switching mechanism and/or controller that can connect parallel, non twisted windings in all parallel, all series, or two or more combinations in between, changing the volt/amp and rpm/torque ratios of the rotor/stator sets. In some embodiments, there can be two (2), four (4), six (6), or more than six (6) parallel, non twisted wires in the core windings, producing two (2), three (3), four (4), or more than four (4) combinations of parallel, series or parallel/series combinations respectively.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some embodiments, a motor/generator/transmission includes: a stator support extending longitudinally in a first direction, the stator support having a first interactive field element (e.g., a first stator) and a second interactive field element (e.g., a second stator) spaced apart from the first interactive field element in the first direction; a rotor rotatably coupled with the stator support, the rotor having an axis of rotation and a longitudinal support structure extending in the first direction; and at least a third interactive field element (e.g., a magnet, an electromagnet) slidably coupled with the longitudinal support structure to translate along the longitudinal support structure parallel to its axis of rotation between a first orientation where the first stator is engaged with the magnet, a second orientation where the second stator is engaged with the magnet, and a third orientation where neither the first stator nor the second stator is engaged with the magnet.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some embodiments, a propulsion system includes: a propulsion device; an engine to selectively power the propulsion device; a variable torque motor/generator/transmission to selectively power the propulsion device; an energy storage device to store energy for powering the variable torque motor/generator/transmission; and a controller to selectively operate the propulsion system in a first mode where the variable torque motor/generator/transmission supplies power to the propulsion device, a second mode where the engine supplies power to both the propulsion device and the variable torque motor/generator/transmission, and/or a third mode where the engine and the variable torque motor generator both supply power to the propulsion device, where the variable torque motor/generator/transmission supplies energy for storage in the energy storage device when the propulsion system is operated in the second mode.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, a method of operating multi-phase stator windings of a motor/generator/transmission includes connecting two or more multi-phase stator windings of a stator of a motor/generator/transmission having a separated switchable center tap in series with one another; operating the motor/generator/transmission at a first torque while the two or more multi-phase stator windings are connected in series with one another; connecting the two or more multi-phase stator windings in parallel with one another; and operating the motor/generator/transmission at a second torque while the two or more multi-phase stator windings are connected in parallel with one another, the second torque different than the first torque. For example, the center tap of the multi-phase stator windings is separated by a switching system where sets of two or more, parallel non-twisted wires of stator core windings may be switched so the windings are in series with one another to operate the motor/generator/transmission at a first torque; switched so the windings are in parallel with each other to operate the motor/generator/transmission at a second torque; and switched so the windings are in pairs or sets of three, where each pair or set of three is connected to other pairs or sets of three in series to operate the motor/generator/transmission at a third torque or a fourth torque (e.g., between the first and second torques). In this manner, a motor/generator/transmission can be configured using electronics to switch the torque/rpm ratio and/or the amp/volt ratio.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments of this disclosure, a motor/generator/transmission is mechanically and electronically reconfigurable to accommodate variable torques. The motor/generator/transmission can include: a stator having a first multi-phase stator winding and a second multi-phase stator winding separated at a switchable center tap; a rotor rotatably coupled with the stator, the rotor having an axis of rotation, at least one of the stator or the rotor configured to translate parallel to the axis of rotation between a first orientation where the stator is engaged with the rotor, and a second orientation where the stator is disengaged from the rotor; and switching circuitry configured to connect the first multi-phase stator winding and the second multi-phase stator winding in series in the first orientation while the motor/generator/transmission is operated at a first torque, and connect the first multi-phase stator winding and the second multi-phase stator winding in parallel in the first orientation while the motor/generator/transmission is operated at a second torque, the second torque different than the first torque.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description.

end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0048" num="0047">To date more than 99.9% of electricity generated worldwide is from some form of generator with rotational movement. Solar panels account for about 0.05%. Between 65 and 70% of the world industrial power and about 57% of all consumed power is used by electric motors. This relates to an estimated 16,000-plus terawatt-hours (TWh) annual consumption of electrical power worldwide. Due to this trend of consumption and efficiency improvement, conventional modern electrical generators and motors can operate in the 90 to 98% efficiency range near their rated revolutions per minute (RPM) and torque specifications. For this reason it is thought that the modern generator and motor industries are very mature and small incremental improvements can be made. However, while the narrow band of high efficiency rating in generators and motors is high, when these same generators and motors are operating outside the specified RPM and/or torque rating, the efficiencies dramatically decrease sometimes as low as 30 to 60%.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">While most conventional generation systems use a continuous RPM and torque power source, renewable energies that are now emerging have much greater RPM and torque changes, as the power source is variable, untimely and most times unpredictable. As our capacity in conventional generation and distribution is reached, the need for generators in the renewable energies to be sensitive to this torque and still be efficient can be a very high priority. Likewise in the motor sector there exists a greater need for wider operating ranges with high efficiency for the industrial use and especially in the transportation sector as the demand for hybrid and &#x201c;plug in&#x201d; electric vehicles increases exponentially. An electrical motor's efficiency rarely stays constant, as the real world operating conditions require starts, stops and variable loads.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The modern day vehicle alternator converts some of the rotational power of the combustion engine into electrical power in order to operate the electronics and maintain battery charge. These alternators generally are 50 to 60% efficient. In 2007 there were about 806 million vehicles and today it is estimated to exceed a billion in operation. Almost 16% of manmade CO<sub>2 </sub>comes from these vehicles. Even a small amount of efficiency improvement in these alternators can make a dramatic improvement in fewer emissions and a considerable decrease in fuel consumption. This alternator efficiency loss is due primarily to air gap and inefficiencies in the rotor coil system (electromagnet). Permanent magnets in the rotor are not generally used in vehicular alternators due to the inability to regulate the output for variable loads efficiently.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Permanent magnet alternators (PMA) are used in small wind machines today. They typically have a high startup speed, as cogging of the rotor and the natural magnetic attraction of the stator tend to require a substantial minimum wind speed in order to overcome this limitation. They also lack the RPM range required to produce efficient power in the lower speed range as well as having a current limitation at very high wind speeds. They do not have the ability to regulate their output as the construction allows maximum power production at a given RPM. The stator selection limits the maximum current or voltage; it has a very limited efficiency range.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">With medium to large wind systems, they use large generators that are converted to DC, and then power invertors that follow the power grid and distribute this current to the grid. This conversion comes with lost efficiency and heat production. This also limits the turbine startup speed and maximum output power. In large wind turbines, synchronous 3-phase generators can be used that usually have the rotor powered by the electrical grid in order to tie into the power grid frequency. While using the power inverter system to regulate the output power, they lose efficiency as well as limiting the turbine RPM range. Other renewable energy system generators such as tidal and wave generators have the same problems with efficiency loss due to limited RPM and torque ranges for the wide variations in RPM and torque range of these systems.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The use of permanent magnet motors in hybrid and &#x201c;plug-in&#x201d; electric vehicles has a very limited efficiency range as well. These motors like their PMA counterparts are limited by their construction in RPM, torque and current usage. They also have a problem with back EMF and extreme drag while in coast mode due to the permanent magnet passing continuously by the iron core of the stator.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The present disclosure is directed to an electric generator and motor transmission system that is capable of operating with high energy, wide operating range and extremely variable torque and RPM conditions. This disclosure utilizes the variability of renewable resources such as inconsistent wind speed, untimely ocean wave movement or braking energy in a hybrid vehicle and more efficiently increases the generating potential that conventional generators cannot do. On the motor side, the disclosure produces a variable range of torque/RPM possibility to more efficiently meet the requirements of hybrid vehicles. The system can actually dynamically change the output &#x201c;size&#x201d; of the motor/generator by modularly engaging and disengaging rotor/stator sets as power demands increase or decrease and as torque/RPM or amperage/voltage requirements change activate one stator or another within the rotor/stator sets and can change from parallel to series winding or the reverse through sets of 2, 4, 6 or more parallel, three phase, non-twisted coil windings to meet the torque/RPM or amperage/voltage requirements at optimum or nearly optimum efficiency. The disclosed motor system also increases the variability of hybrid and &#x201c;plug-in&#x201d; electric vehicles, e.g., by increasing the operating range, battery life, longevity of the device, cost effectiveness and ease of retrofitting.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Example Implementations&#x2014;Motor/Generator Including Rotor(s) with Selectively Moveable Interactive Field Elements</heading><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Referring generally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> through <b>12</b></figref>, electric motor/generator/transmissions are described in accordance with embodiments of this disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an electric motor/generator/transmission <b>100</b>, which in some embodiments can be connected to one or more additional electric motor/generator/transmissions <b>100</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, electric motor/generator/transmission <b>100</b> includes a rotor/stator housing <b>102</b> and a rotor <b>104</b> rotatably coupled with the rotor/stator housing <b>102</b>. The rotor <b>104</b> has an axis of rotation <b>106</b> and a longitudinal support structure <b>108</b> that extends in a first direction (e.g., in the direction of the axis of rotation <b>106</b>). The rotor/stator housing <b>102</b> also extends longitudinally in the first direction and includes two or more stators (e.g., a first stator <b>110</b>, a second stator <b>112</b>, and possibly a third stator, and so on), where each stator includes a set of interactive field elements (e.g., stator coils or windings). In embodiments of the disclosure, the interactive field elements are spaced apart from one another in the first direction. In some embodiments, the rotor/stator housing <b>102</b> can be implemented using a housing and/or casing, which may provide, for instance, three or more stator positions, such as stator positions A, B, and/or C described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. In this example, the stator <b>110</b> and/or the stator <b>112</b> can be firmly secured to an inner wall of a casing in the stator positions A, B, and/or C.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The rotor <b>104</b> includes multiple interactive field elements (e.g., magnets <b>114</b>, which can be, for example, permanent magnets, electromagnets, etc.) slidably coupled with the longitudinal support structure <b>108</b> to translate along the longitudinal support structure <b>108</b> parallel to the axis of rotation <b>106</b>. In some embodiments, the rotor <b>104</b> may provide, for instance, three or more positions for the magnets <b>114</b>. For example, a magnet <b>114</b> can be positioned at one of the stator positions A, B, and/or C. As described herein, one of the positions can be a neutral position, such as stator position A, which does not correspond to a stator. In this example, stator position B corresponds to stator <b>110</b>, and stator position C corresponds to stator <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">As used herein, the term &#x201c;interactive field element&#x201d; can include a field element of a rotor or a stator that is configured to electromagnetically interact with a complimentary field element. For example, interactive field elements can include magnets (e.g., permanent magnets or electromagnets) configured to interact with coils or vice versa. In some embodiments, a rotor can include magnets configured to interact with stator coils. In other embodiments, the stator can include magnets configured to interact with rotor coils. The foregoing embodiments are provided by way of example; however, it is noted that any combination of complimentary interactive field elements can be implemented in a rotor/stator set.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In embodiments of the disclosure, the stator <b>110</b> and the stator <b>112</b> may each have different cores and/or winding configurations so that operating characteristics of an electric motor/generator/transmission <b>100</b> can be changed when a magnet <b>114</b> translates between an orientation corresponding to stator position C, where the stator <b>112</b> is engaged with the magnet <b>114</b>; an orientation corresponding to stator position B, where the stator <b>110</b> is engaged with the magnet <b>114</b>; and an orientation corresponding to stator position A, where neither the stator <b>110</b> nor the stator <b>112</b> is engaged with the magnet <b>114</b>. It should be noted that the order of stator positions A, B, and C is provided by way of example and is not meant to limit the present disclosure. In other embodiments, a neutral stator position can be positioned between two stators. A neutral stator position can also be at a different end of the electric motor/generator/transmission <b>100</b>. Further, an electric motor/generator/transmission <b>100</b> can include more than one neutral position and so forth.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> through <b>8</b></figref>, an electric motor/generator/transmission <b>100</b> may include a central shaft (e.g., a large diameter rotor shaft <b>116</b>) that defines rotor shaft magnet slideways <b>118</b>. In some embodiments, the rotor shaft <b>116</b> may be hollow, defining one or more cavities, which can include additional equipment for an electric motor/generator/transmission <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, one or more of the magnets <b>114</b> can include multiple permanent magnets supported in holders, which can be slidably attached to an outer surface of the rotor shaft <b>116</b>, forming a peripheral ring around the circumference of the rotor shaft <b>116</b>. The magnets <b>114</b> can be axially located on the shaft in the neutral stator position A, and can be moved (e.g., in sets of magnets) to stator position B and/or stator position C. For example, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, three (3) sets of four (4) permanent magnets each are moved from the neutral stator position A to be engaged by the stator <b>110</b>. In embodiments of the disclosure, the magnets <b>114</b> can be equally spaced on the periphery of the rotor shaft <b>116</b> and can be moved by an actuator to stator position B, where the outer peripheral surface of the magnets <b>114</b> is at a defined minimal distance (e.g., gap) from the inner peripheral surface of the stator <b>110</b> core surface, causing electricity to flow in the stator <b>110</b> as the rotor <b>104</b> rotates if acting as a generator, or causing the rotor <b>104</b> to rotate if electric current is supplied to the stator <b>110</b> from an external source.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, three (3) additional sets of four (4) permanent magnets each can be moved from the neutral stator position A to be engaged by the stator <b>110</b>. In this configuration, the power output of the electric motor/generator/transmission <b>100</b> can be at least approximately doubled when acting as a generator with respect to the configuration described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. In another example, the torque of the electric motor/generator/transmission <b>100</b> can be at least approximately doubled when acting as a motor under constant voltage with respect to the configuration described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. Further, when the remaining three (3) sets of four (4) permanent magnets each are moved from the neutral stator position A to be engaged by the stator <b>110</b>, the power output of the electric motor/generator/transmission <b>100</b> can be at least approximately tripled when acting as a generator, and/or the torque of the electric motor/generator/transmission <b>100</b> can be at least approximately tripled when acting as a motor under constant voltage.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">However, these examples are not meant to limit the present disclosure. In other embodiments, one magnet can be implemented per holder, with an actuator moving each magnet independently. In a further example, all of the magnets can be included in a single ring holder, which can move the magnets from position to position as a unit (e.g., actuated by a single actuator and/or multiple actuators). For example, a magnet configuration can be selected to balance centrifugal, magnetic, and/or electrical forces acting on the system. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, all sets of the permanent magnets (e.g., nine (9) total) on the periphery of the rotor shaft <b>116</b> can be moved from the neutral stator position A to stator position C to be engaged by the stator <b>112</b>. Note they can be moved to the second stator as a group from neutral or individually but when moving from a first stator to a second stator the electrical connection to or from the first stator is disconnected prior to engaging the second stator except where the first and second stators are wired separately. In another embodiment, the system includes a second electric bus to and from the second stator. As described herein, the different stator windings <b>110</b> and <b>112</b> can provide different power, torque, amperage, and/or voltage capacities and efficiencies. In some embodiments, a controller can be used to send commands to the actuators of each set of magnets to move them in and out of stator positions to achieve enhanced efficiency under widely varying input and output conditions, such as wind powered generators, motors for city busses, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> through <b>11</b></figref>, an actuator <b>120</b> (e.g., a stepper motor, linear actuator, or the like) can be directly or indirectly coupled with a magnet or set of magnets <b>114</b>. In some embodiments (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>), the actuator <b>120</b> can be configured to rotate one or more gears <b>124</b> to turn a threaded shaft <b>122</b>, thereby causing the magnets <b>114</b> to move up or down the shaft <b>122</b> to a desired position. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> and <b>11</b></figref>, the rotor shaft <b>116</b> can include a plurality of cavities <b>126</b> for receiving a plurality of actuators <b>120</b> and associated components (e.g., threaded shaft <b>122</b> and one or more gears <b>124</b>).</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In embodiments of the disclosure, multiple electric motor/generator/transmissions <b>100</b> can be connected together (e.g., end-to-end as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). For example, the longitudinal support structure <b>108</b> of the rotor <b>104</b> can be configured as a modular shaft, and multiple modular shafts can be connected together to form, for instance, a common axle. In some embodiments, each electric motor/generator/transmission <b>100</b> can include one or more endplates <b>128</b> (e.g., such the endplates <b>128</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>), which can include bearings (e.g., rotary bearings) for the rotor <b>104</b>. In some embodiments, the endplates <b>128</b> of two or more electric motor/generator/transmissions <b>100</b> can be connected together to allow additional electric motor/generator/transmissions <b>100</b> to be added inline (e.g., under a common control system to form larger and more powerful units with variable torque and/or power capabilities).</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In some embodiments, modular rotor endplates <b>128</b> fixedly connected to individual rotors <b>104</b> can be connected together when the endplates <b>128</b> are connected, e.g., by interfacing one or more features on a surface of one rotor endplate <b>128</b>, such as machined indentations <b>130</b>, with one or more matching features on a surface of another rotor endplate <b>128</b>, such as protrusions <b>132</b> (e.g., as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>). The protrusions <b>132</b> can be mated with the indentations <b>130</b> when the end of one electric motor/generator/transmission <b>100</b> is joined to the end of a second electric motor/generator/transmission <b>100</b>, causing the torque and rotation of the rotor <b>104</b> of one rotor/stator set to be transferred to the rotor <b>104</b> of the second rotor/stator set through the rotor endplates <b>128</b>, and causing large diameter rotor shafts of both electric motor/generator/transmissions <b>100</b> to act as a common axle. In some embodiments, a rotor endplate <b>128</b> can also include bearings (e.g., rotary bearings) for the rotor <b>104</b>. In some embodiments, a rotor endplate <b>128</b> in union with another endplate <b>128</b> can include rotor bearings.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">However, the configuration described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is provided by way of example only and is not meant to limit the present disclosure. In other embodiments, one electric motor/generator/transmission <b>100</b> set can be connected to another electric motor/generator/transmission <b>100</b> using a different technique. For example, in some embodiments, a central opening <b>134</b> in a rotor endplate <b>128</b> can be shaped (e.g., machined to create a spline and/or a keyed coupling) so that multiple rotor endplates <b>128</b> of respective electric motor/generator/transmissions <b>100</b> can be connected to, for instance, a common axle extending through the centers of the electric motor/generator/transmissions <b>100</b>. In this configuration, the rotor endplates <b>128</b> may structurally accommodate the maximum torque generated by a single electric motor/generator/transmission <b>100</b>, e.g., as opposed to the combined torque of multiple units transferred by mated rotor endplates <b>128</b> (as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>). Further, in some embodiments, an electric motor/generator/transmissions <b>100</b> may not necessarily include rotor endplates <b>128</b>, e.g., where an interior of the longitudinal support structure <b>108</b> of the rotor <b>104</b> is shaped (e.g., machined to create a spline and/or a keyed coupling) so that multiple longitudinal support structures <b>108</b> of respective electric motor/generator/transmissions <b>100</b> can be connected to, for instance, a common axle. In some embodiments, the matching key ways shown on the rotor endplates <b>128</b> may not be needed, for example, where the shaft <b>108</b> is splined or otherwise connected to a through axel. Note that the hollow shaft with the large center hole can also serve the purpose of retrofitting an existing vehicle since the means of connecting it to the drive system is to run the drive shaft through the hollow shaft and connect it with friction bearings or otherwise.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Example Implementations&#x2014;Motor/Generator Including Selectively Moveable Rotor(s)</heading><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Referring generally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b> through <b>18</b></figref>, electric motor/generator/transmissions are described in accordance with additional embodiments of this disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> shows an electric motor/generator/transmission <b>200</b>, which in some embodiments can be connected to one or more additional electric motor/generator/transmissions <b>200</b>.

In some embodiments, for example, in a system with six commonly wired stators, all of the stators may need to be energized together. If one or more are electrically disconnected, the motor/generator can experience inefficiency from the induced drag and there is no neutral. There are four levels of torque/voltage when the connections between the stators are switched as above described, but there is no further torque/voltage adjustment within the stators themselves, nor is there an ability to adjust the power capacity of the motor/generator.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In embodiments of six rotor/stator sets with two or more stators per set, the total power of the electric motor/generator can be increased or decreased by activating more or less rotor/stator sets within the units and further adjusted by shifting the rotor's magnetic field to the next stator of different wiring and even further adjusted by adjusting the number of magnets in the rotating magnetic field as described above. In cases where there are two or more rotor stator sets in operation, the active stator in each of the sets, the rotor magnets in each of the sets, and the stator wiring in each of the sets must be identically set and radially oriented, then additional adjustments in torque and voltage may be made by switching the parallel/series connections between the stators as above described.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">In some embodiments, the mechanical shifting in the rotor/stator sets is implemented with the electronic shifting of the stator wiring, and when there are multiple stator sets, the sets are connected with the ability to switch the connections between them from series to parallel and the noted combinations thereof. For further clarification, when a second set of two or more stators is added to a first set of two or more stators, both sets must be in either series or parallel for the same voltage to run through both of them and generate the same torque for the common shaft. As stated above, stators can run all in series or all in parallel or equal sets of two or three stators in parallel where the sets are connected in series. When shifting between series and parallel the stators should all be shifted together.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">Moreover, when additional sets of stators are added to the motor/generator, the power capacity of the generator is increased and the motor/generator will also have a different torque. This can be done by having multiple rotor/stator sets that each have a neutral or idle position, where the magnetic field of the rotor is not engaged with the electro-magnetic field of any of the stators in the multi-set motor/generator, and then as the power available or required increases, the stators in the sets are brought on line as needed. The power capacity of the motor/generator can also be increased or decreased by shifting to differently wound stators within the sets and further fine-tuned by adjusting the number of rotor magnets engaged in the flux field at any one time. The ability to add or subtract active stators from the motor/generator and change between stator windings, and to add and subtract magnets from the rotors, and then further change the windings from series to parallel and combinations thereof, provides the motor/generator with an ability to dynamically adapt to widely varying sources of energy. This serves to optimize motor/generator configuration for improved electrical generation and to adapt to widely varying demands for motor power in hybrid vehicles and similar uses.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The motor/generators as described herein can include modular components, comprising modular stator cage and housing sections, rotors, stators, end caps, actuators, electrical connections, power switching, electronic sensors, controls and user interface, where the motor/generator can be assembled to comprise single or multiple rotor/stator sets with two or more stators per set serving as one motor/generator.

Such motor/generators and motor/generator/transmissions can be implemented in a variety of power generation and power management applications. For example, the motor/generators and motor/generator/transmissions described herein can be implemented in generation devices (e.g., windmills, hydropower generators, and the like) and vehicles or motor-driven devices with multiple power sources, such as hybrid vehicles (e.g., cars, motorcycles, etc.), hybrid marine vessels, hybrid airplanes, and so forth. Some example applications are discussed below.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">Example Implementations&#x2014;Wind Power Generation System</heading><p id="p-0106" num="0105">In an example application where a motor/generator as described herein is implemented in a windmill or wind turbine, an operating scenario can start with no wind at the wind turbine and the stator cage in the inactive &#x201c;stopped&#x201d; condition. In this scenario, an actuator has moved the stator cage (or the rotor field element) to the furthest position where the blank space is over the rotor and the stator windings are disengaged from the magnetic field of the rotor. As the wind speed starts to increase, the sensor can measure the RPM and &#x201c;shift&#x201d; or move the first stator section (or rotor field element) from the neutral mode into a position where the magnetic field of the rotor engages the least amount of stator coils and is 100% parallel requiring the least amount of torque, allowing rotation of the windmill to begin at very low wind speeds and generate electricity much sooner than conventional generators can &#x201c;startup&#x201d;. The computer interface can collect data from the wind speed sensors and the rotational speed of the windmill. As the wind speed increases, the computer can shift from Gear #<b>4</b>, 100% parallel to Gear #<b>3</b>, two sets of three parallel wires connected in series, and so on to Gears #<b>2</b> and #<b>1</b>, increasing the torque required to turn the windmill blades until either a preset rotational speed is achieved or the resisting torque of the stator/rotor set is equal to the power of the wind and the wind mill blades are turning at a constant speed. Upon shifting to full series winding and maximum torque of the first stator in the stator/rotor set, the computer can cause the actuator to shift the second stator with a greater number of stator coils in the stator/rotor set in line with the rotor and go through the same parallel to series shifting process until the stator windings in the second stator are full series windings and maximum resisting torque. If there is a third stator in the set the process can be repeated.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">As the computer monitors the wind speed and power available from the wind it can engage the actuators of 1, 2, 3 or more stator/rotor sets to match the power of the wind concurrently shifting each of the stator/rotor sets through their various gears and stators/rotors as above described until equilibrium in the rotational speed of the windmill blades is achieved and the power of the wind is matched with an optimum or nearly optimum generating capacity of the wind power generator and maintaining needed line voltage. As the wind speed increases and it is desired to bring additional stator sets online, say from three sets to four sets, the computer can determine what gear the four sets can be in and what stator activated, then momentarily electrically disconnect the three sets, place the four sets in the new configuration and electrically reconnect the four sets to be concurrently shifted with the same voltage emanating from each stator set Final adjustments and fine tuning is achieved by fine adjustment of the alignment of the stators with the rotor in the sets. This also applies when minor adjustments are required to accommodate minor variations in the wind speed.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">When the wind velocity subsides and the number of stator sets on line is to be decreased from four to three, the last stator to come on line is electrically disconnected, its stator repositioned to neutral and the three remaining stator sets adjusted to match the wind power then being generated by the windmill. In this manner systems and techniques in accordance with the present disclosure can accurately, swiftly and efficiently balance the power output of the motor generator with the available wind speed at levels of wind speed and produce generated electric power from the wind at high efficiency rate. Generally, the total number of stator/rotor sets in the motor generator in full series setting acting together can correspond to the maximum structural and mechanical capabilities of the wind mill and its blades. At the point of maximum capacity as with some generators it can automatically shut down. But unlike generators that have a narrow band of wind speeds where they operate efficiently, techniques in accordance with the present disclosure can extract increased power from the wind at high efficiency throughout the entire range of wind speeds up to the structural capacity of the wind mill. When the wind speed starts to slow down and the output voltage drops, the unit can switch down to the next stator-wiring mode to increase the voltage/power collection. When the wind speed drops to a very slow condition, and although not much power is generated, the unit can still capture this and help with the annual wind turbine output for greater overall machine efficiency where conventional generators may have to shut down.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">Another operational function can be described in a larger scaled up version as in megawatt sized wind turbines. This scenario can behave the same as in the small wind example but the configuration of the generator can be much larger, may have as many as 12 or more stator/rotor sets in a 3-phase configuration to enable a smooth transition in RPM changes do to highly variable wind. The stator engagement process can also be the same or similar, with the exception of extra user controls, sensors for power grid control and monitoring systems to sense the load and adjust to customer demand.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">Another feature of this disclosure is the addition of larger stator/rotor sets and the ability to offset each of the stator/rotor sets rotationally by a few degrees as to make the number of stator and rotor section equal the evenly spaced out rotational offsets. This can help with generator &#x201c;cogging&#x201d; and enable a design of this disclosure whereby the multiple stator windings can be controlled to have an onboard insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) select the different high and low voltage points and using pulse width modulation (PWM) schemes, build and create a 3-phase sine wave at a set frequency of 60 hz. When sensing RPM changes and fluctuations, the controls can adjust the stator winding section to keep and maintain this frequency even when moderate RPM changes are noticed. This is a solution for a variable rotational power source and a constant frequency generated output for a local grid or emergency power source without conversion losses due to AC-to-DC and large inverter systems power consumption. To understand this process, an example of a large stator set of multiple pole 3-phase winding and 12 stator and rotor sets is provided. In this example, the stator sets are aligned with each other but the rotor sets are rotationally offset by 1/12<sup>th </sup>of the multiple pole rotational angle. This can provide 12 separate 3-phase outputs equally spaced in oscillation offset. The computer system can then take the current RPM, acceleration, load, back EMF (electromagnetic force), output frequency and target frequency and use the PWM switching IGBT's to select upcoming power potentials from the multiple phases and produce the target frequency from the high and low points of the generated multiple phases, possibly regardless of the source RPM (e.g., as long as the RPM is sufficient to maintain the target voltage and power output). The same linear actuation of the stator sections can regulate the torque and changing wind speed rotor RPM's while producing efficient power for the conditions of gusts and very low wind speed plus conditions in between.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">The disclosure's operational function in the application of other renewable energy sources such as tidal and wave generation machines can utilize this same variability in RPM to increase efficiency where the source is intermittent and unreliable, for example, where wave and possible tidal generation machines may also turn a generator one direction and then immediately change rotational direction and continue to generate power efficiently. This disclosure has the ability to add additional rotor/stator set to increase and/or decrease the power capacity and then fine-tune the output with the stator linear movement to coincide with the gradual oscillating output power source and direction changes and further adjust the volt/amp ratios to increase the efficiency of the unit to match the variable input at an instant of time, by switching between stators and parallel or series winding.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Example Implementations&#x2014;Hybrid Vehicle Propulsion System</heading><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Referring generally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b></figref>, a hybrid vehicle (e.g., hybrid car or motorcycle) propulsion system <b>400</b> is described.

The second electric motor/generator/transmission <b>514</b> and the second internal combustion engine <b>516</b> can be used when extended high speed is required and/or when widely fluctuating power demands draw down the battery bank <b>512</b> to a level where the electric motor/generator/transmission <b>506</b> may not keep the battery bank <b>512</b> charged at a predetermined level.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">Further, control circuitry communicatively coupled with one or more sensors that monitor functions of a marine vessel (e.g., engine speed, shaft speed, shaft torque at an internal combustion engine <b>504</b>, shaft torque at an electric motor/generator/transmission <b>506</b>, boat speed through the water, battery status, operator input, and so forth) can compare boat and/or propulsor performance against operator input and make adjustments to two or more internal combustion engines <b>504</b> and/or to two or more electric motor/generator/transmissions <b>506</b> to match boat performance with operator input. For instance, the control circuitry can operate two or more internal combustion engines <b>504</b> to facilitate enhanced efficiency and/or life expectancy, supplementing engine power with power from two or more electric motor/generator/transmissions <b>506</b> at a torque and speed selected to meet operator input requirements. Further, a second electric motor/generator/transmission <b>514</b> can be used to supply power to an electric motor/generator/transmission <b>506</b> (e.g., in addition to or instead of power supplied by one or more batteries) as determined based upon operator input demands.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">In some embodiments, when operator input indicates a desired acceleration and/or high power that may not otherwise be obtainable from the two or more internal combustion engines <b>504</b>, power supplied by the two or more electric motor/generator/transmissions <b>506</b> can be used to supplement power supplied by the two or more internal combustion engines <b>504</b>, e.g., where the two or more electric motor/generator/transmissions <b>506</b> shift their configurations (e.g., coil/wiring configurations) to meet the power, torque, and/or speed desired. When operator input indicates that less power, torque, and/or speed is desired from the two or more internal combustion engines <b>504</b>, the two or more electric motor/generator/transmissions <b>506</b> may shift their configurations (e.g., coil/wiring configurations) to meet the torque and speed of the shaft as it rotates to provide charging power for the battery bank <b>512</b>.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">Further, if the control circuitry determines that the two or more internal combustion engines <b>504</b> and the two or more electric motor/generator/transmissions <b>506</b> are insufficient to meet the desired input of the operator and/or maintain an operator determined charge level on the battery bank <b>512</b>, the control circuitry can activate the second internal combustion engine <b>516</b> and the second electric motor/generator/transmission <b>514</b> to supplement power to the two or more electric motor/generator/transmissions <b>506</b> and/or to charge the battery bank <b>512</b> (or a second battery <b>518</b>) chargeable by the second electric motor/generator/transmission <b>514</b>.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">In some embodiments, propulsion systems <b>500</b> described herein can be used with diesel engines, which may be comparatively slower to accelerate, and as a result may have slower throttle response times when compared to, for example, gasoline powered engines. Slower throttle response times may be less desirable for some applications, including high speed attack applications, riverine applications, emergency response applications, and security boat applications. As described herein, systems and techniques in accordance with the present disclosure can speed up throttle response times for diesel engine configurations. The electric motor/generator/transmission <b>506</b> of the present disclosure has the ability to shift between stators of different windings, and can internally shift windings from series to parallel, and partially parallel and partially series, enabling the electric motor/generator/transmission <b>506</b> to serve as an electro/mechanical power source with selectively variable power ranges and selectively variable torque/speed ratios within each power setting.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">A high performance diesel internal combustion engine may have low torque and power on startup and may require time under load to build up sufficient revolutions per minute (RPM) and torque to accelerate a boat, which may be slower than an equivalently powered gasoline internal combustion engine. A high performance diesel internal combustion engine also has an optimum speed at which it will run efficiently, generally burning less fuel at its optimum speed than an equivalently powered gasoline engine. High performance diesel engines also generally have a limited number of hours to run at top speed before an expiration of warranty and/or engine life. Thus, supplementary power can be supplied to a high performance diesel boat when rapid acceleration and/or high speed are required, e.g., for a rapid response boat, a patrol boat on a board, a search and seize mission where throttle response in coming along side is critical, a high speed attack boat on an extended mission where throttle response in rough seas is critical and extended cruise at high speed is desired, and so forth. While an electric motor can be used to provide supplementary power on startup, the electric motor may not be as efficient when providing power at high speed, except possibly with the assistance of an elaborate transmission, which may not be able to shift back and forth rapidly enough. A high speed electric motor may have the opposite result, being comparatively inefficient and possibly burning up when high torque is required in rapid acceleration situations. The electric motor/generator/transmissions <b>506</b> described herein can provide supplementary power at both the high end and the low end efficiently, and can shift from one to the other and many positions in between rapidly.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">In some instances, larger patrol boats may use diesel internal combustion engines for cruising (e.g., at low speed) and then may switch to gas turbine powered electric generators and electric motors for high speed transit. A combination of diesel and electric engines may result in excessive torque for the transmission, which can fail. As described herein, a transmission (e.g., if other than a clutch), is between the internal combustion engine <b>504</b> and the electric motor/generator/transmission <b>506</b>. The electric motor/generator/transmission <b>506</b> is itself the transmission to the marine propulsor <b>502</b> when supplementary power is applied and is self-disconnectable or neutral from the drive line without clutch or other device when the system is in diesel cruise mode only or intermittently. If another transmission is used, it can be a transmission or clutch for the internal combustion engine <b>504</b> and may only be subject to the internal combustion engine <b>504</b> power/torque and not the combined power/torque of both internal combustion engine <b>504</b> and the electric motor/generator/transmission <b>506</b>. By using the electric motor/generator/transmission <b>506</b> to supplement the power of the internal combustion engine <b>504</b>, both the internal combustion engine <b>504</b> and the electric motor/generator/transmission <b>506</b> can be of smaller design since they can work together and not independently when required.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">The second electric motor/generator/transmission <b>514</b> described herein can have a wide range of torque/speed operating levels where it can be highly efficient and can adjust its power and torque to match the speed and power setting of, for example, an electric motor/generator/transmission <b>506</b> when operating at cruise or lower speeds and continue adjusting to obtain efficient battery charging at any speed when necessary. The second electric motor/generator/transmission <b>514</b> can supply charging power to the battery bank <b>512</b> at the same time it is providing power to the electric motor/generator/transmission <b>506</b> (e.g., except when the electric motor/generator/transmission <b>506</b> is demanding all power from the second electric motor/generator/transmission <b>514</b>). This ability to continually adjust to adapt to widely varying speed and power demands can allow the propulsion system <b>500</b> to monitor and select an efficient power source between diesel, gas turbine, and electric to propel the vessel, and can allow the system to recharge the battery bank <b>512</b> in an efficient manner at various speeds where it is not demanding full power for the propulsion of the boat. An electric motor may not be able to accomplish this, because when it is not turning at its predetermined design speed, the electric motor is either delivering less efficient power to a propulsor or delivering less efficient power to a battery.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">A propulsion system <b>500</b>, including some or all of its components, can operate under computer control.

Operator input devices can include: system on/off, manual or automatic switch, GPS navigation unit that can communicate with trip software, forward/reverse/gear ratio selector, throttle, brake, and so forth.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">Example Operational Sequence</heading><p id="p-0138" num="0137">In an example operational sequence, an operator enters vehicle, assumes the control position and switches system from off to automatic. This energizes the system electronic monitoring and control modules. The operator may engage GPS navigation unit and enter destination and note if one way or round trip. The system controller on automatic can run the following sequence of checks: engine RPM&#x2014;can be zero, not yet started; engine transmission gear ratio/position&#x2014;can be neutral-shaft disengaged, part of shut down protocol; torque of shaft from electric motor/generator/transmission can be zero; electric motor/generator/transmission checks: the low gear stator with the largest number of cores stators can be engaged with the rotor for max flux/torque to prevent accidental movement of vehicle, part of automatic shutdown protocol; core windings can be in Series for max flux/torque to prevent accidental movement of vehicle, part of automatic shutdown protocol; current flow from battery to electric motor/generator/transmission is off, part of automatic shutdown protocol; battery charge condition, if plugged into external power source overnight it can be at full charge but may not be if recently used or not plugged in, vehicle speed can be zero; if operator entered a destination into GPS system, controller can calculate energy requirements for trip and return, measure present fuel and KWH remaining and advise operator if fuel stop is desired. Calculations can be based on previous destination history if known or area history if not a previous destination.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">When the Operator selects automatic drive mode. If batteries are charged to a high level (above 80%), controller can bypass combustion engine startup, and leave engine transmission in neutral with drive shaft disengaged from engine. Operator depresses brake and selects forward or reverse. With forward or reverse selected, controller confirms brake is depressed and vehicle speed is zero. Operator releases brake and advances throttle causing current to flow from the batteries through the inverter control unit for 3-phase power to the electric motor/generator/transmission causing the rotor and the vehicle drive shaft to rotate in the forward or reverse direction as selected. Operator further advances throttle sending more current from the batteries to the electric motor/generator/transmission.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">Controller monitors speed of vehicle, RPM and torque on the drive shaft and current flow from the batteries versus pressure or position of throttle. If the operator is requesting more speed through pressure on or position of the throttle to accelerate the vehicle or climb a hill, the RPM/torque on the drive shaft is measured and added to the amount of additional power required to accelerate the vehicle. If the projected power demand is within the torque/RPM range of the first stator set, the controller can switch the first of the parallel wire sets in the core windings of the stator from series to parallel and then the second set and so on until the desired speed is obtained, having the same effect as switching gears from lower gear to higher gear ratio, but actually switching from series to parallel changing the voltage/amperage ratios to produce lower torque and higher RPM at each change of the core wiring from series to parallel. If the projected power demand is not within the torque/RPM range of the first stator set the computer can electrically disconnect the first stator set and cause the second stator actuator to engage the second stator/rotor set and the third and more stator/rotor sets as available and calculated to be desired from the pressure on or position of the throttle and the present torque/RPM loading and place them in the appropriate gear and stator position for a continued smooth acceleration in torque and speed concurrently electrically reconnecting the selected stator sets and shifting active stator sets as described to produce the desired speed. In other embodiments, each stator set can have its own starter whereby shutting down the active stators and bringing them back on line together can be eliminated, allowing each stator set to be independently activated; whereupon, active rotor/stator sets can be adjusted so that the active stator in each set is in the range desired for enhanced (e.g., optimized) efficiency and further fine-tuned by switching from series to parallel by commands from the controller until the desired speed is reached. The controller can continuously monitor the power and speed requirements of the vehicle as determined from the throttle and road conditions to adjust between stators and parallel and series combinations to achieve the least amount of power consumption and maximum efficiency.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">When the operator lets up on the throttle, the controller can cause the stator actuators to disengage the stators from the rotors allowing the vehicle to coast with no current flow to the electric motor/generator/transmission. When the operator lightly touches the brake, the first stator set can be engaged in its high gear mode with the electric motor/generator/transmission acting as a generator. As brake pressure is increased the computer can rapidly shift the windings and stator sets to lower and lower parallel/series combinations or the positions with the greatest magnetic back EMF, electricity generated and electromagnetic braking force generated until the vehicle is stopped. In other embodiments, the engagement of high parallel/series mode and the fewest stator sets can occur on the let up of the throttle replacing the coast mode with a defined rate of deceleration on let up of the throttle, i.e. brake control.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">As the vehicle continues in operation under full electric battery power it can eventually reach the point where the remaining KWH battery capacity is approximately 80% or some other level depending on battery design where it can more readily and efficiently accept charge from vehicle braking and deceleration as above described. At this point, which could be on startup, if the batteries were not fully charged beforehand, the controller can assess the energy requirements to complete the trip if the operator entered a destination, either new or previous, and compare same with battery charge remaining. If adequate battery power remains for the trip, no further changes are needed and the trip can be completed on full electric power. If the battery charge is insufficient to complete the trip with a reserve of some threshold (e.g., approximately 10 or 20%), the controller can calculate the rate of battery power consumption and the rate of recharge to determine when the combustion engine can be started and engaged to adequately complete the trip&#x2014;assuming that at the end of the trip the battery can be recharged from external sources. If no destination is entered, the controller can assume the trip length is indefinite and base its computations of energy consumption on prior history for the area it is in, or if no prior history a predetermined factor for different areas of the country such as sea level, hilly, high country mountainous, heavy urban or rural can be used. Where the trip is considered as having indefinite/unknown length the combustion engine can be started and brought on line as desired to maintain an economical and efficient use of power on a continuous basis balancing between combustion fuel and electric power. Although it is stated herein that the calculations for employing the combustion engine can be made at the 80% mark, because that may be the level below which the batteries can more efficiently be recharged, the calculations can be made from the moment the system is turned on and continuously thereafter at regular intervals using the battery charge level, rate of discharge and rate of recharge to determine when the combustion engine can be engaged, unless over ridden by manually selecting battery recharge instead of automatic. Moreover, any threshold or range provided herein and may be substituted by another value if implementation needs so require.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">When the controller calculates and determines that the combustion engine can be started and brought on line, the combustion engine becomes the primary power source for the vehicle. The combustion engine is sized to provide sufficient power to move the vehicle at max load and at a predetermined speed over level ground, e.g., 70 mph turnpike driving plus an additional predetermined amount of power to be able accelerate the vehicle to bring it up to speed and climb modest hills without losing excessive amounts of speed. The combustion engine can be sized with the intent of powering a vehicle with a small fuel efficient engine to meet ordinary level driving power requirements plus an incremental additional amount of power for modest acceleration purposes.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">When the internal combustion engine is engaged, the engine and associated engine transmission can respond to throttle pressure or position. The torque and RPM on the shaft from the engine prior to the electric motor/generator/transmission is monitored, When RPM used by the operator through the throttle position exceeds the capacity of the engine, the computer can compute the power required to increase the RPM of the shaft from its current torque/RPM level to that required by throttle position and determines the number of stator sets to be engaged to meet the additional power requirement, the appropriate stator within the sets and the appropriate parallel/series winding combination to be able to increase the applied torque to the shaft at the then RPM. As the RPM increases the computer can shift stator sets and parallel/series windings to provide efficient use of power as it can with the electric mode above described. In this case, however, the electric motor/generator/transmission is providing supplemental power in addition to that supplied by the combustion engine which is primary. The electric motor/generator/transmission can come into use as described when additional power is required to accelerate and pass another vehicle, enter traffic flow or increase vehicle speed faster than the low powered combustion engine can produce. The same can be the case if a large hill is encountered and additional torque is used to maintain speed. When the other vehicle is passed or the top of the hill is reached and additional power to maintain speed begins to diminish, the controller can reduce the number of stator sets employed, and downshift the electric motor/generator/transmission by shifting between stators within the sets and changing the parallel/series until the additional power requirement is no longer required and can shut down the electric motor/generator/transmission. The controller continuously monitoring the system throughout to maintain efficient/economical use of power and fuel through the use of the electric motor/generator/transmission. This can also apply in cases where the combustion engine is required by throttle position to operate outside of its optimum efficiency range and the computer determines that there is adequate battery power to supplement the combustion engine.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">When decelerating and/or braking under combustion engine power, the operator can reduce throttle pressure or position, the combustion engine can be disengaged (after a predefined lag can shut down) and stator actuators in the electric motor/generator/transmission can move the stators and shift the parallel/series windings as described above. When the throttle pressure is increased after decelerating or braking the engine restarts if shut down and if desired the VTMG supplements the combustion engine with electric power as described above.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">When traveling under combustion engine power and the computer determines that the battery charge is not being maintained sufficiently to provide auxiliary power for operations as defined by recent history of operation of the vehicle and past history for the area or destination if available, the controller can engage one or more stator sets in the generator mode to utilize the incremental additional power during times when the vehicle is operating on level ground and has such incremental power available within the capacity of the combustion engine. This and the deceleration or braking mode is an area where the techniques in accordance with the present disclosure can provide two or more stator coils windings of different coil numbers and the ability to switch sets of wires within a stator from parallel to series to efficiently collect energy available at optimum efficiency whether kinetic or combustion/mechanical, it can replenish the battery charge readily and efficiently. This is accomplished by automatically switching to a lower mechanical gear, if desired, in the combustion engine transmission designed for that purpose and running the combustion engine at higher RPM where drive shaft speed is consistent with typical operation but with higher engine speed and greater torque there is excess engine power being generated during straight and level non-accelerating operations to be collected by the electric motor/generator/transmission to recharge the batteries along with the ability to quickly redirect the power being collected back to the vehicle operation and further supplement it as described above.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">In certain instances where the difference between typical operations and peak demand is high, the capacity of the battery system and the frequency and level of recharge including recharge from the engine may be insufficient to provide supplementary power for meeting extreme demands. Examples of this may be a heavily loaded truck climbing up a long mountain pass or a military patrol boat that is normally on patrol at idle or slow cruise speeds and then goes into a high speed chase or other extreme military maneuver. In such instances a third power source may be desirable. In the case of a truck it might be a second diesel engine powering a second electric motor/generator/transmission unit that can independent from the primary electric motor/generator/transmission recharge the batteries or provide additional power to the primary electric motor/generator/transmission controlled from the primary computer. In the case of a patrol boat it could have twin diesel engines powering propellers or other propulsion units such as water jets each with an electric motor/generator/transmission arranged as shown for the hybrid vehicle and its engine and a third larger jet turbine engine with a third larger electric motor/generator/transmission providing electrical power to the two primary electric motor/generator/transmission units or power to recharge the battery bank.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">For use in industrial motor functions, the disclosure can slowly engage the stator actuation and shift windings from high torque/low speed to high speed lower torque in order to &#x201c;soft start&#x201d; in heavy use situations such as large air conditioning, piston compressors, conveyors, large water pumps and hydraulic pumps. This can help conserve energy and cost as the initial power spike can be lessened and lower maximum amperage draws from the power company can result in a lower power bill.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">Generally, any of the functions described herein can be implemented using hardware (e.g., fixed logic circuitry such as integrated circuits), software, firmware, manual processing, or a combination thereof.
