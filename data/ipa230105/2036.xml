In an embodiment, aircraft may include a single deck allowing a minimum height of the aircraft. With minimum height a blended wing aircraft may be configured with a passenger storage compartment of a size comparable to current single-aisle commercial aircraft (e.g., Boeing 737 and Airbus A320).</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Aspects of the present disclosure can also be used to manufacture blended wing body aircraft for commercial air travel. This is so, at least in part, because single-aisle commercial aircraft are the most popular size of aircraft for commercial airliners.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Aspects of the present disclosure allow for placement of landing gear fore and aft of a passenger compartment, in order to allow for a single deck passenger compartment to be used without interference with landing gear. Exemplary embodiments illustrating aspects of the present disclosure are described below in the context of several specific examples.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Today the single-aisle market for commercial air travel is dominated by the Boeing 737 and the Airbus A320. Boeing's 2016 market outlook predicts the single-aisle market will constitute 71% of sales in the 2016-2035 timeframe. Adding the 6% estimate for regional jet demand shows over 75% of total airline demand will come from the regional and single-aisle markets. These aircraft are in extraordinary demand and both manufacturers have near decade-long backlogs despite being older models. For instance, 737 first flight was in 1967 and A320 first flight was in 1987. Blended wing body aircraft may be capable of satisfying new market and regulatory expectations for increased fuel efficiency and reduced noise pollution. However, it has long been believed that because of limitations on fuselage shape that blended wing body aircraft may only be made for commercial air travel with two decks, requiring a much greater number of passengers than is desired by the current commercial air travel market.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some embodiments a blended wing body aircraft may address the most pressing issues in today's Airliner fleet including new stringent emissions and noise standards from ICAO, operating cost, maintenance cost, and the newest problem&#x2014;declining passenger comfort. According to some embodiments, aircraft described herein may provide any number of a multitude of improvements to air transport, for instance an airframe that shields community from most of engine noise, supersonic flow above cabin which prevents forward-radiated noise from entering the cabin, nacelles which are protected from ground handling equipment eliminating intake and exhaust hazards for ground personnel, thrust reversers that do not blank stabilizing surfaces which is a major problem for today's transports on icy runways, fuel tanks that are totally protected from rotor-burst, a pressure vessel and passenger compartment that are totally protected from rotor-burst, a primary wing structure is largely protected from rotor-burst, wingtip-stall that is much improved as the elevons reduce air load near stall, maneuver-loads on the wing that are reduced as the elevons are loaded opposite to the wing load during flight maneuvers, engine inlets which are protected from stall at high angle-of-attack as the airframe directs the flow to the inlet, a majority of the center-body that is stall-free up to and beyond wing stall, a mid-span planform kink that is stall critical to protect the wingtips from stall and the engines from distortion, passenger cabin loading, unloading, and emergency egress that are faster due to multiple short aisles, a ditching stability and integrity that are improved by a large belly surface, traditional tails and associated systems are eliminated, entire high lift flap system is removed, no control surfaces are located behind the wing where they are vulnerable to stalled wakes, and a wing shape and lack of tails reduces the size of the ice protection system.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to some embodiments, a small blended wing body (BWB) aircraft, suitable for addressing the market needs presently met by the Boeing 737, must have a single deck. To date, commercial BWB aircraft have been configured with two decks for optimal packaging. Commonly, a lower deck may be used for cargo and landing gear stowage. In some embodiments, a single-deck BWB aircraft may locate landing gear and cargo elsewhere if the lower deck is to be removed from the aircraft. In some embodiments, a single-deck BWB may locate its main gear in a traditional location. In this embodiment, gear wells (i.e., hear housings) may occupy large volumes within a passenger compartment (i.e., cabin). In some cases, these gear wells may be equal in size to all lavatories and galleys combined. It is for this reason that single-deck BWB aircraft configurations have long been considered infeasible and uneconomical.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">There are two fundamental conflicts between main landing gear and its payload compartment. A lateral conflict comes from gear track limit for Group-III airports. If main gear were to be located outboard of all payload compartments (e.g., cabin and cargo), gear track would exceed Group-III limit for future growth models. If main gear were located between cabin and cargo compartments, center-body would need to grow in size adding weight and drag. Main gear must also be near a longitudinal center of gravity (CG) to rotate for takeoff. Moving main gear behind cabin in some cases may be very desirable as this space is typically unused. Unfortunately, in some cases, this gear location is too far aft and may prevent takeoff rotation, when using conventional landing gear technology. This is why, present BWB aircraft locate gear wells in a second lower cargo deck near the aircraft CG below the payload compartment.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to some embodiments, an aircraft having a blended wing body may be developed that can carry a maximum of between about 100 passengers and 300 passengers on a single deck, as a regional jetliner. In some cases, technology enabling blended wing body aircraft of this size includes landing gear and emergency egress advances, which are disclosed in Non-provisional application Ser. No. 16/181,687 filed on Nov. 6, 2018 and entitled &#x201c;TILTING LANDING GEAR SYSTEMS AND METHODS,&#x201d; Non-provisional application Ser.

For purposes of description herein, relating terms, including &#x201c;upper,&#x201d; &#x201c;lower,&#x201d; &#x201c;left,&#x201d; &#x201c;rear,&#x201d; &#x201c;right,&#x201d; &#x201c;front,&#x201d; &#x201c;vertical,&#x201d; &#x201c;horizontal,&#x201d; and derivatives thereof relate to embodiments oriented as shown for exemplary purposes in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any expressed or implied theory presented in this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a plan view of an exemplary aircraft <b>100</b> for commercial air travel is illustrated. As used in this disclosure, &#x201c;commercial air travel&#x201d; is a mode of transport where non-pilot passengers are conveyed by way of an aircraft. Aircraft may include a blended wing body <b>104</b>. Further disclosure related to exemplary aircraft and blended wing bodies is described in detail below, for example with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a single deck <b>108</b> may be located within blended wing body <b>104</b>. As used in this disclosure, a &#x201c;deck&#x201d; on an aircraft is platform upon which one or more of passengers and cargo may be stored. A single deck <b>108</b> may be contrasted with a two-deck configuration analogously to a single-story house contrasted to a two-story house. In some cases, a single deck may have deviations in angle or height, just as a single-story house may have rooms in which one steps-up or steps-down in when entering. For example, in some cases, a single deck <b>108</b> may include multiple bays (e.g., 2 bays, 3 bays, 4 bays, 5 bays, and the like). Each of the multiple bays may have a floor which is not in plane with another bay. Furthermore, in some cases, a single deck <b>108</b> may not be entirely of a single plane or angle. For example, single deck <b>108</b> may have slight grade introduced in one or more portions. Slight grade in single deck <b>108</b> may match or parallel an outer mold line of aircraft. While a single deck <b>108</b> need not be comprised of a single plane, a single deck <b>108</b> may be characterized by its not having another deck directly above or below it. In some cases, single deck <b>108</b> may include a passenger compartment <b>112</b>. As used in this disclosure, a &#x201c;passenger compartment&#x201d; is an area within which passengers may be seated during flight. In some cases, passenger compartment may be located in a lateral middle portion of blended wing body <b>104</b>. As used in this disclosure, a &#x201c;lateral&#x201d; direction of an aircraft may refer to a direction running from wing tip to wing tip. Lateral direction may be substantially orthogonal to a nose to tail direction. In some embodiments, passenger compartment <b>112</b> may additionally be configured to have a maximum passenger transport capacity substantially within a range of about 5 and about 500 passengers. As used in this disclosure, a &#x201c;maximum passenger transport capacity&#x201d; is a number of passengers that may be conveyed within the passenger compartment. In some cases, maximum passenger transport capacity may be a function of regulatory and/or market constraints, for example on seating row pitch or seat width.

Exemplary aircraft <b>400</b> may employ a tubular fuselage <b>404</b>. Aircraft may locate cargo in a cargo hold <b>408</b> below floor (i.e., single deck) <b>412</b>. In some cases, a passenger compartment <b>416</b> may be located atop single deck <b>412</b>. In some cases, passengers ride within passenger compartment <b>416</b> in upper portion of fuselage. Conventionally, floor structure of tube-wing aircraft may be substantial. For example, floor <b>408</b> may consist of a series of transverse beams (&#x201c;floor beams&#x201d;) <b>420</b> supported at their outboard ends by tubular fuselage structure <b>404</b>. In some cases, floor beams <b>420</b> may be supported by columns <b>424</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>, for instance just outboard of cargo bay <b>408</b>. In some embodiments, columns <b>424</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>may transmit floor beam <b>420</b> loads to tubular fuselage <b>404</b> and may reduce floor beam weight by reducing a free span of the floor beams. Floor beams <b>420</b> may be surfaced by a combination of longitudinal elements, usually seat tracks, and floor panels that span between the seat tracks. In some embodiments, lateral elements, for example attached to a top of floor beams <b>420</b>, support floor panels on their fore and aft edges. In some cases, passenger seat legs have a &#x201c;button&#x201d; that is captured within a slot in seat track. In some embodiments, fore-aft location of seats may be indexed and restrained by regularly spaced cutouts in the seat track. In some cases, seat tracks carry load of floor panels longitudinally to transverse floor beams <b>420</b>. As a result, seat tracks may be shaped as I beams. In some embodiments, modern floor panels are generally a sandwich panel consisting of carbon-epoxy face sheets and a honeycomb core. In some cases, floor panel thickness may be about 0.400 inches. Floor panels may be fastened to seat tracks with screws through recessed inserts in the floor panel. In some embodiments, an upper surface of each floor panel may be flush with an upper surface of a seat track. In some cases, a lower surface of each floor panel may rest on lateral extensions of seat track. As a result, in some embodiments a smooth floor surface from wall-to-wall may be achieved, while allowing seat track slot access from above. In some cases, an aircraft having a blended wing body may preclude conventional flooring as described in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> above, for instance in cases where the aircraft employs a single-deck configuration.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring now, to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, an exemplary view showing a bottom of a blended wing body aircraft <b>500</b> is illustrated. In some embodiments, a BWB cannot practically use a conventional cabin floor structure. In some cases, this may be because a BWB may have little depth between finished floor surface <b>504</b> (top of floor panel) and a lower outer mold line (OML) of BWB. Furthermore, in some cases, a conventional floor structure may span between cabin walls, which may be supported by columns to an OML structure. As depth between floor and lower OML may be relatively small in a single-deck configuration, a conventional floor structure may be likely to be very inefficient and heavy. In some embodiments, floor structure <b>504</b> of a BWB aircraft may support both a payload (multiplied by a maximum g-load) and a cabin pressurization load. In some cases, cabin pressure load may be far greater than payload weight. As a result, in some cases, floor structure <b>504</b>, may resist far greater vertical loads and therefore may need to be far stronger than typical airliner floor systems.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, in some embodiments, OML structure and floor structure <b>504</b> may form an integrated structure. In this arrangement, floor structure <b>504</b> may function as a sandwich structure. For instance, a structural face of floor structure <b>504</b> may be considered an upper sandwich skin; and a lower OML may be considered a lower sandwich skin. In some cases, cabin and or cargo store walls may terminate lateral edges of sandwich structure and transfer their loads to airplane <b>500</b> as a whole. In some embodiments, transverse beams <b>508</b> may function as one or more of beams and/or shear webs, for instance by linking an upper sandwich skin (floor structure <b>504</b>) and lower sandwich skin (lower OML). In some cases, additional longitudinal beams <b>512</b> may transmit shear longitudinally. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is provided by way of an example, it is likely that other embodiments, will include far more transverse elements <b>508</b> and longitudinal elements <b>512</b> than shown.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, in some embodiments, structural skin may be preferably flat and without discontinuities, such as without limitations long grooves. A competing concern is conventional seat tracks that may be necessary in any practical solution for a commercial airliner. In some cases, rather than being integral to floor <b>504</b> seat tracks may be fastened to the structural floor <b>504</b> and/or longitudinal elements <b>512</b>, for instance between the floor <b>504</b> and lower OML. In some embodiments, upward protrusion of seat tracks may be &#x201c;filled in&#x201d; to provide smooth finished floor surface. In some cases, filling in seat track protrusions may be accomplished with a sandwich floor panel, as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. For example, one or more floor panels may be conventionally fastened to seat tracks or supported at one or more locations &#x201c;in the field&#x201d; so that the floor panel load is transferred to much-stronger integrated floor system <b>504</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, an exemplary blended wing aircraft <b>600</b> is illustrated. Aircraft <b>600</b> may include a blended wing body <b>604</b>. For the purposes of this disclosure, a &#x201c;blended wing body aircraft&#x201d; is an aircraft having a blended wing body. As used in this disclosure, A &#x201c;blended wing body&#x201d; (BWB), also known as a &#x201c;blended body&#x201d; or a &#x201c;hybrid wing body&#x201d; (HWB), is a fixed-wing aircraft body having no clear demarcation between wings and a main body of the aircraft at the leading edge of the wings. For example, a BWB <b>604</b> aircraft may have distinct wing and body structures, which are smoothly blended together with no clear dividing line or boundary feature between wing and fuselage. This contrasts with a flying wing, which has no distinct fuselage, and a lifting body, which has no distinct wings. A BWB <b>604</b> design may or may not be tailless. One potential advantage of a BWB <b>604</b> may be to reduce wetted area and any accompanying drag associated with a conventional wing-body junction. In some cases, a BWB <b>604</b> may also have a wide airfoil-shaped body, allowing entire aircraft to generate lift and thereby facilitate reduction in size and/or drag of wings. In some cases, a BWB <b>604</b> may be understood as a hybrid shape that resembles a flying wing, but also incorporates features from conventional aircraft. In some cases, this combination may offer several advantages over conventional tube-and-wing airframes. In some cases, a BWB airframe <b>604</b> may help to increase fuel economy and create larger payload (cargo or passenger) volumes within the BWB. In some cases, blended wing body <b>604</b> may have a maximum depth of centerbody substantially within a range of about 15 to about 35 feet. As used in this disclosure, a &#x201c;maximum depth of centerbody&#x201d; of a blended wing body is a distance from an extreme bottom of the blended wing bottom to an extreme top of the blended wing body, not including external flight components, such as without limitation landing gear and nacelles. In some cases, blended wing body <b>6</b> may have a wingspan substantially within a range of about 125 to about 225 feet. As used in this disclosure, a &#x201c;wingspan&#x201d; of a blended wing body is a distance between an extreme tip of both wings of the blended wing body. In some cases, blended wing body <b>604</b> may have a maximum length substantially within a range of about 75 to about 150 feet. As used in this disclosure, a &#x201c;maximum length&#x201d; of a blended wing body is a distance from an extreme forward position and an extreme aftward position of the blended wing body, not including external flight components, such as without limitation landing gear and nacelles.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, in some cases, blended wing body <b>604</b> may have a thickness to chord ratio configured for transonic flight. As used in this disclosure, a &#x201c;thickness to chord ratio&#x201d; a blended wing body is a function of a height of the blended wing body at a certain location divided by a length of the blended wing body at the certain location. In some cases, thickness to chord ratio may compare a maximum vertical thickness (i.e., maximum depth of centerbody) of a wing to its chord (i.e., maximum length). Thickness to chord ratio may be a key measure of performance of a wing planform or blended wing body, including at transonic speeds. As used in this disclosure, &#x201c;transonic flight&#x201d; refers to flight at a transonic speed. As used in this disclosure, &#x201c;transonic speed&#x201d; is a speed that is approaching a speed of sound and is likely to result in generation of air flows at both subsonic and supersonic speeds. For example, in some cases, transonic speed may include speeds no less than about Mach 0.5 and no more than about Mach 1.5. In some cases, transonic airspeeds see a rapid increase in drag from about Mach 0.8. As a result, in some cases fuel costs associated with drag from transonic air flow that limits airspeed. In some embodiments, swept wings may be used to reduce drag at transonic speeds. In some case, BWB <b>604</b> may be configured for one or more of subsonic speeds (e.g., no greater than about Mach 1.0), transonic speeds (e.g., between about Mach 0.5 and about Mach 1.5), and supersonic speeds (e.g., no less than Mach 0.9).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">BWB <b>604</b> may allow for advantageous interior designs. For instance, cargo can be loaded and/or passengers can board from the front or rear of the aircraft. A cargo or passenger area may be distributed across a relatively wide (when compared to conventional tube-wing aircraft) fuselage, providing a large usable volume. In some embodiments, passengers seated within an interior of aircraft, real-time video at every seat can take place of window seats. In some cases, and generally speaking, for an airline, adding one extra seat in a 100-seat transport improves revenues 1%, but costs only 0.5% in additional fuel which translates into about 0.2% in increased operating cost. This simple math explains present motivations to fit more seats in airliners. In some cases, as number of seating rows often greatly out numbers number of seats per row, narrowing seats is not a feasible strategy. For instance, in some exemplary embodiments seats would need to be narrowed about 4 inches, or about 20%, to add another seat in a row. However, in some embodiments, adding an entire row to a 22-row airplane may only cost about 1.3 inches, or about 4%, in seat pitch. Little by little this pressure has created innovative thin seats, but also less comfort.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some embodiments, one or both of passenger seat width and pitch may be varied dependent upon market needs. In some cases, nominal seat pitch may be about 34 inches. Alternatively, in some embodiments, another row may be added with a reduced seat pitch, for example a seat pitch of about 31 inches. Seat pitch range may be varied, for example within a range of about 24 inches (e.g., sub-economy on short-haul flights) to about 80 inches (e.g., first class on long-haul flights). In some cases, with reduced pitch and more rows, the added row may increase capacity about 5% to about 20% and fuel efficiency by between about 2% and about 10% per seat-mile. In some embodiments, seat width may also be varied in order to balance comfort and efficiency. Seat width may be varied for example within a range of about 15 inches (e.g., sub-economy on short-haul flights) to about 40 inches (e.g., first class on lang-haul flights).</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">BWB <b>604</b> offers new options to interior designers and configurators which may increase comfort for passengers and crew. First, sidewalls are vertical which may increase perception of space for passengers. Second, a cost of cabin width may be much less for a BWB than a cylindrical fuselage. Widening a BWB <b>604</b> center-body may not require an attendant increase in height, which is typically needed for cylindrical bodies. In some embodiments, this approximately halves costs for seat and aisle widths. For example, in some embodiments, cost of about 10% more seat width, or about 2 inches, may be less than about 0.9% in takeoff weight and cost only about 0.8% in fuel-burn. Furthermore, in some cases, increasing seat pitch may also be less expensive for a BWB <b>604</b> as reducing thickness to chord ratio generally benefits drag more than a similar reduction in a slender body aircraft's diameter to length-ratio. For example, in some embodiments, increasing seat pitch by about 10% increases takeoff weight by about 0.2% and fuel-burn by about 0.8%. In some embodiments, middle seats may have a width that is larger than non-middle seats. For example, at about 22 inches wide, a middle seat may have about 2 inches of extra width to help counter reduced private space normally experienced in the middle seat of today's airliners.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some embodiments, BWB <b>604</b> may have other noteworthy advantages. First, in some cases, average ceiling height may be higher in BWB <b>604</b> compared with a conventional jetliner. This is the case, while in some embodiments, height at a rear bulkhead may be less. Both, average ceiling height and rear bulkhead height may be a result of airfoil shaped cabin. Second, in some embodiments, overhead baggage space may be about 50% greater, in a cabin of a BWB <b>604</b>. In some cases, greater overhead baggage space may be advantageous as it may serve to reduce gate checking of bags. In some cases, gate checking may be disruptive to passenger flow and may require additional airline personnel to manage. In some embodiments, greatly reducing or even eliminating gate checking may further improve benefits of commercial air travel with an aircraft <b>600</b> having a BWB layout <b>604</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, BWB <b>604</b> of aircraft <b>600</b> may include a nose portion. A &#x201c;nose portion,&#x201d; for the purposes of this disclosure, refers to any portion of aircraft <b>600</b> forward of the aircraft's fuselage <b>616</b>. Nose portion may comprise a cockpit (for manned aircraft), canopy, aerodynamic fairings, windshield, and/or any structural elements required to support mechanical loads. Nose portion may also include pilot seats, control interfaces, gages, displays, inceptor sticks, throttle controls, collective pitch controls, and/or communication equipment, to name a few. As used in this disclosure, a &#x201c;cockpit&#x201d; is a compartment for housing at least a pilot, for instance during flight. Cockpit may include one or more pilot controls configured to interface with at least a pilot for control of at least a flight component, for example by way of a flight controller. In some cases, cockpit may be located substantially above one or more of at least a nose gear and a plane coincident with at least a portion of single deck, for example as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.

In general, carbon fiber composites consist of two parts, a matrix and a reinforcement. In carbon fiber reinforced plastic, the carbon fiber constitutes the reinforcement, which provides strength. The matrix can include a polymer resin, such as epoxy, to bind reinforcements together. Such reinforcement achieves an increase in CFRP's strength and rigidity, measured by stress and elastic modulus, respectively. In embodiments, carbon fibers themselves can each comprise a diameter between 5-10 micrometers and include a high percentage (i.e., above 85%) of carbon atoms.

A &#x201c;stringer,&#x201d; for the purposes of this disclosure is a general structural element that includes a long, thin, and rigid strip of metal or wood that is mechanically coupled to and spans the distance from, station frame to station frame to create an internal skeleton on which to mechanically couple aircraft skin. A former (or station frame) can include a rigid structural element that is disposed along a length of an interior of a fuselage orthogonal to a longitudinal (nose to tail) axis of aircraft <b>600</b>. In some cases, a former form a general shape of at least a fuselage. A former may include differing cross-sectional shapes at differing locations along a fuselage, as the former is a structural component that informs an overall shape of the fuselage. In embodiments, aircraft skin can be anchored to formers and strings such that an outer mold line of volume encapsulated by the formers and stringers comprises a same shape as aircraft <b>600</b> when installed. In other words, former(s) may form a fuselage's ribs, and stringers may form interstitials between the ribs. A spiral orientation of stringers about formers may provide uniform robustness at any point on an aircraft fuselage such that if a portion sustains damage, another portion may remain largely unaffected. Aircraft skin may be mechanically coupled to underlying stringers and formers and may interact with a fluid, such as air, to generate lift and perform maneuvers.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, according to some embodiments, a fuselage can comprise monocoque construction. Monocoque construction can include a primary structure that forms a shell (or skin in an aircraft's case) and supports physical loads. Monocoque fuselages are fuselages in which the aircraft skin or shell may also include a primary structure. In monocoque construction aircraft skin would support tensile and compressive loads within itself and true monocoque aircraft can be further characterized by an absence of internal structural elements. Aircraft skin in this construction method may be rigid and can sustain its shape with substantially no structural assistance form underlying skeleton-like elements. Monocoque fuselage may include aircraft skin made from plywood layered in varying grain directions, epoxy-impregnated fiberglass, carbon fiber, or any combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, according to some embodiments, a fuselage may include a semi-monocoque construction. Semi-monocoque construction, as used in this disclosure, is used interchangeably with partially monocoque construction, discussed above. In semi-monocoque construction, a fuselage may derive some structural support from stressed aircraft skin and some structural support from underlying frame structure made of structural components. Formers or station frames can be seen running transverse to a long axis of fuselage with circular cutouts which may be used in real-world manufacturing for weight savings and for routing of electrical harnesses and other modern on-board systems. In a semi-monocoque construction, stringers may be thin, long strips of material that run parallel to a fuselage's long axis. Stringers can be mechanically coupled to formers permanently, such as with rivets. Aircraft skin can be mechanically coupled to stringers and formers permanently, such as by rivets as well. A person of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that there are numerous methods for mechanical fastening of the aforementioned components like screws, nails, dowels, pins, anchors, adhesives like glue or epoxy, or bolts and nuts, to name a few. According to some embodiments, a subset of semi-monocoque construction may be unibody construction. Unibody, which is short for &#x201c;unitized body&#x201d; or alternatively &#x201c;unitary construction,&#x201d; vehicles are characterized by a construction in which body, floor plan, and chassis form a single structure, for example an automobile. In the aircraft world, a unibody may include internal structural elements, like formers and stringers, constructed in one piece, integral to an aircraft skin. In some cases, stringers and formers may account for a bulk of any aircraft structure (excluding monocoque construction). Stringers and formers can be arranged in a plurality of orientations depending on aircraft operation and materials. Stringers may be arranged to carry axial (tensile or compressive), shear, bending or torsion forces throughout their overall structure. Due to their coupling to aircraft skin, aerodynamic forces exerted on aircraft skin may be transferred to stringers. Location of said stringers greatly informs type of forces and loads applied to each and every stringer, all of which may be accounted for through design processes including, material selection, cross-sectional area, and mechanical coupling methods of each member. Similar methods may be performed for former assessment and design. In general, formers may be significantly larger in cross-sectional area and thickness, depending on location, than stringers. Both stringers and formers may comprise aluminum, aluminum alloys, graphite epoxy composite, steel alloys, titanium, or an undisclosed material alone or in combination.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, stressed skin, when used in semi-monocoque construction, may bear partial, yet significant, load. In other words, an internal structure, whether it be a frame of welded tubes, formers and stringers, or some combination, is not sufficiently strong enough by design to bear all loads. The concept of stressed skin is applied in monocoque and semi-monocoque construction methods of at least a fuselage and/or BWB <b>604</b>. In some cases, monocoque may be considered to include substantially only structural skin, and in that sense, aircraft skin undergoes stress by applied aerodynamic fluids imparted by fluid. Stress as used in continuum mechanics can be described in pound-force per square inch (lbf/in<sup>2</sup>) or Pascals (Pa).

A post may act similarly to stringer in that it is configured to support axial loads in compression due to a load being applied parallel to its axis due to, for example, a heavy object being placed on a floor of aircraft <b>600</b>. A beam may be disposed in or on any portion a fuselage that requires additional bracing, specifically when disposed transverse to another structural element, like a post, which would benefit from support in that direction, opposing applied force.

A force applied perpendicularly to a lever multiplied by its distance from the lever's fulcrum (the length of the lever arm) is its torque. A force of three newtons applied two meters from the fulcrum, for example, exerts the same torque as a force of one newton applied six meters from the fulcrum.

There may also be operational considerations that limit the allowable wingspan (e.g., available width at airport gates).</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Wingtip devices, in some cases, may increase lift generated at wingtip (by smoothing airflow across an upper wing near the wingtip) and reduce lift-induced drag caused by wingtip vortices, thereby improving a lift-to-drag ratio. This increases fuel efficiency in powered aircraft and increases cross-country speed in gliders, in both cases increasing range. U.S. Air Force studies indicate that a given improvement in fuel efficiency correlates directly and causally with increase in an aircraft's lift-to-drag ratio. The term &#x201c;winglet&#x201d; has previously been used to describe an additional lifting surface on an aircraft, like a short section between wheels on fixed undercarriage. An upward angle (i.e., cant) of a winglet, its inward or outward angle (i.e., toe), as well as its size and shape are selectable design parameters which may be chosen for correct performance in a given application. A wingtip vortex, which rotates around from below a wing, strikes a cambered surface of a winglet, generating a force that angles inward and slightly forward. A winglet's relation to a wingtip vortex may be considered analogous to sailboat sails when sailing to windward (i.e., close-hauled). Similar to the close-hauled sailboat's sails, winglets may convert some of what would otherwise-be wasted energy in a wingtip vortex to an apparent thrust. This small contribution can be worthwhile over the aircraft's lifetime. Another potential benefit of winglets is that they may reduce an intensity of wake vortices. Wake vortices may trail behind an aircraft <b>600</b> and pose a hazard to other aircraft. Minimum spacing requirements between aircraft at airports are largely dictated by hazards, like those from wake vortices. Aircraft are classified by weight (e.g., &#x201c;Light,&#x201d; &#x201c;Heavy,&#x201d; and the like) often base upon vortex strength, which grows with an aircraft's lift coefficient. Thus, associated turbulence is greatest at low speed and high weight, which may be produced at high angle of attack near airports. Winglets and wingtip fences may also increase efficiency by reducing vortex interference with laminar airflow near wingtips, by moving a confluence of low-pressure air (over wing) and high-pressure air (under wing) away from a surface of the wing. Wingtip vortices create turbulence, which may originate at a leading edge of a wingtip and propagate backwards and inboard. This turbulence may delaminate airflow over a small triangular section of an outboard wing, thereby frustrating lift in that area. A fence/winglet drives an area where a vortex forms upward away from a wing surface, as the resulting vortex is repositioned to a top tip of the winglet.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, aircraft <b>600</b> may include an energy source.

Presently Jet-A powers modern commercial airliners and is a mix of extremely refined kerosene and burns at temperatures at or above 49&#xb0; C. (120&#xb0; F.). Kerosene-based fuel has a much higher flash point than gasoline-based fuel, meaning that it requires significantly higher temperature to ignite.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, modular aircraft <b>600</b> may include an energy source which may include a fuel cell. As used in this disclosure, a &#x201c;fuel cell&#x201d; is an electrochemical device that combines a fuel and an oxidizing agent to create electricity. In some cases, fuel cells are different from most batteries in requiring a continuous source of fuel and oxygen (usually from air) to sustain the chemical reaction, whereas in a battery the chemical energy comes from metals and their ions or oxides that are commonly already present in the battery, except in flow batteries. Fuel cells can produce electricity continuously for as long as fuel and oxygen are supplied.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, in some embodiments, fuel cells may consist of different types. Commonly a fuel cell consists of an anode, a cathode, and an electrolyte that allows ions, often positively charged hydrogen ions (protons), to move between two sides of the fuel cell. At anode, a catalyst causes fuel to undergo oxidation reactions that generate ions (often positively charged hydrogen ions) and electrons. Ions move from anode to cathode through electrolyte. Concurrently, electrons may flow from anode to cathode through an external circuit, producing direct current electricity. At cathode, another catalyst causes ions, electrons, and oxygen to react, forming water and possibly other products. Fuel cells may be classified by type of electrolyte used and by difference in startup time ranging from 6 second for proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEM fuel cells, or PEMFC) to 10 minutes for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC). In some cases, energy source may include a related technology, such as flow batteries. Within a flow battery fuel can be regenerated by recharging. Individual fuel cells produce relatively small electrical potentials, about 0.7 volts. Therefore, in some cases, fuel cells may be &#x201c;stacked&#x201d;, or placed in series, to create sufficient voltage to meet an application's requirements. In addition to electricity, fuel cells may produce water, heat and, depending on the fuel source, very small amounts of nitrogen dioxide and other emissions. Energy efficiency of a fuel cell is generally between 40 and 90%.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Fuel cell may include an electrolyte. In some cases, electrolyte may define a type of fuel cell.

Connecting batteries in series may increase the voltage of an energy source which may provide more power on demand. High voltage batteries may require cell matching when high peak load is needed. As more cells are connected in strings, there may exist the possibility of one cell failing which may increase resistance in the module and reduce the overall power output as the voltage of the module may decrease as a result of that failing cell. Connecting batteries in parallel may increase total current capacity by decreasing total resistance, and it also may increase overall amp-hour capacity.

At least a flight component <b>608</b> may be fueled by any fuel described in this disclosure, for instance without limitation Jet-A, Jet-B, diesel fuel, gasoline, or the like. In nonlimiting embodiments, a jet engine is a type of reaction engine discharging a fast-moving jet that generates thrust by jet propulsion. While this broad definition can include rocket, water jet, and hybrid propulsion, the term jet engine, in some cases, refers to an internal combustion airbreathing jet engine such as a turbojet, turbofan, ramjet, or pulse jet. In general, jet engines are internal combustion engines. As used in this disclosure, a &#x201c;combustion engine&#x201d; is a mechanical device that is configured to convert mechanical work from heat produced by combustion of a fuel.

Exemplary internal combustion engines may without limitation a reciprocating engine (e.g., 4-stroke engine), a combustion turbine engine (e.g., jet engines, gas turbines, Brayton cycle engines, and the like), a rotary engine (e.g., Wankel engines), and the like. In nonlimiting embodiments, airbreathing jet engines feature a rotating air compressor powered by a turbine, with leftover power providing thrust through a propelling nozzle&#x2014;this process may be known as a Brayton thermodynamic cycle. Jet aircraft may use such engines for long-distance travel. Early jet aircraft used turbojet engines that were relatively inefficient for subsonic flight. Most modern subsonic jet aircraft use more complex high-bypass turbofan engines. In some cases, they give higher speed and greater fuel efficiency than piston and propeller aeroengines over long distances. A few air-breathing engines made for highspeed applications (ramjets and scramjets) may use a ram effect of aircraft's speed instead of a mechanical compressor. An airbreathing jet engine (or ducted jet engine) may emit a jet of hot exhaust gases formed from air that is forced into the engine by several stages of centrifugal, axial or ram compression, which is then heated and expanded through a nozzle. In some cases, a majority of mass flow through an airbreathing jet engine may be provided by air taken from outside of the engine and heated internally, using energy stored in the form of fuel. In some cases, a jet engine may include are turbofans. Alternatively and/or additionally, jet engine may include a turbojet. In some cases, a turbofan may use a gas turbine engine core with high overall pressure ratio (e.g., 40:1) and high turbine entry temperature (e.g., about 1800 K) and provide thrust with a turbine-powered fan stage. In some cases, thrust may also be at least partially provided by way of pure exhaust thrust (as in a turbojet engine). In some cases, a turbofan may have a high efficiency, relative to a turbojet. In some cases, a jet engine may use simple ram effect (e.g., ramjet) or pulse combustion (e.g., pulsej et) to give compression.
