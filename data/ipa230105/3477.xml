The firearm silencers known in the art have various baffles and intermediate spacers that attempt to decrease the noise level created by the firearm when firing a bullet. These silencers are heavy, use lots of different types of parts and/or are difficult to assemble thereby making them expensive to manufacture and quite costly for ultimate consumers, in addition, many prior art silencers do not significantly reduce muzzle flash and/or recoil generated by the firearm when firing the bullet. Therefore, a need exists for a way to reduce noise levels, flash and/or recoil when firing a firearm.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention"
