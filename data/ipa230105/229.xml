It applies in particular, but in a non-limiting manner, to makeup of the eyeshadow/shadow, gloss, balm, blush, foundation or face powder type.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">There are many types of receptacles for a cosmetic product(s), in particular for containing and transporting makeup. In the more specific field of containers of the &#x201c;pocket housing&#x201d; type including a base, a mirror-bearing lid which is articulated on the base, and a hinge, the user generally wears makeup either in front of the mirror of the housing, or in front of an additional mirror.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, very often, in the first case of use mentioned above, the mirror of the housing is either too small, or poorly adapted because the housing must be held with one hand, at an ideal distance from the face, to look at oneself in the mirror and use the other hand to use the makeup tool with the cosmetic products. It requires skill and multiple changes of hand, face or housing position. It is possible to place the open housing on a support (table, bathroom plan, etc.) to avoid holding it, but the height of said support is not always adapted and the makeup tool still have to be used to apply the cosmetic products, which requires holding the housing with one hand, the makeup tool with the other, and therefore potentially changing the position and the inclination of the mirror with respect to the face.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In both cases, the use is impractical, with the risk of dropping the housing, messing up one's makeup or wasting time.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Consequently, there is currently no solution to this problem of having a portable housing while being able to be easily placed in front of a mirror to apply makeup. It is therefore necessary to design a housing with a spacer plate which takes account of these constraints.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">OBJECT AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention aims at overcoming these disadvantages with a totally innovative approach and a solution that is simple to manufacture, practical to use and takes up little space.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">To this end, according to a first aspect, the present invention relates to a housing for a cosmetic product(s) in the form of pallet(s) which may, for example, contain a solid, waxy or pasty formula, including at least:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0008">a base including a bottom and side walls delimiting at least one casing receiving a pallet of cosmetic product,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0009">a mirror-bearing lid which is articulated with respect to the base by means of a hinge around a pivot pin to take at least a first open position for access to the pallet of cosmetic product and a second engagement position with the base to close said housing,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0010">a spacer plate connected to the base and including at least one through-opening passing through the thickness thereof so as to form a compartment directly surrounding the pallet of cosmetic product in order to maintain the latter between said plate and the bottom of the base,</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0009" num="0011">characterized in that said hinge includes a first upper pivot that is as one with the mirror-bearing lid, a pivot pin for the hinge, and a second lower pivot that is connected to the spacer plate so as to form the hinge, said pivots being respectively provided with means for removable connection with one another in such a way that the mirror-bearing lid can be detached from the base and can be repositioned thereon as desired.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0012">The invention is implemented according to the embodiments and variants set out below, which are to be considered individually or according to any technically effective combination.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0013">According to a complementary aspect, the second lower pivot of the hinge is integral with the spacer plate.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0014">In a variant embodiment, the second lower pivot of the hinge is completely independent of the spacer plate and can be detached therefrom. Advantageously, the pivot pin for the hinge is formed by a curved portion of the first upper pivot.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0015">According to a variant embodiment, the pivot pin for the hinge is formed by an intermediate rotation rod received in said second lower pivot.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0016">Preferably, the intermediate rotation rod is integral with the first upper pivot of the hinge.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0017">According to a variant embodiment, the intermediate rotation rod is completely independent of the first upper pivot of the hinge.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0018">According to another aspect of the present invention, the means for removable connection between the intermediate rotation rod and the second lower pivot of the hinge are constituted by protrusions cooperating with two recesses.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0019">Preferably, the second lower pivot of the hinge includes a transverse flat main blade extending parallel to the pivot pin, said blade being provided with two internal lateral tabs erected normally and internally carrying said protrusions, which face each other to receive the end recesses of the intermediate rotation rod or the ends of the curved portion of the first pivot.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0020">According to a specific embodiment, the main transverse blade of the second lower pivot of the hinge also includes two external lateral tabs for its connection with the spacer plate, said external lateral tabs being erected parallel to the internal lateral tabs and forming therewith two pairs of &#x201c;U&#x201d; disposed respectively at each of the opposite longitudinal ends of the main blade.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0021">Preferably, the spacer plate includes a rear strip provided with third parallel tabs provided with recesses cooperating with protrusions projecting outwardly from the second lateral tabs of the second lower pivot of the hinge. According to a particularly advantageous feature, the main transverse blade of the second lower pivot of the hinge includes an elastically deformable curved secondary strip permanently bearing on the first upper pivot of the hinge to form a brake on the articulation of the lid on the base and maintain its angular position.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0022">Preferably, the spacer plate is articulated on the base by means of the second lower pivot.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0023">Other advantages, purposes and features of the present invention emerge from the description which follows given, for an explicative and a non-limiting purpose, with regard to the appended drawings, wherein:</p><p id="p-0022" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of a housing in accordance with the present invention in a closed position,</p><p id="p-0023" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a view similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> but wherein the housing is in an open position,</p><p id="p-0024" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is an exploded perspective view of the housing of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>,</p><p id="p-0025" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a side perspective view of the housing of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>,</p><p id="p-0026" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is an enlarged perspective view showing elements belonging to the hinge of the housing of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>4</b></figref>,</p><p id="p-0027" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a detail perspective view of a first pivot of the hinge,</p><p id="p-0028" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is an enlarged perspective view of a second pivot of the hinge,</p><p id="p-0029" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a perspective view of an enlarged detail of a removable attachment means of the hinge,</p><p id="p-0030" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is another enlarged perspective detail view of the second pivot of the hinge and a portion of the housing,</p><p id="p-0031" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is another enlarged perspective detail view of the second pivot of the hinge,</p><p id="p-0032" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a perspective detail view of a third element of the hinge,</p><p id="p-0033" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a bottom perspective view of an alternative embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>4</b></figref>, and</p><p id="p-0034" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a detail view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0035" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>11</b></figref> show a first embodiment of a housing <b>1</b> for cosmetic products, for example of the pebble type, in accordance with the present invention, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b> and <b>13</b></figref> illustrating a considered variant.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0038">This housing <b>1</b> is mainly or even entirely made of recyclable metal, for example aluminum, and has the shape of a (square or rectangular) parallelepiped, of dimensions adapted to be able to be held in one hand, with a total thickness of a few millimeters to about 1 centimeter.
