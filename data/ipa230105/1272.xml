More specifically, the present invention relates to a golf club head comprising a novel polymeric material that coats at least a portion of a rear surface of the striking face, which improves the sound of the club head without significantly reducing the golf club head's ball speed or coefficient of restitution.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Golf club heads, and particularly iron-type golf club heads, often include polymeric materials disposed behind the striking face to improve or dampen the sound of the head upon impact with a golf ball. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,492,327 discloses an iron with a damping material in a recess, U.S. Pat. No. 6,743,117 discloses a dampening insert behind a strike face insert in an iron, and U.S. Pat. No. 9,168,437 discloses an elastomeric insert attached to the back of the striking face of an iron. Unfortunately, while a polymer fill or insert can improve the sound of the golf club in which it is disposed, this configuration reduces ballspeed off the face, as well as the coefficient of restitution (COR) of the golf club head. This occurs because polymers such as urethane are rigid, with a Poisson's ratio of around 0.5, and when a polymer fills a cavity or space, the polymer prevents the golf club face from flexing. Therefore, there is a need for a golf club head comprising an improved damping material that also preserves, or otherwise optimizes, ballspeed and COR values.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The golf club head comprises a novel material comprising microscopic bubbles (also referred to as hollow beads) made from a strong, lightweight, low-density material such as glass, ceramic, and/or plastic, mixed with a polymeric material, preferably urethane or silicone, at least partially coating a rear surface of a variable thickness striking face. The presence of the microscopic bubbles in the polymeric material prevents the COR of the golf club head from decreasing by more than 0.10, and more preferably by more than 0.05, when compared with a golf club head having all of the same features and characteristics but which lacks a polymeric fill material completely. The fill material is preferably injection molded onto a back surface of the golf club face to fill variable thickness topography and level the rear surface of the golf club face to allow for the attachment of one or more medallions.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">One aspect of the present invention is a golf club head comprising a body comprising a striking face, a sole portion, a top portion, a rear portion, and a cavity, and a fill material comprising a first material and a plurality of microscopic bubbles composed of a second material, wherein the second material is different from the first material, wherein the striking face comprises a nonplanar rear surface, wherein the fill material covers at least a portion of the nonplanar rear surface to create a flat plane, and wherein the plurality of microscopic bubbles constitutes 5% to 70% of a volume of the fill material. In some embodiments, the golf club head further comprises a medallion and an adhesive material, and the medallion is affixed to the flat plane with the adhesive material. In a further embodiment, the medallion may comprise or be composed of the fill material.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In yet another embodiment, the golf club head of claim may further comprise a weight, which may be disposed within the cavity. In a further embodiment, the weight may comprise a tungsten alloy. In a further embodiment, the weight may be at least partially enveloped in a urethane material to form a covered weight, which itself may be at least partially or completely enveloped in the fill material. In an alternative embodiment, a combination of the weight and the fill material may completely fill the cavity. In other embodiments, the golf club head may be an iron-type golf club head, each of the plurality of microscopic bubbles may have a diameter of approximately 18-50 microns, and the first material may have a Poisson's ratio of 0.00-0.50. In still other embodiments, the second material (from which the microscopic bubbles are made) may be selected from the group consisting of glass, ceramic, and plastic.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another aspect of the present invention is a method comprising the steps of providing a golf club head comprising a variable thickness face component with a striking surface and a rear surface, wherein at least a portion of the rear surface is nonplanar, providing a fill material comprising a polymer material and a plurality of microscopic bubbles composed of a low-density material, providing a medallion sized to cover at least a portion of the rear surface, injecting the fill material onto the rear surface to create a flat surface, and affixing the medallion to the flat surface.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a further embodiment, the method may comprise the step orienting the face component so that the striking surface is parallel with the ground plane, which step may occur prior to the step of injecting the fill material onto the rear surface to create a flat surface. In yet another embodiment, the step of providing a golf club head may comprise the step of casting the variable thickness face component from a metal alloy material. In yet another embodiment, the plurality of microscopic bubbles may constitute 25-30% of the volume of the fill material, and each of the plurality of microscopic bubbles may have a diameter of approximately 18-50 microns.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another embodiment, the method may further comprise the step of inserting a weight with a density greater than 4 g/cc into a cavity of the golf club head. In a further embodiment, the method may comprise the step of injection-molding the fill material into the cavity and around at least a portion of the weight.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another aspect, a golf club putter head is provided and includes a body comprising a striking face and a rear portion, where the striking face includes a cavity, an insert made up of a polymer and a plurality of microspheres distributed within the polymer, where the insert is affixed to the body in the cavity of the striking face.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In an embodiment of the golf club putter head aspect, the polymer is cast urethane.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another embodiment of the golf club putter head aspect, the plurality of microspheres are ceramic microspheres.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In another embodiment of the golf club putter head aspect, the plurality of microspheres are selected from the group consisting of W-210, W-410 and W-610.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In another embodiment of the golf club putter head aspect, the plurality of microspheres are glass microspheres.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In another embodiment of the golf club putter head aspect,

description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0008" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The present invention is directed to golf club heads, particularly including both iron-type and putter-type golf club heads, which include a novel fill material comprising a polymeric material and a plurality of microscopic bubbles made of glass, ceramic, and/or plastic, also referred to herein as microscopic, hollow beads. The microscopic bubbles serve two purposes when incorporated with a polymeric material: (1) they lighten the overall fill weight by replacing elastomer with air, thus lowering the material's specific gravity; and (2) they increase the porosity of the fill material, allowing for the formation of micro-holes in the polymeric material. The micro-holes are little air pockets that allow the polymer to flex when the club head impacts a golf ball, thus increasing the COR of the head while at the same time maintaining the sound improvement provided by the polymer itself, such as reduction in dB level and duration. The polymeric material preferably is an elastomer such as polyurethane or silicone having a Poisson's ratio of 0.00-0.50, and more preferably 0.40-0.50, and the microscopic bubbles preferably are measured in D50 micron, which is the median particle size for a measured sample, each microscopic bubble having a diameter of approximately 18-50 microns.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">A first embodiment of the golf club head is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>. In this embodiment, the golf club head <b>10</b> is a cavity back iron having a face cup <b>20</b>, a body <b>30</b>, and a cavity <b>40</b> between the body and the striking portion <b>22</b> of the face cup. The cavity <b>40</b> is completely filled with the microscopic bubble fill material <b>50</b>, which does not extend into the upper cavity portion <b>32</b> of the body <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In an alternative embodiment, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the golf club head <b>10</b> is a closed cavity back iron with a hollow interior <b>15</b>, which is completely filled with the microscopic bubble fill material <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In yet another embodiment, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the golf club head <b>10</b> has an open cavity back <b>35</b> with a medallion <b>60</b> molded or otherwise formed from the microscopic bubble fill material <b>50</b> affixed to a rear surface <b>23</b> of the striking portion <b>22</b>. When the microscopic bubble fill material <b>50</b> is incorporated into a medallion <b>60</b>, it is preferably placed onto a back side of an electroformed medallion and permitted to cure, and then an adhesive is placed on the fill material <b>50</b> and used to bond the medallion <b>60</b> onto the club head <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In each of the embodiments disclosed herein, the microscopic bubbles in the novel fill material <b>50</b> preferably constitute 5% to 70% by volume of the fill material <b>50</b>, more preferably at least 20% of the volume, and most preferably approximately 25-30% of the fill material's 50 volume.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">There are several methods of manufacturing the microscopic bubble fill material <b>50</b> and incorporating it into the golf club head <b>10</b> according to the present invention. The first method <b>100</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, comprises the steps of providing an elastomer material <b>110</b> such as polyurethane, providing microscopic bubbles <b>120</b>, combining the microscopic bubbles with the elastomer material <b>130</b> so that the microscopic bubbles form 5-70% of the volume of the resulting mixture, and more preferably approximately 25-30% of the volume of the resulting material, injecting the resulting mixture into a cavity <b>40</b> or hollow interior <b>15</b> of the golf club head, or a mold for a medallion <b>140</b>, and then oven curing the mixture or otherwise allowing it to cure <b>150</b> (e.g., at air temperature for self-curing materials).</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The second, preferred method <b>200</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, comprises the steps of providing a pre-polymer resin (Part A) <b>210</b> such as a polyurethane or silicone, providing a curing or catalyst agent (Part B) <b>220</b>, and providing the microscopic bubbles <b>230</b>, combining the curing or catalyst agent (Part B) with the microscopic bubbles to form an intermediary material (Part C) <b>240</b> that is 5-70% by volume of microscopic bubbles, and more preferably 25-30% by volume, combining the intermediary material (Part C) with the polymer resin (Part A) <b>250</b>, preferably in a 1:1 Part A to Part B ratio, to form a final mixture, injecting the final mixture into a cavity <b>40</b> or hollow interior <b>15</b> of the golf club head, or a mold for a medallion <b>260</b>, and then oven curing the mixture or otherwise allowing it to cure <b>270</b>. The benefit of this method <b>200</b> is that the intermediary material (Part C) can be prepared and placed into storage until a manufacturer is ready to catalyze the pre-polymer resin.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The third method of the present invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. This method <b>300</b> comprises the steps of providing a pre-polymer resin (Part A) <b>310</b> (preferably polyurethane or silicone), providing a curing or catalyst agent (Part B) <b>320</b>, and providing the microscopic bubbles <b>330</b>, combining the polymer resin (Part A) with the curing or catalyst agent (Part B) <b>340</b>, preferably in a 1:1 Part A to Part B ratio, to form an intermediary material, combining the intermediary material with microscopic bubbles <b>350</b> so that the microscopic bubbles are 5-70% of the volume of the resulting material, and more preferably 25-30% of the volume, injecting the resulting material into a cavity <b>40</b> or hollow interior <b>15</b> of the golf club head, or a mold for a medallion <b>360</b>, and then oven curing the mixture or otherwise allowing it to cure <b>370</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In order to assess the COR performance of the inventive material, test iron-type golf club heads <b>10</b> having unfilled (empty) cavities were created and tested, and compared against golf club heads <b>10</b> having the same construction and filled with (1) the novel microscopic bubble fill material <b>50</b> comprising polyurethane and glass bubbles and made using one of the second <b>200</b> and third methods <b>300</b> and (2) polyurethane only. As shown in Tables 1 and 2, the polyurethane-only fill significantly lowers the COR of the golf club head <b>10</b>. In contrast, when a golf club head cavity is filled with the microscopic bubble fill material <b>50</b> (glass) of the present invention, the COR decreases, on average, only by 0.04, thereby retaining the performance benefits of an unfilled golf club head <b>10</b>. This is particularly evident when the microscopic bubbles or hollow microscopic beads constitute approximately 25% or 30% of the volume of the fill material <b>50</b>, as shown in Table 1.</p><p

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref>, the 30% by volume microscopic bubble fill material <b>50</b> improves the pitch and amplitude of the golf club head <b>10</b> upon impact with a golf ball compared to a polyurethane-only fill, thereby improving the overall sound of the golf club head <b>10</b>. Preferably, a golf club head <b>10</b> incorporating the novel fill material has a pitch upon impact with a golf ball of 3000-6000 Hz, and more preferably of 4500-6000 Hz, an amplitude of 90-100 dB, and a duration of 1.0-2.5 ms.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0081">To assess the effects of the novel fill material on ball speed performance, the performance of a Callaway Golf Apex CF <b>16</b> 6-iron comprising a small polymeric snubber was compared with the performance of test 6-irons having no fill, test 6-irons with a fill having 30% by volume microscopic bubbles (glass material), and test 6-irons with a fill having 20% by volume microscopic bubbles (glass material). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> and <b>11</b></figref>, the test irons comprising the novel, microscopic bubble fill had a higher median ball speed measured at both the center and low center of the striking face compared with the Apex CF <b>16</b> 6-iron, and approached or surpassed the ball speed of test clubs lacking a fill material.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0082">In yet another embodiment of the present invention, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b> and <b>13</b></figref>, the golf club head <b>10</b> has many of the same features as the embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>, except that the cavity <b>40</b> extends further into a rear portion <b>35</b> of the body <b>30</b> of the golf club head <b>10</b>, and the golf club head <b>10</b> includes a weight <b>70</b> sized to fit within at least a portion of the cavity <b>40</b>. The weight <b>70</b>, which preferably is composed of a metal alloy material having a density of 4 g/cc or greater, such as steel or tungsten alloy, is over-molded with the novel fill material <b>50</b> of the present invention, which preferably completely envelops the weight <b>70</b> and at least partially fills the cavity <b>40</b> of the golf club head <b>10</b>. This embodiment serves to move mass downwards and towards the striking portion <b>22</b> of the face cup <b>20</b> without compromising the COR of the golf club head <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0083">The embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>-<b>13</b></figref> can be achieved via several methods. A first method <b>400</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, comprises the steps of providing a golf club head comprising a body having a cavity <b>410</b>, providing a metal weight <b>420</b>, providing a fill material <b>50</b> comprising a polymer material and a plurality of microscopic bubbles composed of a low-density material <b>430</b>, injection-molding the fill material onto the metal weight to create a co-molded weight <b>440</b>, and inserting the co-molded weight into the cavity <b>450</b>. An alternative method <b>500</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, comprises the steps of providing a golf club head comprising a body having a cavity <b>510</b>, providing a metal weight <b>520</b>, providing a fill material <b>50</b> comprising a polymer material and a plurality of microscopic bubbles composed of a low-density material <b>530</b>, inserting the metal weight into the cavity <b>540</b>, and injection-molding the fill material into the cavity and around at least a portion of the metal weight <b>550</b>. Each of these methods produces a golf club head having a low center of gravity and an optimized COR.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0084">In a preferred embodiment, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b>-<b>17</b></figref>, the face portion <b>26</b> of the face cup <b>20</b> has a variable thickness, with the striking portion <b>22</b> being planar and the rear surface <b>23</b> having a topography reflecting the variable thickness pattern. The variable thickness pattern improves the striking performance of the face cup <b>20</b>, but complicates the process of adding a medallion <b>60</b> to the rear surface <b>23</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b> and <b>17</b></figref>, the golf club head <b>10</b> comprises a thin layer of the fill material <b>50</b> coating the rear surface <b>23</b>, which creates a flat or planar surface <b>80</b>.

In this orientation, the fill material <b>50</b> free flows onto the rear surface <b>23</b> and becomes self-leveling until the fill material <b>50</b> reaches its gel state.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0086">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, an exemplar golf club putter head <b>1000</b> is shown. The golf club putter head <b>1000</b> illustrated is exemplary, and it will be understood that putter heads come in many different shapes, sizes and configurations. The golf club putter head <b>1000</b> includes a body <b>1002</b> with a striking face <b>1004</b> and a rear portion <b>1006</b>. The striking face <b>1004</b> includes a cavity (not shown) into which is affixed a putter insert <b>1008</b>.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0087">Putters have used face inserts for many years to provide an enhanced feel after striking the golf ball. Putter inserts can be made from many different types of materials, depending on the &#x201c;feel&#x201d; that a player desires, and the intended cost of the putter. When an putter insert is comprised of a softer material than the metal body of the putter head, the softer material provides more compression between the ball and the club than would be possible with a metal striking face, thus giving the player a softer &#x201c;feel&#x201d; and in many cases, more control over the golf shot. Two main methods of producing plastic face inserts exist in the marketplace, specifically injection molding and casting. An advantage of using a cast urethane material to create a putter face insert is that no hard mold tooling is required. Instead, many unique shapes can be cut out of a sheet of cast urethane by using cutting tools such as wire cutting devices, laser cutting machines or waterjet cutting machines. Further, this approach enables a manufacturer to more easily achieve a desired fit of the insert in the striking face cavity of the putter head.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0088">A cast urethane putter insert has been used in certain of the Odyssey&#xae; series of putters by Applicant for many years, and this cast urethane putter insert is desired by consumers for its iconic &#x201c;feel&#x201d;. This &#x201c;feel&#x201d; is achieved by the material hardness, bounce back of the plastic and the thickness of the putter insert.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0089">Embodiments disclosed herein improve on a major shortcoming of the current casting process for a urethane putter insert by adding microspheres (either one type, or multiple types) to the urethane, to provide more favorable feel, sound, or/and performance. The microsphere compounds of both solid and hollow glass and ceramics can help reduce the volume of urethane needed within face insert to reduce material cost while maintaining or even enhancing feel, sound and/or performance.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0090">The compression of ceramics when compared to plastic is significantly less and this difference in material composition will help improve the rigidity of the putter insert without changing the hardness of the physical urethane. The benefit of this could be that the player &#x201c;feels&#x201d; the same stroke as a conventional cast urethane putter insert, but for example, because of ceramic microspheres, the insert would have a more rigid surface resulting in improvement to ball speed.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0091">In accordance the disclosure herein, the putter insert <b>1008</b> is a cured polymer with some quantity of microspheres distributed in the cured polymer. It is believed by the Applicants that this composition of putter insert, including but not limited to the embodiments disclosed herein, can provide further advantages with respect to &#x201c;feel&#x201d;, ball control, ball speed, sound, and performance, while reducing cost of materials and manufacture over other putter insert compositions. In one embodiment of the golf club putter head, the polymer is cast urethane. The microspheres may be many different types of microspheres, depending upon the effect desired. Some exemplary types of microspheres include glass, hollow glass, ceramic, and plastic. For example, ceramic microspheres referred to herein may include products made and sold by the 3M company, such as microspheres identified as W-210, W-410 and W-610. In another example, glass microspheres referred to herein may include products made and sold by the 3M company, such as microspheres identified as K, S, iM, XLD, Floated series and HGS Series.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0092">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>, in one embodiment, the microspheres <b>900</b> are uniformly distributed within the cured polymer <b>902</b>, and thus are uniformly distributed throughout the putter insert <b>904</b>.

In certain embodiments, microspheres that have a higher specific gravity than the liquid polymer will &#x201c;sink&#x201d; in the liquid polymer prior to curing. For example, solid ceramic microspheres generally have a higher specific gravity than liquid urethane, thus they will migrate downward over time due to the force of gravity if the urethane is left in liquid form for a period of time prior to curing. This difference in specific gravity may be utilized to control the distribution of microspheres in the finished cured putter insert, as desired. Likewise, microspheres that have a lower specific gravity than the polymer will tend to rise upward in the liquid polymer prior to curing. For example, hollow glass microspheres generally have a lower specific gravity than liquid urethane, thus they will migrate upward over time if the urethan is left in liquid form for a period of time prior to curing.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0103">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b></figref>, manufacture of the golf club putter head insert includes the steps of: (a) mixing a plurality of microspheres into a first quantity of polymer to produce a liquid polymer&#x2014;microsphere mix; then (b) pouring the liquid polymer&#x2014;microsphere mix into a mold; (c) selecting a wait time; (d) selecting a first cure time; then (e) after the pouring step is completed, waiting for the wait time, such that a first quantity of the plurality of microspheres migrate from a first interior portion of the mold to a second interior portion of the mold, such that the concentration of microspheres in the first interior portion of the mold is less than the concentration of microspheres in the second interior portion of the mold, then (f) after the wait time is completed, applying heat to the mold for the first cure time, so as to cure the liquid polymer&#x2014;microsphere mix into a solid insert blank; then (g) removing the solid insert blank from the mold; and (h) cutting the solid insert blank into a selected shape so as to form a finished putter insert.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0104">In another embodiment of the method of making a putter insert, the method can include the additional steps of: (i) selecting a mold-orientation angle with respect to the ground; and (j) positioning the mold at the selected mold-orientation angle, so as to use gravity to control the direction of the migration of the first quantity of the plurality of microspheres from a first interior portion of the mold to a second interior portion of the mold, by positioning the first interior portion of the mold and the second interior portion of the mold with respect to the ground.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0105">It may also be advantageous to form the putter insert using two or more separate polymer castings, in order to ensure that one of the castings&#x2014;and therefore one of the layers or regions of the putter insert&#x2014;is entirely free of microspheres, or contains a particularly advantageous type of microspheres, or contains a particularly advantageous density of microspheres.
