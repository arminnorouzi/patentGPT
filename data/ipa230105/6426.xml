The ignition plug includes an insulator that supports a center electrode and a metal fitting (i.e. housing) that supports the insulator from outside thereof. The metal fitting is fastened and fixed to the internal combustion engine. A connection part is provided on a side surface of the metal fitting, which allows a tool such as a plug wrench to be engaged thereto when the ignition plug is attached to the internal combustion engine.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Japanese Patent No. 3502936 discloses an ignition plug having an annular space positioned between the outer peripheral surface of the insulator and the inner peripheral surface of the metal fitting inside the above-mentioned connection part. A talc material which is powdered talcum is filled into the annular space. The talc material is utilized to enhance anti-shock properties of the ignition plug while the internal combustion engine is operating and to prevent the gas from the internal combustion engine from leaking to the outside. In the annular space, annular-shaped members are provided at both portions along a center axis of the ignition plug to support the talc material in the annular space.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the manufacturing of the ignition plug, the metal fitting is fastened to the insulator in a state where the talc material and a pair of annular members are accommodated in the annular space. At this moment, the talc material thereinside is compressed. The metal fitting receives force from the compressed talc material in a direction expanding outward.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In recent years, the ignition coil is required to be smaller because of space restriction in the vicinity of the internal combustion engine due to arrangement of the components. Hence, a two-face width in the connection part, that is, the width between two faces which face each other in the connection part, becomes smaller compared to that of conventional art. In the case where the two-face width is small, since the thickness of the connection part becomes small, the metal fitting is likely to be deformed due to the force of the talc material.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the case where the connection part of the metal fitting is deformed, it may be difficult to engage with a tool when attaching the ignition plug to the internal combustion engine. Further, deformation of the metal fitting lowers the sealing performance of the talc material, which may cause external leaking of the gas from the internal combustion engine through the talc material.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The above-mentioned patent literature, Japanese Patent No. 3502936, discloses that dimension such as length and thickness of the annular space where the talc material is filled is defined so as to suppress deformation of the metal fitting due to the force applied from the talc material. However, according to a result of experiment conducted by the inventers of the present disclosure, it is found that it is difficult to sufficiently prevent deformation of the metal fitting using only the configuration disclosed in the above-described patent literature.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The inventors of the present disclosure have found a fact that the annular member to which force is applied by the talc material applies force to the metal fitting to be expanded outward depending on the shape of the insulator, whereby the metal fitting is further deformed. In this regard, the above-described patent literature does not suggest or mention suppressing of the deformation of the metal fitting caused by the force transmitted through the annular member.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">With reference to the drawings, the present embodiment will be described. In order to facilitate understanding, for the same constituents in each drawings, the same reference numbers are applied as much as possible and duplicated explanation will be omitted.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a configuration of an ignition plug according to the present embodiment will be described. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the ignition plug <b>10</b> is illustrated in which a cross section sectioned along a surface including a center axis CX described later is shown on the left side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. For a center electrode <b>30</b> and a terminal fitting <b>40</b> among components that constitute the ignition plug <b>10</b>, each outline is shown without showing a cross section.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The ignition plug <b>10</b> is provided at each cylinder in the internal combustion engine which is not shown, and ignites air-fuel mixture in the combustion chamber of each cylinder. The ignition plug <b>10</b> is provided with an insulator <b>20</b>, a center electrode <b>30</b>, a terminal fitting <b>40</b>, a metal fitting <b>50</b> and a ground electrode <b>60</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The insulator <b>20</b> is a cylindrical member formed of an insulation material such as alumina. In the insulator <b>20</b>, a shaft hole <b>200</b> is formed. The shaft hole <b>200</b> is configured as a through hole penetrating through the insulator <b>20</b> along the center axis thereof. The center axis of the shaft hole <b>200</b> corresponds to the center axis of the insulator <b>20</b>. Hereinafter, the center axis of the shaft hole <b>200</b> is also referred to as center axis CX. When the insulator <b>20</b> is sectioned along a line perpendicular to the center axis CX, a cross sectional shape of the shaft hole <b>200</b> is circular shape.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The center electrode <b>30</b> is made of metal and supported by the insulator <b>20</b> at an one end portion along the center axis CX (end portion in the lower side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) of the shaft hole <b>200</b>. The center electrode <b>30</b> is a stick-shaped member and the most part thereof is arranged inside the shaft hole <b>200</b>. A part of the center electrode <b>30</b> protrudes outside the insulator <b>20</b> from the shaft hole <b>200</b> and a discharge chip <b>31</b> is attached to a tip end of the portion protruded from the shaft hole <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The terminal fitting <b>40</b> is a metallic member and supported by a glass or the like inside the insulator <b>200</b> at a second end portion (end portion in the upper side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) of the shaft hole <b>200</b> in the center axis CX. The terminal fitting <b>40</b> is a stick-shaped member and the most part thereof is arranged inside the shaft hole <b>200</b>. A part of the terminal fitting <b>40</b> protrudes outside the insulator <b>20</b>. This protruded portion serves as an electrode terminal to which voltage is applied from external power supply which is not shown.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the insulator <b>20</b>, a region in which the center electrode <b>30</b> is attached along the center axis CX may be referred to as tip end side. Also, in the insulator <b>20</b>, a region in which the terminal fitting <b>40</b> is attached along the center axis CX may be referred to as rear end side.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">A resistor <b>71</b> is provided between the terminal fitting <b>40</b> and the center electrode <b>30</b> in the shaft hole <b>200</b>. The resistor <b>71</b> is provided for adjusting an electrical resistance of an electrical path from the terminal fitting <b>40</b> to the center electrode. The resistor <b>71</b> is made of a material in which a predetermined amount of carbon powder is added to powdered glass and zirconia. The electrical resistance of the resistor <b>71</b> is adjusted by an amount of addition of the carbon. The resistor <b>71</b> is provided at the electrical path between the terminal fitting <b>40</b> and the center electrode <b>30</b>, thereby suppressing electromagnetic noise accompanied by a spark discharge of the ignition plug <b>10</b>. The resistor <b>71</b> and the center electrode <b>30</b> are electrically connected via a conductive sealing layer <b>72</b>. Similarly, the terminal fitting <b>40</b> and the resistor <b>71</b> are electrically connected via the conductive sealing layer <b>73</b>. Each of the conductive sealing layers <b>72</b> and <b>73</b> is a conductive layer formed of a material in which copper powder is added to the powdered glass.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The metal fitting <b>50</b> is configured as a cylindrical member provided to cover a part of the insulator <b>20</b> from an outer periphery side thereof. For the metal fitting <b>50</b>, the entire body is made of metal. As will be described later, the metal fitting <b>50</b> is fixed to the insulator <b>20</b> by caulking and supports the insulator <b>20</b>. The metal fitting <b>50</b> includes a connection part <b>52</b>, flange portion <b>55</b> and an insertion portion <b>56</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The connection part <b>52</b> is a portion to be engaged with a tool such as a plug wrench when the ignition plug <b>10</b> is attached to the internal combustion engine. The shape of the connection part <b>52</b> is hexagonal when viewed along the center axis CX. According to the present embodiment, in the connection part <b>52</b>, width between two faces which face with each other (two face width) is 16 mm. Note that the connection part <b>52</b> may have a Bi-HEX shape when viewed from the center axis CX.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The flange portion <b>55</b> comes into contact with an outer surface of the internal combustion engine via a gasket GK when the ignition plug <b>10</b> is attached to the internal combustion engine. The flange portion <b>55</b> is provided in a tip end side than the connection part <b>52</b> is positioned, and protrudes towards outer periphery side. A deformation portion <b>54</b> is provided between the flange portion <b>55</b> and the connection part <b>52</b>, which will be described later.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The insertion portion <b>56</b> is provided a tip end side than the flange portion <b>55</b> is positioned, and is to be inserted to an insertion hole (not shown) formed in the internal combustion engine. A male screw is formed on the outer peripheral surface of the insertion portion <b>56</b>. When the ignition plug <b>10</b> is attached to the internal combustion engine, the connection part <b>52</b> rotates around the center axis CX with the force applied by the tool. Thus, a female screw formed on the inner peripheral surface of the above-described insertion hole and the male screw <b>561</b> of the insertion portion <b>56</b> are engaged with each other. With this, the ignition plug <b>10</b> is fastened and fixed to the internal combustion engine. In a state where the ignition plug <b>10</b> is attached to the internal combustion engine, the electrical potential of the metal fitting <b>50</b> is ground potential which is the same as that of the internal combustion engine.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The ground electrode <b>60</b> is made of metal and formed extending from an end portion in the tip end side of the metal fitting <b>50</b> to further tip end side. The ground electrode <b>60</b> is bent and a part thereof faces, along the center axis CX, the discharge chip <b>31</b> of the center electrode <b>30</b>. A ground side chip <b>61</b> is attached to a portion facing the discharge chip <b>31</b> of the ground electrode <b>60</b>. A gap formed between the ground side chip <b>61</b> and the discharge chip <b>31</b> serves as a discharge gap.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an annular space SP is formed, inside the connection part <b>52</b>, between the outer peripheral surface of the insulator <b>20</b> and the inner peripheral surface of the metal fitting <b>50</b>. The annular space SP is a space having an annular shape and formed surrounding the center axis CX. An end portion in the tip end side of the annular space SP is partitioned by a protrusion <b>211</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). An end portion in the rear end side of the annular space SP is partitioned by a caulking part <b>51</b> of the metal fitting <b>50</b>. The caulking part <b>51</b> is positioned closer to a rear end side than the position of the connection part <b>52</b> in the metal fitting <b>50</b>. The caulking part <b>51</b> is deformed towards the inner periphery side when being caulked.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">A talc material which is powdered talcum is filled into the annular space SP. The talc material TC enhances the anti-shock properties of the ignition plug <b>10</b> in a state of being attached to the internal combustion engine and prevents the gas from the internal combustion engine from leaking towards the rear end side.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the annular space SP, an annular member <b>90</b> is provided at an end portion in the rear end side along the center axis CX (i.e. opposite side of the center electrode <b>30</b>). Further, in the annular space SP, a first annular member <b>81</b> and a second annular member <b>2</b> are provided in a state of being in contact with each other at an end portion in the tip end side along the center axis CX (i.e. the center electrode <b>30</b> side). Each of the annular member <b>90</b>, the first annular member <b>81</b> and the second annular member <b>82</b> is formed in an annular shape to surround the center axis CX. For example, each of the annular member <b>90</b>, the first annular member <b>81</b> and the second annular member <b>82</b> is made of hard metal material such as carbon steel. Each cross-sectional shape of the annular member <b>90</b>, the first annular member <b>81</b> and the second annular member <b>82</b> which are sectioned at a surface including the center axis CX is a circular shape.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Thus, according to the present embodiment, a single annular member <b>90</b> is provided at a rear end side of the talc material TC, but a plurality of annular members (first annular member <b>81</b> and second annular member <b>82</b>) are provided in the tip end side of the talc material TC. The reason of this arrangement will be described later.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">A method of fixing the metal fitting <b>50</b> to the insulator <b>30</b> will be described. Firstly, the insulator <b>20</b> is inserted into the metal fitting <b>50</b> from the rear end side thereof. At this time, the caulking part <b>51</b> is not deformed yet as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, but linearly extends in the rear end side. In other words, the rear end side of the annular space SP is opened towards outside.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">A protrusion <b>562</b> is formed on the inner peripheral surface of the insertion portion <b>56</b> of the metal fitting <b>50</b>. The insulator <b>20</b> inserted inside the metal fitting <b>50</b> comes to stop in a state where a stepped portion formed on the outer periphery thereof is in contact with the protrusion <b>562</b>. Thereafter, the first annular member <b>81</b>, the second annular member <b>82</b>, the talc material TC and the annular member <b>90</b> are arranged in the annular space SP in this order.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Next, force is applied between a bottom surface (surface to be contacted with gasket GK) of the flange portion <b>55</b> and a tip end of the caulking part <b>51</b> along the center axis CX to compress therebetween. With this force, the caulking part <b>51</b> is deformed to be displaced towards the inner periphery side as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Further, since the deformation portion <b>54</b> formed between the connection part <b>52</b> and the flange portion <b>55</b> is relatively thin, the deformation portion <b>54</b> is buckled. Thus, since the distance from the caulking part <b>51</b> to the protrusion <b>562</b> becomes shorter, with the force via the talc material TC, the insulator <b>20</b> is strongly pressed onto the protrusion <b>562</b>.
