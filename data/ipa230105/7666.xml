An element corresponding to a TCI state applied to an uplink signal/channel may be expressed as a spatial relation.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The TCI state is information related to Quasi-Co-Location (QCL) of a signal/channel, and may be referred to as, for example, a spatial reception parameter or Spatial Relation Information (SRI). The TCI state may be configured to the UE per channel or per signal.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">QCL is an index that indicates a statistical property of a signal/channel. In a case where, for example, a certain signal/channel and another signal/channel have a QCL relation, the QCL relation may mean that it is possible to assume that at least one of a Doppler shift, a Doppler spread, an average delay, a delay spread and a spatial parameter (e.g., spatial reception parameter (spatial Rx parameter)) is identical (at least one of these parameters is quasi-co-located) between a plurality of these different signals/channels.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In addition, the spatial reception parameter may be associated with a UE reception beam (e.g., reception analog beam), and the beam may be specified based on spatial QCL.

The TCI state may be configured (instructed) by a higher layer signaling, a physical layer signaling or a combination of these signalings.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the present disclosure, the higher layer signaling may be one or a combination of, for example, a Radio Resource Control (RRC) signaling, a Medium Access Control (MAC) signaling and broadcast information.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">For example, an MAC Control Element (MAC CE) or an MAC Protocol Data Unit (PDU) may be used for the MAC signaling.

The SSB may be referred to as an SS/PBCH block.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The UE may receive configuration information (e.g., PDSCH-Config or tci-StatesToAddModList) including a list of information elements of TCI states by a higher layer signaling.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">An information element of a TCI state (&#x201c;TCI-state IE&#x201d; of RRC) configured by the higher layer signaling may include a TCI state ID and one or a plurality of pieces of QCL information (&#x201c;QCL-Info&#x201d;). The QCL information may include at least one of information (RS related information) that relates to an RS that is in a QCL relation, and information (QCL type information) that indicates a QCL type. The RS related information may include information such as an RS index (e.g., an SSB index or a Non-Zero-Power CSI-RS (NZP CSI-RS) resource Identifier (ID)), an index of a cell in which the RS is arranged, and an index of a Bandwidth Part (BWP) in which the RS is arranged.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">According to Rel. 15 NR, both of an RS of the QCL type A and an RS of the QCL type D or only the RS of the QCL type A may be configured as a TCI state of at least one of a PDCCH and a PDSCH to the UE.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">&#x3c;TCI State for PDCCH&#x3e;</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Information related to QCL of a PDCCH (or a DeModulation Reference Signal (DMRS) antenna port associated with the PDCCH) and a certain DL-RS may be referred to as, for example, a TCI state for the PDCCH.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The UE may decide the TCI state for a UE-specific PDCCH (CORESET) based on a higher layer signaling. For example, one or a plurality of (K) TCI states may be configured to the UE per CORESET by an RRC signaling.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The UE may activate one of a plurality of TCI states configured by the RRC signaling for each CORESET by using an MAC CE. The MAC CE may be referred to as a TCI State Indication for a UE-specific PDCCH MAC CE. The UE may monitor the CORESET based on an active TCI state associated with the CORESET.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">&#x3c;TCI State for PDSCH&#x3e;</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Information related to QCL of a PDSCH (or a DMRS antenna port associated with the PDSCH) and a given DL-RS may be referred to as, for example, a TCI for the PDSCH.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">M (M&#x2265;1) TCI states for PDSCHs (QCL information for the M PDSCHs) may be notified (configured) to the UE by a higher layer signaling. In addition, the number M of TCI states configured to the UE may be limited according to at least one of UE capability and a QCL type.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">DCI used to schedule a PDSCH may include a given field (that may be referred to as, for example, a TC field or a TCI state field) that indicates a TCI state for the PDSCH. The DCI may be used to schedule a PDSCH of one cell, and may be referred to as, for example, DL DCI, a DL assignment, a DCI format 1_0 and a DCI format 1_1.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Whether or not the TCI field is included in the DCI may be controlled based on information notified from a base station to the UE. The information may be information (e.g., TCI-PresentInDCI) that indicates whether the TCI field is present or absent in the DCI. The information may be referred to as TCI presence information, and may be configured to the UE by, for example, a higher layer signaling.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In a case where TCI states of more than 8 types are configured to the UE, the TCI states of 8 types or less may be activated (or indicated) by using an MAC CE. The MAC CE may be referred to as a TCI States Activation/Deactivation for a UE-specific PDSCH MAC CE. The value of the TCI field in the DCI may indicate one of the TC states activated by the MAC CE.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">(Default QCL of A-CSI-RS of Rel. 15 NR)</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">According to NR, the UE measures a channel state by using a given reference signal (or a resource for the given reference signal), and feeds back (reports) Channel State Information (CSI) to the base station.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The UE may measure a channel state based on at least one of a CSI-RS, an SS/PBCH block and a DMRS as a reference signal.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">As a CSI feedback method, a Periodic CSI (P-CSI) reporting, an Aperiodic CSI (A-CSI) reporting and a Semi-Permanent CSI (SP-CSI) reporting are studied.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The SP-CSI reporting (PUCCH-based SP-CSI reporting) that uses the PUCCH may be activated by an MAC CE. The SP-CSI reporting (PUSCH-based SP-CSI reporting) that uses the PUSCH and the A-CSI reporting that uses the PUSCH or the PUCCH may be activated (or triggered) by DCI.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">For example, a CSI request field included in the DCI may indicate one trigger state from a plurality of trigger states configured by a higher layer signaling (e.g., RRC signaling). In addition, the CSI request field and a CSI trigger field may be interchangeably read.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">A CSI-RS measured for the A-CSI reporting may be referred to as an Aperiodic CSI-RS (A-CSI-RS). The A-CSI reporting simultaneously triggers measurement of the A-CSI-RS and the A-CSI reporting by using DCI, so that it is possible to dynamically trigger a CSI reporting while efficiently using an RS resource and an uplink channel resource.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">A list of trigger states for the A-CSI reporting may be configured by an RRC information element &#x201c;CSI-AperiodicTriggerStateList&#x201d;. Each trigger state may be associated with, for example, one or a plurality of report configuration IDs (CSI-ReportConfigId), CSI resource configuration information or a TCI state (or QCL assumption) of an A-CSI-RS.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Regarding the A-CSI-RS resource of a CSI-RS resource set associated with a trigger state, a QCL configuration including an RS resource of QCL and a QCL type may be instructed to the UE by a higher layer. For example, the TCI state (or QCL assumption) of the A-CSI-RS may be indicated by (a CSI request field of) DCI for triggering measurement of the A-CSI RS.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">By the way, a duration from DCI (triggering DCI) to an A-CSI-RS instructed (triggered) by the DCI may be specified in association with the above-described trigger state. For example, the UE determines a CSI-RS resource set ID associated with a measurement target CSI-RS resource set based on the trigger state. This CSI-RS resource set ID may be associated with an aperiodic triggering offset. The aperiodic triggering offset may be read as a scheduling offset.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The scheduling offset may mean an offset between a last symbol of a PDCCH for conveying DCI for triggering an A-CSI-RS resource set (or a last slot including the PDCCH), and a first symbol (or slot) of an A-CSI-RS resource of the resource set. As the scheduling offset of the A-CSI-RS, for example, a value equal to or more than 0 and equal to or less than 4 may be configured, or a value larger than 4 (e.g., 16 or 24) may be configured. A unit of the offset may be a symbol unit or may be a slot unit.
