The embodiments described below are exemplary, and the planar light sources and the methods of manufacturing planar light sources according to the present disclosure are not limited to the embodiments described below. For example, the numerical values, shapes, materials, processes, and the sequence of the processes are presented merely as examples, and can be modified in various ways to the extent that such modifications do not cause any technical inconsistency. The embodiments described below are merely provided as examples, and can be combined in various ways to the extent that such combinations do not cause any technical inconsistency.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The dimensions, shapes, and the like of the constituent elements shown in the drawings might be exaggerated for clarity, and might not reflect the dimensions and the shapes of, and the magnitude relations between, the constituent elements in an actual planar light source. Furthermore, certain elements might be omitted in a drawing or a cut section might be shown as a cross-sectional view such that the drawing would not be excessively complex.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the explanation below, the constituent elements having practically the same function will be denoted with common reference numerals for which redundant explanation will be omitted. Furthermore, terms indicating directions or positions (for example, &#x201c;above,&#x201d; &#x201c;under,&#x201d; &#x201c;right,&#x201d; &#x201c;left&#x201d; or other terms related thereto) might occasionally be used. These terms, however, are merely used to clarify the relative directions or positions in a referenced drawing. As long as the relationship between the directions or the positions indicated with the terms such as &#x201c;above,&#x201d; &#x201c;under,&#x201d; or the like is the same as that in a referenced drawing, the layout of the elements in another drawing, an actual product, and manufacturing equipment outside of the present disclosure, does not have to be the same as that shown in the referenced drawing. &#x201c;Parallel&#x201d; in the present disclosure includes cases where the two straight lines, sides, planes, or the like form an angle in the range of about 0&#xb0; to &#xb1;5&#xb0; unless otherwise specifically noted.
