As a drive device used for such an electric truck, for example, as shown in Patent Literature 1, a drive device in which a driving motor and a reducer are integrally provided in a differential gear has been considered.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">PRIOR ART REFERENCE</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0003">[PATENT LITERATURE 1] Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. 2019-026050</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Problems to be Solved by Invention</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For commercial vehicles such as trucks, there is a market demand to improve the steering performance of vehicles by increasing the steering angle of wheels to 90&#xb0; or more, preferably to about 180&#xb0;. If such a steering angle can be realized, there is an advantage that the turning radius can be reduced, and if the steering of 180&#xb0; is possible, the vehicle can be moved and parked in the left-right direction.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, in an electric truck which is actually produced up to now, since a suspension device of a leaf spring type, a rigid axle, or the like is often employed, it is difficult to realize the steering angle described above. In addition, since the electric truck is required to have a higher torque than that of a passenger car, it is necessary to provide a speed reduction mechanism, which increases the size of the drive device. From this point of view as well, it is difficult to realize the steering angle described above.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An electric truck has a tendency of having larger vehicle-body vibration while traveling than a passenger car, and for this reason, a demand arises to improve drive feeling.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">With the foregoing problems in view, it is an object of the present disclosure to provide a drive device for an electric truck having a steering performance of a steering angle of 0&#xb0; to 180&#xb0; while improving drive feeling.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Means to Solve the Problems</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present disclosure is made in order to solve at least part of the above problems and can be carried out in the following embodiment or application.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">(1) A drive device for an electric truck of the present application example includes drive unit housings disposed on each of left and right sides of the electric truck, each of the drive unit housings integrally accommodating a motor that generates drive power, a reducer that reduces a rotation speed of the motor, and a final gear that is connected to the reducer and transfers the drive power of the motor to the drive wheel; suspension parts one provided over the final gear in each of the drive unit housings; steering gear parts one being provided over each of the suspension parts and being configured to be steerable the drive wheel; pairs of hinge parts, each pair disposed one to each of a vehicle front side and a vehicle rear side of each of the steering gear parts; and pairs of body-connecting parts, one of the pairs connecting each of the steering gear parts to a vehicle body of the electric truck through each of the pairs of hinge parts.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">This configuration drives each individual drive wheel and steers each individual drive wheel, and consequently can achieve a steering angle in the range of 0&#xb0; to 180&#xb0;, which makes the turning radius small. Furthermore, the steering gear part is connected to the vehicle body through the pair of hinge parts and the pair of body-connecting parts, so that the drive feeling can be enhanced.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">(2) In the drive device for the electric truck of the present application example, each of the suspension parts may be an air suspension including: an outer tube centered at a steering shaft of the drive wheel; and an inner tube being concentric with the outer tube, being slidable along an inner circumference face of the outer tube in an axis direction, and being incapable of relatively rotating with respect to the outer tube.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">As such, serving the air suspension as the suspension part makes a configuration simpler as compared with serving a hydraulic suspension or an electromagnetic suspension as that.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">(3) In the drive device for the electric truck of the present application example, an upper part of the outer tube may be linked to a lower part of the inner tube.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Linking the upper part and the lower part of the two tubes constituting the air suspension by, for example, a steering arm mechanism or a stabilizer mechanism restricts the outer tube and the inner tube to rotate relatively to each other but allows the outer tube and the inner tube to vertically move relatively to each other and further makes these movements smooth.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">(4) In the drive device for the electric truck of the present application example, each of the steering gear parts may include a protrusion portion to be connected to the body-connecting parts and a tube portion being concentric with the steering shaft of the drive wheel; an upper portion of the outer tube may be concentric with the tube portion and is rotatably supported by the tube portion; a thrust plate that receives load of a vertical direction may be interposed between an inner circumference face of the tube portion and an outer circumference face of the outer tube.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">With this configuration, the thrust plate interposed between the tube portion and the outer tube serves as a spacer, which avoids direct contact of the tube portion on the fixing side with the outer tube on the rotating side. Furthermore, since the thrust plate receives the load in the vertical direction, the drive feeling is further enhanced.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">(5) In the drive device for the electric truck of the present application example, the steering gear part may further include a low frictional member being arranged at a point where the outer tube is brought into slidable contact with the thrust plate and reducing friction of the outer tube with the thrust plate.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">This configuration makes the low frictional member possible to reduce the friction between the thrust plate and the outer tube.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">(6) In the drive device for the electric truck of the present application example, each of the steering gear parts may be configured to be capable of steering the drive wheel up to 90&#xb0; leftward and rightward on an assumption that a steering angle of the drive wheel under a state where the electric truck is traveling straight forward is 0&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">This configuration enhances the steering performance, which allows the truck to be moved and parked in a left-right direction, for example.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">(7) In the drive device for the electric truck of the present application example, the drive device may be applied to the electric truck comprising a double-tire constituting two of the drive wheels; and the drive power of the motor may be transferred to the double-tire.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">By adopting the double-tire as the above, the drive device can be also applied to a larger electric truck.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">(8) In the drive device for the electric truck of the present application example, the final gear of the each of the drive unit housings may be included in a differential gear.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">This structure distributes appropriate drive power to the double-tire, so that the steering performance can be enhanced.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Effects of Invention</heading><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The present disclosure makes it possible to provide a drive device for an electric truck having a steering performance of a steering angle of 0&#xb0; to 180&#xb0; while improving drive feeling.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0009" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an overall perspective view of an electric truck to which a drive device according to an embodiment is applied.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective view of the periphery of the drive device arranged on the front side of the electric truck of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a side view of a drive device according to an embodiment, omitting one of the wheels.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along the A-A arrows of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a perspective view of a drive device according to an embodiment, omitting a double-tire.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view explaining the main configuration of a drive device.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a partial cross-sectional view of a drive device as an embodiment, which is cut in a vehicle front-rear direction through a steering center.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows examples in which a common drive device is applied to electric trucks having different specifications.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0010" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENT(S)</heading><p id="p-0035" num="0034">A drive device for an electric truck according to an embodiment will now be described with reference to accompanying drawings.

This drive device drives each individual drive wheel <b>2</b>A and steers each individual drive wheel <b>2</b>A, and consequently can achieve a steering angle in the range of 0&#xb0; to 180&#xb0;, which makes the turning radius small. Furthermore, the steering gear part <b>30</b> is coupled to the vehicle body via the part of hinge parts <b>40</b> and the body-connecting parts <b>32</b> and <b>33</b>. The hinge parts <b>40</b>, which have a function to suppress propagation of vertical vibration of the drive wheel <b>2</b>A to the vehicle body, can suppress the vehicle vibration as well as the suspension part <b>20</b>, so that drive feeling can be improved.

Modification]</heading><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The above-described drive device and the truck <b>1</b> are all examples. For example, although the suspension part <b>20</b> is an air suspension including the outer tube <b>21</b> and the inner tube <b>22</b>, or a hybrid of an air suspension and the coil spring <b>28</b>, the suspension part can be selected based on the load and application. Alternatively, a hydraulic suspension or an electromagnetic suspension may be employed.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The low frictional members <b>23</b> and <b>35</b> and the thrust plate <b>34</b> are not essential and can be omitted. The structure for restricting the relative rotation between the outer tube <b>21</b> and the inner tube <b>22</b> is not limited to the link connection by the stabilizer <b>27</b>. The steering gear part <b>30</b> may be realized using gears other than the spur gear <b>30</b><i>c </i>and the annular gear <b>30</b><i>d</i>. The range of the steering angle of the double-tire <b>2</b> may be set according to the required turning radius.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In the above-described truck <b>1</b>, although the drive device is packaged by arranging the pair of drive units <b>10</b> adjacent to each other in the vehicle width direction in the frame of the body frame casing <b>5</b>, the method of mounting the drive device on the vehicle body is not limited to this. For example, the drive device may be connected to a pair of left and right chassis frames extending in the front-rear direction. Note that the hinge parts <b>40</b> are not essential and may be omitted. The above-described truck <b>1</b> has double-tires <b>2</b>, but may alternatively have a single-tire structure. In this alternative, the drive unit housing <b>15</b>, the suspension part <b>20</b>, and the steering gear part <b>30</b> may be arranged for each drive wheels, considering a weight balance.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF REFERENCE NUMBERS</heading><p id="p-0082" num="0000"><ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0081"><b>1</b>, <b>1</b>&#x2032;, <b>1</b>&#x2033;: truck (electric truck)</li>    <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0082"><b>2</b>: double-tire</li>    <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0083"><b>2</b>A: drive wheel</li>    <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0084"><b>11</b>: motor</li>    <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0085"><b>12</b>: reducer</li>    <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0086"><b>14</b>: final gear</li>    <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0087"><b>15</b>: drive unit housing</li>    <li id="ul0002-0008" num="0088"><b>20</b>: suspension part</li>    <li id="ul0002-0009" num="0089"><b>21</b>: outer tube</li>    <li id="ul0002-0010" num="0090"><b>22</b>: inner tube</li>    <li id="ul0002-0011" num="0091"><b>30</b>: steering gear part</li>    <li id="ul0002-0012" num="0092"><b>30</b><i>a</i>: steering shaft</li>    <li id="ul0002-0013" num="0093"><b>30</b><i>e</i>: tube portion</li>    <li id="ul0002-0014" num="0094"><b>30</b><i>f</i>: protruding portion</li>    <li id="ul0002-0015" num="0095"><b>32</b>: front body-connecting part</li>    <li id="ul0002-0016" num="0096"><b>33</b>: rear body-connecting part</li>    <li id="ul0002-0017" num="0097"><b>34</b>: thrust plate</li>    <li id="ul0002-0018" num="0098"><b>35</b>: low frictional member</li>    <li id="ul0002-0019" num="0099"><b>40</b>: hinge part</li></ul></p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
