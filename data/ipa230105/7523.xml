In NR, the network delivers system information (SI) to a UE through a master information block (MIB) and system information blocks (SIBs). The MIB is transmitted on the Physical Broadcast Channel (PBCH). The MIB contains a small amount of information necessary for the UE to receive the remaining system information in the SIBs. Among other pieces of information, the MIB contains the configuration of Control Resource Set #0 (CORESET#0) and Search Space #0. The CORESET provides a time-frequency region where the UE monitors for a Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH). The Search Space defines monitoring locations of the CORESET in time.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The structure of the MIB is specified in the standard and the format cannot change between releases as this will break backwards compatibility. In the current NR specification, the smallest possible CORESET#0 size in the frequency domain is 24 resource blocks (RBs). The MIB occupies 20 RBs. Currently, except for one reserved bit, all the bits in the MIB have a specific meaning defined in the NR standard.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">SI messages, other than the SI in the MIB, are scheduled in a similar way as normal data transmission, but SI messages are repeated periodically by being scheduled in an SI window. A PDCCH indicates to the UE that the Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH) is to be received and the PDSCH contains the SI message (containing one or more SIBs).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Low-cost and/or low-complexity UE implementations are needed for the 5th Generation (5G) system, for example, to facilitate deployment of a massive number of industrial sensors or wearable devices. Currently, NR-Light is used as the running name for the discussion of such low-complexity UEs in the third generation partnership project (3GPP). NR-Light is a new feature that is currently under discussion and could be introduced as early as in 3GPP Release 17 for supporting reduced capability (RedCap) devices in a 5G network. NR-Light is intended for use cases that do not require a device to support full-fledged NR capability and International Mobile Telecommunications-2020 (IMT-2020) performance requirements. For example, the data rate for NR-Light does not need to reach above 1 Gbps, and the latency does not need to be as low as 1 ms. By relaxing the data rate and latency targets, NR-Light allows low-cost and/or low-complexity UE implementation. In 3GPP Release 15, an NR UE is required to support 100 MHz carrier bandwidth in frequency range 1 (from 410 MHz to 7125 MHz) and 200 MHz carrier bandwidth in frequency range 2 (from 24.25 GHz to 52.6 GHz). For NR-Light UEs, supporting 100 MHz or 200 MHz bandwidth is superfluous. For example, a UE bandwidth of 8.64 MHz might be sufficient if the use cases do not require a data rate higher than 20 Mbps. Reduced UE bandwidth results in complexity reduction and possibly energy consumption reduction as well. However, reduced UE bandwidth may cause problems for the NR-light UE when accessing the NR system, as certain channels in NR have a minimum bandwidth requirement.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">There currently exist certain challenge(s). For example, although configuring a wide CORESET#0 bandwidth can be advantageous in terms of coverage and scheduling capacity, the wide CORESET#0 bandwidth creates a problem for a low-complexity UE that only supports UE bandwidths that are smaller than the bandwidth required for CORESET#0.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Certain aspects of the present disclosure and their embodiments may provide solutions to these or other challenges. For example, this disclosure describes methods and systems for enabling a low-complexity reduced capability (RedCap) user equipment (UE) such as, for example, a New Radio-Light UE (NR-Light UE) to access a New Radio (NR) cell even when the CORESET#0 of the NR cell is configured to a wider bandwidth than the maximum supported bandwidth of the low-complexity UE (e.g., NR-Light UE).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to certain embodiments, a method by a reduced capability wireless device includes receiving system information from a network node.

accompanying drawings. Other embodiments, however, are contained within the scope of the subject matter disclosed herein, the disclosed subject matter should not be construed as limited to only the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided by way of example to convey the scope of the subject matter to those skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Generally, all terms used herein are to be interpreted according to their ordinary meaning in the relevant technical field, unless a different meaning is clearly given and/or is implied from the context in which it is used. All references to a/an/the element, apparatus, component, means, step, etc. are to be interpreted openly as referring to at least one instance of the element, apparatus, component, means, step, etc., unless explicitly stated otherwise. The steps of any methods disclosed herein do not have to be performed in the exact order disclosed, unless a step is explicitly described as following or preceding another step and/or where it is implicit that a step must follow or precede another step. Any feature of any of the embodiments disclosed herein may be applied to any other embodiment, wherever appropriate. Likewise, any advantage of any of the embodiments may apply to any other embodiments, and vice versa. Other objectives, features and advantages of the enclosed embodiments will be apparent from the following description.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In NR, one of the initial access steps is for the UE to acquire system information block type 1, SIB1 (SIB1 is acquired after the UE acquires MIB), which is scheduled through PDCCH using Search Space #0 associated with CORESET#0. In NR, CORESET#0 has bandwidths 4.32 MHz, 8.64 MHz, or 17.28 MHz in frequency range 1 (FR1), and bandwidths 34.56 MHz or 69.12 MHz in frequency range 2 (FR2). The number of symbols used for CORESET#0 can be 1, 2, or 3. The bandwidth of CORESET#0 depends on the subcarrier spacing indicated in MIB (by parameter subCarrierSpacingCommon) and is configured by the network. For example, if CORESET#0 uses 30 kHz subcarrier spacing for PDCCH, the bandwidth of CORESET#0 can be either 8.64 MHz or 17.28 MHz depending on whether the ControlResourceSetZero information element configured 24 RBs or 48 RBs for CORESET#0.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The network may choose either bandwidth option. Between the two options, some implementation consideration may favor the configuration of 17.28 MHz bandwidth for CORESET#0. For example, with 30 kHz subcarrier spacing and 17.28 MHz CORESET#0 bandwidth, the PDCCH can operate with aggregation level (AL) 16, which offers the highest PDCCH coverage when only one symbol is used for CORESET#0. In comparison, if only one symbol is used, configuring CORESET#0 with bandwidth 8.64 MHz can only support AL 8 when the PDCCH is configured with 30 kHz subcarrier spacing, which results in approximately 3 dB coverage reduction compared to AL 16. Furthermore, using a higher CORESET#0 bandwidth gives rise to higher scheduling capacity. Using 17.28 MHz bandwidth, however, may result in CORESET#0 not being useable by low-complexity UEs (e.g., NR-Light UEs) that only support smaller UE bandwidths, especially considering that currently only an interleaved resource mapping is supported by CORESET#0, which means a PDCCH candidate may not use contiguous RBs, resulting in a PDCCH candidate spreading out in the frequency domain within the CORESET#0 bandwidth.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">A PDCCH mapped to resources in CORESET#0 may be used to transmit downlink control information (DCI) that schedules a PDSCH carrying SIB1.

The SSB refers to the combination of Synchronization Signal (SS) (both the primary SS and the secondary SS) and Physical Broadcast Channel (PBCH). The PBCH carries the MIB, and the CORESET#0 is configured in the MIB. Certain embodiments disclosed herein may refer to UEs with reduced capabilities as &#x201c;low-complexity UEs,&#x201d; &#x201c;low-cost UEs,&#x201d; &#x201c;NR-Light UEs,&#x201d; &#x201c;NR MTC UEs,&#x201d; or &#x201c;reduced capability NR devices,&#x201d; for example. These types of UEs may have a maximum supported UE bandwidth that is less than the bandwidth configured, e.g., for CORESET#0.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0050">In order for the NR-Light UEs to access an NR cell even when the CORESET#0 of the NR cell is configured to a wider bandwidth than the maximum UE supported bandwidth, certain embodiments disclosed herein may assume that the NR-Light UE can receive the same SIM (or eSIB1 as defined below) as the legacy UE. The challenge is the bandwidth difference between the two type of UEs, i.e., the legacy NR UEs and the low-complexity UE with reduced bandwidth.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0051">In general, if a cell supports both legacy UEs and low-complexity UEs, the cell has to transmit the necessary information for both types of UEs to access the system. If the SSB of the legacy UE is reused for the low-complexity UE, certain embodiments of the present disclosure assume that, in addition to transmitting the legacy SIB1 information intended for legacy UEs or UEs supporting a bandwidth equal to or wider than the CORESET#0 bandwidth, the network transmits additional information elements specifically intended for NR-Light UEs. These additional NR-Light specific information elements can be added to the legacy SIB1, which will be referred to herein as an extended SIB1 (eSIB1 using ASN.1 extension of the message contents). Thus, the legacy SIB1 is extended to include information elements specifically intended for NR-Light UEs. In particular, an eSIB1 may include one or more of the information elements in the legacy SIB1 as well as one or more of the new NR-Light specific information elements. The structure of the eSIB1 is arranged in a way that it can be read and used both by the legacy UE and the low-complexity UE, e.g., the legacy UE does not act on the added NR-Light specific information elements.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0052">In a particular embodiment, the eSIB1 may be scheduled using the same legacy DCI format 1_0 with cyclic redundancy check (CRC) scrambled by System Information-Radio Network Temporary Identifier (SI-RNTI).</p><p id="p-0055" num="0053">In a particular embodiment, the DCI for scheduling eSIB1 may be transmitted using PDCCH that spans over a bandwidth wider than the maximum NR-Light UE supported bandwidth. For example, the maximum NR-Light UE supported bandwidth may be 10 MHz, while the PDCCH with AL 16 spans over 48 RBs, which amount to 17.28 MHz with 30 kHz subcarrier spacing. According to this example embodiment, the NR-Light UE receives X out of Y RBs, where the X RBs have a frequency span equal to or less than the maximum NR-Light UE supported bandwidth. For example, with 30 kHz subcarrier spacing, Y may be 48, corresponding to 17.28 MHz bandwidth, and X may be 24 and has a span of 8.64 MHz, which is within the maximum NR-Light UE supported bandwidth of 10 MHz. In a particular embodiment, the NR-Light UE treats the (Y-X) RBs that it does not receive as &#x201c;punctured&#x201d;. The UE sets the soft values of the corresponding coded bits carried in the punctured RBs to zero. These coded bits are said to be punctured. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an example 20 of an NR-Light UE receiving a subset of CORESET#0 RBs and treating the RBs that it does not receive as punctured, according to certain embodiments. The example in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> assumes 30 kHz subcarrier spacing. However, this particular example is not limiting and, in fact, any RBs may be punctured. For example, in a particular embodiment, the RBs at both edges can be punctured.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0054">According to another particular embodiment, the PDCCH used for scheduling eSIB1 may be repeated and the NR-Light UE alternates the puncturing patterns so that when it combines the received signals over two or more PDCCH repetitions the number of punctured coded bits is reduced. In fact, it is possible to eliminate the punctured coded bits. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates such an example where the punctured coded bits are eliminated. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates an example 30 of an NR-Light UE receiving multiple repetitions of PDCCH carrying the DCI that schedule PDSCH for eSIB1 transmission, alternating the puncturing patterns across repetitions, and combining the received signals from multiple repetitions to reduce the number of punctured coded bits. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a 30 kHz subcarrier spacing is assumed.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0055">There are two alternatives for the repetitions. In the first alternative, the next generation NodeB (gNodeB (gNB), the base station in NR) can be configured to schedule additional PDCCH repetitions in relation to the legacy PDCCH whenever NR-Light and reduced bandwidth UEs are supported in the cell. These can have a pre-determined offset to the legacy PDCCH transmission. If NR-Light support is indicated in MIB or by other means in the cell, this could implicitly mean that such pre-determined repetition is applied for PDCCH (if the bandwidth of CORESET#0 is wider than the maximum bandwidth of the NR-Light UE). The repetition may follow a certain specific frequency hopping pattern within the configured CORESET#0 bandwidth.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0056">In the second alternative, no additional repetitions are introduced. Instead, the UE relies on SIB1 being system information that will be transmitted repeatedly in the cell. That is, the same SIB1 content may be transmitted several times during a time period over which the UE can accumulate. As an example, SIB1 may be transmitted every 20 ms, which would enable the UE to accumulate and combine up to 8 repetitions in a 160 ms window for decoding. In another example, the SIB1 transmission could be assumed to be unchanged during the entire modification period (e.g., 160 ms period).</p><p id="p-0059" num="0057">The above repetition may compensate for the loss due to puncturing and make AL=16 applicable also to NR-Light and reduced bandwidth UEs.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0058">According to certain other embodiments, a method by the network node is provided for transmitting an extra repetition specifically for NR-Light UEs. According to this embodiment, the network node only repeats the RBs that the NR-Light UE has punctured in its previous PDCCH reception. The network node and the UE need to agree on which RBs will be punctured. As an example, and not as a limitation, the network and UE may agree that the lower (Y-X) RBs are punctured in the 1<sup>st </sup>transmission. Which portion of the initial transmission is punctured may be specified in a technical specification. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates an example 40 of an NR-Light UE receiving multiple repetitions of PDCCH carrying the DCI that schedule PDSCH for eSIB1 transmission and combining the received signals from multiple repetitions to reduce the number of punctured coded bits, according to certain embodiments. The network transmits a repetition for the NR-Light UE to recover from the puncturing it has applied in the initial transmission. The example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> assumes 30 kHz subcarrier spacing; however, this example is not intended to be limiting. In fact, any PRBs can be punctured. In a particular example embodiment, the PRBs at both edges can be punctured.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0059">Note that when a UE receives DCI scheduling a PDSCH that the UE is to receive, the DCI indicates the slot offset K<sub>0 </sub>between the PDCCH and the scheduled PDSCH, among other things. If PDCCH repetitions are confined in the same slot, there is no ambiguity in interpreting the meaning of the slot offset K<sub>0</sub>. If the PDCCH repetitions span across slots, how to interpret the slot offset K<sub>0 </sub>needs to be defined. In one embodiment, the slot offset K<sub>0 </sub>indicates the slot offset between a reference slot and the slot in which PDSCH carrying eSIB1 is scheduled. In one example, the reference slot is the slot containing the first PDCCH repetition. In another example, the reference slot is the slot containing the last PDCCH repetition.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0060">In the case using PDCCH repetition, symbol level repetition is preferred. In this case, the frequency and/or domain resource assignment of the eSIB1 indicated in the DCI is at a place that does not overlap with the repeated PDCCH symbol. If there are no such resources available, there can be a partial overlap, and a dropping rule needs to be defined such as, for example, whether the overlapping part needs to be PDCCH transmission or PDSCH transmission. Either the repeated PDCCH can partly puncture the PDSCH or the overlapped PDCCH resource elements (subcarriers) are dropped by the UE. Alternatively, the resource elements used by the repeated PDCCH may be indicated as reserved resources and the PDSCH rate-around them.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0061">Another solution is to configure more symbols for the CORESET#0 for the legacy UE than what is needed for PDCCH coverage. For example, assume AL 8 is sufficient for PDCCH coverage. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates an example OFDM symbol index <b>50</b> where the network node configures 48 RBs and one OFDM symbol for CORESET#0, according to certain embodiments.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0062">In another embodiment, to support PDCCH repetition for NR-Light UEs, the network can instead configure CORESET#0 to have 48 RBs and 2 OFDM symbols. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates such an example 60, according to certain embodiments. Specifically, in the example, {CCE0, CCE1, . . . CCE7} can be used for PDCCH transmissions of AL 8. A subset of {CCE8, CCE9, . . . , CCE15} can be used for transmitting PDCCH repetitions for NR-Light UEs. For example, due to bandwidth constraint, CCE3, CCE5, and CCE7 may not be received by the NR-Light UEs. These CCEs can be repeated in the same slot using the resource elements assigned to CCE8, CCE10, and CCE12, respectively.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0063">According to certain embodiments, unused CCE resources may be used for transmitting PDCCH and/or PDCCH repetitions and/or PDCCH repetitions for the previously punctured portion (partly or fully) for NR-Light UEs. To this end, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates another example 70 wherein the network intends to support PDCCH up to AL 16 and configures CORESET#0 to have 48 RBs and 3 OFDM symbols, according to certain embodiments. In the example embodiment, {CCE0, CCE1, . . . CCE15} are used for PDCCH transmissions of AL 16. A subset of {CCE16, CCE17, . . . , CCE23} can be used for transmitting PDCCH repetitions for NR-Light UEs. For example, due to bandwidth constraint, CCE5, CCE7, CCE9, CCE11, CCE13, and CCE15 may not be received by the NR-Light UEs. One or more of these CCEs can be repeated using the resource elements assigned to CCE16, CCE17, . . . , and CCE23.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0064">An aggregation level determines the resource elements used to send the PDCCH. Higher aggregation levels require more CCEs. AL 1 needs 1 CCE, AL2 needs 2 CCEs, AL4 needs 4 CCEs, AL8 needs 8 CCEs, and AL16 needs 16 CCEs. Each CCE consists of 6 Resource Element Groups (REGs), and one REG is made up of one resource block (12 resource elements in frequency domain) and one OFDM symbol in time domain.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0065">Therefore, when more symbols are used for PDCCH, more CCEs are available to be used for higher aggregation levels. As discussed above, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, and <b>7</b></figref> illustrate examples when one, two, or three OFDM symbols are used for PDCCH transmission, respectively. As can be seen, increasing the number of OFDM symbols used for PDCCH transmission allows more CCEs to be supported. Also, due to the frequency and time mapping of the REGs, by increasing the number of OFDM symbols used per CCE, each CCE uses less bandwidth (still <b>6</b> REGs per CCE but it expands in time first and then frequency). Accordingly, an NR light UE may receive more CCEs within its maximum supported bandwidth, and higher aggregation levels can be supported within its bandwidth. Compare <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> (wherein configuring 2 OFDM symbols per CCE allows the NR light UE to receive nine CCEs within its maximum supported bandwidth) and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> (wherein configuring 3 OFDM symbols per CCE allows the NR light UE to receive fourteen CCEs within its maximum supported bandwidth). As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>7</b></figref>, the CCEs are not required to be arranged in continuous order (e.g., CCE0 may be followed by CCE2, rather than CCE1, along the Resource Block (RB) Index).</p><p id="p-0068" num="0066">Note that the feature of these embodiments to be applicable only when gNB &#x201c;configure more symbols for the CORSET#0 for the legacy UE than what is needed for PDCCH coverage&#x201d; is only valid for the scheduling of eSIB. That is, the PDCCH transmission scheduling the eSIB should be decodable both by legacy UEs and NR-Light UEs.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0067">The DCI is used for scheduling PDSCH for eSIB1 transmission. According to certain embodiments disclosed herein, the same PDSCH that carries SIB1 information also carries information elements for NR-Light UEs, i.e., information elements intended for NR-Light UEs are added to SIB1, making it eSIB1. As NR-Light information elements are not anticipated by the legacy UEs, they legacy UE does not need to act upon receiving this information. This is typically the case for an ASN.1 extension, it will be ignored by legacy UEs. According to one aspect of the present disclosure, the PDSCH that carries eSIB1 has a frequency span equal to or less than the maximum NR-Light UE supported bandwidth. Alternatively, the PDSCH that carries eSIB1 may have a frequency span wider than the maximum NR-Light UE supported bandwidth. In that case, the NR-Light UE may puncture the RBs of PDSCH outside of its receiving bandwidth. Essentially, the embodiments above about how an NR-Light UE deals with PDCCH that has a wider bandwidth than its maximum supported bandwidth can be applied to address the scenarios where the PDSCH bandwidth is wider than its maximum supported bandwidth.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0068">In yet another embodiment, a first PDCCH intended for legacy UEs or UEs supporting a bandwidth equal to or wider than the CORESET#0 bandwidth is used to schedule eSIB1, and a second PDCCH intended for NR-Light UE. To ensure that the second PDCCH falls within the maximum NR-Light UE supported bandwidth, a different hashing function may be used. For example, the hashing function may be devised as follows:</p><p id="p-0071" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mrow>   <mi>L</mi>   <mstyle><mtext>?</mtext></mstyle>   <mrow>    <mo>{</mo>    <mrow>     <mrow>      <mo>(</mo>      <mrow>       <mrow>        <mi>Y</mi>        <mstyle><mtext>?</mtext></mstyle>       </mrow>       <mo>+</mo>       <mrow>        <mo>&#x230a;</mo>        <mfrac>         <mrow>          <mi>m</mi>          <mo>&#x2062;</mo>          <mrow>           <mstyle><mtext>?</mtext></mstyle>           <mo>&#xb7;</mo>           <mi>N</mi>          </mrow>         </mrow>         <mrow>          <mi>L</mi>          <mo>&#xb7;</mo>          <msubsup>           <mi>M</mi>           <mrow>            <mi>s</mi>            <mo>,</mo>            <mi>max</mi>           </mrow>           <mrow>            <mo>(</mo>            <mi>L</mi>            <mo>)</mo>           </mrow>          </msubsup>         </mrow>        </mfrac>        <mo>&#x230b;</mo>       </mrow>       <mo>+</mo>       <mrow>        <mi>n</mi>        <mstyle><mtext>?</mtext></mstyle>       </mrow>      </mrow>      <mo>)</mo>     </mrow>     <mo>&#x2062;</mo>     <mi>mod</mi>     <mo>&#x2062;</mo>     <mrow>      <mo>&#x230a;</mo>      <mrow>       <mi>N</mi>       <mo>/</mo>       <mi>L</mi>      </mrow>      <mo>&#x230b;</mo>     </mrow>    </mrow>    <mo>}</mo>   </mrow>  </mrow>  <mo>+</mo>  <mstyle><mtext>?</mtext></mstyle> </mrow></math></maths><maths id="MATH-US-00001-2" num="00001.2"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mstyle><mtext>?</mtext></mstyle>  <mtext mathsize="6pt">indicates text missing or illegible when filed</mtext> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0072" num="0000"> <img id="CUSTOM-CHARACTER-00001" he="2.96mm" wi="53.51mm" file="US20230007524A1-20230105-P00999.TIF" alt="text missing or illegible when filed" img-content="character" img-format="tif"/><br/>where the number of CCEs in CORESET#0 (N=N<sub>CCE,0</sub>) is used for hashing the first PDCCH intended for legacy UEs or UEs supporting a bandwidth equal to or wider than the CORESET#0 bandwidth, and (N=X), a number of CCEs less than N<sub>CCE,0</sub>, is used for hashing the second PDCCH intended for NR-Light UE.
