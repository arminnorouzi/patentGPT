The press tool <b>31</b> is located between the baking device <b>2</b> and the second conveying component <b>12</b>. The press tool <b>31</b> has at least a compression state and a lifting state. The press tool <b>31</b> is driven by the compression drive <b>32</b> to switch between the two states. When the baking device <b>2</b> is required to start heating, the press tool <b>31</b> is in the compression state to ensure that relative positions of the protruding solder strip <b>201</b> and the back side may not move when the baking device <b>2</b> heats, and the press tool <b>31</b> is in the lifting state upon completion of the heating. In this case, the photovoltaic cell string may move freely on the conveying device <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">With the above configuration, the protruding solder strip <b>201</b> and the back side may keep close contact during soldering, which improves the accuracy of soldering.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In one embodiment, the first conveying component <b>11</b> and/or the third conveying component <b>13</b> are/is provided with a lift drive <b>14</b>.

In this way, the first conveying component <b>11</b> and/or the third conveying component <b>13</b> may have a height difference in the vertical direction relative to the second conveying component <b>12</b>, so that the actions in the second step of the welding step may be in a following sequence. The first conveying component <b>11</b> and the second conveying component <b>12</b> drive the first solar cell string <b>5</b> to move toward a direction away from the second solar cell string <b>6</b>, until the back side of the non-defective solar cell <b>210</b> is located below the baking device <b>2</b>.

The third conveying component <b>13</b> drives the second solar cell string <b>6</b> to move toward a direction close to the non-defective solar cell <b>210</b>, so that the protruding solder strip <b>201</b> of the second solar cell <b>61</b> moves below the baking device <b>2</b> and is located directly above the back side of the non-defective solar cell <b>210</b>.

It is to be noted that the above action process may also be as follows.

The process described is illustrated with an example in which the photovoltaic cell string moves along a direction from the first conveying component <b>11</b> to the third conveying component <b>13</b>. It may be understood that when the feeding direction of the photovoltaic cell string is reversed, that is, when the photovoltaic cell string moves along a direction from the third conveying component <b>13</b> to the first conveying component <b>11</b>, the lift drive <b>14</b> drives the first conveying component <b>11</b> to move along the vertical direction.
