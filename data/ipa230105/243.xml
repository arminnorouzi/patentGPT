As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>4</b></figref>, the liftable table leg includes a bushing <b>1</b>, a second fixing piece <b>2</b>, a lift assembly <b>3</b>, a fixing base <b>4</b>, and a drive assembly <b>6</b>. A first fixing piece <b>13</b> is sleeved on a periphery of a first end <b>11</b> of the bushing <b>1</b>. The second fixing piece <b>2</b> includes a fixing flange <b>21</b> and an accommodation groove <b>22</b>. The first end <b>11</b> is fixed to a bottom end of the accommodation groove <b>22</b> through the first fixing piece <b>13</b>. The lift assembly <b>3</b> includes a lead screw <b>31</b> and a nut <b>32</b>. The nut <b>32</b> is disposed coaxially with the bushing <b>1</b> and fixedly disposed at a second end <b>12</b> of the bushing <b>1</b>. The lead screw <b>31</b> is rotatably disposed in the bushing <b>1</b> and threaded into the nut <b>32</b>. The fixing base <b>4</b> is provided with a through hole. The second fixing piece <b>2</b> is inserted into the through hole and fixedly disposed at the fixing base <b>4</b> through the fixing flange <b>21</b>. The drive assembly <b>6</b> includes a fixing frame. An end of the lead screw <b>31</b> passing through the nut <b>32</b> is rotatably connected to the fixing frame, and the drive assembly <b>6</b> is capable of driving the lead screw <b>31</b> to rotate.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0052">For the liftable table leg, a fixed block traditionally disposed at the bottom of the lead screw <b>31</b> is removed. The first fixing piece <b>13</b> is sleeved outside the bushing <b>1</b> so that the lead screw <b>31</b> is capable of penetrating the first fixing piece <b>13</b>. Therefore, the thickness of the first fixing piece <b>13</b> does not affect the net stroke of the lead screw <b>31</b>. Meanwhile, the bushing <b>1</b> is fixed in the accommodation groove <b>22</b> of the second fixing piece <b>2</b> through the first fixing piece <b>13</b>, and the second fixing piece <b>2</b> is inserted into the through hole of the fixing base <b>4</b>. Therefore, the lead screw <b>31</b> is capable of being closer to the ground and the net lift stroke of the lead screw <b>31</b> is capable of being further increased. The drive assembly <b>6</b> drives the lead screw <b>31</b> to rotate. As the nut <b>32</b> is fixedly connected to the bushing <b>1</b>, the lead screw <b>31</b> moves up and down with respect to the nut <b>32</b> during rotation. The drive assembly <b>6</b> moves up and down synchronously with the lead screw <b>31</b> through the fixing frame to ensure that the drive assembly <b>6</b> is capable always of driving the lead screw <b>31</b> to rotate.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0053">Optionally, the liftable table leg further includes a sliding block <b>311</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the sliding block <b>311</b> is disposed at an end of the lead screw <b>31</b> away from the nut <b>32</b>, and the periphery of the sliding block <b>311</b> abuts against the inner wall of the bushing <b>1</b>. Due to the long legs of the table, when the end of the lead screw <b>31</b> away from the nut <b>32</b> rotates closer to the bottom of the lead screw <b>31</b>, the lead screw <b>31</b> is capable of not always remaining coaxial with the bushing <b>1</b>. Therefore, the lead screw <b>31</b> will shake, causing the table legs to be unable to be stable. The sliding block <b>311</b> is capable of filling the gap between the end of the lead screw <b>31</b> away from the nut <b>32</b>, and the bushing <b>1</b>, so that the lead screw <b>31</b> is always coaxial with the bushing <b>1</b>, and the liftable table leg is always stable during the lifting process.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0054">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the liftable table leg further includes a support base <b>5</b>. The drive assembly <b>6</b> is fixedly disposed in the support base <b>5</b> through the fixing frame. The support base <b>5</b> is capable of covering the drive assembly <b>6</b>, making the liftable table leg more aesthetic and protecting the drive assembly <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0055">The drive assembly <b>6</b> includes a drive motor <b>61</b>, a worm <b>62</b>, and a worm gear <b>63</b>. The drive motor <b>61</b> is fixedly disposed at the fixing frame. The worm <b>62</b> is in transmission connection with an output end of the drive motor <b>61</b>. The worm gear <b>63</b> is rotatably disposed at the fixing frame and is capable of rotating under the driving of the worm <b>62</b>. The end of the lead screw <b>31</b> closer to the fixing frame passes through the worm gear <b>63</b>, and rotates synchronously with the worm gear <b>63</b>. The drive motor <b>61</b> is capable of providing power for adjusting the liftable table leg. The worm gear <b>63</b> and the worm <b>62</b> are capable of changing the transmission direction so that the drive motor <b>61</b> is capable of being disposed laterally without occupying the space at the top of the liftable table leg. Meanwhile, the worm gear <b>63</b> and the worm <b>62</b> are capable of achieving a certain deceleration effect, so that the adjustment speed of the liftable table leg is very smooth.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0056">Optionally, the liftable table leg further includes a guide assembly <b>7</b>. The guide assembly <b>7</b> includes a first sleeve <b>71</b> and a second sleeve <b>72</b>. An end of the first sleeve <b>71</b> is fixedly disposed at the second fixing piece <b>2</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> to <b>4</b></figref>). An end of the second sleeve <b>72</b> is fixedly disposed at the fixing frame, and one of the first sleeve <b>71</b> or the second sleeve <b>72</b> is sleeved outside the other. The first sleeve <b>71</b> and the second sleeve <b>72</b> is capable of further improving the stability of the liftable table leg during the lifting process. Meanwhile, the first sleeve <b>71</b> and the second sleeve <b>72</b> are also capable of hiding the related parts controlling the lifting inside. Therefore, the appearance of the liftable table leg is more aesthetic.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0057">Optionally, the liftable table leg further includes a gap filler <b>73</b>. A gap is provided between the first sleeve <b>71</b> and the second sleeve <b>72</b>. The gap filler <b>73</b> is fixedly disposed at the first sleeve <b>71</b> or the second sleeve <b>72</b>, and the gap filler <b>73</b> circumferentially fills the gap between the first sleeve <b>71</b> and the second sleeve <b>72</b>. The first sleeve <b>71</b> and the second sleeve <b>72</b> each have certain hardness. When the first sleeve <b>71</b> and the second sleeve <b>72</b> are in contact with each other, relative sliding will generate relatively large noise and relatively great friction, which seriously degrades the user experience. The gap filler <b>73</b> is capable of making the first sleeve <b>71</b> and the second sleeve <b>72</b> space apart by a certain gap, greatly reducing noise during sliding. Meanwhile, the gap filler <b>73</b> may be made of the material having a smooth surface. Therefore, the friction between the first sleeve <b>71</b> or the second sleeve <b>72</b> and the gap filler <b>73</b> can be reduced. The user can adjust the height of the liftable table leg more conveniently.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0058">When the liftable table leg is lowered to the lowest height, the fixing frame will collide with the nut <b>32</b>, easily causing damage to the liftable table leg and generating relatively large noise. In order to solve this problem, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the liftable table leg further includes a cushion <b>321</b>. The cushion <b>321</b> is fixedly disposed at the side of the nut <b>32</b> closer to the fixing frame.
