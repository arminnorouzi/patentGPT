A pacemaker uses electrical pulses to prompt the heart to beat at a normal rate. The pacemaker may speed up a slow heart rhythm, control a fast heart rhythm, and coordinate the chambers of the heart. The implantable portions of a pacemaker system generally comprise three main components: a pulse generator, one or more wires called leads, and electrodes found on each lead. The pulse generator produces the electrical signals that make the heart beat. Most pulse generators also have the capability to receive and respond to signals that are sent by the heart. Leads are insulated flexible wires that conduct electrical signals to the heart from the pulse generator. The leads may also relay signals from the heart to the pulse generator. One end of the lead is attached to the pulse generator and the electrode end of the lead is positioned on or in the heart.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In one aspect, a cardiac pacing system is described.

This electrical stimulation may be delivered via electrodes on one or more implantable endocardial or epicardial leads that are positioned in or on the heart. This electrical stimulation may also be delivered using a leadless cardiac pacemaker disposed within a chamber of the heart.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Therapeutic electrical stimulation may be delivered to the heart in the form of electrical pulses or shocks for pacing, cardioversion or defibrillation.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">An implantable cardiac pacemaker may be configured to facilitate the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. The devices, systems and methods of the present disclosure may be used to treat cardiac arrhythmias including, but not limited to, bradycardia, tachycardia, atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation. Resynchronization pacing therapy may also be provided.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">A cardiac pacemaker consistent with the present disclosure may include a pulse generator implanted adjacent the rib cage of the patient, for example, on the ribcage under the pectoral muscles, laterally on the ribcage, within the mediastinum, subcutaneously on the sternum of the ribcage, and the like. One or more leads may be connected to the pulse generator. A lead may be inserted, for example, between two ribs of a patient so that the distal end of the lead is positioned within the mediastinum of the patient adjacent, but not touching, the heart. The distal end of the lead may include an electrode for providing electrical pulse therapy to the patient's heart and may also include at least one sensor for detecting a state of the patient's organs and/or systems. The cardiac pacemaker may include a unitary design where the components of the pulse generator and lead are incorporated within a single form factor. For example, where a first portion of the unitary device resides within the subcutaneous tissue and a second portion of the unitary device is placed through an intercostal space into a location within the mediastinum.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a front-view <b>100</b> of a pulse generator <b>102</b> having features consistent with implementations of the current subject matter.

Various techniques can be employed to avoid damaging important blood-filled structures. For example, sensors can be used to determine the location of the blood-filled structures. Such sensors may include accelerometers configured to monitor pressure waves caused by blood flowing through the blood-filed structures. Sensors configured to emit and detect light-waves may be used to facilitate locating tissues that absorb certain wavelengths of light and thereby locate different types of tissue.

Once the component has reached the desired location, the component may be replaced with the lead or the lead may be inserted within the component. An example of a component can include an expandable sheath. Once the sheath has been advanced to the desired location, a cannula extending the length of the sheath may be expanded, allowing a lead to be pass through the cannula.

The pulse generator can deliver therapeutic electrical pulses through an electrode to regulate a heartbeat of a patient in response to certain conditions being detected in the monitored physiological characteristics of a patient. To monitor the physiological characteristics of a patient, a sensor(s) can be provided in the patient, from which the pulse generator can receive information associated with the physiological characteristics of the patient. However, the sensors not only obtain measurements associated with physiological characteristics of the patient, the sensors also capture noise from exogenous or endogenous sources and signals unrelated to the monitored physiological characteristics. Consequently, the pulse generator can be configured to filter out, or normalize, the noise and signals.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0197">Signal preparation <b>1702</b> prepares the sensing signals for use by the downstream system/algorithms. This stage is primarily focused on the signals used for sensing, not the vector used for pacing. The signal preparation stage <b>1702</b> can take all of the available input signals <b>1704</b> from the system (e.g., ECG pairs, respiration, blood oximetry, etc.), apply filters to these signals <b>1706</b>, identify noise contained within these signals, determine which signals are acceptable for use and then select the preferred signals for downstream sensing algorithms. The signal preparation stage can continually monitor all of the signals to determine if changes to the selected signal are required.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0198">There are many sources of noise that can interfere with the quality of the signal being sensed by the cardiac pacing system. For example, noise can be generated from the patient's own muscle tissue. When a patient flexes a muscle, signals caused by, for example, electrical waves, pressure waves, temperature changes, and the like, can be detected by the sensors associated with a cardiac pacing system. Another example of noise that can cause a distortion in the signals being received by the cardiac pacing system is radio frequency interference. Radio frequency interference can come from the components of the cardiac pacing system itself, from other components within the body, from external sources such as cell phones, electrical cables, and the like. The effect of these signals, or noise, can be accounted for by filtering.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0199">The cardiac pacing system, configured to monitor the patient's heart, can include hardware filters <b>1710</b>, software filters <b>1712</b> and gain amplifiers <b>1714</b> for filtering out the noise or interference signals <b>1706</b> detected by sensors of the cardiac pacing system. The filtering <b>1706</b> can be applied in series or become a product of multiple parallel processes to yield a useable signal for downstream operations.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0200">Hardware filters <b>1710</b> are fixed filters within the hardware of the cardiac pacing system. Hardware filters <b>1710</b> are designed to remove noise and apply a basic set of filtering in preparation for the operations of the software filters <b>1712</b>. Hardware filters <b>1710</b> can be configured to cancel out or account for signals not generated from the patient's heart using hardware filtering solutions. In some variations, the cardiac pacing system can use a fixed hardware low-pass filter, a fixed high-pass filter, a notch filter and the like. In some variations, the cardiac pacing system can use a series of hardware filters <b>1710</b> to create a desired band-pass filter response. Some filter types contemplated include Butterworth, Chebyshev, and the like.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0201">Multiple hardware filter band-pass filter ranges can be used to filter different signals for the cardiac pacing system.

Software filters <b>1712</b> can be configured to account for exogenous signals using software filtering solutions. Software filters <b>1712</b> can be modifiable by firmware/software to be applied to one or more sensed signals <b>1704</b>. Examples of modifiable software filters include a permanent digital filter <b>1716</b> that is controllable via the programmer, a dynamic filter <b>1718</b> which is automatically adjusted based upon certain criteria and an active baseline algorithm <b>1720</b> to ensure the sensing signal remains centered about the &#x201c;zero&#x201d; baseline.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0204">Software filters <b>1712</b> can be executed by one or more processors of the cardiac pacing system, such as being embodied in controller <b>302</b> of pulse generator <b>102</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.

Because the cardiac pacing system can sense numerous physiologic signals (e.g., ECG, respiration, pulse oximetry), the signal inputs <b>1704</b> for each of the physiologic signals can vary. A digital filter <b>1716</b> can be used in combination with hardware filters <b>1710</b> to refine desired bandpass settings. For example, the cardiac pacing system's fixed hardware filters <b>1710</b> may be applied to an ECG input channel using a 3 Hz to 30 Hz bandpass. Following the hardware filters <b>1710</b>, a digital filter <b>1716</b> may subsequently refine the signal further to 9 Hz to 24 Hz.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0206">A digital filter <b>1716</b> can be programmed to modify its filtering upon meeting certain conditions. For example, when additional data is collected by the cardiac pacing system suggesting a bandpass setting may be too broad and should be narrowed, upon reaching such determination, the digital filter <b>1716</b> can be reprogrammed to adjust the bandpass setting accordingly. Such reprogramming can be executed by the physician using one or more processors controlled by the programmer <b>320</b>, or automatically by the cardiac pacing system.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0207">Modifications to a digital filter <b>1716</b> can be made based on other unrelated signals sensed by the cardiac pacing system. For example, upon sensing an increased respiratory rate by one sensing channel, the digital filter <b>1716</b> for an independent ECG sensing channel can be automatically adjusted to refine the bandpass settings, and the subsequent data, being collected during the time of increased respiratory rate. Similarly, when the respiratory rate returns to normal, the digital filter <b>1716</b> for the ECG sensing channel can return to its original bandpass setting. Similar modifications can be made in response to posture changes, heart rate or the like.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0208">Software filters <b>1712</b> can be configured to dynamically filter noise signals. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>B</figref> is an illustration of an exemplary process flow for dynamic filtering <b>1718</b> of signals, having features consistent with the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0209">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>B</figref> at <b>1718</b>, the incoming signal(s) can be dynamically filtered.

The secondary digital filter <b>1730</b> can be layered into the sensing architecture so that the secondary digital filter <b>1730</b> can be utilized, or deactivated, without affecting the permanent digital filter <b>1716</b>. Dynamic filtering can provide more timely changes to the cardiac pacing system's sensing architecture for specific known events and based on assessment of certain criteria.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0210">The filtered signal is assessed and processed based on one or more criteria <b>1732</b>. The set of criteria <b>1732</b> being assessed include changes in signal amplitude, heart rate, posture, transthoracic impedance, ventricular pacing, ventricular sensing, atrial pacing, atrial sensing, morphology, frequency analysis on the template of the sensed signal, noise, states of the implanted pulse generator, and the like. Morphology assessments can include assessing monophasic or biphasic characteristics of the cardiac signal, such as narrow vs. wide signal complexes, patterns of peaks and nadirs and timing between particular signal characteristics on one or more input signals. States of the implanted pulse generator include storage mode prior to implant, set up mode at the time of implant, follow-up mode while communicating with the programmer, explant mode while surgically removing the cardiac pacing system, or other protective states that may be utilized in the presence of surgical procedures such as electrocautery, ultrasound, MRI or the like.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0211">At <b>1734</b>, a determination is made as to whether the signal meets the one or more criteria being assessed <b>1732</b>. In response to a determination that the signal does not meet the criteria, no additional filter changes are required, and the signal is ready to be passed to downstream algorithms. At <b>1736</b>, in response to a determination that the signal does meet the criteria, a determination can be made as to whether to alter the dynamic filter response. In response to a determination that the bandpass frequency should be altered, at <b>1738</b>, the filter frequency response can be changed and the signals are then reprocessed through the modified filter. In response to a determination that the bandpass frequency should not be altered, the signals are then presented to the cardiac pacing system's downstream algorithms for processing.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0212">Dynamically filtering <b>1718</b> can be initiated during certain testing regiments performed by the programmer, such as programmer <b>320</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. Such testing regiments can be performed following the implant procedure or in connection with certain follow-up testing. For example, a physician can apply certain dynamic filtering assessments when obtaining patient input during the setup procedure. Obtaining such user input can facilitate the normalization process for the cardiac pacing system, especially when conducting, for example, posture analysis, exercising, and the like.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0213">An alternative example where the programmer initiates a dynamic filtering assessment is within a noisy environment. Radio frequency communication can introduce noise in the environment affecting communication between various elements of the cardiac pacing system. Sensors within the programmer and/or the cardiac pacing system can identify a high degree of radio frequency noise in the environment and temporarily activate the second dynamic filter <b>1730</b> during the communication session with the programmer. Consequently, the cardiac pacing system can modify the distorted signals through dynamic filtering <b>1718</b> to allow the intended testing within the noisy environment.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0214">Dynamic filtering <b>1718</b> can be initiated by the cardiac pacing system based on changes in the physiological characteristics of the patient and the patient's environment. For example, if the patient's heart rate increases, the bandpass filter frequency may be narrowed temporarily by activating a second digital filter <b>1730</b> to ensure T-waves are filtered more aggressively. Such dynamic filtering adjustments can avoid over-detection of sensed signals. Similarly, if a patient works in an environment producing a high degree of noise (e.g., welder, electrician), dynamic filtering <b>1718</b> can temporarily filter the dominant frequency of the environmental noise and avoid the potential for overlying noise or saturation of sensed signals. Preventing saturation enables the cardiac pacing system to avoid missing critical indicators of heart arrhythmias, dyssynchrony, and the like.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0215">A baseline reference value (or &#x201c;baseline&#x201d;) is a representation of zero input on a sensing channel. With no input on a sensing channel, the signal will come to rest at the baseline value. Deflections from this baseline occur in response to measured input from the patient. For example, as the heart beats, a P-wave, QRS and T-wave are noted on the ECG. These waves are noted as voltage departures from the signal baseline on the ECG sensing channel. For proper sensing operation, it is important that the signal baseline be maintained at the zero input level such that any measurements from a sensor are accurately represented as an electrical delta from zero. Should the baseline of the signal wander away from zero, the sensing algorithms can be misled leading to inadvertent therapeutic response. Exogenous noise or patient movement can cause the baseline signal to shift even though the patient is perfectly normal and does not require therapeutic pacing treatment. Software filters <b>1712</b> and algorithmic processes can be configured to account for such baseline shifts, distinguish between treatable and non-treatable rhythms, and establish new temporary baselines in these circumstances.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0216">The active baseline algorithm <b>1720</b> initiates temporary and remedial actions to maintain or reestablish a proper sensing baseline upon a unique baseline-shifting event. The active baseline algorithm <b>1720</b> is then deactivated upon correction of the baseline. For example, a defibrillation shock can cause the sensing inputs of the cardiac pacing system to become saturated and could inappropriately trigger heartbeat detections. This in turn could cause an inappropriate inhibition of pacing therapy delivery. The active baseline algorithm <b>1720</b> can recognize the temporary signal saturation as a defibrillation shock. To remediate the event, the active baseline algorithm <b>1720</b> can temporarily apply more aggressive filtering and algorithmic mechanisms to reestablish an appropriate baseline allowing the cardiac pacing system to make appropriate decisions based on the correct baseline signal.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0217">In certain situations, the cardiac pacing system and the device producing the defibrillation (ICD) are in active communication with another. When notified by the ICD of a pending shock with or without post-shock pacing by the ICD, the active baseline algorithm <b>1720</b> can prophylactically condition the cardiac pacing system's sensing filters and algorithms accordingly. The resultant sensing signals following the shock will therefore maintain a proper sensing baseline and are acceptable for downstream system evaluation.</p><p id="p-0219" num="0218">In addition to reestablishing a proper baseline following a defibrillation shock, the active baseline algorithm <b>1720</b> can temporarily alter the pacing mode of the cardiac pacing system. The heart rate can be monitored by various sensors on various leads in communication with the cardiac pacing system. Hardware and software filters can be configured to update the dynamic baseline algorithm <b>1720</b>, or their level of filtering, based on the detected heart rate. Such dynamic modifications enable the cardiac pacing system to utilize an increased pacing rate or higher pacing output in a post-shock manner. For example, the active baseline algorithm <b>1720</b> can temporarily cause the cardiac pacing system to switch from a VDD mode with 50 ppm, 3.0V @ 1.0 ms to a VVI mode with 75 ppm, max output for 30 seconds.</p><p id="p-0220" num="0219">Baseline reestablishment by the active baseline algorithm <b>1720</b> can be a repetitive process. For example, shortly after a defibrillation shock and more aggressive filter application, the sensors may continue to fail to provide meaningful readings. The active baseline algorithm <b>1720</b> can repeatedly cause the cardiac pacing system to refine filters or generate new filter schemes to cause the sensors to function properly and provide the desired information.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0220">The active baseline algorithm <b>1720</b> can be updated based on whether the cardiac pacing system is in a sensing mode or a pacing mode. When the cardiac system is in a pacing mode it is, itself, generating electrical signals. This condition can alter or saturate one or more of the sensors. For example, the cardiac pacing system can be configured to alter the sense/pace filters of one or more specific sensing signals based on whether the cardiac pacing system is sensing or pacing.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0221">This can occur based on a time duration of a single case of pacing, or based on some percentage of time in which the cardiac pacing system is pacing.</p><p id="p-0223" num="0222"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> is an illustration <b>1800</b> of an exemplary process flow for altering software filters and the active baseline algorithm in response to providing pacing therapy. At <b>1802</b>, a signal can be sensed by the cardiac pacing system. At <b>1804</b>, a determination can be made as to whether the cardiac pacing system is currently pacing the patient. At <b>1806</b>, in response to a determination that the cardiac pacing system is currently providing pacing therapy, the software filters can be altered to maintain an appropriate baseline from the resultant processed signal. At <b>1808</b>, in response to a determination that the cardiac pacing system is not currently providing pacing therapy, the noise can be filtered from the signal.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0223">A cardiac pacing system can include gain amplifiers <b>1714</b>. Gain amplifiers <b>1714</b> can be executed by one or more processors of the cardiac pacing system, such as may be embodied in controller <b>302</b> of pulse generator <b>102</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. Gain amplifiers <b>1714</b> can be executed by one or more processors of a programmer, such as programmer <b>320</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0225" num="0224">Gain amplifiers <b>1714</b> can adjust the gain of the sensed signal to generate a stable signal that is acceptable for use by downstream algorithms. For example, typical signal processing includes a phase where the analog signal is converted into the digital domain (ADC). At times, a gain multiplier/divider is applied to the analog and/or digital signal in order to improve the signal's representation to the downstream detection system.</p><p id="p-0226" num="0225">Fixed and automatic gain control schemes can be used by the cardiac pacing system. Fixed gain control schemes use a specific gain for a specified period of time. Automatic gain control schemes continually adjust the gain based upon the size of the sensed signal. A combination of a fixed and automatic gain scheme can also be utilized. The cardiac pacing system selects or automatically adjusts gain schemes based upon a preferred sensing signal. For example, one gain scheme may be selected for ECG signals, while a differing gain scheme is selected for blood oximetry signals.</p><p id="p-0227" num="0226">Following filtering and other signal preparation, the cardiac pacing system then evaluates whether the resultant signals are of sufficient quality to be processed for downstream sensing algorithms. The cardiac pacing system continually analyzes all of the available sensed signals against their corresponding set of acceptability requirements. Acceptability factors include signal amplitudes, signal-to-noise ratios, signal widths, frequency spectrum and time ratios. The acceptability factor for any particular signal can be further modified based upon other factors such as heart rate, posture, time of day or upon information provided by other sensors from the cardiac pacing system. For any particular sensed signal, there is a minimum acceptability score the signal must pass. A signal is discarded from further evaluation if the signal is below the minimum acceptability score. If the signal quality is passing, the signal continues to be processed, evaluated and analyzed.</p><p id="p-0228" num="0227">While the cardiac pacing system analyzes numerous physiological characteristics such as the patient's electrocardiogram, respiration, blood oximetry, temperature, and the like, the signal selection algorithm gives preference to those signals that result in the highest sensitivity and specificity for triggering detections in response to a heartbeat or other events of interest such as skeletal muscle contraction. As such, the signal selection algorithm can dynamically preference certain sensed signals over others. Therefore, while several physiological signals are deemed equally usable because they receive passing acceptability scores, the signal selection algorithm can apply greater weight to certain signals (e.g., electrocardiogram) to other passing signals (e.g., respiratory rate) because they are more deterministic for triggering heartbeat detections. The signal selection algorithm can use a predetermined signal preference order, or alternatively, the signal preference order can be weighted differently based upon certain factors such as signal amplitude, signal-to-noise ratio, signal width, timing ratios and the like.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0228">In certain circumstances, the cardiac pacing system assesses multiple signals for the same physiological characteristic. For example, respiratory rate signals from two different sensing pairs receive passing acceptability scores. The signal selection algorithm can analyze and select the sensing signal resulting in the best signal for electrocardiogram analysis. Alternatively, the signal selection algorithm can combine two or more signals in a manner that yields an improved composite signal for sensing evaluation. Different mathematical processes can be applied to each or combined signal(s) to yield the desired composite sensing signal. These processes may include summing/subtracting signals, multiplying or dividing one signal from others, combining the differentiated or integrated signal from other signals or other mathematical combinational methods</p><p id="p-0230" num="0229">A cardiac pacing system can include a smart switch algorithm. The smart switch algorithm can automatically initiate additional sensing and prepare to switch to an alternative sensing signal in response to certain defined detected events. The smart switch algorithm can be configured to monitor certain detected events. Examples of detected events the smart switch algorithm can monitor include signal amplitude, heart rate, posture, pace/sense modes, and/or other characteristics of the heart, patient, and/or cardiac pacing system. Upon sensing such a detected event, the smart switch algorithm can automatically switch the primary sensing signal to an alternative sensing signal upon confirmation of such detected event. For example, the manner in which signals travel through the body can change if the patient's posture changes from supine to standing. Consequently, a particular sensing signal may be the most appropriate signal in one posture, but ineffective in a second posture. As a result of programming, or learning from previous events, the smart switch algorithm can anticipate the inappropriateness of the signal selection based on the detected event and prophylactically switches to alternative sensing signal(s).</p><p id="p-0231" num="0230">As an example, a first sensor can be disposed in the patient's body and configured to detect a first physiological characteristic of the patient. A pulse generator, receiving signals from the first sensor can be configured to have the first physiological characteristic being the primary physiological characteristic for monitoring by the cardiac pacing system. An event can occur that saturates the sensing capabilities of the first sensor, making the sensor ineffective at detecting whether or not the heart is functioning properly. The smart switch algorithm can be configured to select a second physiological characteristic as being the primary physiological characteristic for monitoring by the cardiac pacing system in response to the first sensor becoming saturated. For example, if the amplitude of the ECG increases due to changes in posture, resulting in ECG amplifier saturation, the smart switch algorithm can switch to monitoring pressure waves generated by the heart.</p><p id="p-0232" num="0231">The cardiac pacing system can use the resultant processed sensing signal(s) to analyze whether pacing a patient's heart is appropriate. Accurately sensing atrial and ventricular activity enables the cardiac pacing system to assess the need for therapy delivery, and the appropriate pacing mode for the patient.</p><p id="p-0233" num="0232">The cardiac pacing system of the present disclosure can be configured to monitor the activity and origin of a sensed cardiac signal. The cardiac pacing system can be configured to detect the functioning of the cardiac muscles and to provide therapy accordingly. In some variations, the cardiac pacing system can detect the functioning of the cardiac muscles using one or more accelerometers.</p><p id="p-0234" num="0233">Sensitive accelerometers can be configured to detect motion of cardiac tissue. Accelerometer(s) can be disposed adjacent the heart of the patient. For example, accelerometer(s) can be placed in the mediastinum, intercostally, and/or in other locations suitable for sensing. The accelerometer can be configured to measure the degree of motion imparted onto the accelerometer by the beating heart.</p><p id="p-0235" num="0234">A beating heart causes a pressure wave to be emitted from it. The accelerometer can be configured to detect the localized tissue movement due to the pressure wave and provide indications on the functionality of the heart by analyzing the resultant signal. However, the accelerometer can also be affected by exogenous motion attributable to other factors, such as movement of the patient, breathing, sound waves, and the like. In certain instances, this exogenous motion can dwarf the motion attributable to the pressure waves from the heart.</p><p id="p-0236" num="0235">Exogenous motion can be filtered from the received signals using a combination of hardware and software filters as previously described. Exogenous motion can be also be filtered from the received signals when at least two sources are used to facilitate the detection of the motion of the heart. Subcutaneous accelerometer(s) (SA) can be placed, for example, on the pectoral region of the patient. A second heart accelerometer (HA) can be placed adjacent the heart, for example, on a lead inserted through the intercostal space in the region of the anterior mediastinum. Movement of the heart causes pressure waves travelling through tissues of the patient to be detected by both accelerometers, but each accelerometer receives a different signal based on the path taken and the interference or exogenous motion added during propagation of the signal. In some cases, the intensity of the interference or exogenous motion can far exceed the intensity of any pressure wave attributable to the functioning of the heart. Consequently, the interference or exogenous motion detected by the accelerometers can dwarf the pressure wave signal attributable to the heart.</p><p id="p-0237" num="0236">The SA can be configured to transmit subcutaneous vibration measurement(s) to the pulse generator. The HA can be configured to transmit a cardiac vibration measurement to the pulse generator. The pulse generator can be configured to factor the subcutaneous vibration measurement(s) from the SA into the cardiac vibration measurement from the HA to assess a physiological characteristic of the heart. In some variations, the factored vibration measurement can be processed using one or more filters. In some variations, the cardiac vibration measurement and/or the subcutaneous vibration measurement can be processed using one or more filters prior to being factored. The resultant vibration measurement can provide a desired signal that the cardiac pacing system can analyze to assess heart functionality.</p><p id="p-0238" num="0237">In some variations, the SA can be disposed within the housing of the pulse generator, at the end of a lead disposed within the patient, and the like. In some variations, multiple HA and SA accelerometers can be used. The multiple HAs and SAs can be disposed at different locations throughout the body. For example, multiple HAs can be disposed about the heart. The HAs being at different locations can facilitate determination of the movement, or beating, of different portions of the heart. In this manner, a virtual model of the complete functionality of the heart can be generated which can form the basis of adjustments to the pacing by the cardiac pacing system.</p><p id="p-0239" num="0238">Triggering of certain heartbeat detections can be performed by the cardiac pacing system using one or more acoustic sensors. Acoustic sensors function similarly to a stethoscope. As such, acoustic sensors can be configured to detect sound waves generated by the heart. The cardiac pacing system can sense and analyze sound wave signals to determine whether or not pacing therapy is required. Analysis of the sensed sound wave signals can include identification of known sounds, such as the sounds made when the mitral and tricuspid valves close (S1 sounds). Analyzing sound waves can be an effective way to separate T-wave signals, a period of relatively little acoustic pressure, from QRS complex and S1 sounds, when T-wave signals become a prominent component of the ECG signal. The cardiac pacing system can be configured to use filters, such as the filters described herein, to separate exogenous sounds from the cardiac sounds prior to the analysis by algorithms of the cardiac pacing system.</p><p id="p-0240" num="0239"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>A</figref> is an example of an ECG <b>1901</b> of a patient having prominent T-wave signals. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>B</figref> is an example of a simultaneous acoustic signal <b>1902</b>. These figures demonstrate that acoustic signals can be used to distinguish desirable signal attributes such as ventricular depolarization (the R-wave on the ECG and the S1 from the heart sound signal) from undesirable signal attributes such as ventricular repolarization (the T-wave on the ECG and the S2 from the heart sound signal). In this example, the corresponding T-wave event on the acoustic signal is less prominent than the same T-wave event shown on the ECG.</p><p id="p-0241" num="0240"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> is an illustration <b>2000</b> of an exemplary process flow for processing acoustic signals obtained by the cardiac pacing system, having features consistent with the present disclosure.

The functioning of the particular chambers of the heart can be monitored in similar manners as the general cardiac sensing techniques described herein. Additionally, the filtering techniques described in the present disclosure apply equally to atrial sensing as they to do to ventricular sensing, and sensing of the heart generally.</p><p id="p-0244" num="0243">The cardiac pacing system can include multiple sensors at multiple sensing vectors around the heart. The sensing vectors can be at predefined locations, or along predefined planes, relative to the patient's heart. The sensors creating the multiple sensing vectors can be configured to triangulate, and therefore pinpoint, the location of a source of a signal and determine how and where the signal is propagating.</p><p id="p-0245" num="0244">ECG signals can propagate from the heart through other anatomical structures within the body. The propagation of the ECG signal can be obtained by the multiple sensors. The cardiac pacing system can be configured to process the propagated signals to determine if the source of the ECG signal originates from higher within the thorax, near the atrium of the heart, or lower within the thorax, near the ventricle of the heart.</p><p id="p-0246" num="0245">For example, a sensor on the pulse generator (SPG) placed over the sternum will have a unique angle and shorter distance to the atria than an alternative sensor (SA) placed in the intracostal space inferior to the pulse generator. Signal analyses of a particular feature can be performed to determine differences in amplitudes and relative timing. Due to proximity, the feature as measured from SPG will have larger amplitude and occur before the feature as it is measured from SA. These timing relationships can be used to determine whether the origin of the signal is atrial or ventricular in nature and the direction of signal propagation.</p><p id="p-0247" num="0246">In some cases, alignment of various elements of the cardiac cycle may be used for timing comparison between sense vectors. These features can include the onset (starting point), completion (ending point), mid-point, inflection point, zero-slope point, positive peak (signal maximum), negative peak (signal minimum), steepest slope, or area under the curve of a particular portion of the ECG (P-wave, QRS, T-wave, etc.). These alignment points can be compared across multiple sense vectors to identify timing relationships. Additionally, multiple alignment points can be combined during the comparative analysis with an alternate sense vector. Signal elements from other non-ECG sensors (accelerometer, blood oximetry, pulse pressure, etc.) can also be used for alignment purposes.</p><p id="p-0248" num="0247">The cardiac pacing system can be designed with a dedicated signal triangulation circuit or real-time algorithm that continually outputs the calculated source location of the signal source. The output of the signal triangulation can consist of a matrix ID or a grid coordinate method to represent the location of the signal source. This output can be calibrated for the patient automatically by the cardiac pacing system or with physician input via a programmer, such as programmer <b>320</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. For example, following implantation of the cardiac pacing system, a calibration routine can be used to analyze the real-time signals from multiple ECG vectors available from the cardiac pacing system. This calibration can include input from the physician to specify or confirm the P-wave or R-wave elements of the ECG. Once confirmed, the cardiac pacing system can identify the range of coordinates that each real-time signal represents, and the direction of the signal's propagation.</p><p id="p-0249" num="0248">Signal triangulation can guide therapy delivery for the cardiac pacing system. For example, signal triangulation can be used to identify instances when an atrial signal does not conduct to the ventricle. In these instances, the cardiac pacing system can deliver a ventricular pacing pulse to assist with proper cardiac conduction. Alternatively, signal triangulation can be used to confirm intrinsic ventricular depolarization and inhibit pacing therapy.</p><p id="p-0250" num="0249"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b>A</figref> is an illustration <b>2100</b> of an exemplary process flow for an atrial template reference having features consistent with the current subject matter. An atrial template reference can use a known template for a particular signal for comparison against a signal detected by one or more sensors of the cardiac pacing system. This comparison can be performed to find P-waves on a live streaming signal. The atrial template signal can be collected by a programmer, such as programmer <b>320</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, and fed into a controller, such as controller <b>302</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.

In some variations, multiple templates can be obtained that reflect the signal template when the patient is in different postures, has different heart rates, for different sense vectors, and other like parameters.</p><p id="p-0251" num="0250">During sinus rhythms, the interval between consecutive P waves does not change significantly on a beat-to-beat basis. Consequently, the cardiac pacing system can be configured to use an &#x201c;expectation window&#x201d; to determine when in time a subsequent P-wave would be expected to occur. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b>B</figref> is an illustration of a P-wave signal illustrating an &#x201c;expectation window.&#x201d; Within this window, the signal can be analyzed and compared to the known template in order to confirm the presence of a P-wave. By limiting this analysis to the expectation window, false positive matches to other signal features such as the T-wave can be avoided or minimized.</p><p id="p-0252" num="0251">Expectation windows can also be used to identify irregular P-wave intervals indicative of atrial arrhythmias. In response to identifying these irregular intervals, the pacing mode or other settings can be automatically altered to ensure appropriate pacing therapy continues. Settings can then automatically revert back to the previous settings when regular intervals are identified and the arrhythmia terminates.</p><p id="p-0253" num="0252">AV delays can be similarly triggered once a P-wave is confirmed. The AV delay can also be adjusted based on the timing location of the peak, onset, termination, and the like, of the P-wave. In some variations, the &#x201c;expectation window&#x201d; can be based on a combination of average heart rate for the patient and the preceding P-P interval or R-R interval. The duration of the expectation window can also be automatically shortened or lengthened based upon the heart rate, or adjusted via the programmer.</p><p id="p-0254" num="0253">At <b>2102</b>, the average heart rate (HR) of the patient can be obtained.

At <b>2110</b>, the AV delay can be initiated and adjusted for the detected P-wave peak timing.</p><p id="p-0255" num="0254">While expectation windows have been disclosed with reference to atrial signals, the description is additionally applicable for ventricular signals. For example, expectation windows can be used to determine when in time a subsequent R-wave would be expected to occur.</p><p id="p-0256" num="0255">Following the filtering stage and selection of the preferred sensing signals for analysis, the cardiac pacing system can then analyze these signals for heartbeat detections and assess the need for therapy delivery. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref> is an illustration of an exemplary process flow <b>2200</b> for analyzing sensed signals for the triggering and authentication of heartbeat detections, having features consistent with the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0257" num="0256">Detection profiles are used to trigger heartbeat detections from a selected sensing signal. A detection profile is a threshold value used for comparison with the preferred sensing signal. If the sensing signal exceeds the detection profile threshold, a heartbeat detection is triggered. If the sensing signal remains below the detection profile threshold, sensing continues until a heartbeat detections is triggered.</p><p id="p-0258" num="0257">Detection profiles can take many forms and are based upon the type of sensing signal being analyzed. A horizontal, equipotential level (horizontal line) is an example of a detection profile. In this example, a fixed horizontal detection profile of 5 mV will trigger a heartbeat detection when the sensing signal exceeds the 5 mV detection profile threshold. The detection profiles can include horizontal (equipotential) elements, decaying elements of various shapes such as fixed slope, exponential decays, and the like, increasing slope elements of various shapes such as fixed slope, exponential growths, and the like, or a combination of elements.</p><p id="p-0259" num="0258">Detection profiles are selected based upon the type of sensing signal being analyzed. Similarly, multiple detection profiles can be used for a particular sensing signal. For example, the cardiac pacing system will select a detection profile designed for ECG sensing over a detection profile for a respiration signal when analyzing an ECG signal. Similarly, the cardiac pacing system will select a detection profile designed for atrial ECG sensing over a detection profile for ventricular ECG sensing when analyzing an ECG signal for P-waves by the sensing algorithms described herein.</p><p id="p-0260" num="0259">Detection profiles can include periods where heartbeat detections are temporarily inhibited. Such periods can be used immediately following the triggering of an initial heartbeat detection in order to prevent a subsequent erroneous heartbeat detection for some period of time. Furthermore, heartbeat detections from one sensing signal may initiate non-detection periods on alternate sensing signals.</p><p id="p-0261" num="0260">Elements of the detection profile and non-detection windows can be automatically adjusted based upon attributes of the sensing signal such as mode of pacing, ectopic cardiac events, signal amplitude, heart rate, time of day or other sensor input such as accelerometer or posture, and the like.</p><p id="p-0262" num="0261">Morphology comparison methods can be used as a means to trigger heartbeat detections and identify the occurrence of specific cardiac events. This comparison method may be performed in real-time using morphology detection algorithms or hardware circuitry. For example, if the morphological shape of a ventricular depolarization is known from an ECG signal, a template of that known shape can be created and used for subsequent comparison. The template can then be continually scanned in real-time throughout the sensing signal to identify when the known shape reoccurs. When a pattern match is noted, a heartbeat detection can be declared. As a result, this method can identify the occurrence of a subsequent ventricular depolarization.</p><p id="p-0263" num="0262">The template can be collected by a programmer, such as programmer <b>320</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, and fed into a controller, such as controller <b>302</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. In some variations, the template can be automatically generated and stored within electronic storage of the pulse generator, such as electronic storage <b>308</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. Historical templates can be used to generate or update a primary template, or a primary template can be a based upon the compilation of some number of previous heartbeat detections.</p><p id="p-0264" num="0263">In some variations, multiple templates can be obtained that reflect the template when the patient is in different postures, has different heart rates, for different sense vectors, and for other like parameters. Furthermore, the selection of the appropriate template for comparison can be automatically updated based upon factors including pacing mode, heart rate, posture, time of day or other measures of the input signals. Alternatively, several measured or artificially created templates can be stored by the cardiac pacing system and used for the morphology detection algorithms.</p><p id="p-0265" num="0264">Different elements of sensed signals can be used for comparison purposes. For example, ventricular depolarizations may be used to store the ventricular signal template, while a separate signal template is stored for atrial depolarization detections. Furthermore, non-heartbeat signals and templates can be used for morphology comparisons. For example, a unique shape of the respiration signal can be used to count the number of breaths per period of time, indicative of the respiratory rate.</p><p id="p-0266" num="0265">Morphology comparison methods can be performed with software and/or hardware processing. Automatic adjustment of the signal or stored template can be performed prior to or during the morphology comparison process. Such adjustments include scaling methods of the amplitude or width, time shifting of either the signal or stored shape, or the like.</p><p id="p-0267" num="0266">Morphology detection methods can be used independently, or in conjunction with certain detection profiles. For example, a detection profile can be used first to trigger a heartbeat detection. This initial heartbeat detection can then initiate a morphology comparison algorithm to confirm or call into question the initial heartbeat detection. Alternatively, both algorithms may be operating in parallel to independently evaluate heartbeat detections.</p><p id="p-0268" num="0267">Alternative sensing methods can be analyzed to confirm or question certain sensing signals collected by the cardiac pacing system. Sensors collecting information regarding a patient's activity and respiration rate provide the cardiac pacing system additional analysis tools to confirm heartbeat detections and assess the need for therapy delivery.</p><p id="p-0269" num="0268">Activity sensors can be used to determine the current activity levels of the patient. Activity sensors such as accelerometers can be used to indicate patient movement and activity and can be, for example, incorporated into an implanted pulse generator housing. The accelerometer signal can be analyzed to determine the degree of movement by the patient. As patient movement increases, heart rate demands generally rise as well.</p><p id="p-0270" num="0269">An algorithmic comparison of the actual versus ideal heart rate for any given degree of movement can be used to automatically adjust a cardiac pacing system's rate-responsive pacing rate. If the activity sensor indicates a high degree of patient movement, yet the measured heart rate falls below the ideal heart rate by a pre-determined range, the pacing rate may be temporarily increased. The degree of heart rate increase is related to the degree of activity, up to a predetermined maximum pacing rate. Conversely, when the activity sensor indicates less motion, the pacing rate can be reduced over-time to some pre-determined lower pacing rate.</p><p id="p-0271" num="0270">Filtering of the accelerometer signal can separate outside motion from the actual movement of the patient. For example, filtering can be used to separate the motion from a patient sitting calmly in their car as compared to a patient running up a set of stairs.</p><p id="p-0272" num="0271">Respiration sensing can be used to determine the current activity levels of the patient. As a patient's activity increases, oxygen demand generally increases and the respiration rate and volume increase accordingly. By detecting these changes in respiration, heart rate requirements can be assessed. If respiration rate and/or volume increase without a correlative heart rate increase, the pacing rate can be automatically increased to improve hemodynamic response for the patient.</p><p id="p-0273" num="0272">Respiration sensing can be used in conjunction with activity sensing to improve the cardiac pacing system's response. If an activity increase is noted and a correlative respiration increase is not observed, exogenous noise activity can be suspected. The cardiac pacing system can analyze additional sensed signals to assess whether the discrepancy is noise related. If so, the cardiac pacing system can alter its primary sensing profile to an alternative sensing profile in efforts to avoid the discrepancy and assess an actual heart rate. Additionally, the information about the discrepancy can be retained by the cardiac pacing system as a detected event for future smart switch algorithm usage.</p><p id="p-0274" num="0273">Leads and electrodes placed in locations consistent with the current subject matter will be in relatively close proximity to the lungs. This proximity to the lung can facilitate several methods to assess changes in lung status such as pulmonary edema. Methods to detect changes in lung fluid status include the delivery of sub-stimulation levels of energy with a pacing vector that includes a portion of the lung tissue. Changing fluid levels in the lung will result in changes in measured impedance.</p><p id="p-0275" num="0274">Changes in pulmonary status are generally caused by heart failure or other cardiac conditions requiring medical treatment. As such, sensed changes in lung status can be communicated to the physician at in-person visits or remotely to facilitate appropriate medical treatment. Additionally, the pacing mode, pacing rate and pacing energy can be automatically adjusted in response to changes in lung status.</p><p id="p-0276" num="0275">Leads and electrodes placed in locations consistent with the current subject matter can include temperature probes. Temperature measurements within the mediastinum can be recorded by the cardiac pacing system and provided to a physician during in-person visits or remotely. Recording temperature data over time creates a normal temperature pattern. Aberrations in the normal temperature pattern can be detected and communicated to a physician so a definitive diagnosis and appropriate medical treatment can be performed and prescribed. Additionally, the pacing mode, pacing rate and pacing energy can be automatically adjusted in response to temperature changes.</p><p id="p-0277" num="0276">Authentication is a confirmation process used to ensure the accuracy of the sensing signal(s) and that the subsequent heartbeat detections or inhibition decisions made by the cardiac pacing system are appropriate. The authentication process utilizes algorithms to analyze heartbeat detection decisions from multiple signal inputs and multiple signal processing steps for a consistent decision. If discrepancies are found from one input or process to another, the cardiac pacing system can change the sensing signal or detection process that consistently makes the most appropriate heartbeat detection decisions.</p><p id="p-0278" num="0277">The authentication process continually monitors all of the acceptable signals to ensure they all yield similar heartbeat detections. To preserve energy for the cardiac pacing system, the authentication process can be initiated randomly to test the system's performance. Should repeated errors in performance be noted, the frequency and intervals of the authentication process can be adjusted until reliable heartbeat detections are observed. Alternatively, every time a heartbeat detection is triggered on the primary sensing channel, the sensing signals or detection processes of the alternate channels can be monitored to ensure that they would have also triggered a heartbeat detection; however, these additional signals can be post-processed in batches of 5-sec segments, or within another time window and frequency that is considerate of power consumption by the system.</p><p id="p-0279" num="0278">In instances when sensing algorithms trigger a heartbeat detection and subsequently inhibit a pace pulse, algorithms used in the authentication process will confirm that the heartbeat detection was accurate and not an over-detection of some non-cardiac event. Conversely, if a pacing pulse is required, algorithms used in the authentication process will confirm that an intrinsic beat was not missed. If some quantity of non-agreements are noted, algorithms such as the signal selector algorithm can be initiated to ensure that the current primary sensing vector is still the most robust of those options available for the system.</p><p id="p-0280" num="0279">The cardiac pacing system can be configured to verify whether delivery of therapeutic pulses is required. This verification can be performed using one or more sensors. For example, the cardiac pacing system can use a multiple trigger authentication. Multiple trigger authentication uses multiple input signals to confirm whether a pacing pulse is required. As an example, the cardiac pacing system can have its primary sensing signal set to the ECG input from the sensors configured to monitor the ECG of the patient's heart. The ECG will not trigger a heartbeat detection if the ventricle does not beat; however, a QRS signal amplitude decrease can lead to a &#x201c;missed&#x201d; heartbeat detection. A second input signal can be used to confirm what the QRS signal indicates. For example, simultaneous monitoring of the heart sound, such as with acoustic sensors or accelerometers, can be used to confirm whether or not the ventricle beat. Heart sounds lag the ECG electrical response signal, making the use of heart sounds as the secondary confirmation signal especially useful.</p><p id="p-0281" num="0280"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref> is an illustration <b>2300</b> of an ECG reading over time together with a time synchronized heart sound signal reading over time. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>, the S<sub>1 </sub>heart sound, representing the ventricular pressure wave, <b>2302</b> lags the QRS complex from the ECG reading <b>2304</b> associated with the ventricular depolarization. Other heart sounds S<sub>2</sub>, S<sub>3 </sub>and S<sub>4 </sub>may also be used to identify specific normal or abnormal cardiac activity for the purposes of adjusting, inhibiting or delivering therapy or providing diagnostic feedback regarding the patient to the physician.</p><p id="p-0282" num="0281"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref> is an illustration of an exemplary process flow <b>2400</b> for verifying a lack of heart beat having features consistent with the current subject matter. Process flow <b>2400</b> is provided as an example of a process that could be performed by the cardiac pacing system to verify whether or not the ventricle, for example, has stopped beating. At <b>2402</b>, the ECG signal can be obtained by the cardiac pacing system. At <b>2404</b>, the ECG signal can be filtered. The filtering can include filtering techniques consistent with the present disclosure. At <b>2406</b>, the ECG signal can be monitored for a duration of time consistent with a desired pacing rate. In response, at <b>2408</b>, a determination can be made as to whether the signal exceeds a detection threshold using heartbeat detection techniques consistent with the present disclosure. If the signal does not exceed a detection threshold, then reference to the acoustic signal detection can be made.</p><p id="p-0283" num="0282">At <b>2410</b>, an acoustic signal can be obtained by the cardiac pacing system. At <b>2412</b>, the acoustic signal can be dynamically filtered by the cardiac pacing system. At <b>2414</b>, a determination can be made as to whether the acoustic signal exceeds the detection threshold. If the acoustic signal does exceed the detection threshold, then, at <b>2416</b>, no pacing is required and monitoring of the heart can proceed. If, at <b>2414</b>, the acoustic signal does not exceed the detection threshold, then, at <b>2418</b>, a determination of whether a therapeutic pulse is required for delivery to the heart can be made. At <b>2420</b>, in response to determining a pulse is required, the ECG sensors can be modified in order to improve the accuracy for triggering heartbeat detections. For example, the range, gain, and/or other parameters of the ECG can be modified. At <b>2422</b>, a therapeutic pulse can be delivered to the heart. Subsequently, the signals can be monitored.</p><p id="p-0284" num="0283">Sensing for heartbeat detections must operate in real-time as pacing is triggered on a beat-to-beat basis. Lagged real-time analysis is an authentication process that runs in a delayed fashion allowing for the processing of additional data that was not otherwise available at the very moment the real-time decision was made. Following an initial heartbeat detection, the lagged real-time analysis will continue to gather data and, following the post-processing of that data, can ultimately over-rule the primary detection decision, resulting in a decision to deliver a therapeutic pace pulse. For example, if the primary triggering mechanism for heartbeat detections uses the ECG signal with an exponentially decaying detection profile, and a sensed event is triggered, it will subsequently specify that the pacing pulse should be inhibited. The lagged real-time analysis can continue to gather data and, using a previously stored morphology template, can compare data that occurred after the primary detection to the morphology template. This analysis can confirm that the primary detection was in fact triggered by the desired event and not an over-sensing of some other ECG segment or non-cardiac signal. The additional data collection can be of a varying period of time such as 10% of the previous R-R interval, or other periods of fixed or relative time.</p><p id="p-0285" num="0284">Alternatively, if the primary triggering mechanism for heartbeat detections indicates that no-sensed event occurred, pacing will be initiated. The lagged real-time analysis may optionally include a first-pace delay feature that intentionally delays or overrules a pacing pulse delivery decision if a pacing pulse has not been delivered for some preset period of time. For example, no pacing pulses have been delivered for 10 minutes; however, the real-time primary detection suddenly indicates that a pace pulse is required. Rather than immediately delivering the pace pulse, the lagged real-time analysis invokes a 100 ms first-pace delay in order to analyze additional data to confirm that intrinsic activity was not missed. If pacing is required, the first-pace delay is reduced or eliminated for the next paced beat. If pacing inhibition is confirmed, additional pace delays or pacing rate adjustments can be made to promote continued intrinsic heartbeats.</p><p id="p-0286" num="0285">Lagged real-time analysis can include maximum interval thresholds to ensure pacing is not inhibited for a clinically undesirable duration.</p><p id="p-0287" num="0286">Pacing vector selection is designed to evaluate all pacing vector choices available in order to select the optimal pacing vector. Multiple pacing choices may be acceptable, allowing the device to have options for changing the vector automatically if other sensor input suggests that a change is required.</p><p id="p-0288" num="0287">Pacing vector selection compares pacing requirements for some or all of the pacing vector electrodes available to the cardiac pacing system. In addition to electrode pairs, more than two electrodes may also be used for pacing delivery, with one or more electrodes acting as the cathode and one or more electrodes acting as the anode during pacing delivery.</p><p id="p-0289" num="0288">An optimal pacing vector is one that minimizes pacing energy while maintaining adequate pacing energy safety margin. Analysis may include the assessment of skeletal muscle stimulation during pacing and/or the assessment of pacing requirement changes with various patient postures, respiration sizes (deep breath), heart rates, and the like. The resulting optimal pacing vector can be determined by combining some or all of these variables using a weighted or non-weighted scoring method. As such, the pacing vector with the lowest energy requirement may not necessarily become the optimal pacing vector. Other vectors with low energy requirements that minimize other factors such as skeletal muscle stimulation may be preferred.</p><p id="p-0290" num="0289">The pacing vector selection algorithm can generate a list of all acceptable or unacceptable pacing vectors. These lists can then be used by other algorithms to optimize particular sensor/electrode pairs for sensing and therapy delivery. For example, it is desirable to sense from electrodes that are not involved in delivery of therapeutic pacing pulses due to latent polarization effects. Polarization effects can degrade sensing performance of the cardiac pacing system. Allowing the system to utilize distinct electrodes to perform sensing and pacing functions enables the system to optimally select sensing pairs sufficiently far away from the interface between pacing electrodes and surrounding tissue, which is most susceptible to polarization effects each time a pacing pulse is delivered. As such, the pacing vector selection algorithm can work in concert with sensing algorithms to automatically switch sensing and therapy delivery electrode pairs to optimize system performance.</p><p id="p-0291" num="0290">The programmer can be used during the pacing vector selection assessment in order to provide confirmatory responses for certain pacing vectors. During in person follow-up visits, a range of amplitude and pulse widths for each available pacing vector configuration can be evaluated. For each setting, the degree of skeletal muscle stimulation and any resulting perception of discomfort can be assessed, along with cardiac pacing thresholds. The degree of skeletal muscle stimulation can be measured automatically by the cardiac pacing system and/or programmer by analyzing signals from an accelerometer, or like sensor, designed to detect skeletal muscle stimulation. The perception of any discomfort can be provided by the patient to the physician conducting the procedure for each pacing vector. The patient can accept or reject one or more pacing vectors during the assessment. Cardiac pacing thresholds can be measured by the physician performing the follow-up visit or automatically by the cardiac pacing system. Factors used in the prioritization of pacing vectors include (1) cardiac capture thresholds, (2) degree of skeletal muscle stimulation at tested outputs, (3) patient perception of discomfort at tested outputs and (4) degree of separation between cardiac capture thresholds and onset of skeletal muscle stimulation or perceived discomfort for each pacing vector. These factors may be analyzed in one or multiple postures and across varying degrees of activity and heartrates. Information from the assessment can then be saved in the cardiac pacing system allowing the pacing vector selection algorithm to create a prioritized list of pacing vectors for future reference. In the event that cardiac capture does not occur consistently with the most preferential vector, the cardiac pacing system will switch to those pacing vectors chosen as desirable by the patient.</p><p id="p-0292" num="0291">The cardiac pacing system can incorporate energy control algorithms to assist in reducing pacing energy output, resulting in a longevity increase for the cardiac pacing system. Energy control algorithms can be used to ensure that sufficient pacing energy is delivered to safely capture the heart, while minimizing energy loss due to excessive safety margins. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref> is an illustration of an exemplary process flow <b>2500</b> for analyzing sensed signals to determine whether delivered energy levels and/or pacing vectors can be adjusted, having features consistent with the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0293" num="0292">Pacing therapy demands are known to lessen while a patient is sleeping. Additionally, certain patient postures, such as the prone position, can reduce the pacing energy requirement for successful cardiac capture. As a result, patients that typically, or periodically, sleep on their chest, can require less pacing energy while sleeping as compared to the rest of the day when they are upright. The sleep response algorithm can use time of day, patient position information from an accelerometer or posture sensor, heart rate, ECG data, respiratory information or other sensed information to determine when a patient is sleeping and in what posture. By analyzing these sensory inputs, the sleep response algorithm can automatically reduce pacing energies or pacing rates during a sleep cycle when it is safe to do so. The sleep response algorithm may also adjust pace pulse delivery to be timed with the point of maximal exhalation in order to minimize the potential tissue space between the electrode and the heart, resulting in lower pacing energy requirements.</p><p id="p-0294" num="0293">The pacing energy reduction can be a fixed reduction or a proportional reduction to the specific measured position. The duration of the pacing energy reduction can be automatically adjusted or can be for a fixed period. In addition to adjusting the pacing energy, the sleep response algorithm can also adjust other pacing parameters, such as pacing rate, pacing mode, rate-response settings, or the like during the sleep cycle.</p><p id="p-0295" num="0294">A delivered pacing pulse that successfully captures the heart will cause the heart to beat resulting in mechanical movement of the heart that is measurable. The mechanical response algorithm utilizes sensors connected to the cardiac pacing system to assess mechanical movement of the heart, and adjust proper cardiac capture energy levels accordingly.</p><p id="p-0296" num="0295">The mechanical response algorithm identifies mechanical heart deflections following the delivery of a pacing pulse using one or more accelerometer signals, other posture sensors, acoustic signals, or the like. The cardiac pacing system then gradually reduces the energy levels until a mechanical heart deflection is no longer noted by the sensors, and loss of cardiac capture is suspected. Specific timing windows may be used to ensure that the mechanical sensory information is only analyzed for a limited period of time immediately following pacing pulse delivery. Upon loss of cardiac capture, the cardiac pacing system will increase the energy level of the pacing pulse until cardiac capture is regained. The cardiac pacing system will then set that new energy level, with a specific safety margin of additional energy, as the new default pacing pulse energy level.</p><p id="p-0297" num="0296">The mechanical response algorithm can operate continuously or operate in a periodic fashion, such as once per hour, day, week, or the like. The mechanical response algorithm can also be initiated by some other trigger mechanism such as a change in posture, time of day, heart rate, or some other physiologic event noted on the ECG, accelerometer or other signal. Throughout the energy reduction process, a backup pacing pulse at higher energy can be delivered in a delayed fashion to ensure that appropriate cardiac function is maintained despite the loss of capture due to a reduced energy pacing pulse.</p><p id="p-0298" num="0297">A delivered pacing pulse that successfully captures the heart generally evokes a larger and wider ECG deflection than the ECG deflection caused by an intrinsic heartbeat. The evoked response algorithm uses ECG analysis for larger and wider deflections to determine if the delivered pacing pulse captured the cardiac tissue. The algorithm can also assess evoked responses by evaluating simultaneous signals other than the pacing vector and measuring changes in specific intervals relative to the time in which a pace pulse is delivered.</p><p id="p-0299" num="0298">Immediately following pace pulse delivery, the cardiac pacing system will analyze the ECG to identify the evoked ECG response. If noted, successful capture is confirmed. The evoked response algorithm continues to pace with lower and lower energies until loss of cardiac capture is noted. The evoked response algorithm can utilize the preferred sense vector, any other ECG sense vector or physiologic signal, or any combination of multiple signals to determine if cardiac capture was successful. Upon loss of cardiac capture, the cardiac pacing system will increase the energy level of the pacing pulse until cardiac capture is regained. The cardiac pacing system will then set that new energy level, with a specific safety margin of additional energy, as the new default pacing pulse energy level.</p><p id="p-0300" num="0299">The evoked response algorithm can operate continuously or operate in a periodic fashion, such as once per hour, day, week, or the like. The evoked response algorithm can also be initiated by some other trigger mechanism such as a change in posture, time of day, heart rate, or some other physiologic event noted on the ECG, accelerometer or other signal.</p><p id="p-0301" num="0300">Pacing modifiers incorporate data from sensor inputs to ensure successful cardiac capture and minimize skeletal muscle stimulation. Pacing modifier algorithms can modify pacing therapy as a result of the sensor inputs. For example, the effect of noise to a cardiac pacing system can include inappropriate inhibition of life-sustaining pacing. As a result, the cardiac pacing system can include pacing modifiers that temporarily pace in an asynchronous mode if noise cannot be effectively removed. Switching to an asynchronous pacing mode in the presence of persistent noise can provide a safety mechanism to help ensure pacing is not dangerously inhibited due to noise.</p><p id="p-0302" num="0301">Atrial arrhythmia algorithms can ensure that pacing therapy remains appropriate in response to the initiation or termination of atrial arrhythmias. Certain atrial arrhythmias can result in highly variable conduction to the ventricles. This variability causes irregular heart rate intervals which can result in symptoms for patients. An atrial arrhythmia response algorithm can include an interval threshold method to limit the degree of interval variability. In the event that the interval threshold is reached without detection of an intrinsic R-wave, a pacing pulse can be delivered. The interval threshold can be calculated based upon a percentage of some number of previous R-wave intervals and may be updated periodically or on a beat-to-beat basis. Additionally, the interval threshold method can be selectively activated such that it operates only once an atrial arrhythmia has been identified. In this example, upon termination of the atrial arrhythmia, the interval threshold method is deactivated.</p><p id="p-0303" num="0302">The onset of an atrial arrhythmias can result in undesirable high rate or irregular ventricular pacing when the cardiac pacing system is operating in a synchronous pacing mode such as DDD(R) or VDD(R). To prevent undesirable pacing in the ventricles in response to an atrial arrhythmias, a maximum ventricular tracking rate threshold can be used. The cardiac pacing system will continue to pace the ventricles in response to atrial sensed events; however, the ventricular pacing rate cannot exceed the maximum ventricular tracking rate threshold.</p><p id="p-0304" num="0303">Additionally, if a prolonged, highly variable or high rate atrial arrhythmia is detected, the cardiac pacing system can switch pacing modes from a tracking mode to a non-tracking mode, such as VVI(R). Switching to a non-tracking mode will ensure that the ventricles do not pace at an undesirably rapid or irregular rate in response to the atrial arrhythmia. When the cardiac pacing system detects that the atrial arrhythmia has terminated, the cardiac pacing system can revert back to a tracking mode to continue delivering atrial synchronous ventricular pacing.</p><p id="p-0305" num="0304">The atrial arrhythmia response algorithms can work in conjunction with other physiologic sensors. For example, upon the initiation of an atrial arrhythmia, the respiratory signal can be examined to monitor for shortness of breath and certain pacemaker settings, such as pacing rate, mode, output or the like, and automatically make pacemaker setting adjustments accordingly.</p><p id="p-0306" num="0305">The respiratory pacing response algorithm ensures that adequate energy for pacing is delivered to the patient during times of high respiration volume. When oxygen demand increases (e.g., during exercise), respiratory rates and volumes increase. An electrode placed in the anterior mediastinum can be subjected to small movements as the chest moves in response to deep inhalation/exhalation breaths. The deep breaths can additionally cause small changes in the tissue separation between the electrode and the heart.</p><p id="p-0307" num="0306">The resulting respiration signal can be used by the cardiac pacing system to analyze the patient's breathing patterns and identify moments of increased respiratory volume. In response to these deep breaths, the pacing energy can be increased to ensure cardiac capture is maintained. Alternatively, the respiratory pacing response algorithm can delay the pacing pulse delivery until the point of maximum exhalation, thereby avoiding the need for increased energy at maximum inhalation. A pacing pulse can be selectively synchronized to breathing patterns in order to ensure cardiac capture in an energy efficient manner. The degree of energy increase can be a fixed energy increase or can be proportional to the size of respiration volume change.</p><p id="p-0308" num="0307">The degree or method of the energy increase can be modified by the physician using a programmer. The programmer can assist in analyzing the patient's breathing patterns, including during deep inhalation. Pacing capture thresholds can be determined at varying states of inhalation and this data may be supplied to the cardiac pacing system, and used by the respiratory pacing response algorithm.</p><p id="p-0309" num="0308">The postural pacing response algorithm ensures that adequate energy for pacing is delivered to the patient, despite changes in patient posture. Certain changes in patient posture can result in small movements of the organs or tissue within the chest. These changes can alter the separation between the heart and pacing electrodes used by the cardiac pacing system. For example, when a patient moves from a prone to supine posture, the distance between the patient's heart and the distal tip of a lead placed within the anterior mediastinum can be observed. Subsequently, an increase in the pacing energy requirement for successful cardiac capture can result. Other posture changes can similarly reduce the separation between the heart and pacing electrodes used by the cardiac pacing system, resulting in a reduction in pacing energy requirements.</p><p id="p-0310" num="0309">A multi-axis accelerometer, or other posture sensor, can be used by the cardiac pacing system to analyze the patient's position and identify those positions that can affect pacing energy requirements. In response to a positional change, the pacing vector or energy can be modified accordingly to ensure the proper pacing energy is used and cardiac capture is maintained. The degree of energy increase/reduction can be a fixed or can be proportional to the relative position displacement.</p><p id="p-0311" num="0310">The programmer <b>320</b> can be used to analyze the pacing requirements during various patient postures. Pacing capture thresholds can then be determined at varying positions for the postural pacing response algorithm.</p><p id="p-0312" num="0311">The skeletal muscle response algorithm assesses whether therapeutic pacing pulses delivered by the cardiac pacing system produced undesirable skeletal muscle stimulation. Exciting skeletal muscle can result in muscle contractions. These muscle contractions can then be measured by sensitive accelerometers controlled by the cardiac pacing system. The muscle response algorithm can use signals from one or more accelerometers to compare changes in skeletal muscle deflection during pacing to skeletal muscle deflection during intrinsic heartbeat activity. Through the comparison, the cardiac pacing system can determine if the skeletal muscle response is more significant during pacing delivery. For example, the skeletal muscle response algorithm can compare signals from one accelerometer placed on a lead disposed in the anterior mediastinum to a second accelerometer within the implanted pulse generator. If skeletal muscle stimulation is noted during pacing, the skeletal muscle response algorithm can automatically adjust the pacing output until skeletal muscle stimulation is no longer observed. The skeletal muscle response algorithm can alter voltage, pulse width or a combination of both, or can automatically switch to a different pacing vector that reduces or eliminates skeletal muscle stimulation. The skeletal muscle response algorithm can additionally utilize other energy control algorithms described herein to ensure successful cardiac capture is maintained throughout the algorithmic assessment.</p><p id="p-0313" num="0312">The programmer <b>320</b> can be used to analyze the degree of skeletal muscle stimulation observed using various pacing vectors. This information can then be calibrated with the patient's perception of the skeletal muscle stimulation to generate a prioritized list of pacing vectors the cardiac pacing system should utilize for a patient, and for what circumstances certain such pacing vectors should be adjusted if the original pacing vector possesses a high likelihood of resulting in undesirable skeletal muscle stimulation.</p><p id="p-0314" num="0313">The cardiac pacing system can be configured to monitor a concomitant device. A concomitant device can be a device that provides different functionality than, for example, the cardiac pacing system consistent with the current disclosure. The concomitant device can be, for example, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). The cardiac pacing system may be configured to facilitate pacing of the heart and rely on the ICD to provide defibrillation for the heart. In response to an activation of the concomitant device, the cardiac pacing system can be configured to dynamically change the filters used by the sensor(s) disposed within the body to account for the energy or signal noise generated by the concomitant device.</p><p id="p-0315" num="0314">The cardiac pacing system can be further configured to communicate with the concomitant device.
