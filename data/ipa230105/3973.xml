The image sensing device of the ordinary photographing camera is commonly selected from a charge coupled device (CCD) or a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor sensor (CMOS Sensor). Also, as advanced semiconductor manufacturing technology enables the minimization of the pixel size of the image sensing device, the development of the optical image capturing system has gravitated towards the field of high pixels. Therefore, the requirement for high image quality has been rapidly increasing.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The traditional optical image capturing system of a portable electronic device comes with different designs, including a two-lens or a three-lens design. However, the requirement for the higher pixels and the requirement for a large aperture of an end user, like functionalities of micro filming and night view, or the requirement of wide angle of view of the portable electronic device have been raised. But the optical image capturing system with the large aperture design often produces more aberration resulting in the deterioration of quality in peripheral image formation and difficulties of manufacturing, and the optical image capturing system with wide angle of view design increases distortion rate in image formation, thus the optical image capturing system in prior arts cannot meet the requirement of the higher order camera lens module.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, how to design an optical image capturing system capable of balancing the requirement for higher total pixel count and quality of the formed image as well as the minimization of camera module by effectively increasing the amount of admitted light and the angle of view the optical image capturing system has become a pressing issue.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The aspect of embodiment of the present invention directs to an optical image capturing system and an optical image capturing lens which use combination of refractive power, convex and concave surfaces of four-piece optical lenses (the convex or concave surface in the present invention denotes the change of geometrical shape of an object side or an image side of each lens with different height from an optical axis) to increase the quantity of incoming light of the optical image capturing system and the angle of view of the optical lenses, and to improve total pixels and image quality for image formation, so as to be applied to compact electronic products.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The term and the definition to the lens parameter in the embodiment of the present invention are shown as below for further reference.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The Lens Parameters Related to the Length or the Height</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The maximum height for image formation of the optical image capturing system is denoted by HOI.

Specifically, the transverse aberration at the longest operation wavelength (for instance, the wavelength is 650 nm) and the shortest operation wavelength (for instance, the wavelength is 470 nm) respectively passing through the margin of the aperture is calculated to act as the standard of the performance. The aforementioned coordinate direction of the tangential fan can be further divided into the positive direction (the upper ray) and the negative direction (the lower ray). The transverse aberration at the longest operation wavelength passing through the margin of the aperture defines the difference between the image position at the specific field of view where the longest operation wavelength passes through the margin of the aperture and strikes on the first image plane and the image position at the specific field of view where the chief ray of the reference wavelength (for instance, the wavelength is 555 nm) strikes on the first image plane.
