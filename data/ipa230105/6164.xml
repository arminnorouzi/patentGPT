These structures are traditionally deposited using evaporation through a shadow mask. Deposition through a shadow mask typically includes placing a template in front of a substrate that blocks the substrate everywhere except the desired deposition locations for the OLED material. Conventional patterning methods such as lithography are generally not used since OLEDs are comprised of organic materials and said organic materials are susceptible to being dissolved or degraded by the solvents required for photoresist techniques found in conventional lithography. If it were not for this limitation, conventional lithography methods would be the most straightforward method in fabrication of OLED structures and other organic devices.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A common deposition method used to deposit and for patterning organic devices and in particular OLED devices involves the use of a fine metal mask, which is a type of shadow mask. A shadow mask can be a large sheet that is generally made as thin as possible with small holes. Deposition occurs through a point source in which organics are evaporated onto the mask and through these holes, the organics that come through this point source then end up on the substrate at the appropriate locations as dictated by the mask. Due to limitations in how small the holes in the shadow mask can be, how thin the shadow mask can be made, and how close to the substrate the shadow mask can be placed among other reasons, there is a resolution limit limiting the feature size and density of the patterned organics. Among the challenges created by the physical dimensions of the shadow mask is a shadowing effect whereby material is deposited underneath the masked regions of the shadow mask and unmasked regions have non-uniform deposition. The shadowing effect occurs during deposition underneath physically masked regions of the substrate due to off normal arrival angles of the evaporated material. The thickness of the shadow mask is one factor that determines how much of an undesired shadowing effect there is on the substrate which leads to the resolution limit one can pattern the organics to. Therefore, it is desirable to have a very thin shadow mask if the shadow mask is too thin, there is a risk of mask breaking or deforming. Due to the target dimensions of high-resolution OLED for light field display technology, photolithography is an ideal deposition technique as it is mature and well-developed, often used for small-scale patterning of semiconductors and metals. It should be noted however that the materials generally used in the fabrication of semiconductors and metals in particular are much less process-sensitive than organic materials. Many microfabrication processes are designed to strip away organics through development, as in many instances, organics are viewed as contaminants. In particular, standard photolithography cleaning procedures are designed to remove organic contaminants.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">There are specially formulated resist systems that utilize solvents which are safe for organic materials. These specially formulated systems typically utilize a two-layer photolithography liftoff scheme, wherein the bottom photolithography layer is used as a sacrificial layer while the top layer is a photosensitive resist layer. In one technique, the bottom layer is spun on a wafer and baked before the top layer is spun, baked, and patterned. The basis of this type of photoresist system is that the top and bottom layers dissolve in different solvents, or at least at different rates in the same solvent, allowing for selective etching, or removal, of each of the two layers. For patterning of organics, a lift-off technique is often utilized where an undercut profile is created in the photosensitive resist layers to create a cavity structure where the top layer of resist is overhanging an opening in the bottom layer of resist. The material to be lifted off is then deposited through the opening and the cavity under the overhang resist profile leaves additional space for solvents to access the resist system after deposition of the desired material, leaving the deposited material in the patterned openings.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It has been demonstrated that exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light, as required for the photolithography process used with these specially formulated resist systems, may be damaging to OLED structures. Some organic-safe resist systems use a negative photoresist top layer, which must be exposed to UV light during patterning. A negative photoresist is a type of photoresist wherein the region of the photoresist that is exposed to light becomes insoluble to the photoresist developer. Specifically, the negative photosensitive resist material is strengthened, by polymerization or cross-linking, in the presence of UV light. Following exposure of the negative photoresist to light through a light mask, also referred to herein as a photomask, the developer will dissolve the regions that were not exposed to light, leaving behind a coating of resist in areas of the negative photoresist layer not exposed to UV light. The photomask has opaque and transparent regions to allow UV light to pass through, forming the desired pattern in the photoresist. The unexposed region of the photoresist is then dissolved by the photoresist developer, such as, for example, a buffered KOH developer. In contrast to a negative photoresist, a positive photoresist is a type of photoresist wherein the region of the photoresist exposed to UV light becomes soluble to the photoresist developer. In the case of a positive photoresist, the photo-sensitive material is changed by light and the developer will dissolve away the regions that were exposed to light through the transparent regions of the photomask, with remaining photoresist material under the opaque regions of the photomask (i.e. regions not exposed to UV light). The unexposed regions of the photoresist remain insoluble to the photoresist developer and serves as the protective layer in the photolithography process. Positive photoresists are well known in the art and highly controllable, however traditionally have not been able to be used when patterning OLED structures due to the damaging nature of their developers to organic materials.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to Lin (Multi-Layer Resist Systems, INTRODUCTION TO MICROLITHOGRAPHY Chapter 6, pp. 287-350, 1983), the history of trilayer resists begins in the liftoff era of microelectronics in the early 1970s. There was a desire to perform liftoff for microelectronics fabrication at the time and the trilayer resist system proved to be a strong candidate. The basic elements of this resist system include an imaging layer, an inorganic transfer layer, and a bottom sacrificial layer. The bottom sacrificial layer is typically a hard-baked photoresist while the inorganic transfer layer is a metal or dielectric material and the imaging layer is a conventional photoresist. After coating the wafer in the trilayer resist, the imaging layer is exposed and developed and then the inorganic transfer layer is etched. The system is then exposed to an oxygen plasma to transfer the pattern to the sacrificial layer. The oxygen plasma can be designed to produce an undercut in the resist and remove the imaging layer for an ideal liftoff profile. In projection lithography, it is important that the imaging layer be all in the same plane. At this time, planarization techniques, such as chemical-mechanical polish, were unavailable, therefore lithography was performed over topography.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one example of the use of a trilayer resist for semiconductor processing, U.S. Pat. No. 10,049,876 to Sankarapandian et al. describes a method that includes forming a trilayer resist structure having a middle layer disposed between a top layer and a bottom layer. This trilayer resist method is used to remove a material in a directional way from a specialized type of transistor, while not damaging nearby similar transistors. The function of this trilayer resist is to first planarize the surface and then to act as a hard mask for an etching process. To remove the middle layer of resist, a material similar to, or the same as, the bottom layer of the trilayer resist structure, is applied to planarize and etch back a chemical-mechanical polish (CMP) layer to a level that is below the middle layer of resist. The middle layer can then be removed by an etching procedure that would normally harm the rest of the substrate, however due to the additional planarization layer the substrate is covered and protected from the etch that removes the middle layer. The remaining planarization layer is finally removed using a dry or wet stripping process.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In traditional dual-layer photoresist systems for patterning organics, the bottom, or base layer, is a sacrificial layer which helps to create the desired undercut profile for patterning OLEDs. To use a conventional resist for the base layer of an organic-safe resist system require developers to first create an undercut profile using a resist that can be removed without damaging the deposited organics. As previously mentioned, the chemical photolithographic developers used for traditional photolithography processes (i.e. for a positive type photoresist) are generally harmful to organic materials. Accordingly, there has been a barrier to the development of photolithography techniques for the fabrication of small-scale organic devices, and specifically nano-scale OLED devices suitable for high resolution display applications.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">This background information is provided for the purpose of making known information believed by the applicant to be of possible relevance to the present invention.

The wavelength of light used in photolithography is generally in the ultraviolet region (about 10-450 nm) and more preferably in the deep ultraviolet region (about 200-300 nm) or at wavelengths under 300 nm. Extreme ultraviolet radiation (about 10-125 nm) and x-ray light (10 picometers to 10 nanometers) are also used in some applications of photolithography.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">It is contemplated that any embodiment of the compositions, devices, articles, methods and uses disclosed herein can be implemented by one skilled in the art, as is, or by making such variations or equivalents without departing from the scope of the invention.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">The present disclosure is directed to semiconductor processing and fabrication techniques, and more particularly, photolithography techniques using photoresist systems for patterning organic devices including organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) and OLED arrays.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">Photoresists are light-sensitive sacrificial materials which are fundamental to photolithography. Photoresist systems are generally comprised of a polymer, a sensitizer, and a solvent. Upon exposure to a radiation source such as UV radiation, the polymer structure of the photoresist material is altered. The solvent component allows the photoresist to be spun and to form thin layers over a wafer, or substrate surface. Finally, the sensitizer, or inhibitor, controls the photochemical reaction in the polymer phase. Photoresists can be classified as positive photoresists (positive-type photoresists) or negative photoresists (negative-type photoresists). The photochemical reaction that occurs for positive photoresists during exposure to a radiation source weakens the polymer, making it more soluble to the developer, resulting in a positive pattern. Therefore, for a positive photoresist, the photomask used will have the same pattern as that desired for patterning on the semiconductor layer. Alternatively for negative photoresists, exposure to a UV radiation source causes polymerization of the polymer. This polymerization results in the negative photoresist layer region exposed to the UV light becoming insoluble to the photoresist developer. The negative photoresist regions that had been exposed to the radiation source will remain upon the surface of the wafer, or substrate, following the chemical treatment with a developer solution. Therefore, masks used for negative photoresists contain the inverse or photographic &#x201c;negative&#x201d; of the pattern to be transferred.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">A mask, or photomask, controls where the semiconductor wafer or substrate is exposed to radiation by either permitting or blocking transmissivity of the radiation through the photomask through to the underlying photoresist material. Regions of the photomask structure that permit transmissivity of radiation will result in degradation of an underlying positive photoresist material or a polymerization of an underlying negative photoresist material layer (Microfabrication technologies used for creating smart devices for industrial applications. Jose M. Quero, Carmen Aracil, in Smart Sensors and MEMs (Second Edition), Woodhead Publishing Series in Electronic and Optical Materials, 2018, Pages 291-311). Radiation used in photolithography is generally ultraviolet (UV) or extreme UV, however x-rays can also be used. The wavelength of light used determines the minimum feature size that it can impress on the photoresist. UV radiation is generally referred to herein as the photolithography light source, however it is understood that a variety of wavelengths of light may be used according to the desired process materials and results. The photomask comprises an opaque plate with perforations or transparent regions that allows light to shine through (transmit) at defined locations in a particular pattern. Photomask materials can include, for example, fused silica (quartz glass) with a coating pattern made of chrome. In some cases, the photomask can be further coated with Teflon&#x2122; or other low-friction, low-stick coating to help prevent stiction issues during contact photolithography. By placing the photomask between the photoresist and a light source capable of degrading the polymer in the positive photoresist an exact copy of the pattern on the photomask can be created by degrading the photoresist at the holes or transparencies in the photomask pattern. As previously mentioned, for negative photoresists, the photomask will have the inverse of the desired pattern. Both negative and positive photoresists have advantages and disadvantages. Advantages of negative photoresists include good adhesion to silicon, low cost, and short processing time. Further, more desirable advantages of positive photoresists include increased controllability, good resolution, and good thermal stability.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">Positive photoresists are suitable, to a limited extent, for lift-off processes because positive photoresists do not cross-link or further polymerize upon light exposure, therefore maintaining the softening point of the photoresist layer to values in the range of approximately 110-130&#xb0; C. Cross-linking refers to the polymerization or bonding of one polymer chain to another to create polymer chains or a polymer network. In chemical applications, cross-linking can be used to promote a change in the physical properties of the polymer. Temperatures in the range of 110-130&#xb0; C. are often used during typical coating processes in the fabrication of semiconductor devices. The resist features will become coated overall, making lift-off difficult or impossible if the positive photoresist were to polymerize within the 110-130&#xb0; C. temperature range. Additional advantages of using positive photoresists for semiconductor fabrication include that a positive photoresist generally does not swell during development, is capable of finer resolution, and is reasonably resistant to plasma processes. Negative photoresists are generally considered to be a better choice for lift-off processes as these polymers can achieve a reproducible undercut in the fabrication layers. This undercut helps to prevent the photoresist sidewalls from being coated as the crosslinking of the polymer resin of common negative resists maintains the undercut, making subsequent lift-off of sacrificial layers easier.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">Herein is described a trilayer photoresist structure and method of use thereof. The trilayer system is comprised of a fluoropolymer base layer, an intermediate inorganic layer, and a top positive-type photoresist layer, that can be used for patterning nano-scale organic structures, such as OLEDs, using photolithography techniques. The disclosed trilayer resist system avails of the advantages of photolithographic patterning using conventional photoresists by including an intermediate inorganic transfer layer between a top positive photoresist, also referred to as a positive-type photoresist layer, and a fluoropolymer base layer. The implementation of a positive photoresist as the top layer which forms an image layer upon patterning allows for the fabrication of a finer pattern through the trilayer photoresist structure, leading to increased resolution of the resulting organic devices and a more controllable photolithography process. As previously mentioned, when using a photomask with a positive photoresist, radiation (UV light) is passed through transparent regions in the mask, defining the regions where the positive photoresist material will be subsequently removed with a developer. Using a positive photoresist with a photomask is particularly advantageous when patterning an high density OLED array as regions on the underlying substrate that have organics already deposited thereon are shielded from UV light rays during patterning of a subsequent OLED color by the opaque regions of the photomask. In particular, the combination of a positive photoresist and opaque photomask blocks photolithography radiation from penetrating below the photomask into areas of the substrate and organic device that contain organic materials sensitive to the radiation. In comparison, patterning organics using a negative photoresist dual layer system, for example using photolithography and a photomask, exposes the substrate underneath the negative photoresist layer to the radiation used to polymerize or harden the negative photoresist regions. Any structures underneath the negative photoresist on the underlying substrate that have an existing organic layer deposited thereon are therefore also exposed to radiation (UV light rays) during patterning of any subsequent organic stack (i.e. an additional OLED color), potentially damaging the organic layer. As such, radiation exposure required for the hardening or polymerizing step in a negative photoresist treatment can penetrate into layers below the negative photoresist, thereby damaging underlying organic layers.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">The described trilayer resist system comprises a bottom fluoropolymer base layer, an inorganic transfer layer, and a top positive-type resist which forms the image layer. The intermediate inorganic transfer layer acts as a protective barrier for the fluoropolymer base layer. The presence of this protective inorganic transfer layer facilitates the implementation of a top, positive-type resist image layer. The positive-type photoresist image layer can then be patterned using conventional photolithography techniques for positive-type photoresists, thereby avoiding degradation of previously deposited organic materials on the substrate caused by UV light exposure. The fluoropolymer base layer can be developed and lifted off the substrate using a perfluorinated solvent which is not harmful to organic materials during the liftoff process.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">The term &#x201c;organic stack&#x201d; as used with reference to OLED devices refers to the layers in the OLED that include an organic layer where a light beam is formed between two electrodes. These layers may include one or more electron transport layer, emission layer, hole transport layer, and hole injection layer, where the emission layer is an organic layer and the other layers can be either inorganic, organic, or combinations of organic and inorganic. In other organic devices, for example, an organic solar cell, one or more of each of these layers can comprise organic materials sensitive to the radiation used in photolithography. Therefore, the term &#x201c;organic stack&#x201d; refers to one or more layers, one of which being a layer formed of an organic material and may be replaced by a single organic layer for alternative embodiments of the disclosure (i.e. alternative organic devices).</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">The intermediate inorganic transfer layer of the disclosed trilayer resist system acts as a critical barrier layer by preventing penetration of the harmful developer used for patterning the top positive photoresist material, through to the underlying fluoropolymer base layer and any organic material present under said base layer.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">The fluoropolymer base layer is a sacrificial layer that functions to create the desired undercut profiled for patterning for organic devices, and specifically for OLED devices. The trilayer system described herein employs a fluoropolymer base layer which, after exposure through the intermediate inorganic transfer layer, is etched with oxygen plasma or reactive ion etching (RIE) to create a microcavity, preferably with an undercut, through which the organic stack can be deposited.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">The presently described trilayer resist system allows for the implementation of photolithography techniques for patterning organic devices and organic light emitting diodes at a sub 10 &#x3bc;m scale, with a highly controllable photoresist as the top positive-type resist image layer. The described trilayer resist system can further liftoff organics in a reliable way, providing a high-density OLED array, that is scalable to substrate sizes not currently possible for patterning OLEDs at the target sub 10 &#x3bc;m dimension. In comparison, present OLED devices using a shadow mask are not scalable to a flat panel display. Although OLED fabrication is provided herein as an example of how the present trilayer photoresist system can be used, it is understood that the same trilayer photoresist fabrication system and method can be used to fabricate other devices comprising organic semiconductor layers, for example organic-based field-effect transistors, organic-based solar cells, photovoltaic cell devices, other organic-based semiconductor devices, and organic laser devices.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">OLEDs are generally divided into two main classes: those comprised of small organic molecules and those comprised of organic polymers. An OLED is a light-emitting diode in which the emissive electroluminescent layer comprises a film of organic compound or component that emits light in response to an electric current. Generally, an OLED is a solid-state semiconductor device having at least one conducting organic layer disposed between and electrically connected to an anode and a cathode. When a current is applied, the anode injects holes, and the cathode injects electrons into the organic layers, and the injected holes and electrons each migrate toward the oppositely charged electrode. When an electron and hole localize on the same molecule, an exciton, which is a localized electron-hole pair having an excited energy state, is formed. Light is emitted when the exciton relaxes via a photoemissive mechanism. Types of OLEDs include but are not limited to Active-matrix OLEDs (AMOLEDs), Top-emitting OLEDs, and Bottom-emitting OLEDs. AMOLEDs have full layers of cathode, organic molecules, and anode. The anode layers have a thin film transistor (TFT) plane in parallel to it to form a matrix. This helps in switching each pixel to its on or off state as desired, thus forming an image. Hence, the pixels switch off whenever they are not required or there is a black image on the display, increasing the battery life of the device. This is the least power consuming type of OLED and has quicker refresh rates which makes them suitable for video. Some uses for AMOLEDs are in computer monitors, large-screen TVs and electronic signs or billboards. Top-emitting OLEDs have a substrate that is either opaque or reflective. Top-emitting OLEDs are better suited for active-matrix applications as they can be more easily integrated with a non-transparent transistor backplane. Manufacturers use top-emitting OLED displays in devices such as smart cards. An OLED is bottom emitting if the emitted light passes through the transparent or semi-transparent bottom electrode and substrate.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">Typically, in the fabrication of organic devices, organic layers are deposited onto an organic device through a fine metal mask (FMM), or shadowmask, which is acceptable for creating larger pixels (10s of &#x3bc;m scale). However, to achieve the pixel density required for a high-definition light field display must be in the sub-10 &#x3bc;m range. The presently disclosed trilayer resist system allows for the patterning of organics using traditional photolithographic processes at a much finer resolution. Additionally, the present trilayer system can be used in multiple iterations on a single device, enabling fabrication of multiple independent organic stack structures on the same substrate. Previously deposited organic layers are first protected from degradation by radiation through use of a positive photoresist top layer (an opaque photomask) and by the intermediate inorganic transfer layer which acts as a critical barrier layer by preventing penetration of the harmful developer, used for patterning the top positive photoresist material, through to the underlying fluoropolymer base layer and any organic material present under said base layer.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">In patterning the trilayer resist system using photolithography techniques using a photomask, at least one electrode is exposed for deposition of the organic stack or one or more organic layers. For example, in patterning an OLED device (or OLED array), the active area is defined as the region comprising an exposed bottom electrode, which was deposited on the substrate in an array prior to application of the trilayer photoresist system. Generally, the active area defines the boundaries where first level electrical connections will be made while predetermining the pattern shape and resolution of the organic device(s). Accordingly, the horizontal offset of the trilayer resist system from the active area also affects the shadowing of the organics, with greater offset expected to lead to less shadowing.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">Alternatively, in the disclosed trilayer resist system, patterning using maskless photolithography (without a physical mask) is also an option, otherwise known as direct-write lithography. Direct-write lithography refers to any technique that is capable of depositing, removing, dispensing, altering the chemistry, or processing various types of materials over different surfaces following a predetermined layout or pattern. In the present application, direct-write lithography can be used, for example, to expose the positive photoresist top layer in a desired pattern for organic layer deposition on the substrate or bottom electrode.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>C</figref> illustrate the deposition of the trilayer polymer resist system on a substrate comprising an electrode. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> illustrates a cross section of a substrate following the deposition of a fluoropolymer base layer. Substrate <b>10</b>, in this embodiment, has deposited thereon an oxide layer <b>12</b>, bottom electrode <b>14</b>, and a first layer of a fluoropolymer resist, herein referred to as the fluoropolymer base layer <b>16</b>. The bottom electrode <b>14</b> can be a transparent material such as indium tin oxide (ITO) or a conducting polymer such as, for example, doped polyaniline, a thin layer of a metal, such as Ag, Au or Al, or a combination thereof. Bottom electrode material layer thicknesses can range from, for example, 10-100 nm with an overall bottom electrode material thickness of 100&#xb1;10 nm. Shown is a single bottom electrode, however it is understood that the organic device may be comprised of a plurality of bottom electrodes which may be unpatterned or patterned, such as into rows or columns or other geometric or regularly spaced arrangement. The optional oxide layer <b>12</b> is used to achieve improved adhesion between the substrate <b>10</b> and the bottom electrode <b>14</b> and can be formed, for example, of a conducting transparent oxide material. Examples of transparent conducting oxide (TCO) materials include, but are not limited to, Indium Tin Oxide (ITO), Indium Zinc Oxide (IZO), and Aluminum Zinc Oxide (AZO). TCOs are electrically conductive materials with a relatively low resistivity and relatively high transmittance. In use of the presently described trilayer system, the fluoropolymer base layer <b>16</b> is capable of being etched into a cavity with an undercut for receiving an OLED stack or other organic stack during manufacturing. Although the term &#x2018;organic stack&#x2019; and &#x2018;organic layer&#x2019; are used herein, it is understood that any semiconductor device containing one or more layers of light-sensitive material may benefit from the present photolithography method.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">Fluoropolymers of use in the fluoropolymer base layer <b>16</b> are generally fluorocarbon-based polymers with multiple carbon-fluorine bonds. Fluoropolymer materials are characterized by a high resistance to solvents, acids, and bases, but can be etched using oxygen plasma or reactive ion etching. Some suitable fluoropolymer base layer materials include amorphous fluoropolymers. Fluoropolymer base layer <b>16</b> materials of use in the present system preferably have extremely high transparency (i.e. a visible light transmission ratio of 95% or greater) as optical transparency may be required for alignment during photolithography. One example of a suitable material for the fluoropolymer base layer is CYTOP&#xae; produced by AGC Chemicals, which is classified by its unique amorphous structure. CYTOP&#xae; can be dissolved with certain fluorinated solvents and can be used in thin film coatings to achieve a sub-micron thickness. Another example of a suitable fluoropolymer for the fluoropolymer base layer <b>16</b> is Teflon&#x2122; AF1600X (AF). Preferably, the fluoropolymer does not negatively chemically interact with the organic materials of the OLED device, as the process used to lift off the fluoropolymer must not damage any previously deposited OLED stacks or organic layers. Spin coating can be used to apply the fluoropolymer in the present method. In fabrication, spin coating can be used to apply a uniform thin film (420&#xb1;20 nm) onto a solid surface by applying the film material in a volatile solvent and using centrifugal force to spread the film out onto the surface. The higher the angular speed of spinning, the thinner the film. In a typical spin coating procedure, a liquid is placed at the center of a circular surface and the surface is rapidly rotated to produce uniform films of 1-10 &#x3bc;m in thickness. In one example, the fluoropolymer base layer <b>16</b> is applied by spin coating, and spun to a thickness of 340-500 nm at a speed of 4000 RPM for approximately 20-25 seconds. It should be noted that the thickness of the fluoropolymer base layer <b>16</b> is preferably 1.25 times the thickness of the organic material later deposited. Following the spinning process, the fluoropolymer base layer <b>16</b> is cured. In one example curing process, the first phase (prebaking) is a drying of the fluoropolymer base layer <b>16</b> at room temperature for 5-30 minutes, which removes gas bubbles. To further de-gas the fluoropolymer base layer <b>16</b>, an optional bake at 50&#xb0; C. for 10-30 minutes removes any remaining bubbles. The next phase is another prebake with a bake at 80-100&#xb0; C. for 30-60 to remove the remaining solvent in the fluoropolymer base layer <b>16</b>. The final phase is the final bake, at a temperature of 180-250&#xb0; C. for 30-60 minutes to improve the adhesion of the fluoropolymer base layer <b>16</b> to the substrate <b>10</b>. Other curing processes of the fluoropolymer base layer may be also used dependent upon the base layer material, to de-gas, remove solvent and improve adhesion of the base material. It should be noted that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> illustrates a substrate covered by an oxide layer, however the presence of said oxide layer <b>12</b> does not impact the disclosed trilayer resist system and the fluoropolymer base layer <b>16</b> can also be deposited directly upon the substrate. It is also noted that although spin coating is provided as an example method of application, other methods of application can be used to apply the fluoropolymer, for example, spray coating or other deposition methods and deposition of the fluoropolymer base layer includes the physical deposition and all processing phases (prebake and final baking steps).</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">The thickness of the fluoropolymer base layer <b>16</b> in the present method is preferably between 100 nm and 2 &#x3bc;m and can be selected based on the thickness of the organic OLED materials to be deposited through the fluoropolymer base layer <b>16</b>. The thickness of the fluoropolymer base layer <b>16</b> should also be sufficient to provide the desired planarization. When considering OLED arrays, the fluoropolymer should use solvents that do not interact or interact very weakly with OLED materials. This is particularly important when patterning a second array of OLED devices on a substrate <b>10</b> comprising an OLED device. Preferably, the minimum thickness, or height, of the fluoropolymer base layer should be about 1.25 times the thickness of the organics that will deposited on top of the base layer for liftoff. Designing the fluoropolymer base layer height to be just a bit higher than the deposited stack enables deposition of the stack layers through the trilayer system with enough space to accommodate all layers below the undercut of the fluoropolymer base layer. For example, in an OLED, 1.25&#xd7; the height of a red organic stack could be 308&#xb1;30.5 nm, 1.25&#xd7; the height of a green organic stack is 258&#xb1;30 (12%) nm, or 1.25&#xd7; the height of a blue organic stack is 238&#xb1;35 (15%), suggests a fluoropolymer base layer 16 minimum thicknesses of 385 nm, 322.5 nm, and 297.5 nm respectively. The maximum thickness of the fluoropolymer base layer <b>16</b> and overall trilayer resist system stack height may be determined through simulation and/or experimentation. If the layers in the trilayer system are too thick and/or the desired undercut is not adequately formed in the fluoropolymer base layer <b>16</b>, a shadowing effect may occur. This shadowing effect can result in non-uniform organic layer thicknesses from the sidewall of the fluoropolymer base layer <b>16</b> blocking or &#x201c;shadowing&#x201d; the active area of the bottom electrode <b>46</b>, thereby preventing even deposition. In general, the total height of the trilayer resist stack should preferably be minimized as much as possible to universally improve the uniformity of organics deposition and reduce shadowing effects. According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, the height of the fluoropolymer base layer <b>16</b> should not exceed 530 nm, assuming that the positive-type resist image layer and inorganic transfer layer are limited to thicknesses of 500 nm and 100 nm respectively. It is also preferred that the actual minimum fluoropolymer base layer <b>16</b> thickness should range from 340-400 nm, while maintaining the ratio of 1.25&#xd7; the height of the organic stack.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> depicts a single bottom electrode <b>14</b> on a substrate <b>10</b> for illustrative purposes, however it is understood that the substrate <b>10</b> may have additional organic or OLED devices and a plurality of electrodes deposited upon it that are not shown in the magnified profile view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>.

The substrate <b>10</b> shown has layered on it, in order, an oxide layer <b>12</b>, bottom electrode <b>14</b>, a fluoropolymer base layer <b>16</b>, an intermediate inorganic transfer layer <b>18</b> and a positive-type photoresist top layer, herein referred to as the positive-type photoresist layer <b>20</b>, deposited directly on the inorganic transfer layer <b>18</b>. The positive-type photoresist layer <b>20</b> is responsible for recording the image of the photomask that is used for lithography. Once patterned with UV light, the positive-type photoresist layer <b>20</b> is referred to as the image layer. As previously mentioned, photoresists are categorized as positive or negative-type. Positive photoresists chemically transform and become soluble to etching when exposed to UV light. Therefore, only the exposed regions of the photoresist to light are removed through etching while the unexposed regions of the photoresist remain insoluble. Alternatively, for a negative photoresist, the region of the photoresist that is exposed to UV light or photolithography radiation becomes insoluble to etching. UV light is used herein as an example of radiation that can be used in photolithographic patterning, however it is understood that a range of wavelengths may be used based on the properties of the photoresist layer. Positive photoresists are easier to control during photolithography because they generally maintain their size and can receive a radiation pattern, have better etching resistance, have superior resolution, and have good thermal stability. The photoresist layer can be removed through chemical etching. Chemical etching techniques include but are not limited to use of a developer, plasma etching, reactive ion etching, and ion beam milling.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">In the disclosed trilayer resist system, the positive-type photoresist layer <b>20</b> needs to be of sufficient thickness to function as a mask for the etch of the inorganic transfer layer <b>18</b>, which is thin compared to what would be otherwise required in other photolithography systems. The positive-type photoresist layer <b>20</b> is also preferably deposited on a planar surface, in this case the planar inorganic transfer layer <b>18</b>, therefore it is not restricted by a minimum thickness dictated by the topography on which it is deposited. These factors allow the top positive-type photoresist layer <b>20</b> to be much thinner than would otherwise be possible for a single layer resist system, thereby enabling a higher resolution pattern to be imaged thereon, resulting in the ability of the present system to deposit higher resolution and smaller organic devices. The positive-type photoresist layer <b>20</b> may be deposited using a variety of techniques, for example using a spin coating technique, a sprayed-on technique, or dip application. Spin coating is a preferred method as it allows for finer control during application and a reduced layer thickness. The film for the positive-type photoresist layer <b>20</b> can be as thin as 10s of nanometers to several micrometers thick. Baking procedures used during the coating process should be carefully controlled to avoid heat damaging of the organic materials while enabling curing of the positive photoresist. In the present case, a baking temperature limit for the positive photoresist top layer <b>20</b> not exceeding 120&#xb0; C. has been found to be acceptable. It is understood that reference to deposition of the top positive photoresist layer <b>20</b> includes the physical deposition of the photoresist as well as all processing phases including drying, curing, degassing, and baking steps.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">The material selection criterion for the positive-type photoresist layer <b>20</b> should be considered such that the resist material provides strong adhesion to the inorganic transfer layer <b>18</b>, and the positive-type photoresist layer <b>20</b> is sufficiently thin to be completely removed by the oxygen plasma during the fluoropolymer base layer etch step. Suitable materials for the positive-type photoresist layer <b>20</b> include but are not limited to commercially available positive-type photoresists compatible with common developers and strippers with suitable film thickness. In an example, the positive photoresist can be formulated from a phenol-formaldehyde novolak resin. Specific examples of suitable positive photoresists are those from the AZ&#xae;1500 family of positive photoresists from Micro Chemicals.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>F</figref> illustrate a method of patterning the trilayer photoresist system and deposition of an organic layer on an exposed electrode in accordance with the present method. The organic layer can be an organic stack, or plurality of layers, wherein in at least one layer is comprised of an organic material. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> illustrates a cross section of a substrate with an electrode and a trilayer resist system following photolithography of the positive-type photoresist image layer. The substrate <b>10</b> shown has layered upon it, in order, an oxide layer <b>12</b> and a bottom electrode <b>14</b>, and the disclosed trilayer resist system comprising a fluoropolymer base layer <b>16</b>, an inorganic transfer layer <b>18</b>, and a positive-type photoresist layer <b>20</b>. A photolithography technique is used to pattern the positive-type photoresist layer <b>20</b> to expose the inorganic transfer layer <b>18</b> above bottom electrode <b>14</b> where the organic layer(s) will be deposited. A photomask can be used to develop the positive-type photoresist layer <b>20</b>. In an example of patterning, UV light is applied to the positive-type photoresist layer <b>20</b> in a desired pattern through a photomask, and the exposed regions of the positive-type photoresist layer <b>20</b> underneath the UV-transparent regions of the photomask become soluble to etching. The etching process then removes the soluble regions of the positive-type photoresist layer <b>20</b> transferring the desired pattern to the positive-type photoresist layer <b>20</b>. In this embodiment, etching is performed using a developer that may be comprised of a hydroxide such as, for example, sodium hydroxide (NaOH), potassium hydroxide (KOH), tetramethylammonium hydroxide, or other suitable materials. Developers typically have a limited range of useful dilutions. Highly concentrated dilutions have high sensitivity and allow faster photo speeds, but they are limited by high dark film losses and reduced contrast. The more dilute concentrations enable high contrast and provide greater selectivity between the exposed and unexposed resist. These require longer development times or increased exposure energy and have greater sensitivity to the effects of standing waves from monochromatic exposure. Sodium-based buffered developers provide optimal process control while minimizing the attack on aluminum surfaces. Potassium-based buffered developers provide optimal process control while minimizing contamination risks by using the less mobile potassium ion. In one example process, developers can have about a 1:4 dilution ratio, a development time of about 15-25 seconds and a water rinse time of about 55-65 seconds. The positive-type photoresist layer <b>20</b> should be developed with the developer after exposure of UV light through the photomask, taking care that the developer solution does not or only limitedly reacts with the inorganic transfer layer <b>18</b>. If a post exposure bake process is desired for the positive-type photoresist layer <b>20</b> to further remove solvent, the temperature should not exceed a temperature that would destabilize or damage the organic materials, for example 120&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> illustrates a cross section of a substrate, an electrode and a trilayer resist system, following etching of the inorganic transfer layer <b>18</b>.

The pattern formed in the top positive-type photoresist layer <b>20</b> is transferred to the inorganic transfer layer <b>18</b> by a wet etching process.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0153">There are a variety of etching techniques, including wet etching which utilizes a chemical etchant, and dry etching which uses a plasma, also referred to as plasma etching. Plasma etching is a processing technique whereby the surface of a source material becomes rougher on a microscopic scale. This is achieved using a reactive gas, such as oxygen, thereby altering both chemical and physical properties of the source material being etched. This chemical effect is imparted by the reactive gas, which steadily reacts and combines with the surface molecules of the material being etched. High energy ions are responsible for the physical effects as they physically hit surface atoms of the source material, thereby moving them to the gas phase. Ideally, the plasma recipe should be at a relatively high pressure and low power so that it is capable of producing an undercut. In this embodiment, the inorganic transfer layer <b>18</b> is etched, transferring the pattern formed in the top positive-type photoresist layer <b>20</b> to the inorganic transfer layer <b>18</b>. This transfer should preferably form an undercut region <b>22</b>. Etching of the inorganic transfer layer <b>18</b> using a high pressure and low power recipe will produce the desired undercut region <b>22</b>. For example, for a fluoropolymer base layer <b>16</b> thickness of 340-400 nm and an inorganic transfer layer thickness <b>18</b> of 100 nm, about 0.33-0.35 &#x3bc;m of minimum offset or undercut length has been found to prevent shadowing and non-uniform deposition of organic layers over the bottom electrode active area <b>46</b>. Preferably, the etching plasma and conditions used to remove the inorganic transfer layer <b>18</b> under the pattern created by the positive-type photoresist layer <b>20</b> are not damaging to the positive-type photoresist layer <b>20</b> or the fluoropolymer base layer <b>16</b> underneath. Wet or dry etching can be used for etching the inorganic transfer layer <b>18</b> of the disclosed trilayer resist system. Preferably, the etching plasma and conditions during a dry etch, or chemical interactions during a wet etch, which are used to remove the inorganic transfer layer <b>18</b> in the pattern created by the positive-type photoresist layer <b>20</b> are not damaging to the positive-type photoresist layer <b>20</b> or the fluoropolymer base layer <b>16</b> underneath. Depending on the choice of method for etching the inorganic transfer layer <b>18</b>, a small undercut <b>22</b> may be created which ideally will be minimised during processing.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0154"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> illustrates a cross section of a substrate, an electrode and a resist system, following etching of the fluoropolymer base layer with an oxygen plasma or fluorosolvent. The substrate <b>10</b> shown has layered on it, in order, an oxide layer <b>12</b> and bottom electrode <b>14</b>, a fluoropolymer base layer <b>16</b> and an inorganic transfer layer <b>18</b> following the transfer of the pattern from the inorganic transfer layer <b>18</b> to the fluoropolymer base layer <b>16</b>. The pattern transfer procedure can use, for example, a reactive ion etching (RIE) process, such as an oxygen plasma etch to remove a region of the fluoropolymer base layer <b>16</b> to expose bottom electrode <b>14</b> which is the electrically active area on which the organic stack or organic layer(s) will be deposited. Ideally, the reactive ion etching will not have a negative impact or cause damage to the underlying oxide layer <b>12</b>, bottom electrode <b>14</b>, or substrate <b>10</b> used for OLED or organic device operation. Additionally, preferably patterned etching of the fluoropolymer base layer <b>16</b> will proceed slightly sideways underneath the remaining inorganic transfer layer <b>18</b>, to produce a lateral undercut profile <b>24</b> and a longitudinal undercut profile <b>38</b>, ideal for the liftoff procedure. In one example, the lateral undercut profile <b>24</b> can be limited to &#x2265;0.25 &#x3bc;m in length. The underlying bottom electrode <b>14</b> can also be made accessible through the open pattern in the trilayer resist and can be treated prior to deposition of the organics. The degree of angle for the longitudinal undercut profile relative to the normal of the substrate <b>10</b> can vary. In a preferred example the longitudinal undercut profile <b>38</b> angle relative to substrate <b>10</b> is preferably at least 30 degrees from the lateral undercut profile. Etching the fluoropolymer base layer and creating the undercut can be done, using an etching treatment such as, for example, using UV ozone or an oxygen plasma. The lateral undercut profile <b>24</b> and longitudinal undercut profile <b>38</b> can be formed using an etching process in a similar way it is formed in the inorganic transfer layer <b>18</b>. The lateral undercut profile <b>24</b> and longitudinal undercut profile <b>38</b>, which is the minimum offset required to prevent shadowing, and overlay accuracy are all specific to the height of the fluoropolymer base layer <b>16</b> and the inorganic transfer layer <b>18</b> and change if the organic stack height changes. Generally, expanding the height of the fluoropolymer base layer <b>16</b> beyond 530 nm should be avoided unless it is accounted for by expanding the horizontal offset, lowering the sidewall angle, and/or lowering the thickness of the other layers. It has been found that maintaining and minimizing the sidewall angle of the fluoropolymer base layer <b>16</b> avoids excessive shadowing resulting from the limiting factor of the top edge over the inorganic transfer layer <b>18</b>. It is noted that etching of the fluoropolymer base layer <b>16</b> above the electrode <b>14</b> also substantially removes the remaining positive-type resist image layer <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0155">Preferably, the bottom fluoropolymer base layer <b>16</b> is etched by oxygen plasma or reactive ion etching (RIE) with reactive plasma to remove material deposited on the substrate. The fluoropolymer base layer <b>16</b> should therefore have good selectivity in an oxygen or reactive ion etching process. Etch selectivity can be described as the ratio of etch rates between materials. The formula for etch selectivity is:</p><p id="p-0157" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mi>Selectivity</mi>  <mo>=</mo>  <mfrac>   <mrow>    <mi>Etch</mi>    <mo>&#x2062;</mo>    <mtext>   </mtext>    <msub>     <mi>Rate</mi>     <mrow>      <mi>Material</mi>      <mo>&#x2062;</mo>      <mtext>   </mtext>      <mi>A</mi>     </mrow>    </msub>   </mrow>   <mrow>    <mi>Etch</mi>    <mo>&#x2062;</mo>    <mtext>   </mtext>    <msub>     <mi>Rate</mi>     <mrow>      <mi>Material</mi>      <mo>&#x2062;</mo>      <mtext>   </mtext>      <mi>B</mi>     </mrow>    </msub>   </mrow>  </mfrac> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0158" num="0156">Selective etching describes a process wherein a first material etches more rapidly than a second material. The result is a difference in the quantity of each material that is removed in a specific time period. For example, selective etching to a mask material means the mask is only slightly thinned while the material of interest to be etched has more material removed. Selective etching of a mask allows the mask to be much thinner and increases the ability to achieve a more vertical profile in the etched material. In other examples, consisting of layers of material, it may be useful to selectively etch one material and selectively stop on an underlying material. There are a variety of dielectrics and metals that act as suitable materials for the intermediate inorganic transfer layer <b>18</b>. The selectivity of these materials versus typical first resist layer materials to oxygen plasma is strong, which also enables this layer to be comparatively thin. In optical lithography, another consideration is alignment of the mask pattern to features on the substrate <b>10</b>. This intermediate inorganic transfer layer <b>18</b> can be as thin as 10s of nanometers to 100s of nanometers thick. Examples of films that can be used include metals such as aluminum, chromium, or dielectrics such as silicon dioxide. It should be noted that any film that is highly selective over fluoropolymer films to an oxygen plasma etch would be suitable. The film may be deposited using physical vapor deposition techniques such as evaporation or sputtering, chemical vapor deposition techniques such as plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition, or a spin coating process. Preferably temperatures involved in the deposition should not exceed about 120&#xb0; C. to avoid damage to any organic materials. It is generally preferable that the inorganic transfer layer <b>18</b> is transparent to the wavelength of light used for alignment. The inorganic transfer layer <b>18</b> ideally has good selectivity to oxygen plasma as an oxygen plasma etching process is performed to transfer the pattern from the inorganic transfer layer <b>18</b> to the fluoropolymer base layer <b>16</b>. A transparent or semi-transparent material selection would be beneficial for alignment purposes, therefore SiO<sub>2 </sub>is also candidate for the inorganic transfer layer material. One consideration is that the SiO<sub>2 </sub>be low stress in order to sustain the deposition of the top positive-type photoresist image layer.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0157"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref> illustrates a cross section of a substrate with an electrode and a resist system following the deposition of an organic stack.

In this embodiment, the organic stack <b>26</b> comprises at least one layer of organic material suitable for creating an OLED device. In alternative embodiments of an organic device, the organic stack <b>26</b> may be a single organic layer. In one example, the layers of the organic stack <b>26</b> are deposited using thermal evaporation deposition. Evaporation deposition may be defined as a method of thin-film deposition wherein the source material is evaporated in a vacuum. The vacuum allows vapor particles to travel directly to the target object (substrate <b>10</b>), where they condense back to a solid state.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0158">A shadow mask can be used for evaporation deposition, wherein the evaporation gas travels through the opening in the shadow mask onto the bottom electrode <b>14</b>, such that an organic stack <b>26</b>, corresponding to the width of the lower portion of the opening is formed on the bottom electrode <b>14</b>. This can prevent the generation of shadow effect or reducing the widths of the inner and outer shadows of the organic stack <b>26</b> during evaporation. Shadow masks are generally micro-structures, or stencils, that are used to define device areas, with precision, for deposition, etching, or a variety of applications suitable for processing a substrate. Precision is particularly important when depositing the organic stack <b>26</b> on the bottom electrode <b>14</b> to avoid shadowing effects. Shadowing effects may result in the organic stack <b>26</b> not fully covering the active area of the bottom electrode <b>46</b>, resulting in decreased performance and edge effects on the perimeter of the bottom electrode active area <b>46</b> due to a reduced thickness of the organic stack <b>26</b> layers at that perimeter. This can further result in non-optimal electrical properties and optical characteristics in an OLED device. Shadowing effects can be reduced by using a shadow mask for precise deposition and by forming a lateral undercut profile <b>24</b> and a longitudinal undercut profile <b>38</b> in the fluoropolymer base layer during etching. The lateral undercut profile <b>24</b> and a longitudinal undercut profile <b>38</b> allows the organic stack <b>26</b> to be deposited on a defined device area that extends the width of the bottom electrode active area <b>46</b>. The thickness of the organic stack <b>26</b> is preferably less than the thickness of the fluoropolymer base layer <b>16</b> in order to form the optimal lateral undercut profile <b>24</b> and a longitudinal undercut profile <b>38</b> in the fluoropolymer base layer <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0159">For an OLED device, the organic layers of the organic stack <b>26</b> may include, but are not limited to, one or more electron transport layers (ETL), emission layers (EML), hole transport layers (HTL), and hole injection layers (HIL).

The base layer was applied to the substrate using a spin-coating technique to achieve &#x2dc;420&#xb1;20 nm film. The thickness of the base layer was measured using a Filmetrics measurement tool. The fluoropolymer base layer was then baked for 15 minutes at room temperature, followed by a subsequent bake for 30 minutes at 105&#xb0; C. The inorganic transfer layer was then deposited on top of the CYTOP base layer at room temperature, with a thickness of 50-100 nm, using magnetron sputtering. The substrate, base layer and inorganic transfer layer were then spin coated with positive resist of AZ&#xae;1505 (positive-type resist image layer) at a thickness of 500-600 nm, therefore completing deposition of the trilayer resist system. The resist was then baked at 100&#xb0; C. for 2min and rehydrated for 5min. The trilayer system was subsequently exposed to UV light using direct write lithography and then developed using an AZ&#xb0; 400K developer.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0165"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> illustrates a cross section of the UV exposure stage of photolithography for patterning a second color OLED using the disclosed trilayer resist system on a substrate with a first color OLED structure already deposited thereon. Substrate <b>10</b> shown has deposited thereon, in order, an optional oxide layer <b>12</b>, a first color OLED organic stack <b>26</b><i>a </i>on a first bottom electrode <b>14</b><i>a, </i>and a trilayer resist system comprising a fluoropolymer base layer <b>16</b>, an inorganic transfer layer <b>18</b>, and a positive-type photoresist layer <b>20</b>. The trilayer resist system is then used for patterning a second color OLED organic stack on a second bottom electrode <b>14</b><i>b. </i>In the trilayer resist system, the positive-type photoresist layer <b>20</b> is patterned using a photolithography process. The photomask <b>34</b> has transparent regions <b>42</b> where UV light rays can penetrate and opaque regions <b>44</b> which block UV light from reaching the positive-type photoresist layer <b>20</b>. The transparent region <b>42</b> of the photomask <b>34</b> allows UV light rays to penetrate through to the underlying positive-type photoresist layer <b>20</b> material. Conversely, the opaque region <b>44</b> of photomask <b>34</b> prevents UV light rays from penetrating through to the material under the photomask <b>34</b>, protecting the organic stack <b>26</b><i>a </i>underneath and exposing only the area above the electrodes on top of which the second color organic stack should be deposited. In the case of the disclosed trilayer resist system, the opaque region <b>44</b> of the photomask <b>34</b> covers the material above the first color OLED organic stack <b>26</b><i>a. </i>The positive-type photoresist is a type of photoresist in which the region of the photoresist that is exposed to light becomes soluble to the photoresist developer after the positive resist in the positive-type photoresist layer <b>20</b> is degraded by ultraviolet light. Generally, the UV light preferably has a wavelength of 100-450 nm, more preferably 300-450 nm. The unexposed region of the positive-type photoresist under the opaque region <b>44</b> of the photomask <b>34</b> remains insoluble to the photoresist developer. Positive photoresists are well known in the art and highly controllable, however, traditionally have not been able to be used when patterning organic devices due to the damaging nature of their developers to organic materials. In the present case, the developer used to dissolve the part of the positive-type photoresist exposed to UV light does not penetrate the inorganic transfer layer <b>18</b>, thus protecting the organic stack underneath. Negative photoresists are not commonly used as the resolution is limited due to swelling in the exposed crosslinked areas caused by solvent uptake. Use of a positive photoresist in a trilayer resist system can benefit from the positive photoresist's etching resistance, superior resolution, and thermal stability. A further advantage of the implementation of a positive-type photoresist with a photomask in the present trilayer system, is that the first color OLED organic stack <b>26</b><i>a </i>is protected from UV exposure when patterning the second color OLED structure. During development of the positive-type photoresist layer <b>20</b> the inorganic transfer layer <b>18</b> acts as a barrier layer, protecting the organic stack <b>26</b><i>a </i>from the developer, which is very harmful to organic materials. The trilayer resist system is particularly advantageous for patterning multiple organic devices, specifically, multi-color OLED arrays, on a single substrate <b>10</b>. This is achieved by patterning an array of OLEDs for a first color, then subsequently patterning a second and then third color, if desired, with the photomask exposing only those bottom electrodes desired for organic stack deposition.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0166"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> illustrates a cross section of a substrate with a first color organic stack patterned on a first electrode, a second electrode and a trilayer resist system following patterning of the positive-type photoresist image layer.
