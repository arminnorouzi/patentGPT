In some implementations, the low-complexity error correction decoder decodes the input data prior to the high-complexity error correction decoder based on the cascade order. In some implementations, in response to an event that the low-complexity error correction decoder is unable to decode the input data, the high-complexity error correction decoder decodes the codewords.

One mistake can corrupt the entire message. No matter how systems communicate, they face this problem, since there is no perfect noiseless environment in term of data communication (e.g., digital data communication). One kind of corruption occurs when a bit flips&#x2014;a transmitter sends a &#x201c;1&#x201d; but it is received as a &#x201c;0&#x201d; or a &#x201c;0&#x201d; which is received as a &#x201c;1.&#x201d; These are called errors. Another kind of corruption is an erasure which occurs when the bits are so distorted that they are considered unknowns or blanks in the message. In this disclosure, for convenience purposes, the corruption is also referred to as an error.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In a system for a fiber-optic network, a transceiver in the fiber-optic network may suffer from the data corruption. Particularly, as the data transmission rate of the fiber-optic network increases, the data corruption is more likely to occur at the transceiver of the fiber-optic network. A transceiver may include a physical media dependent (PMD) module (hereinafter also referred as &#x201c;fiber-optic interface unit&#x201d;) and a transmission convergence-media access control (TC-MAC) module (hereinafter also referred as &#x201c;host unit&#x201d;). The fiber-optic interface unit is configured to couple with one or more optical fiber lines. As a result, fast-traveling pulses of light are transmitted from the optical fiber line to the transceiver. At the fiber-optic interface unit, the fast-traveling pulses of light (e.g., input data including codewords) are received and converted into electrical signals (e.g., input data in electrical signal form) that can further travel to the host unit via an electrical interface (e.g., electrical interface on the fiber-optic interface unit side, electrical interface on the host unit side, electrical connection between the interfaces). Here, the data corruption can occur for various reasons (e.g., noise such as connection/line noise, intersymbol interference (ISI), fiber dispersion) when the pulses of light (input data) are traveled through the optical fiber line and received/converted into the electrical signal form and when input data in the electrical signal form is transmitted from the fiber-optic interface unit to the host unit via the electrical interface.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The present disclosure includes implementations of forward error correction (FEC) techniques that may increase the data transmission reliability of fiber-optic network by correcting the data corruption and decrease power consumption. In some circumstances, implementations of the present disclosure may include two-step FEC decoding (e.g., a first step FEC decoding at the fiber-optic interface unit and a second step FEC decoding at the host unit) that enables data corruption correction (e.g., error correction) in a seamless and efficient way.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The present disclosure may implement a fiber-optic interface unit integrated with a soft-decision input FEC decoder that leverages increased coding gain from soft-input (e.g., input data in analog electrical signal form). In some configurations, the FEC coding gain is not sacrificed by the impact of the electrical interface. Further, this configuration may enable additional coding gain from direct coupling to an advanced equalizer.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The present disclosure may enable a fiber-optic interface unit pluggable to a transceiver by making the electrical interface between the fiber-optic interface unit and a host unit more robust from the data corruption. When analog data (e.g., analog electrical signals) is exchanged between the fiber-optic interface unit and the host unit, the analog data is more likely to corrupt due to the noise. However, in some implementations, design of the printed circuit board for the transceiver is not limited by the high noise sensitivity of the electrical interface for analog data.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The present disclosure includes implementations of correcting bit errors mainly caused by an electrical interface in a seamless and efficient way on a host unit. In some implementations, the host unit may include a simplified FEC decoder that needs to correct data that has a comparatively low bit error rate (BER). In some implementations, an additional FEC encoding in a fiber-optic interface unit is not necessary since parity bits from a first FEC decoding step are re-used. In some implementations, additional timing markers are not necessary for delineation of FEC codewords since the framing structures and alignment markers from the received signal are reused. Accordingly, in some implementations, seamless integration into the processing chain is possible. In some implementations, real time exchange of meta data between the fiber-optic interface unit and the host unit is not necessary. In some implementations, additional standardization efforts are not necessary besides the BER of the electrical interface.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The present disclosure includes a simplified host unit with regard to sync pattern search and FEC decoding in accordance with some implementations. This also can be beneficial for multi-channel implementations of the host unit.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The present disclosure may provide line rates that are homogenous both on optical side (e.g., optical fiber line and fiber-optic interface unit) and electrical side (e.g., fiber-optic interface unit, host unit, and electrical connection between the fiber-optic interface unit and the host unit), and in both transmitting (TX) direction and receiving (RX) direction. Accordingly, a mixture of various line rates (on each section of the interfaces) is not necessary. For example, the same line rate is maintained from the optical fiber line to the host unit.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The present disclosure may provide a host unit, configured with two FEC decoders (e.g., two different types of decoder), which can work with the fiber-optic interface unit configured with and without FEC decoding capability. In some implementations, the host unit is configured to determine which type of decoder should be used (automatically) based on the BER of input data transmitted from the fiber-optic interface unit (e.g., codewords from the fiber-optic interface unit).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The present disclosure may be applied to any optical networking system, including high-speed PON (e.g., any speed above 10 Gbps, including 50G-PON an higher).</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a simplified schematic view of an example transceiver <b>100</b> associated with a fiber-optic interface unit <b>130</b>, coupled with an optical fiber line <b>110</b>, and a host unit <b>150</b>.
