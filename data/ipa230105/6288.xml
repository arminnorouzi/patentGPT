In addition, the secondary battery <b>100</b> according to an embodiment of the present disclosure may further include a corrosion preventer <b>180</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The electrode assembly <b>110</b> includes a first electrode plate, a second electrode plate, and a separator.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The first electrode plate may be any one of a negative electrode plate and a positive electrode plate. When the first electrode plate is a negative electrode plate, the first electrode plate may include, for example, but is not limited to, a negative electrode coating portion in which a negative electrode active material is coated on a negative electrode current collector plate made of a thin conductive metal plate, for example, copper or nickel foil or mesh, and a negative electrode non-coating portion in which a negative electrode active material is not coated. Here, the negative active material may be made of, for example, but is not limited to, a carbon-based material, Si, Sn, tin oxide, a tin alloy composite, a transition metal oxide, lithium metal nitrite, or a metal oxide.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The second electrode plate may be the other one of the negative electrode plate and the positive electrode plate. As described above, when the first electrode plate is a negative electrode plate, the second electrode plate may be a positive electrode plate. In this case, the second electrode plate may include a positive electrode coating portion in which a positive electrode active material is coated on a positive electrode current collector plate made of a thin metal plate having excellent conductivity, for example, aluminum foil or mesh, and a positive electrode non-coating portion in which a positive electrode active material is not coated. Here, the positive electrode active material may be, for example, but is not limited to, a chalcogenide compound, for example, a composite metal oxide, such as LiCoO<sub>2</sub>, LiMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, LiNiO<sub>2</sub>, LiNiMnO<sub>2</sub>, or the like.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The separator is interposed between the first electrode plate and the second electrode plate to prevent or substantially prevent a short circuit between the first electrode plate and the second electrode plate. The separator may be made of, for example, but is not limited to, polyethylene, polypropylene, a porous copolymer of polyethylene and polypropylene, and the like.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The electrode assembly <b>110</b> may be stacked, for example, in such a manner that the lower end of the first electrode plate protrudes lower than the lower end of the second electrode plate, and the upper end of the second electrode plate protrudes higher than the upper end of the first electrode plate, and thus may be wound in the form of a jelly roll.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In an embodiment, the case <b>120</b> is shaped of a cylinder having a surface open to accommodate the electrode assembly <b>110</b> and another surface (e.g., an opposite surface) closed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates that the lower surface is open and the upper surface is closed, but the upper surface may be open and the lower surface may be closed, as desired. However, for purposes of understanding, as shown in the drawing, the following description will be made with respect to a case in which the upper surface is closed and the lower surface is open.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The cap plate <b>130</b> is shaped to correspond to the lower surface of the case <b>120</b>, for example, in a disk shape, and serves to seal the lower surface of the case <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The first current collector plate <b>140</b> is disposed between the electrode assembly <b>110</b> and the cap plate <b>130</b> inside the case <b>120</b>, and electrically connects the first electrode plate of the electrode assembly <b>110</b> and the cap plate <b>130</b> to each other. As described above, when the first electrode plate of the electrode assembly <b>110</b> is a negative electrode plate, the cap plate <b>130</b> in contact with the first current collector plate <b>140</b> and the case <b>120</b> in contact with the cap plate <b>130</b> will have a negative polarity.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In an embodiment, the case <b>120</b>, the cap plate <b>130</b>, and the first collector plate <b>140</b> may be bonded to each other by welding, for example, laser welding. To this end, first, in a state in which the electrode assembly <b>110</b> is installed in the case <b>120</b>, the first current collector plate <b>140</b> is disposed under the case <b>120</b> so as to allow the first current collector plate <b>140</b> to be in contact with the first electrode plate of the electrode assembly <b>110</b>. Next, the lower surface of the case <b>120</b> is closed with the cap plate <b>130</b> so as to allow the cap plate <b>130</b> to be in contact with the first current collecting plate <b>140</b>. Thereafter, a laser is irradiated to an outer surface of the cap plate <b>130</b> from the outside of the cap plate <b>130</b> to weld the cap plate <b>130</b> and the first current collector plate <b>140</b>. Herein, the resulting welding portion provided on the outer surface of the cap plate <b>130</b> is referred to as a first welding portion W<b>1</b>. Next, a laser is irradiated to the outer surface of the cap plate <b>130</b>, more specifically, to a boundary region between the case <b>120</b> and the cap plate <b>130</b>, from the outside of the cap plate <b>130</b>, to weld the case <b>120</b> and the cap plate <b>130</b>. Herein, the resulting welding portion provided on the outer surface of the cap plate <b>130</b> is referred to as a second welding portion W<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">If a laser were irradiated from an inside of the case <b>120</b> to an inner peripheral surface of the case <b>120</b> or an inner surface of the first current collector plate <b>140</b>, spatters may be generated during welding and remain inside the case <b>120</b>, thereby lowering safety. However, in the secondary battery <b>100</b> according to an embodiment of the present disclosure, the first welding portion W<b>1</b> and the second welding portion W<b>2</b> are provided on the outer surface of the cap plate <b>130</b>, that is, after the lower surface of the case <b>120</b> is closed with the cap plate <b>130</b>, a laser is irradiated to the outer surface of the cap plate <b>130</b> from the outside of the cap plate <b>130</b> to weld the first current collector plate <b>140</b> and the cap plate <b>130</b>, and, thus, even if spatters are generated during welding, the spatters can be prevented or substantially prevented from being introduced into the case <b>120</b>, and the spatters can be easily suctioned and removed by using a separate suctioning device (not shown).</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Although it has been described above that the cap plate <b>130</b> and the first current collector plate <b>140</b> are first welded and the case <b>120</b> and the cap plate <b>130</b> are then welded, the case <b>120</b> and the cap plate <b>130</b> may first be welded and the cap plate <b>130</b> and the first current collector plate <b>140</b> may then be welded, as desired. Alternatively, the case <b>120</b> and the cap plate <b>130</b> may be welded at the same time as the cap plate <b>130</b> and the first current collecting plate <b>140</b> are welded.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In an embodiment, a stepped portion <b>121</b> may be formed at a lower portion of the case <b>120</b> so as to allow the first current collecting plate <b>140</b> and the cap plate <b>130</b> to be stably disposed with respect to the case <b>120</b>. For example, as a whole, that is, above the stepped portion <b>121</b>, an inner diameter of the case <b>120</b> may be smaller than outer diameters of the first current collecting plate <b>140</b> and the cap plate <b>130</b>, while the inner diameter of the stepped portion <b>121</b> may be substantially the same as the outer diameters of the first current collecting plate <b>140</b> and the cap plate <b>130</b>. Accordingly, the first current collecting plate <b>140</b> may be disposed under the case <b>120</b> so as to allow the first current collecting plate <b>140</b> to be seated on the stepped portion <b>121</b>, and the lower surface of the case <b>120</b> may be closed with the cap plate <b>130</b> so as to allow the cap plate <b>130</b> to be in close contact with the first current collecting plate <b>140</b>. Thereafter, by pressing and welding the cap plate <b>130</b> by using a separate jig (not shown), for example, a gap between parts may be eliminated and welding quality can be improved.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In an embodiment, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the first current collecting plate <b>140</b> may have a structure in which a first region (e.g., an entire region) <b>141</b> is cut and bent with respect to a second region <b>142</b>. In an embodiment, the first current collector plate <b>140</b>, which includes the first region <b>141</b> mainly in contact with the first electrode plate of the electrode assembly <b>110</b> and the second region <b>142</b> mainly in contact with the cap plate <b>130</b>, may be constructed so as to be elastically deformably bent to allow the first region <b>141</b> to have a height difference (e.g., a vertical offset) with respect to the second region <b>142</b>. Accordingly, even if tolerances occur in the electrode assembly <b>110</b>, the case <b>120</b>, the cap plate <b>130</b>, the first current collector plate <b>140</b>, etc. during manufacturing, the first region <b>141</b> may come into close contact with the first electrode plate of the electrode assembly <b>110</b> and the second region <b>142</b> may come into close contact with the cap plate <b>130</b>, through the flexible first current collector plate <b>140</b>, while the cap plate <b>130</b> may be assembled so as to be arranged substantially on the same plane as the lower surface of the case <b>120</b> (the cross-section of the lower end of the case <b>120</b>).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In an embodiment, the cap plate <b>130</b> may or may not have an electrolyte injection hole <b>131</b> formed therein. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates that the electrolyte injection hole <b>131</b> is formed.

The corrosion preventer <b>180</b> may be, for example, a rust preventing agent applied on the first welding portion W<b>1</b> and the second welding portion W<b>2</b>. In an embodiment, to limit an area to which the rust preventing agent is to be applied, the cap plate <b>130</b> may have a groove <b>132</b> formed in regions corresponding to the first welded portion W<b>1</b> and the second welded portion W<b>2</b>.
