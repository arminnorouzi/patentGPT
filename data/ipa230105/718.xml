Once disease of the myocardium or its vasculature exists, procedures may be required for diagnosis and treatment. Cardiac catheterization is among the most common of the invasive cardiac procedures. It is the set of procedures whereby diagnostic and therapeutic catheters are placed within the coronary vasculature or chambers of the heart so as to allow diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. When coronary artery procedures are performed using catheters advanced through arteries and veins from the skin, the procedure is often called percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). Cardiac catheterization is generally performed in specialized facilities called cardiac catheterization laboratories, also referred to as cathlabs.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Cathlab associated procedures can include angioplasty, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), angiography, transcatheter aortic valve replacement, and various other procedures that will be known to those skilled in the art. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of a typical Cathlab showing various components, according to an illustrative embodiment.

These contrast agents typically contain iodine as the radiopaque constituent, and can be either ionic or non-ionic in nature, depending on the carrier used for iodine.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0011">Maximization of the contrast injection method can help in obtaining images in which the coronary blood vessels are emphasized and artifacts are minimized. Factors such as: location of injection, concentration, shape, timing, rate, and composition of the contrast bolus can contribute to effectiveness of the contrast medium. In the injection process, one factor is the site, i.e. the blood vessel, chosen to inject the contrast. Faster injection rates allow coronary arteries to be accentuated more and within lesser time i.e. the peak enhancement time for coronary arteries is reduced.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0012">One injection enhancement approach is based on the pattern of radiocontrast administration i.e. it involves a multi-stage injection process with separate doses of contrast, saline, or diluted contrast. Multi-headed injectors that store the radiocontrast and saline solution separately have made this possible. In the biphasic technique a bolus of undiluted radiocontrast is injected first, which is then followed by a smaller volume of saline &#x201c;chaser.&#x201d; A triphasic approach also may be employed where the undiluted contrast bolus is injected first, followed by a diluted bolus of contrast and finally saline. Using a saline chaser following a contrast bolus ensures that the entire volume of contrast is delivered to the coronary vessels rather than being stuck in the catheter. It can improve coronary angiography by removing the streak artifacts in the images of the coronary artery that are caused by accumulation of contrast in the right ventricle or superior vena cava.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="2">CPR and Motion Artifact</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0013">A cathlab can allow a patient to be examined with diagnostic imaging equipment, so that doctors and/or other medical professionals can see the arteries, veins, and chambers of the heart in action while the patient's heart is pumping blood through the circulatory system. The cath lab can be used to monitor the function of a patient's heart, and/or can be used to monitor a patient with various abnormalities or dysfunction in the circulatory system. In some situations, a patient who is undergoing examination in a cath lab may also require the use of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).</p><p id="p-0010" num="0014">Cardiac arrest can occur in the cath lab, and is associated with dramatically worsened patient outcomes. Historically, when automated CPR devices are used in a cath lab, they are stand-alone devices and not integrated into the imaging systems of the cath lab. When automated CPR devices are used in the cath lab, the chest compressions of CPR can cause motion of visceral structures, including the coronary arteries. Motion of the coronary arteries can cause motion artifact and makes various procedures done in the cath lab more difficult to accomplish accurately and safely. These procedures can include angioplasty, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), angiography, transcatheter aortic valve replacement, and various other procedures done in a cath lab that will be known to those skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0015">Motion artifact is a problem in almost all forms of medical imaging, and can interfere with the quality of images during cathlab procedures. Recent approaches have tested deep learning techniques for the removal of motion artifacts through extraction of features and by applying image processing techniques. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), in particular, single-scaled and de-noised, CNN have been used.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0016">The vast majority of PCI's are performed in patients with a beating heart under mild sedation. Occasionally, however, cardiac arrest occurs and the procedure must be performed simultaneously with CPR. This circumstance is associated with dramatically worse patient outcomes.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0017">Continuing with PCI in arrested patients without CPR places the patients at much greater risk of poor outcomes. The human brain is intolerant of even short intervals of absent blood flow and ischemia related vital organ injury may result in post-anoxic encephalopathy. Generally, the chest compressions of CPR are started immediately while alternatives such as automated CPR devices, endovascular pumps, or extracorporeal circulation are considered.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0018">Manual CPR and piston based automated CPR devices create blood flow by compressing the anterior chest. This provides motive force to cardiac and thoracic CPR pump mechanisms. However, its application is also associated damage to skeletal and visceral organ structures, and of particular importance in relation to the fluoroscopic imaging utilized in cardiac catheterization, the sternal compressions of CPR create large abnormal motions of cardiac structures. These motion artifacts make fluoroscopic interpretation of coronary anatomy and the phenomena of PCI difficult, which can significantly impede successful performance of PCI procedures. If the coronary artery with the culprit coronary occlusion cannot be successfully reopened by balloon angioplasty and maintained open by stenting, then reversal of the cardiac arrest may be impaired. CPR related motion artifact is particularly challenging for interventional cardiologists because they encounter it only infrequently and do not develop expertise at ignoring it.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0019">Most commonly, when cardiac arrest occurs in the cathlab, cardiopulmonary resuscitation is performed manually with a member of the cathlab team pushing on the middle of the chest. This has a number of limitations, including:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0020">Manual CPR is generally associated with inadequate forward blood flow.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0021">The provider of chest compressions is in a suboptimal position and often requires a stepstool to achieve appropriate height above the patient.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0022">The provider of chest compressions is on the opposite side of the catheterization table, and is often interfering with views of the procedure.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0023">The hands of the provider of chest compressions are in the fluoroscopic field-of-view.

Vest-CPR is more effective than manual CPR and existing automated devices, and can be more compatible with the cathlab. The pneumatic vest that is applied to the patient is completely radiolucent and will not interfere with imaging. It is associated with significantly less cardiac motion than sternal-based CPR. Unlike current automated CPR devices, it does not have a tendency to move out of the optimal location around the thorax. Because it spreads the motive force circumferentially, it is associated with significantly lower rates of thoracic skeletal and visceral organ injury. In its standard embodiment, it is free of a backboard and can be pre-positioned in high-risk patients. It can be integrated into the cathlab system so as to reduce thoracic and/or myocardial motion artifact. Integration of this device with other components of the cathlab allows for improved effectiveness of imaging, defibrillation, CPR, and hemodynamics. The integration of the cathlab imaging system with the CPR device allows removal of the CPR related cardiac motion artifact. Integration of this device with the contrast injector pump allows optimization of contrast media in the abnormal state of inadequate or absent spontaneous circulation.

The method can integrate an automated CPR device and all major cathlab components that might be used during PCI in cardiac arrested patients to achieve both more effective resuscitation and more effective PCI.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0047">Vest-CPR is more effective than manual CPR and existing automated devices Vest CPR can include application of circumferential constriction CPR using an inflatable or pneumatic vest, as taught in U.S. Pat. No. 10,772,793 to Paradis, titled MECHANICAL CARDIOPULMONARY RESUSCITATION COMBINING CIRCUMFERENTIAL CONSTRICTION AND ANTEROPOSTERIOR COMPRESSION OF THE CHEST, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, and U.S. Patent Publication No. 2021/0059900 to Halperin et al., titled DEVICES AND METHODS FOR ACTIVE DECOMPRESSION OF THE CHEST DURING CIRCUMFERENTIAL CONSTRICTION CARDIOPULMONARY RESUSCITATION, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Vest CPR is not only more effective at creating forward blood flow, but also is intrinsically safer with respect to skeletal and visceral organ injury. Cathlab patients are often anticoagulated, and the injuries created by the existing automated CPR devices and manual CPR, or particularly concerning in patients who cannot properly form blood clots.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0048">The vest CPR component that is applied to the patient can be completely radiolucent and will not interfere with imaging. The patient portion of vest CPR can be a fully enclosed pneumatic bladder made of materials such as ballistic nylon or radio welded polyurethane coated ballistic nylon.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0049">When not inflating, the CPR vest can have a form factor that is completely flat, or nearly completely flat. It can thus be laid across the cathlab table beforehand and closed around the patient only when needed. It's presence, when not being utilized, causes no patient discomfort and no impact on cathlab procedures.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0050">Vest CPR is associated with significantly less cardiac motion than sternal-based CPR techniques. In many cases, the cardiac arrest that supervenes a PCI is caused by occlusion of one or more coronary arteries. While CPR is needed to prevent irreversible brain injury after the occlusion has occurred, in most cases the PCI procedure should continue with the purpose of alleviating the coronary occlusion and reestablishing coronary blood flow. However, existing CPR techniques create a large degree of abnormal motion of the myocardium and other mediastinal structures. This cyclic anterior to posterior motion artifact interferes with the ability of the interventional cardiologist to delineate structures and continue with PCI procedures. Circumferential vest CPR does induce anterior to posterior motion of the precordium, but because it stabilizes the whole of the thorax circumferentially, abnormal cardiac motion is significantly reduced as compared to manual CPR or piston-type mechanical CPR.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0051">Unlike, current automated CPR devices, vest CPR does not have a tendency to move out of its optimal location and orientation around the patient's thorax. Current automated devices often require that cathlab personnel direct their attention towards preventing movement of the piston device away from the mid sternum. This is not required with vest CPR. Vest CPR can also include use of multiple pneumatic bladders in different locations, and different bladders can be inflated separately or in combination with other bladders, as taught in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2019/0209428 to Paradis, titled METHODS AND DEVICES TO IMPROVE THE EFFICACY OF MECHANICAL CARDIOPULMONARY RESUSCITATION BY CHANGING THE POSITION OF CHEST COMPRESSION, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. This allows the location and/or direction of compressive force to be varied in a way that can maximize the effectiveness of CPR and/or maximize the effectiveness of cathlab procedures including imaging of the heart and coronary arteries.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0052">Because it can spread the motive force circumferentially, vest CPR is associated with significantly lower rates of thoracic skeletal and visceral organ injury. This can be a significant advantage in a population of patients that are often anticoagulated.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0053">Unlike existing automated CPR devices, vest CPR can be free of a backboard, and can be pre-positioned in high-risk patients. The backboards of existing automated CPR devices are relatively thick and cannot be pre-positioned as they would be uncomfortable to patients who are conscious or mildly sedated.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0054">It has also been previously described that integration of defibrillation capabilities into a CPR device can improve the efficacy of defibrillation, as described in U.S. Pat.

When used for motion artifacts caused by respiratory motion, predictive respiratory gating can be implemented. In this approach the breathing pattern of the patient can be monitored and the data can be used to predict when motion will cease temporarily in the respiratory cycle, and the imaging system can start scanning automatically for this time duration.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0069">Although vest CPR is associated with less abnormal cardiac motion than manual CPR and existing piston-type devices, vest CPR may still result in some abnormal motion of the cardiac structures. Integration of the imaging systems and CPR systems by means of a computer based controller can allow additional removal of the abnormal motion by means of gating. When image gating is used, the imaging display monitor would not show all portions of the CPR compression-decompression cycle. Instead, the user would be presented with real time imaging during that portion of the CPR cycle in which the mechanical device is in its release phase and all internal thoracic structures are in their native configuration. At end-release, the final fluoroscopic image would be retained on the monitor screen throughout the active constriction phase. Real time imaging can then re-initiate at the beginning of the next full release interval.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a chart showing the gating of imaging across CPR cycles, according to an illustrative embodiment. Baseline <b>302</b> represents the state when the automated CPR device is not applying compression to the patient. Put another way, at baseline <b>302</b>, the patient is at a normal anatomic, resting state, with all organs and internal structures in a normal position. At uncompressed stage <b>312</b> of the CPR cycle, the CPR machine is not applying any force or compression to the patient, and the patient is at a normal, resting state. At increasing compression stage <b>314</b>, the CPR device is applying increasing compression to the patient in an effort to assist the movement of blood through the patient. At maximum compression stage <b>316</b>, the CPR device has reached maximum compression, and is holding the compression in an effort to assist the movement of blood through the patient. In the case of a CPR machine with inflatable, or pneumatic, bladders, maximum compression stage <b>316</b> is the state of maximum inflation for the bladders. At releasing compression stage <b>318</b>, the CPR device is releasing the compression on the patient until the cycle returns to uncompressed stage <b>312</b>. With respect to vest CPR, deflation of the vest, or bladders of the vest, allows for the return to uncompressed stage <b>312</b>. In various embodiments, the timing of the cycles can be the timing recommended by the American Heart Association for CPR. In various embodiments, the timing of the cycles can include 300 ms of uncompressed stage <b>312</b> and 300 ms of maximum compression stage <b>316</b> per cycle. In various embodiments, the timing of the cycle can be optimized by the controller and/or by the physician to improve the performance of CPR and/or improve the performance of the cathlab and cathlab imaging. In various embodiments, optimizing the timing of the CPR cycle can include adjusting the lengths of one or more of the uncompressed stage <b>312</b>, increasing compression stage <b>314</b>, maximum compression stage <b>316</b>, and/or releasing compression stage <b>318</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0071">The image gating system can allow the fluoroscopic image of the patient to be displayed on the monitor in real time during the imaging phase <b>320</b>. Imaging phase <b>320</b> can be while the patient is in an uncompressed state.

In various embodiments, the non-imaging phase can include the increasing compression stage <b>314</b>, the maximum compression stage <b>316</b>, and the releasing compression stage <b>318</b>. The gating system can provide live, real-time images while the patient is in an uncompressed state, and then hold the last image taken before compression starts, and then return to live, real-time imaging when the patient returns to an uncompressed state. The input signal for gating the imaging system may be obtained from the automated CPR device or from integrated accelerometers on the patient facing surface of the pneumatic vest.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0072">Utilizing biomarkers of hemodynamics, and measures of abnormal cardiac motion from the imaging subsystem, it can be possible for the controller to adapt the pattern of CPR constrictions and compressions so as to maintain hemodynamics while minimizing abnormal cardiac motion. In various embodiments, this can be achieved in real time by using previously derived multivariable algorithms, and/or by using machine learning-based closed-loop control.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0073">This coordination between the cathlab imaging system and the CPR system allows the physician to see the organs and internal structures of the patient without motion.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0000">Synchronization of Radiocontrast Injection with CPR Chest Compressions</p><p id="p-0041" num="0074">The forward movement through the patient's circulatory system of radiocontrast material deposited into the aortic root for cardiac catheterization during cardiac arrest is often impaired due to relatively low forward blood flow.

Contrast injection can also be enhanced by synchronizing the injection of contrast material with CPR relaxation, such as releasing compression stage <b>318</b> and/or uncompressed stage <b>312</b>, because the lower intrathoracic pressure may enhance injection.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">Synchronization of Defibrillation and Thoracic Compression or Constriction</heading><p id="p-0042" num="0075">As noted above, defibrillation and CPR compressions can be synchronized.

This device may be connected to other components of the integrated system by cable or wireless connection.</li>        <li id="ul0014-0002" num="0100">The radiographic imaging system may be x-ray fluoroscopy, computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and/or other imaging systems. The fluoroscopy can be either monoplane or biplane utilizing a traditional C-arm configuration. The imaging system can include various image-collecting components and an image display component. This device may be connected to other components of the integrated system by cable or wireless connection.</li>        <li id="ul0014-0003" num="0101">The control system adapted to integrate and synchronize the other components may incorporate one or more mechanisms to connect to and control the other components.</li>        <li id="ul0014-0004" num="0102">The control system can remove the CPR related movement artifact from the images of the myocardium and coronary arteries by means of image gating the radiographic imaging so as to retain the image acquired at the end of the end of the automated CPR release through the whole of the compression phase thereby removing CPR motion artifact. Thus, the operator could see only the images of the coronary artery, myocardium, and cardiac chambers during chest release, when they are in their native configuration.</li>        <li id="ul0014-0005" num="0103">The control system can control the integrated contrast injector pump, so as to synchronize the timing of the contrast injection such that it can inject contrast dye during the release phase of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The increased intrathoracic pressure generated by CPR compression may act to impair radio contrast injection. This may be avoided if the injection occurs during the release phase. Additionally, coronary blood flow during CPR is greatest during the relaxation phase, and radio contrast injection during this interval can provide optimal images of the coronary anatomy. A particular optimal time of injection could be during the initial 100 milliseconds of CPR relaxation.</li>        <li id="ul0014-0006" num="0104">The control system can control an integrated aortic balloon pump such that during complete cardiac arrest, i.e. cardiac standstill, the balloon can be inflated in synchrony with the chest constriction or compression. This would act to enhance cardiac output. Deflation of the balloon in synchrony with CPR relaxation would enhance the venous return. Alternatively, inflation of the balloon during the relaxation phase of CPR may enhance coronary perfusion pressure and coronary artery blood flow. If, however, there is residual coordinated but inadequate cardiac contractions, as is described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,645,247, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, the balloon may be inflated in synchrony with the residual ventricular function, again, this would act to enhance cardiac output and venous return.</li>        <li id="ul0014-0007" num="0105">The control system would be capable of controlling an integrated left ventricular assist device such that during complete cardiac arrest, i.e. cardiac standstill, the pulsatile flow is in synchrony with the chest constriction or compression such that the expulsion of blood by the LVAD is during the compression phase of CPR. This would act to enhance cardiac output. Alternatively, expulsion of blood by the LVAD during the relaxation phase of CPR may enhance coronary perfusion pressure and coronary artery blood flow. If there is residual coordinated but inadequate cardiac contractions, as is described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,645,247, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, the pulsatile flow in synchrony with the residual ventricular function, again, this would act to enhance cardiac output.</li>        <li id="ul0014-0008" num="0106">The integrated cathlab and CPR system may incorporate motion, acceleration, or force sensors on patient facing surfaces of the device to measure one or both of chest wall motion or chest wall force. These data streams may be utilized by the control system as inputs to: 1) alter the pattern of chest constriction so as to minimize coronary artery motion, 2) time the injection of radiocontrast, 3) synchronize intravascular hemodynamic assist devices, and/or 4) gait the imaging system so as to minimize motion artifact.</li>        <li id="ul0014-0009" num="0107">The control system can receive data from the ECG monitor, so as to synchronize the CPR system, and/or one of the other components including balloon pumps or LVADS, with an organized ECG QRS, if it is present. An organized QRS on the ECG raises the possibility of retained ventricular function. Coordination and synchronization of the other modalities with this retained function may improve their efficacy, as is taught in U.S. Pat. No. 7,645,247.</li>        <li id="ul0014-0010" num="0108">Circumferential constriction CPR has the additional advantage that it can perform both CPR when patients are in cardiac arrest and ventricular assist when they are in cardiogenic shock. Circumferential constriction CPR devices provide CPR when the pneumatic force applied to the thorax is in the range of 4-6 pounds per square inch (PSI), and cardiac assist when the force is less than this range. The control system can apply CPR or cardiac assist based on data received from the physiologic monitor. Patients in cardiac arrest generally have characteristic ECGs, no detectable blood pressures, and ET-CO2 below 30 mmHG. Multivariable algorithms composed of these data streams can reliably and accurately separate cardiac arrest from cardiogenic shock. The control module can utilize such algorithms and then adjust the force of circumferential constriction to the appropriate level. Alternatively, operator input to the control device may allow selection of CPR or cardiac assist.</li>        <li id="ul0014-0011" num="0109">The control system can move the mechanized patient table such that the table acts to damp patient motion created by the cardiopulmonary resuscitation system. This may further act to remove CPR related movement artifact on the images. Sensors on or within the table can sense motion and the controller can then trigger actuators to damp or remove this motion.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0058" num="0110">The foregoing has been a detailed description of illustrative embodiments of the invention.
