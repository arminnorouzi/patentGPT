According to the statistics, about 80% of drilling tool failure accidents are caused by the failure of joints and threads of the drilling tool. Through a large number of failure analysis and research, it is found that most of the failures of drilling tools are due to the wear of joints and threads of the drilling tools, which reduces the torsional strength of the connections and fails under the action of alternating bending stress. Due to the limited length of the joint of the drill pipe, the main tongs clamp the pipe body to buckle and unbuckle, the buckle torque is large, and the tooth scars of the main tongs will become larger. Among the various surface scars on the drill pipe, the tooth scars of the main tongs are the most common and serious, which can easily form stress concentration points and induce the failure of joints and threads of the drilling tools. Therefore, it is a problem that cannot be ignored to reduce the tooth scars damage on the drill pipe body caused by the tongs.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Nitrile rubber is widely used in the manufacture of oil-resistant products such as sealing articles, gaskets and the like due to the excellent oil resistance. However, the using temperature range of nitrile rubber is limited, which cannot meet the on-site working conditions of the protective tooth blocks in drilling tongs. The high temperature environment will reduce the aging resistance of nitrile rubber, thus declining its mechanical properties rapidly. Therefore, the preparation of a nitrile rubber with better mechanical properties is of great significance in practical applications.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Chinese Patent CN110343299A discloses a graphene-modified nitrile rubber and a preparation method thereof. The method utilizes the product obtained by the dehydration condensation reaction of hydrolyzed mercaptosiloxane and graphene oxide to modify the nitrile rubber, which has more improved mechanical properties than the unmodified nitrile rubber. However, this method does not consider the interfacial compatibility between the filler and the rubber, and the dispersion of the filler in the rubber, so does not have applicability and versatility. And the filler can only be carbon black, that will increase the using amount of the modified graphene oxide and is not economical.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Chinese Patent CN104262700A discloses a preparation method of silica-grafted graphene oxide/rubber composite material. The method utilizes silica-grafted graphene oxide to modify rubber, which has improved heat resistance and wear resistance than unmodified rubber. However, this method does not take into account that the silica has acid radical residues, and after being used for modification, the material is prone to yellowing and poor weather resistance.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, the nitrile rubber in the related art may suffer from reduced mechanical properties and compatibility problems at the interface between filler and rubber due to the limited temperature range.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The purpose of the present disclosure relates to a functionalized graphene oxide nitrile rubber and a preparation method of a tooth-scar-free tooth block, wherein the functionalized graphene oxide nitrile rubber has excellent mechanical properties, a wide range of applicable temperatures and strong stability.

Moreover, the intrinsic strength of the graphene reaches 130 GPa, the fracture strain is about 25%, and the elastic modulus can reach 1.1 TPa.The tensile strength of the graphene can be up to 42 N/m<sup>2</sup>, which is about 100 times that of the ordinary steel calculated by the two-dimensional strength limit theory. The experimental results show that the mechanical properties of the tooth blocks made of functionalized graphene oxide modified nitrile rubber have been significantly improved. During high temperature vulcanization, the epoxy resin and the curing agent undergo in-situ polymerization in the rubber compound to form nanoscale particles or fibers, or to form a local interpenetrating network structure with the rubber molecules, and the comprehensive performance of the rubber compound is improved. The epoxy resin as an interface additive between the non-polar unsaturated rubber, the filler and the graphene oxide, forms a bridge function at the interface between the filler and the rubber, and the dispersion degree and the reinforcing effect of the filler are improved.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The preparation method of the functionalized graphene oxide nitrile rubber masterbatch comprises the following steps: dispersing the functionalized graphene oxide in a dispersant, ultrasonically dispersing for 60-90 minutes to obtain a functionalized graphene oxide dispersion, adding nitrile rubber latex and stirring for 90-120 min to obtain a mixed solution, wherein the mass of the functionalized graphene oxide accounts for 11-18% of the mass of the functionalized graphene oxide nitrile rubber masterbatch. The mixed solution above is added to a mixed liquid of a calcium chloride aqueous solution and ethanol with a volume ratio of 1:2-4 used as a coagulation solution for demulsification, wherein the volume ratio of the mixed solution to the coagulation solution is 2-3:3-5, after suction filtration, washing and drying, a functionalized graphene oxide nitrile rubber masterbatch is obtained.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The dispersant can be a mixture of xylene, n-butanol, cyclohexanone, 1,4 butanediol diglycidyl ether, and the mass ratio thereof may be 6-8:1-3:0.5-1.5:2-4, the preferred mass ratio is 7:2:1:3. The solid content of the nitrile rubber latex may be 45-46%.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The preparation method of the above-described functionalized graphene oxide may be preparing graphene oxide (GO) by a modified Hummers method; adding the GO and 3-Aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS) as a modifier with a mass ratio of 1:2 into an anhydrous ethanol and ultrasonic stirring uniformly; heating to 70-80&#xb0; C. in a water bath and refluxing for 4-6 hours; then adding distilled water to the mixture, centrifuging, washing and drying to obtain Aminated Graphene (APTMS-GO), the lamellar spacing of which may be 0.78 nm. In the above-described preparation method of functionalized graphene oxide, in the mixture of GO, APTMS and anhydrous ethanol, the mass content of anhydrous ethanol can be 94%. Wherein, the drying temperature is 60-80&#xb0; C., and the drying time is 8-12 h.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">After graphene oxide is functionalized, the lamellar spacing of the graphene becomes larger, which can better bound the movement of rubber molecular chains and epoxy resin molecular chains, so that the tooth block made of rubber modified by functionalized graphene oxide can have a wider using temperature range; and the functionalized graphene oxide is easier to uniformly disperse in the rubber matrix due to the presence of more active functional groups on the surface of the functionalized graphene oxide. Due to the good dispersion performance, the defects in the rubber are reduced, so that the modified rubber has better mechanical properties.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">A second aspect of the present disclosure relates to a tooth-scar-free tooth block made of functionalized graphene oxide nitrile rubber, which is made of the functionalized graphene oxide nitrile rubber as described above, and the preparation process comprises the following steps:</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">(1) weighing the components according to the formula of the functionalized graphene oxide nitrile rubber as described above for later use;</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">(2) plasticating nitrile rubber to obtain a plasticated rubber;</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">(3) sequentially adding dichlorophenol, a vulcanizing agent, a vulcanization activator, a plasticizer, an antioxidant and a filler into the plasticated rubber obtained in step (2), and uniformly mixing to obtain a premixed rubber compound;</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">(4) cooling the premixed rubber compound obtained in step (3), then adding a functionalized graphene oxide nitrile rubber masterbatch, a curing agent and uniformly mixing to obtain a mixed rubber compound;</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">(5) cooling the mixed rubber compound obtained in step (4), then adding a vulcanization accelerator and uniformly mixing, adding a sheet to obtain a mixed rubber sheet;</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">(6) blanking the mixed rubber sheet obtained in step (5) according to the size and shape of the tooth block mold, wherein the pressing force of the mold in the vulcanization process is 25-27 MPa, the temperature is maintained at 175-180&#xb0; C., and the pressing time is 5-6 h; after completing the vulcanization, opening the mold and taking out the booth block;</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">(7) after taking out the booth block, trimming and shaping in time.
