In particular, the present disclosure relates to self-healing siloxane elastomers comprising at least one siloxane polymer reversibly crosslinked to a siloxane crosslinker.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">At the beginning of 19<sup>th </sup>century, the production of rubber and then plastic materials grew rapidly. The relatively low cost of manufacturing these materials resulted in the production of commodities that were effectively disposable in nature. However, the disposable nature of these materials, and their reliance on non-renewable resources, has had a profound impact on our environment. Some researchers predict that by 2050, 20% of the oil consumed annually would be going to the plastics industry. The marine conservation society in 2008 found that over 50% of the litter is plastic, consisting of 7,393 plastic bags, 7,025 pieces of plastic trays and cups and 16,243 plastic drinks bottles which is 77% more than plastic waste identified in 1994. The exact environmental impact of plastics is difficult to assess. In regards with the applications of plastics and their properties, environmentalists' priority is to recycle and reuse these materials after their service life, which is both economically and environmentally advantageous because it takes two-third less energy to use recycled plastics at the first step of material production other than using virgin plastics. However, pollution by polymers is a growing concern, especially because of the disposable nature of many of the plastics being utilized around the world.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">One of the strategies for addressing the growing plastics pollution problem is the development of methodologies for prolonging lifetimes of polymers through self-healing strategies including silicone polymers.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Self-healing polymers are a class of smart materials capable of responding to a specific stimulus, commonly thermal and mechanical energies, to heal damaged areas through a chemical reaction or physical interaction. Polymeric materials are susceptible to damage over the course of their lifetime. As a result, engineered materials have been developed with the aim of damage suppression/management in order to extend the lifetime and reliability of synthetic materials. Cross-linking is often employed as a means of enhancing the physical and mechanical properties of polymers. Compared to thermoplastics, which are not chemically cross-linked, thermoset materials can have higher durability, extended lifetimes, greater solvent resistance, and dimensional stability.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Although a number of approaches have been utilized in the development of self-healing polymers, including Schiff bases, Diels-Alder reactions, hydrogen bonding interactions, the self-healing process typically requires significant time and/or the application of an external stimulus (e.g., heat). As such, there is a need to develop self-healing and recyclable polymer that would be healed without the input of external thermally energy, optimally at ambient temperature, and that would be able to be easily recycled.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure relates to self-healing siloxane elastomers.

While most reactions required reaction temperatures in excess of 50&#xb0; C. in order to maximize Diels-Alder adduct formation (optimal temperatures were between 65-70&#xb0; C.), Diels-Alder reactions between 5 and 10 and 9 and 10 demonstrated high maleimide conversion at 40&#xb0; C. Based on this result, the Diels-Alder reactions between 5 and 10, and 9 and 10 were attempted at ambient temperature. Under these conditions 80% of the maleimide species was consumed in only 5 h. This represents the first reported instance of a siloxane-based Diels-Alder reaction taking place at ambient temperature; none of the commercially available bismaleimide compounds underwent the Diels-Alder reaction with 5 or 9 at ambient temperature. Under these conditions, the endo isomer was the major product but the concentration of the exo isomer could be increased by increasing the reaction temperature and the reaction time. Conversion of the starting material and the endo/exo composition of the product were determined using <sup>1</sup>H NMR. Given that, the purpose of the Diels-Alder reaction was to form covalent bonds between, and thus crosslink, silicone polymers, the focus of this research was on the formation of a Diels-Alder adduct between polymer chains rather than optimizing the endo/exo ratios of the products.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0128">In an effort to better understand the reaction between diene 5 and dienophile 10, variable temperature (VT) <sup>1</sup>H NMR experiments were undertaken (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>).

The data indicated that the thermal properties of the model system remained stable over multiple iterations, suggesting that elastomers based on these model systems would have merit as a basis for recyclable silicone polymers. The TGA data indicated that the compounds did not demonstrate appreciable degradation as evidenced by minimal weight loss (from 1.75 mg to 1.63 mg depending on the sample) after being subjected to 7 heating and cooling cycles.

level of applied force when compared to the other cross-linked systems, the materials showed very little elongation under the applied force, with 27c only stretching 2 mm before catastrophic failure of the sample was observed. This can be attributed to the high concentration of reactive diene sites along the polymer backbone and the relatively short polymer chains in the parent compound. The remaining elastomers were only able to sustain 12.2 N of force (23b) or less with elongation values ranging from 2 mm (23k) to 32 mm (22b). The elastomers formed using siloxane bismaleimide 10 demonstrated the greatest elongation, presumably as a result of the added flexibility of the siloxane moiety in the cross-linker.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0144">It was of interest to examine the tensile properties of polymers both before and after healing. All of the elastomers became weaker after healing (i.e., were able to sustain a lower applied force) with the exception of 25h, which saw a 74% increase in the amount of applied force (5.4 N virgin vs. 9.4 N healed) before catastrophic failure in the material was observed. The healing process likely resulted in a greater degree of cross-linking, which accounts for the increase in the strength of the material and the negligible (0%) change in elongation. It should be noted that will all of the elastomers that were tested, catastrophic failure always occurred at points other than the scar from healing, even when the calipers were placed as close to the scar as possible. This suggested that in all cases the healed portion of the elastomer became more robust than the undamaged areas, which was consistent with earlier findings.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0145">Elastomers 22b and 22c represent proxies for elastomers formed using 10. When compared to the virgin elastomer, healed elastomer 22c elongated less (&#x2014;60%) and was able to sustain a diminished applied force (&#x2014;80%) after being healed. The virgin elastomer 22c was already highly cross-linked and rigid and the healing process likely permitted the formation of additional cross-links, exacerbating these phenomena and resulting a brittle material. On the other hand, elastomer 22b demonstrated no change in its capacity to sustain an applied force (1.2 N) and elongation (33 mm) after healing. These data suggest that for the elastomers that healed at ambient temperature a 7-8% diene concentration along the siloxane backbone was optimal for maintaining the elastomer's physical properties after healing. This was likely the result of polymer chains becoming untangled during the healing process, making it easier for the polymer chains to move over one another. As with the other healed elastomer elastomers that were tested, catastrophic failure of healed elastomer 22b did not occur at the scar; failure was always observed within the virgin portion of the elastomer. The extreme elongation (+143%) observed with elastomer 22h, coupled with its substantial decrease in capacity to sustain an applied force likely occurred as the result of a decreased level of Diels-Alder cross-links after the healing process.</p><heading id="h-0030" level="1">Thermal Analysis of the Elastomers</heading><p id="p-0168" num="0146">Thermal analyses of the elastomers were also performed, not only to verify the temperature at which the Diels-Alder and retro-Diels Alder reactions occurred, but also the stability of the elastomers over a series of heating and cooling cycles. A representative set of DSC traces for an elastomer (22b) is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. Seven cycles of heating and cooling were performed from 35&#xb0; C. to 120&#xb0; C. with a heating/cooling rate of &#xb1;4&#xb0; C. and a holding time of 30 min after each increase in temperature. For all of the elastomers, the DSC data corroborated the Diels-Alder and retro-Diels-Alder temperatures observed via <sup>1</sup>H NMR. Since the DSC instrument began recording data at 35&#xb0; C., it should be noted that for the elastomers that cured at ambient temperature what was observed at 45&#xb0; C. in the thermogram was the completion of the reaction not the start of the reaction (as corroborated by variable temperature NMR experiments), while the retro-Diels-Alder reaction was observed at 100&#xb0; C., slightly higher than in the NMR experiments. TGA analyses revealed that no substantial thermal decomposition was observed for any of the elastomers. For example, a mass decrease of only 0.6 mg (17.3 mg to 16.7 mg) was observed for 22e.</p><heading id="h-0031" level="1">Hardness Measurements</heading><p id="p-0169" num="0147">In this study, the hardness of the elastomers was measured both before damage and after healing (Table 3) using the Shore 00 scale. Not surprisingly, elastomers synthesized using silicone starting materials that had a higher Si&#x2014;H concentration (25-30% Si&#x2014;H), and hence more subsequent reaction points for crosslinking, saw a smaller change in their hardness values as a result of their higher crosslink density. Likewise, the elastomers were made from silicone starting materials that had an Si&#x2014;H concentration of 7-9% were softer and more flexible owing to their lower crosslink densities. Although the majority of the elastomers became softer after a healing event, as corroborated by the tensile strength data, no trends were observed in terms of the hardness changes.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00002" num="00002"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 3</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Shore 00 measurements of select elastomers.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Virgin</entry><entry>Healed</entry><entry>Change in</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Elastomer</entry><entry>Elastomer</entry><entry>Elastomer</entry><entry>Hardness</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="63pt" align="char" char="."/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>22b</entry><entry>66.0</entry><entry>60.2</entry><entry>&#x2212;5.8</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>22c</entry><entry>68.3</entry><entry>56.7</entry><entry>&#x2212;11.6</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>22d</entry><entry>64.1</entry><entry>48.7</entry><entry>&#x2212;15.4</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>22e</entry><entry>65.3</entry><entry>46.0</entry><entry>&#x2212;19.3</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>22g</entry><entry>58.7</entry><entry>47.2</entry><entry>&#x2212;11.5</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>22h</entry><entry>70.1</entry><entry>63.4</entry><entry>&#x2212;7.3</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>22j</entry><entry>34.0</entry><entry>29.1</entry><entry>&#x2212;4.9</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>22k</entry><entry>78.3</entry><entry>74.0</entry><entry>&#x2212;4.3</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>23b</entry><entry>62.4</entry><entry>58.7</entry><entry>&#x2212;3.7</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>23c</entry><entry>82.4</entry><entry>77.2</entry><entry>&#x2212;5.2</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>23e</entry><entry>63.9</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>23g</entry><entry>53.7</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>23h</entry><entry>69.1</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry><entry>&#x2014;</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>23j</entry><entry>32.0</entry><entry>28.0</entry><entry>&#x2212;4.0</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>23k</entry><entry>70.0</entry><entry>66.1</entry><entry>&#x2212;3.9</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>25b</entry><entry>45.8</entry><entry>36.0</entry><entry>&#x2212;9.8</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>25c</entry><entry>76.2</entry><entry>60.0</entry><entry>&#x2212;16.2</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>25h</entry><entry>85.0</entry><entry>64.2</entry><entry>&#x2212;20.8</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>26b</entry><entry>39.1</entry><entry>31.3</entry><entry>&#x2212;7.8</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>27b</entry><entry>54.8</entry><entry>47.4</entry><entry>&#x2212;7.4</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>27c</entry><entry>64.4</entry><entry>58.0</entry><entry>&#x2212;6.4</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>27e</entry><entry>70.5</entry><entry>72.4</entry><entry>1.9</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>27g</entry><entry>81.4</entry><entry>72.8</entry><entry>&#x2212;8.6</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>27h</entry><entry>67.9</entry><entry>64.4</entry><entry>&#x2212;3.6</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>27j</entry><entry>40.0</entry><entry>36.7</entry><entry>&#x2212;3.3</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>27k</entry><entry>66.9</entry><entry>60.9</entry><entry>&#x2212;6.7</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><heading id="h-0032" level="1">Conclusions</heading><p id="p-0171" num="0148">A number of silicone elastomers capable of not only undergoing an efficient self-healing process, but also had the capacity to be recycled were synthesized. The results illustrated that the novel compound tetramethybis[(N-maleimidomethyl)oxy]disiloxane 10 had the highest maleimide conversion overall when subjected to the Diels-Alder reaction with furan-modified silicone polymers, and more importantly the elastomer cured at ambient temperature in only 5 h. This is the first, and only, reported case of a self-healing silicone elastomer based on the Diels-Alder reaction where healing occurs at ambient temperature. The scars that formed in the healed elastomers were more robust than the virgin material; tensile strength tests demonstrated that catastrophic failure always occurred at some point other than the healed site. After healing, all of the elastomers became softer as the polymer chains reorganized during the healing process. These elastomeric systems represent a promising modality for mitigating the impact of silicone polymers on the global waste stream.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0149">While the present disclosure has been described with reference to what are presently considered to be the preferred examples, it is to be understood that the application is not limited to the examples described herein.
