Each of the elastomeric openings <b>14</b> can pass a ball <b>16</b> into the basket <b>12</b> for transporting the ball <b>16</b>. The ball <b>16</b> may be a tennis ball or other type of ball for playing a competitive game. The basket <b>12</b> has a bottom wall <b>18</b> and an outer wall <b>20</b> extending upwardly therefrom, and the outer wall <b>20</b> has a first lateral side <b>22</b> and a second lateral side <b>24</b>.

In this way the pair of handles <b>54</b> facilitates the balls <b>16</b> to be placed into the basket <b>12</b> in a hands-free manner. Thus, a user does not have to bend over to collect the balls <b>16</b> from the support surface <b>46</b>. Each of the handles <b>54</b> has a central portion <b>56</b> extending between a pair of end portions <b>58</b>. Each of the end portions <b>58</b> has a distal end <b>60</b> with respect to the central portion <b>30</b>. Additionally, the upper end <b>50</b> of each of the tubes <b>48</b> insertably receives the distal end <b>60</b> of a respective one of the end portions <b>58</b> of a respective handle <b>54</b> having the central portion <b>30</b> of each of the handles <b>54</b> being horizontally oriented. A plurality of pads <b>62</b> is positioned around respective handles <b>54</b> and the pads <b>62</b> are positioned on the central portion <b>56</b> of the handles <b>54</b></p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">A plurality of locks <b>64</b> may each be movably integrated into a respective one of the end portions <b>58</b> of a respective one of the handles <b>54</b>.

Additionally, each of the locks <b>64</b> engages hole <b>52</b> in the outer wall <b>49</b> of a respective one of the tubes <b>48</b> for retaining the handles <b>54</b> in an extended position. As is most clearly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, each of the locks <b>64</b> can be disengaged from the hole <b>52</b> to facilitate the handles <b>54</b> to be lowered into the tubes <b>48</b> for storage.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In use, the basket <b>12</b> is rolled along the support surface <b>46</b> to position the basket <b>12</b> over balls <b>16</b> that are lying on the support surface <b>46</b>. The handles <b>54</b> are pushed downwardly to facilitate the bottom wall <b>18</b> of the basket <b>12</b> to be positioned on the support surface <b>46</b>. Moreover, each of the balls <b>16</b> passes through the cuts <b>26</b> in the bottom wall <b>18</b> to enter the basket <b>12</b>. The handles <b>54</b> are released and the bottom wall <b>18</b> is lifted from the support surface <b>46</b> while the balls <b>16</b> remain in the basket <b>12</b>. The basket <b>12</b> is rolled around in order to gather all of the balls <b>16</b> that are lying on the support surface <b>46</b>. In this way the balls <b>16</b> can be gathered in a hands free manner.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">With respect to the above description then, it is to be realized that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of an embodiment enabled by the disclosure, to include variations in size, materials, shape, form, function and manner of operation, assembly and use, are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art, and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by an embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Therefore, the foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the disclosure.
