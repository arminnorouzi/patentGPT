Folded optics systems can facilitate production of more compact and lighter virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) headsets. Flat displays such as cell phones are often used in VR and AR headsets. Images from these displays must be collimated and focused on the human eye. Some folded optics approaches make use of dome-shaped polarizing film lenses that alternatively reflect or transmit light depending on polarization state of the light. The lenses allow the flat display to be positioned closer to the eye and reduce the weight of the optics.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Some embodiments are directed to a device comprising at least one optical film with an active area having a surface that is curved in two orthogonal directions.

In some embodiments, each location over at least 80%, or over 85%, or over at least 90%, or over at least 95% of the active area of the optical film has a reflectance greater than about 80% for normally incident light having the same predetermined wavelength and the same first polarization state. A polarization state can be characterized by the direction of the electric field vector which for normally incident light defines an axis tangent to the optical film. In some embodiments, each location on the curved optical film has a maximum reflectance and a corresponding minimum transmittance for normally incident light polarized along a block axis, and a maximum transmittance for normally incident light polarized along an orthogonal pass axis. The normally incident light may have a predetermined wavelength (e.g., about 550 nm) or may have wavelengths in a predetermined wavelength range (e.g., 450 nm to 650 nm, 400 nm to 700 nm, 400 nm to 800 nm, or 400 nm to 1000 nm).</p><p id="p-0063" num="0059">The enhanced optical characteristics of the disclosed optical films, such as variation in the polarization block and pass axis orientations, can be maintained when the total curvature of the active area of the lens is relatively high. Consider a flat a piece of polarizing film with completely uniform optical properties over its entire surface. We will define the surface of that flat film as S and define a normal unit vector, N, orthogonal to the surface at a point P on S. We will also define two orthogonal surface tangent unit vectors, A and B laying parallel to the pass and block directions of the flat film respectively at P on S as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>. When S is deformed to conform to a new curved surface: s, the point, P, will move to a new location, p, on s and our normal and tangent vectors will become three new vectors, n, a, and b respectively as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>. We will also define a Cartesian coordinate system on the lens with X, Y and Z axes parallel to the undeformed A, B and N axes respectively.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0060">While the initial material vectors A, B, and N are mutually orthogonal, after forming, the deformed vectors, a, b and n may no longer be orthogonal except at points along particular planes of symmetry. The corresponding material pass and block axes however are always orthogonal which means that the true pass and block axes will not exactly lie parallel to the a and b vectors. In other words, if one physically draws two orthogonal lines at P on the flat film surface parallel to the pass and block axes of that film, after forming those two lines, intersecting at p, will, in most cases, no longer be orthogonal and no longer correspond exactly to the pass and block axes of the deformed film, especially when forming films to high curvature. This effect can be greatly reduced in the optical film devices disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> is a diagram illustrating how block and pass axis orientation angles for linear polarization can be measured. In this case lens, polarization direction measurements were made using an Axometrics OPMF-2 polarimeter equipped with a tilting and rotating stage as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>. The polarimeter is equipped with a variable wavelength, non-coherent light source, a detector that measures transmitted light intensity, two rotating linear polarizers located on either side of the sample and two rotating retarders, also located on either side of the sample. The instrument measures polarization and retardation properties to construct a &#x201c;Stokes vector&#x201d; of transmitted light through the sample. When comparing to the Stokes vector of the light incident to the sample, the instrument reports the elements of a &#x201c;Mueller matrix&#x201d; describing the material optical properties of the sample. From the Mueller matrix, the orientation of the pass and block axes at a point in a sample can be determined with respect to a global instrument coordinate system. The rotating and tilting stage allows transmission measurements to be made orthogonal to the sample surface at any point, p, within the active area of a (spherically) curved lens mounted on the stage. Further information on ellipsometry and the measurement of polarized light can be found in Azzam and Bashara (1977) [R. M. A Azzam and N. M. Bashara, <i>Ellisometry and polarized light</i>, North-Holland Pub. Co., 1977] and Chipman (1995) [R. A. Chipman, &#x201c;Polarimetry&#x201d;, in the <i>Handbook of Optics, </i>2<sup>nd </sup>Ed, Vol II, McGraw-Hill Professional, 1995.].</p><p id="p-0066" num="0062">Characterizing polarization direction on compound curved surfaces is slightly more complex since the orientation measurement with respect to the instrument coordinate frame will depend on how points on the lens surface are tilted, rotated, and in some cases, translated into position in the instrument. As a result, it is helpful to define a uniform standard by which to compare different shaped lenses and those made by different forming methods. The orientation direction standard we chose for films formed to any arbitrarily shaped lens surface is the resulting block direction orientation profile produced by a perfect, simple, normal projection of a perfect flat polarizer laying parallel to the best fit plane to the lens surface. The diagram in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> shows the projection of the pass and block axes of the flat film to the curves surface and the resulting local reference directions. The best fit plane is the plane with the minimum least squares average orthogonal distance from every point on the lens surface.

Using that alternative reference definition, the equations (2-5) are replaced with the following expressions to calculate the polarization rotation profile of the lens:</p><p id="p-0080" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00007" num="00007"><math overflow="scroll"> <mtable>  <mtr>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mrow>      <msup>       <mi>a</mi>       <mn>0</mn>      </msup>      <mo>(</mo>      <mi>p</mi>      <mo>)</mo>     </mrow>     <mo>=</mo>     <mfrac>      <mrow>       <mrow>        <mi>n</mi>        <mo>&#x2061;</mo>        <mo>(</mo>        <mi>p</mi>        <mo>)</mo>       </mrow>       <mo>&#xd7;</mo>       <mi>Y</mi>      </mrow>      <mrow>       <mo>&#xf605;</mo>       <mrow>        <mrow>         <mi>n</mi>         <mo>&#x2061;</mo>         <mo>(</mo>         <mi>p</mi>         <mo>)</mo>        </mrow>        <mo>&#xd7;</mo>        <mi>Y</mi>       </mrow>       <mo>&#xf606;</mo>      </mrow>     </mfrac>    </mrow>   </mtd>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mo>(</mo>     <msup>      <mn>2</mn>      <mo>&#x2019;</mo>     </msup>     <mo>)</mo>    </mrow>   </mtd>  </mtr> </mtable></math></maths><maths id="MATH-US-00007-2" num="00007.2"><math overflow="scroll"> <mtable>  <mtr>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mrow>      <msub>       <mi>&#x3c8;</mi>       <mi>a</mi>      </msub>      <mo>(</mo>      <mi>p</mi>      <mo>)</mo>     </mrow>     <mo>=</mo>     <mrow>      <mrow>       <mi>arctan</mi>       <mo>(</mo>       <mfrac>        <mrow>         <mo>&#xf605;</mo>         <mrow>          <msup>           <mi>a</mi>           <mn>0</mn>          </msup>          <mo>&#xd7;</mo>          <mi>x</mi>         </mrow>         <mo>&#xf606;</mo>        </mrow>        <mrow>         <msup>          <mi>a</mi>          <mn>0</mn>         </msup>         <mo>&#xb7;</mo>         <mi>x</mi>        </mrow>       </mfrac>       <mo>)</mo>      </mrow>      <mo>.</mo>     </mrow>    </mrow>   </mtd>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mo>(</mo>     <msup>      <mn>5</mn>      <mo>&#x2019;</mo>     </msup>     <mo>)</mo>    </mrow>   </mtd>  </mtr> </mtable></math></maths><maths id="MATH-US-00007-3" num="00007.3"><math overflow="scroll"> <mtable>  <mtr>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mrow>      <mi>&#x3b1;</mi>      <mo>&#x2061;</mo>      <mo>(</mo>      <mi>p</mi>      <mo>)</mo>     </mrow>     <mo>=</mo>     <mrow>      <mrow>       <mi>arctan</mi>       <mo>(</mo>       <mfrac>        <mrow>         <mo>&#xf605;</mo>         <mrow>          <mi>a</mi>          <mo>&#xd7;</mo>          <msup>           <mi>a</mi>           <mn>0</mn>          </msup>         </mrow>         <mo>&#xf606;</mo>        </mrow>        <mrow>         <mi>a</mi>         <mo>&#xb7;</mo>         <msup>          <mi>a</mi>          <mn>0</mn>         </msup>        </mrow>       </mfrac>       <mo>)</mo>      </mrow>      <mo>=</mo>      <mrow>       <mrow>        <msub>         <mi>&#x3a8;</mi>         <mi>m</mi>        </msub>        <mo>(</mo>        <mi>p</mi>        <mo>)</mo>       </mrow>       <mo>-</mo>       <mrow>        <msub>         <mi>&#x3c8;</mi>         <mi>a</mi>        </msub>        <mo>(</mo>        <mi>p</mi>        <mo>)</mo>       </mrow>      </mrow>     </mrow>    </mrow>   </mtd>   <mtd>    <mrow>     <mo>(</mo>     <mrow>      <msup>       <mn>3</mn>       <mo>&#x2019;</mo>      </msup>      <mo>,</mo>      <msup>       <mn>4</mn>       <mo>&#x2019;</mo>      </msup>     </mrow>     <mo>)</mo>    </mrow>   </mtd>  </mtr> </mtable></math></maths></p><p id="p-0081" num="0000">where &#x3b1;(p) is the polarization orientation angle based on the projected pass axis and &#x3c8;<sub>a</sub>(p) is the angle between a<sup>0</sup>(p) and the instrument x axis.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0067">The following procedure can be used to express block direction orientation profiles consistent with the above definitions based on the projected block axis reference:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0068">1) Define a fixed, right-handed, Cartesian xyz coordinate frame for the instrument with the z direction pointing in the direction of light travel from the source to the detector, and the x and y axes parallel to the pass and block directions of polarizer in the system when its measured diattenuation angle is zero.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0069">2) Find the best fit plane of the lens surface</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0070">3) Find the point, p<sub>0</sub>, on the lens surface that has a surface normal vector parallel to the normal vector of the best fit plane.

For example, a molded curved optical film comprising an optical film with high total curvature may have an unacceptably large variation in polarization block axis angle, polarization pass axis orientation, thickness, band edge, and/or other physical and/or optical characteristics. One solution to this manufacturing difficulty is to form the curved optical film from multiple segments of optical film. The optical film segments are arranged such that edges of adjacent segments form one or more seams. The adjacent segments may be joined together at seams. Each individual segment can have a sag to diameter or total curvature which is less than the sag to diameter ratio or total curvature of the curved optical film. Forming optical films from optical film segments can reduce the variation in the optical and/or physical characteristics of the optical film and can reduce or eliminate buckling of the film.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0126"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b>A through <b>20</b>B</figref> provide several examples of segmented optical films in accordance with some embodiments.

The approaches described herein can be applied optical films comprising segments of various shapes, such as flat segmented optical films, or segmented optical films having a three-dimensional shape, e.g., spherical, paraboloid, cylindrical, aspherical, or other three-dimensional shape. The number and/or configuration of the segments that make up the optical films is not limited to those shown here, as many other segment configurations are possible and are included within the scope of the disclosure.
