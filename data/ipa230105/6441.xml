In the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the power control system <b>1</b> is provided with a photovoltaic (PV) cell <b>11</b>, a storage battery <b>12</b>, an electric vehicle (EV) <b>13</b>, a power conditioning system (PCS) <b>21</b>, a terminal device <b>22</b> and a host control device <b>31</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The photovoltaic cell <b>11</b> generates electricity using sunlight and outputs the generated power.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The storage battery <b>12</b> charges and discharges in accordance with the control of the power conditioning system <b>21</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The electric vehicle <b>13</b> is equipped with a storage battery and runs on the electric energy stored in the storage battery. The electric vehicle <b>13</b> is used as a charging/discharging facility including a storage battery when not used as a vehicle, and charges/discharges in accordance with the control of the power conditioning system <b>21</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The photovoltaic cell <b>11</b>, the storage battery <b>12</b>, and the electric vehicle <b>13</b> correspond to examples of power supply apparatuses. The power supply apparatus referred to here is an apparatus capable of outputting power. Further, the storage battery <b>12</b> and the electric vehicle <b>13</b> correspond to examples of rechargeable power apparatuses.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The power conditioning system <b>21</b> controls the charging and discharging of each of the storage battery <b>12</b> and the electric vehicle <b>13</b>. Specifically, the power conditioning system <b>21</b> determines the input/output power of each of the storage battery <b>12</b> and the electric vehicle <b>13</b>, and controls each of the storage battery <b>12</b> and the electric vehicle <b>13</b> so as to charge/discharge with the determined input/output power. The power conditioning system <b>21</b> also controls the power generation of the photovoltaic cell <b>11</b>. Specifically, the power conditioning system <b>21</b> determines the output power of the photovoltaic cell <b>11</b> and controls the photovoltaic cell <b>11</b> so as to generate power with the determined output power. In particular, the power conditioning system <b>21</b> controls the photovoltaic cell <b>11</b> so as to output the power corresponding to the command value when the outputtable power of the photovoltaic cell <b>11</b> exceeds the command value.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Further, the power conditioning system <b>21</b> allocates the input/output power for each power supply apparatus to the input/output power for each service, and records the details of the amount of input/output power based on the input/output power for each service and each power supply apparatus. The service referred to here is the execution of a certain objective by adjustment of the power or the amount of power.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">According to the power conditioning system <b>21</b>, it is possible to calculate the consideration in accordance with the power supply apparatus, such as for example applying the green power tariff system to the consideration for selling green power generated by the photovoltaic cell <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The power conditioning system <b>21</b> corresponds to an example of a service management device. However, the service management device may be configured as part of the power conditioning system or as an external device to the power conditioning system.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The number of services executed by the power conditioning system <b>21</b> may be one or more, and is not limited to a specific number.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The power conditioning system <b>21</b> and the power supply apparatus connected to the power conditioning system <b>21</b> are collectively referred to as a distributed power supply (DPS) system <b>41</b>. In the case of the configuration example of a consumer installation system <b>42</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the power conditioning system <b>21</b>, the photovoltaic cell <b>11</b>, the storage battery <b>12</b>, and the electric vehicle <b>13</b> are collectively referred to as the distributed power supply system <b>41</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The distributed power supply system <b>41</b> provides energy management services to consumers. The consumer here refers to a consumer of power. Energy management services are also called consumer-oriented services.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Examples of energy management services provided by the distributed power supply system <b>41</b> to consumers include, but are not limited to, peak shift, peak shaving, and power selling.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Peak shift is a service that keeps down the electricity tariff by charging the storage battery during the period of time when the electricity tariff is relatively low and covering the power consumption of apparatuses (discharging the storage battery) during the period of time when the electricity tariff is relatively high.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Peak shaving is a service that sets a threshold power and cuts peak demand by discharging the storage battery when power consumption exceeding the threshold power occurs. For example, when the electricity tariff is set in stages in accordance with the maximum power, the electricity tariff can be suppressed by reducing the maximum power by means of peak shaving.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Power selling is a service that provides power (reverse power flow) from the consumer side to the commercial power system. Consumers get paid for the amount of power they provide.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In the following, an example will be described in which a higher price is paid for the sale of green power than the sale of power other than green power. Green power is power generated by natural energy such as wind power, sunlight, and biomass (power derived from renewable energy). In the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the generated power of the photovoltaic cell <b>11</b> corresponds to the example of green power.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Further, in the following, a case where the storage battery <b>12</b> or the electric vehicle <b>13</b> discharges power charged with green power is treated as green power will be described as an example.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Power other than green power is also called normal power. Green power and normal power correspond to the examples of power attributes in accordance with the power generation scheme, respectively. A power attribute due to the generation scheme is also simply referred to as the power attribute or just the attribute.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Further, the distributed power supply system <b>41</b> adjusts the power supply and demand for a system-oriented service in response to a request from the host control device <b>31</b>. The resource aggregator (RA) using the host control device <b>31</b> aggregates the power supply and demand adjustment by each consumer and provides an ancillary service (coordination power service) to the power transmission and distribution business operator. A resource aggregator is a business operator that provides services by integrating and controlling the power facility (distributed power supply system <b>41</b>) on the consumer side.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Ancillary services are also called system-oriented services.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Examples of ancillary services provided by resource aggregators to power transmission and distribution business operators include load frequency control (LFC), &#x394;f control, and demand response, but ancillary services are not limited thereto. Demand response is defined as changing the power consumption patterns to ensure that the consumer side appropriately controls the use of power (suppresses or conversely increases the use of power) depending on the setting of electricity tariff prices or the payment of incentives, for example, when the wholesale power market price rises or falls, or when the system reliability declines.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Both LFC and &#x394;f control are controls for adjusting the system frequency to the reference frequency. Comparing LFC and &#x394;f control, LFC may have a relatively long cycle and a relatively slow response speed, such that, for example, LFC charges and discharges in cycles of several seconds, while &#x394;f control charges and discharges in a cycle of about a second or less.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The services executed by the distributed power supply system <b>41</b> are not limited to specific services. It is sufficient that the distributed power supply system <b>41</b> is capable of simultaneously executing a plurality of services having different evaluations with respect to power attributes. Furthermore, the distributed power supply system <b>41</b> does not necessarily have to be able to execute both energy management services and ancillary services at the same time. For example, the distributed power supply system <b>41</b> may be able to execute power sales and peak shifts at the same time. In this case, the distributed power supply system <b>41</b> does not necessarily have to be able to further execute ancillary services at the same time as these energy management services.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The number of power supply apparatuses included in one distributed power supply system <b>41</b> is not limited to three, and may be a plurality. Further, the types of power supply apparatuses included in the distributed power supply system <b>41</b> are not limited to photovoltaic cells, storage batteries, and electric vehicles. It is sufficient that the power supply apparatuses included in one distributed power supply system <b>41</b> are capable of outputting power having different attributes such as green power and normal power.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The terminal device <b>22</b> is used as a user terminal of the distributed power supply system <b>41</b>, and accepts user operations such as service setting operations performed by the distributed power supply system <b>41</b>. Further, the terminal device <b>22</b> may calculate the charge/discharge power in some services. For example, the terminal device <b>22</b> may calculate the charge/discharge power in a service with a relatively slow response such as LFC. Since the terminal device <b>22</b> calculates the charge/discharge power in some services, the load for the power conditioning system <b>21</b> to calculate the charge/discharge power becomes relatively light, and in this respect, the responsiveness of the distributed power supply system <b>41</b> can be ensured.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The terminal device <b>22</b>, the power conditioning system <b>21</b>, the photovoltaic cell <b>11</b>, the storage battery <b>12</b>, and the electric vehicle <b>13</b> are collectively denoted as a consumer installation system <b>42</b>. The consumer installation system <b>42</b> is provided as a facility used by consumers.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">However, the terminal device <b>22</b> may be owned by the resource aggregator or by the consumer. For example, the resource aggregator may lend the terminal device <b>22</b> to the consumer.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The power conditioning system <b>21</b>, the photovoltaic cell <b>11</b>, the storage battery <b>12</b>, and the electric vehicle <b>13</b> are owned by, for example, the consumer.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The host control device <b>31</b> requests the power conditioning system <b>21</b> to adjust the power supply and demand. As described above, the resource aggregator using the host control device <b>31</b> aggregates power supply and demand adjustments by respective consumers and provides an ancillary service to the power transmission and distribution business operator.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The host control device <b>31</b> determines the amount of input/output power required for each consumer on the basis of the input/output power of the service provided to the power transmission and distribution business operator. Then, the host control device <b>31</b> transmits the required amount that has been determined to the power conditioning system <b>21</b> and/or the terminal device <b>22</b> of each consumer.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The power control system <b>1</b> may include other systems for inputting/outputting power in addition to the consumer installation system <b>42</b>. In particular, the power control system <b>1</b> may include, in addition to the consumer installation system <b>42</b>, a system including only one power supply apparatus such as a resource aggregator installation system described later. Further, the power control system <b>1</b> may include a system such as a mega solar that outputs (transmits) power but does not input (receive) power.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a diagram showing an example of a configuration in which the power conditioning system <b>21</b> performs power conversion.
