It should be understood that the subject technology may be practiced without some of these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and techniques have not been shown in detail so as not to obscure the subject technology.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Further, while the present description sets forth specific details of various embodiments, it will be appreciated that the description is illustrative only and should not be construed in any way as limiting. Additionally, it is contemplated that although particular embodiments of the present disclosure may be disclosed or shown in the context of an IV set, such embodiments can be used in other fluid conveyance systems. Furthermore, various applications of such embodiments and modifications thereto, which may occur to those who are skilled in the art, are also encompassed by the general concepts described herein.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In accordance with some embodiments, the present application discloses various features and advantages of a fluid connector system. The fluid connector system can provide for efficient and safe maintenance of fluid connections, such as the connections used for transferring medical fluids toward or away from a patient. The fluid connector system can maintain a fluid pathway by resisting unintended disconnection when a pulling or tension force is applied to the fluid connector system, such as when a patient moves or when the medical tubing is pulled away from the patient.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The fluid connector system can also prevent injury to a patient or a caregiver by permitting disconnection or separation between portions of the connector system when a pulling or tension force exceeds a threshold. The fluid connector system can also prevent injury to a patient or a caregiver by obstructing the fluid pathway when disconnection or separation between portions of the connector system occurs. Further, the fluid connector system can provide for efficient and safe reestablishment of the fluid pathway, by permitting reassembly of portions of the system after a disconnection or separation occurs.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring now to the figures, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example of a fluid connector system in use in accordance with aspects of the present disclosure. The connector system <b>100</b> is coupled with tubing of an IV set, which is being used to direct a fluid to a patient <b>10</b>. The IV set can include a medicament bag <b>12</b>, a drip chamber <b>14</b>, tubing <b>16</b>, and an IV catheter <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The connector system <b>100</b> fluidly connects the tubing <b>16</b> to the IV catheter <b>18</b>. Although the connector system <b>100</b> is illustrated being coupled along a fluid pathway of an IV set, between a medicament bag <b>12</b> and a patient <b>10</b>, it should be understood that the connector system <b>100</b> can be connected within other fluid pathways, such as between a patient and a IV pump or between a patient and a dialysis machine. The connector system <b>100</b> can also be connected along another portion of a fluid pathway. For example, the connector system <b>100</b> can be connected along a proximal portion of the fluid pathway, such as being connected between the tubing <b>16</b> and the medicament bag <b>12</b> or other fluid therapy device.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The connector system <b>100</b> includes a first valve assembly <b>110</b> and a second valve assembly <b>210</b>, which are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.
