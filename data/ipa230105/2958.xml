Often the fabrication of garments requires various pieces of fabric to be joined together at a seam. Traditionally, this has been performed by sewing, wherein a thread is used to stitch two or more pieces of fabric together in a desired manner to form a garment.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">More recently adhesive bonds have been used to join fabrics together. This can involve the use of an adhesive material such as glue or could also involve heating certain textile materials to the point where they diffuse and melt together.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">All of the previously used forming methods suffer from disadvantages. For example, once the fabrics have been joined together in this manner, they are difficult or impossible to take apart for rework. Attempting to undo an adhesive bond can be impossible and can lead to damage of the fabric. Undoing a stitched seam is very tedious and labor intensive. In addition, certain marks and damage can remain on the fabric after the stitching has been undone.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition, each of these methods of connecting fabric can be very tedious and labor intensive. This increases manufacturing costs and reduces manufacturing throughput. The labor intensiveness has led to garment manufacturing being located primarily in regions with access to inexpensive labor.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition, the tooling and skill required to bond fabrics by stitching or adhesive bonding has limited the ability of hobbyists, people without proper tooling or those with limited sewing skills to be able to construct garments on their own.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present embodiments provide a device for bonding two or more pieces of fabric. The device includes a base and a plurality of spikes extending from the base. The base and the plurality of spikes are formed of a polymer material having a forming temperature lower than a forming temperature of an intended fabric to be bonded.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present embodiments can also provide a garment including first and second pieces of fabric and a bonding strip having a base and a plurality of spikes extending through the first and second pieces of fabric. The spikes can be bent over to press the first and second pieces of fabric against the base so as to secure the first and second pieces of fabric to the bonding strip.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The bonding strip can be constructed of a material having a lower forming temperature than the first and second pieces of fabric. In one embodiment, the bonding strip can comprise a polymer, and the first and second pieces of fabric can comprise a natural fiber.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The base of the device can have an elongated shape having a long dimension such as a rectangular shape or a strip. The spikes can be formed on two rows arranged along the long dimension of the strip. The two rows of spikes can be arranged along the first and second edges of the base.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The spikes of the device can be configured to extend through one or more pieces of fabric in order to connect the two pieces of fabric. The spikes and base can be integral with one another and formed as a single piece of polymer material.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The device, spikes and base, can be formed of a material having a forming temperature that is less than 200 F, or between 175 F and 250 F. The device spikes and base can be constructed of for example, thermoplastic such as Worbla&#x2122; or thermoplastic elastomer composite.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The embodiments can also provide a method for joining one or more pieces of fabric. The method includes providing a bonding strip having a base and a plurality of spikes extending from the base, the bonding strip being formed of a material having a forming temperature. The spikes of the bonding strip are extended through the two or more pieces of fabric. The bonding strip is then brought to a temperature that is at least as high as the forming temperature of the bonding strip, and the spikes are then formed while the bonding strip is at this temperature.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The spikes can be deformed by bending the spikes and pressing them flat against the fabric. This can be performed by applying pressure from a seaming roll to press the spikes against the fabric.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The fabric to be joined can have a forming temperature higher than that of the bonding strip and the forming of the spikes can be performed at a temperature that is between the temperature of the bonding strip and the forming temperature of the fabric. The bonding strip can be constructed such that the spikes extend from the base in first and second rows and such that the spikes of the first row are aligned with the spikes of the second row. The deformation of the spikes can be performed such that the spikes of the first row contact and bond with spikes of the second row. In some embodiments the bonding strip can be a polymer, whereas the fabric can be an organic material such as cotton, wool or a blend of synthetic and organic material.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">These and other features and advantages will be apparent to one of skill in the art upon reading of the following detailed description of the embodiments in conjunction with the figures.

This description is made for the purpose of illustrating the general principles and is not meant to limit the inventive concepts claimed herein in any way.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The bonding of fabrics in the garment industry involves technologies that include stitching with thread or bonding with adhesive. While these technologies have been used for many years, they each have drawbacks. For example, stitching garments can be time consuming and does not allow for easy reworking if the stitching process was not performed correctly. Reworking such stitched garment requires laborious, careful cutting of the stitching thread. In addition, even if the stitches are successfully removed, they can leave marks on the fabric that can be visible in the finished garment.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Adhesive bonding does not form a mechanical bond, and therefore does not necessarily provide a secure connection of the fabric. In addition, to an even greater extent than stitching adhesive bonding does not allow for reworking if the bonding process is not perfectly performed. As there is no way to undo the adhesive bonding process, a garment must be scrapped if the process is performed incorrectly.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The embodiments which are described herein below provide a quick and easy mechanism for bonding that can be easily reworked especially in an intermediate stage of manufacture.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> shows a perspective view of a bonding strip <b>102</b> according to an embodiment. The bonding strip <b>102</b> is preferably formed of a synthetic material, such as a polymer, that has a relatively low forming temperature, as will be described herein below. The bonding strip <b>102</b> has a base <b>104</b> and a plurality of needles or spikes (hereinafter referred to as spikes) <b>106</b> extending from the surface of the base <b>104</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the spikes <b>106</b> can have a narrow conical shape. However, the spikes <b>106</b> could have many other shapes and configurations, such as narrow pyramidal shape, cylindrical shape, mushroom shape, spikes with jagged edges, spikes that have varying girth along their heights, spikes that may be discontinuous increasing and decreasing girth, or some other shape.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, as mentioned above, the spikes <b>106</b> can have a mushroom shape wherein the top of the spike <b>106</b> can have an enlarged, bulbous shape. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>, according to an alternate embodiment, the spikes <b>106</b> can have a variable shape such as a zig-zag shape. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref>, according to an alternate embodiment, the spikes <b>106</b> can have a step-wise variable width, radius or other dimension. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>E</figref>, according to yet another embodiment, the spikes <b>106</b> can have a variable density, pitch or spacing. In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>E</figref>, the spikes <b>106</b> can have a serrated shape. Various other configurations of bonding strips and or spike configurations are possible and are considered to fall within the scope of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>F</figref> is a top-down view according to yet another embodiment. In this embodiment, the spikes <b>106</b> can be arranged in rows that are not parallel with the long edge of the base <b>104</b>, but are actually perpendicular to the length. Other embodiments are also possible, such as wherein the spikes <b>106</b> are at a diagonal to the length or any other configuration such as randomly grouped, or in rows that are not parallel with one another and which may or may not intersect one another.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a top-down view of the bonding strip of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, as seen from line <b>2</b>-<b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> it can be seen that the spikes <b>106</b> can be formed in first and second rows <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> along opposite edges and running along the length of the base <b>104</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> it can be seen that the spikes <b>106</b><i>a </i>are formed in a row <b>202</b> and spikes <b>106</b><i>b </i>are formed in a row <b>204</b>. Also, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> it can be seen that each of the spikes <b>106</b><i>a </i>in row <b>202</b> is aligned with a corresponding spike <b>106</b><i>b </i>in row <b>204</b>. In other words, each spike <b>106</b><i>a </i>in row <b>202</b> is at location as measured in the longitudinal direction (shown by arrow <b>206</b>) that is the same as a corresponding spike <b>106</b><i>b </i>in row <b>204</b>. This can be beneficial for reasons that will become apparent herein below. However, in some embodiments, the spikes in different rows may be designed not to line up. Furthermore, the spacing, orientation, number of rows, distribution and the shapes of the spikes along one row, or differing rows may vary along a row and/or in between one or more rows.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a cross-sectional end view of the bonding strip <b>102</b> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a cross-sectional side view as seen from line <b>4</b>-<b>4</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref> show how the bonding strip <b>102</b> can connect fabric pieces <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, the fabric pieces <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> are in an intermediate state of bonding. The spikes <b>106</b> of the bonding strip <b>102</b> poke through the fabric pieces <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> holding the fabric pieces <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> in a partially bonded or connected state.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">At this point in the bonding process, if the connection of the fabric pieces <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> is not quite right, for example, there is an unintended wrinkle in one or more of the fabric pieces <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> or one pieces is too tight or too loose, either of the fabric pieces <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> can be easily removed and reattached by pulling the fabric piece <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> off of the spikes correcting the position of the fabric pieces pressing the fabric piece back onto the bonding strip <b>102</b>. This ability to easily rework the attachment of the fabric pieces provides a great advantage over previously available attachment methods such as sewing or adhesive bonding wherein the attachment would be permanent and does not allow for rework.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Fabrics and textile products more generally can be formed of many different products having many different properties. For example, fabrics can be formed of synthetic materials which are generally polymer materials such as polyether, rayon, etc. Fabrics can also be organic, plant-based products such as cotton, hemp, etc. or can be natural animal-based products such as wool. Fabrics can also be a blend of these materials.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">As mentioned above, each of these different materials has unique material properties. One of the properties is forming temperature. The forming temperature of the material is the temperature at which the material can be permanently deformed and lies somewhere between the temperature at which the material is between a solid and liquid state. In most instances, the forming temperature is a temperature at or above the glass transition temperature of the material.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">With reference again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, the bonding strip <b>102</b> is constructed of a material that has a lower forming temperature than that of the fabric pieces <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>. For example, the bonding strip can be constructed of a synthetic material such as polyether having good properties for use in garments, and the fabric pieces <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> can be constructed of a natural, organic fiber material such as cotton, hemp or wool or a (or a synthetic/organic blend) which has significantly higher forming temperature than the synthetic material of the bonding strip <b>102</b>. In some embodiments, the bonding strip <b>102</b> can be constructed of a material having a forming temperature of less than 200 degrees F. or having a forming temperature between 175 degrees F. and 250 degrees F. While such a bonding strip <b>102</b> can be used with advantage in organic or organic/synthetic blends, the usefulness of such as bonding technique is not limited to use only with these materials and can be used with synthetic fabrics too, so long as the synthetic fabric material has a higher forming temperature than the bonding strip <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a side, cross-sectional view of some illustrative embodiments showing how the bonding strip <b>102</b> can be formed to securely bond the two pieces of fabric <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>. As discussed above, the bonding strip <b>102</b> and fabric <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> are heated to a temperature that is above at or above the forming temperature of the bonding strip <b>102</b>. With the bonding strip <b>102</b> and fabric <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> at this temperature, a tool such as a seaming roller <b>502</b> can be used to form the bonding strip <b>102</b>. Movement of the seaming roller is indicated by arrow <b>504</b>. There are several ways in which the bonding strip <b>102</b> and fabric <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> can be brought to this temperature. For example, the bonding strip <b>102</b> and fabric <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> can be heated in an oven. In alternative embodiments, other types of heat including convection or radiant heat such as infrared heat can be applied to the fabric <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> and bonding strip <b>102</b> at the point of forming.
