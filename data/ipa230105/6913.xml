The ECU <b>110</b>, <b>120</b>, or <b>130</b> may include at least one processor and a memory storing instructions executed by the at least one processor.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The autonomous driving ECU <b>110</b> may recognize a driving environment and/or a vehicle state by means of various sensors and/or other ECUs loaded into the vehicle, may plan a driving route based on the recognized driving environment, the recognized vehicle state, and/or the like to control autonomous driving of the vehicle. The autonomous driving ECU <b>110</b> may generate a message including data (e.g., a control command, risk information, driving environment information, vehicle state information, and/or the like) for autonomous driving control. The autonomous driving ECU <b>110</b> may transmit the generated message over a first network N1 or a second network N2. Herein, the autonomous driving ECU <b>110</b> may use the first network N1 as a main network and may use the second network N2 as an auxiliary network. The autonomous driving ECU <b>110</b> may transmit a message based on a predetermined transmission period.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The central gateway ECU <b>120</b> may be a routing device which directly performs routing, for communication inside and outside the vehicle. The central gateway ECU <b>120</b> may fail to operate, when there is no need to directly perform a routing function, for example, a state where there is no need to use a destination network or a state where power is not supplied. The central gateway ECU <b>120</b> may receive a message from a source network, that is, the first network N1 and the second network N2. The central gateway ECU <b>120</b> may route the received message to a third network N3 which is the destination network. Such a central gateway ECU <b>120</b> may include a first timeout module <b>121</b>, a second timeout module <b>122</b>, a routing engine <b>123</b>, and the like.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The first timeout module <b>121</b> may determine whether the message received over the first network N1 is normally received. The first timeout module <b>121</b> may count a time when a message is not received from the first network N1, that is, a message non-reception time. The first timeout module <b>121</b> may compare the counted message non-reception time with a predetermined first reference time. When the counted message non-reception time is greater than or equal to the predetermined first reference time, the first timeout module <b>121</b> may determine a first network reception state as a timeout state (or a non-reception state). When the counted message non-reception time is less than the predetermined first reference time, the first timeout module <b>121</b> may determine the first network reception state as a normal state (or a normal reception state).</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The second timeout module <b>122</b> may determine whether the message received over the second network N2 is normally received. The second timeout module <b>122</b> may count a time when a message is not received from the second network N2. The second timeout module <b>122</b> may identify whether the counted message non-reception time is greater than or equal to a predetermined second reference time. When the counted message non-reception time is greater than or equal to the second reference time, the second timeout module <b>122</b> may determine a second network reception state as a timeout state. When the counted message non-reception time is less than the second reference time, the second timeout module <b>122</b> may determine the second network reception state as a normal state.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The first reference time and the second reference time may be set to be identical to each other or may be set to be different from each other. The first reference time may be set to three times a message reception period using the first network N1, and the second reference time may be set to three times a message reception period using the second network N2.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The first timeout module <b>121</b> and the second timeout module <b>122</b> may operate when messages received over the first network N1 and the second network N2 are messages which are transmitted on a periodic basis and may fail to operate when the messages received over the first network N1 and the second network N2 are transmitted in an event trigger scheme.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">By controlling optional direct routing, the routing engine <b>123</b> may receive a message from the first network N1 and/or the second network N2 and may route the received message to the third network N3. The routing engine <b>123</b> may identify a first network reception state and a second network reception state from the first timeout module <b>121</b> and the second timeout module <b>122</b>. When both the first network reception state and the second network reception state are a normal state, the routing engine <b>123</b> may route a message, received from one of the first network N1 or the second network N2, to the third network N3. When the first network reception state is the timeout state, the routing engine <b>123</b> may route a message, received from the second network N2, to the third network N3. When the second network reception state is the timeout state, the routing engine <b>123</b> may route a message, received from the first network N1, to the third network N3.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The vehicle behavior ECU <b>130</b> may receive a message, transmitted from the central gateway ECU <b>120</b>, over the third network N3. The vehicle behavior ECU <b>130</b> may control a behavior of the vehicle based on the information included in the message. The vehicle behavior ECU <b>130</b> may include controllers having functions of controlling steering, braking, and/or acceleration and deceleration of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a drawing illustrating routing control according to a source network state according to embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the present embodiment, a description will be given of a control method capable of routing only one message to a destination network to reduce a bus load rate of the destination network, when receiving messages, each of which has the same data, from two source networks.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">First of all, in a state P1 where messages are normally received over two source networks, that is, an S1 network and an S2 network, a central gateway ECU <b>120</b> may respectively receive an S1 message and an S2 message over the S1 network and the S2 network. A controller which transmits the S1 message and the S2 message may transmit the messages on a periodic basis. When pieces of data Datal respectively included in the S1 message and the S2 message respectively received over the S1 network and the S2 network are the same as each other, the central gateway ECU <b>120</b> may route the S1 message, received from the S1 network, to a D network which is a destination network.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Next, in a state P2 where a message is not received over the S1 network, the central gateway ECU <b>120</b> may fail to perform routing. The central gateway ECU <b>120</b> may identify whether a state where the S1 message is not received over the S1 network is maintained during a first reference time. When the state where the S1 message is not received over the S1 network is maintained during the first reference time, the central gateway ECU <b>120</b> may finally determine an S1 network message reception state (an S1 network reception state) as a timeout state.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In a state P3 where the S2 message is normally received over the S2 network, after determining the S1 network reception state as the timeout state in P2, the central gateway ECU <b>120</b> may receive the S2 message over the S2 network and may route the S2 message to the D network. Thus, controllers in the vehicle, which receive the S1 message or the S2 message over the D network, may receive the same data.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In a state S4 capable of normally receiving a message again over the S1 network while routing the S2 message received from the S2 network, when detecting that it is able to normally receive the message again over the S1 network, the central gateway ECU <b>120</b> may change the S1 network reception state from the timeout state to a normal state. The central gateway ECU <b>120</b> may stop routing the S2 message received from the S2 network.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">After the S1 network reception state is determined as the normal state in P4, in P5, the central gateway ECU <b>120</b> may receive the S1 message over the S1 network and may route the S1 message to the D network. In other words, the central gateway ECU <b>120</b> may return to the state P1.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The above-mentioned embodiment describes that the central gateway ECU <b>120</b> selectively routes one of the S1 message or the S2 message to the D network based on the message reception state over the S1 network and the S2 network, but not limited thereto. When an event such as a change in local input or communication input occurs, the central gateway ECU <b>120</b> may selectively route one of messages received from the S1 network and the S2 network to the D network. At this time, the messages received from the S1 network and the S2 network may include the same data or different data. The local input may be input from another controller connected in hardware with the central gateway ECU <b>120</b>. When receiving an active signal from the other controller, the central gateway ECU <b>120</b> may perform an optional direct routing function. When receiving an inactive signal from the other controller, the central gateway ECU <b>120</b> may stop the optional direct routing function. The communication input may define activation or deactivation of a communication signal. Because the central gateway ECU <b>120</b> is connected with a plurality of CAN networks, it may perform or stop the optional direct routing function depending on activation or deactivation of a CAN communication signal.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating a configuration of a routing device according to embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a routing device <b>200</b> may be a central gateway ECU which performs optional direct routing.
