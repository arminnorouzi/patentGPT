id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to building systems and in particular to modular building systems for single and multi-storey residential, commercial and industrial buildings.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention has been developed primarily as a modular walling system for use in low rise buildings having one, two or three levels or storeys and will be described hereinafter with reference to this application. However, it will be appreciated that the invention is not limited to this particular field of use and could be readily adapted for use in buildings having four or more levels or storeys such as, for example, residential and office towers.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The following discussion of the prior art has been provided in order to place the invention in an appropriate technical context and allow the advantages of it to be more fully appreciated. However, any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should not be considered as an express or implied admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of common general knowledge in the field.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A variety of methods and systems have been developed for the construction of both residential, commercial and industrial buildings. The systems used often vary depending on whether the building is a single storey, low-rise or high-rise building.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, many building systems are inefficient to construct requiring highly skilled labour and are thus highly expensive. Problems with existing building systems include the use of wet trade processes and other complex construction techniques, concerns over environmental issues relating to the negative impact of pollution, and the high costs associated with machinery and labour. In addition, building systems must comply with strict building codes.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">With these issues in mind there is a continuing need to reduce the cost of construction processes whilst improving or at least maintaining the performance levels required by the building codes.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The conventional cavity masonry wall is an example of a two-leaf wall which is connected by masonry ties. A stud wall with interior and/or exterior sheeting, which are mechanically connected, is an example of an attempt to reduce the cost of on-site labour.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The cost of labour associated with in-situ construction of multi-layered walls is necessarily dependent on the time required to complete the assembly process. In particular, these costs primarily depend on the speed of assembly of each layer. Accordingly, there is a desire to simplify the process of erecting a building so as to reduce the time required to complete a construction and thus reduce the associated labour costs.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Currently available modular building systems have a number of inherent problems ranging from a lack of structural integrity to the inability to be readily adapted to various designs to having relatively complex arrangements and high numbers of component parts.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is an object of the present invention to overcome or ameliorate one or more of the disadvantages of the prior art, or at least to provide a useful alternative.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In broad terms, the present invention provides a modular walling system including a plurality of primary structural members and a securing means for securing adjacent primary structural members together to form a structural wall section.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to one aspect of the invention, there is provided a modular walling system, including:</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">a plurality of primary structural members, each primary structural member having a generally channel-shaped cross-sectional profile with a main web having an outer wall defining surface and two flanges extending away from the outer wall defining surface; and</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">securing means configured to retain pairs of primary structural members in a side-by-side relationship, wherein the securing means secures adjacent flanges of respective pairs of the primary structural members such that the adjacent flanges are held together in secure face-to-face abutment.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a modular walling system, including:</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">a plurality of primary structural members, each primary structural member having a generally channel-shaped cross-sectional profile with an outer wall defining surface and two flanges extending away from the outer wall defining surface;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">securing means configured to apply a securing force to retain pairs of primary structural members in a side-by-side relationship, the securing means being configured to secure adjacent flanges of respective pairs of the primary structural members such that the adjacent flanges are held together in secure face-to-face abutment; and</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">a primary corner member having a solid construction, wherein the primary corner member is connectable between a first primary structural member with its outer wall defining surface extending in a first direction, and a second primary structural member with its outer wall defining surface extending in a second direction.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">For ease of description, the phrase &#x201c;structural wall section&#x201d; will be used herein to refer to two or more primary structural members which have been secured together.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Preferably, the securing means is configured to retain pairs of primary structural members in a side-by-side relationship such that the respective outer wall defining surfaces are generally contiguous. Preferably, the side-by-side outer wall defining surfaces define a planar base surface to which a desired wall finish can be applied. In other embodiments, the primary structural members and/or the securing means are configured such that the respective outer wall defining surfaces of a pair of retained primary structural members are stepped, staggered or offset relative to one another to provide a desired aesthetic effect.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Preferably, each primary structural member is configured to be a load bearing member of the walling system such that the primary structural members transfer the vertical load acting on the wall to the ground or foundation on which the wall is constructed. Each primary structural member is preferably longitudinal or elongate. Preferably, each primary structural member has a length equal to the desired height of the wall so as to extend from the ground to the desired roof height or floor to ceiling height (or the height corresponding to one level or storey of the building).</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Preferably, the main web and the two flanges of each primary structural member are the same length. In some embodiments, the main web and the two flanges are formed to have the same thickness as each other. In some embodiments, the thickness of the main web is less than the thickness of each flange. In certain embodiments, the ratio of the thickness of each flange to the thickness of the main web is approximately 3:1, 2.5:1, 2:1, 1.5:1 or 1:1. In other embodiments, the thickness of the main web is greater than the thickness of each flange.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some embodiments, each primary structural member includes a reinforcing element extending between the main web of the channel and each side flange, thereby to enhance the structural integrity of the respective primary structural member. Preferably, each reinforcing element is arranged or associated with an inner corner formed between the main channel and the respective side flange. In some embodiments, each reinforcing element is a separate element connected between the main channel and the respective side flange. In some embodiments, each primary structural member has a region of increased thickness adjacent each inner corner, thereby to define the respective reinforcing element. In some embodiments, the region of increased thickness is associated with the main web. In some embodiments, each end of the main web tapers away from its inner surface such that each end of the main web is thicker than a central portion of main web, thereby to define the respective reinforcing elements.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Preferably, the flanges of each primary structural member extend generally normal (or perpendicular) to the main web or associated outer wall defining surface such that two or more primary structural members can be secured together to form a structural wall section having a generally planar outer wall surface of a desired length (or span). In some embodiments, the flanges may have an outer flange surface which extends normal to the outer wall defining surface and an inner flange surface which is angled relative to the outer flange surface for setting a desired corner configuration or angle. The planar structural wall section can be configured to be either an external wall section or an internal wall section of a building.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some embodiments, a primary corner member is connectable between the primary structural member at the end of a first structural wall section and the primary structural member at the end of a second structural wall section. Preferably, the primary corner member has a first surface against which the first structural wall section can be mounted and a second surface against which the second structural wall section can be mounted, wherein the first structural wall section extends at a predetermined angle relative to the second structural wall section. In some embodiments, the first and second surfaces of the primary corner module are arranged at 90 degrees to each other. In some embodiments, the first surface of the primary corner member has substantially the same width as the length of the side flanges of the primary structural members. In some embodiments, the second surface of the primary corner member has substantially the same width as the length of the side flanges of the primary structural members. In some embodiments, primary corner module has an (elongate) recess between the first and second surfaces. The recess may be advantageously configured to provide additional space to facilitate mounting of a secondary wall section, particularly during the mounting of those sections forming internal corners. Preferably, the recess extends along the length of the primary corner module. The recess is preferably L-shaped. Preferably, each primary corner member is formed as a solid construction (e.g. as opposed to a channel or hollow member). In some embodiments, each primary corner member is formed from a solid homogeneous mixture. The provision of a solid primary corner member is particularly advantageous for enhancing the structural integrity of a structural wall section.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Preferably, the first surface of the primary corner member has one or more holes arranged to align with the holes in the flange of the respective primary structural member, wherein a threaded fastener can pass through the holes in the flange of the primary structural member and threadedly engage the holes in the first surface of the primary corner member, thereby to secure the primary corner member thereto. Preferably, two or more threaded fasteners are used to secure the primary corner member to the first structural wall section.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Preferably, the second surface of the primary corner member has one or more holes arranged to align with the holes in the flange of the respective primary structural member, wherein a threaded fastener can pass through the holes in the flange of the primary structural member and threadedly engage the holes in the second surface of the primary corner member, thereby to secure the primary corner member thereto. Preferably, two or more threaded fasteners are used to secure the primary corner member to the second structural wall section.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The provision of threaded fasteners for securing the structural wall sections to the solid primary corner member is particularly advantageous for further enhancing the structural integrity of a structural wall section.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Preferably, the primary corner member has a first outer surface which is adapted to be substantially flush with the outer surface of the first structural wall section when the primary corner member is fastened thereto.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Preferably, the primary corner member has a second outer surface which is adapted to be substantially flush with the outer surface of the second structural wall section when the primary corner member is fastened thereto.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In certain preferred embodiments, the primary structural members are formed of a material selected from the group consisting of steel, timber, plastic, concrete, and fibre cement. It will of course be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the primary structural members are not limited to being formed of the above listed materials but may be formed of any suitable building material, including naturally occurring and man-made materials. The primary structural modules are preferably formed by a moulding, casting or extruding process.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some preferred forms of the walling system, each primary structural member may be formed of the same material. However, in other preferred forms, some of the plurality of primary structural members can be formed of one material whilst the other primary structural members can be formed of one or more different materials to enable various aesthetic appearances to be achieved, or to combat the expected climatic and/or environmental conditions of a particular location and/or side of a building.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In certain embodiments, the flanges of each primary structural member include a linear array of apertures, each aperture being configured for accommodating an associated securing means. The apertures are preferably equally spaced apart. The distance between the top of the flange and the first aperture is preferably less than the equidistant spacing between the apertures. Similarly, the lower most or bottom aperture is preferably located at a distance above the bottom of the associated flange which is less than the equidistant spacing between the apertures.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">It will be appreciated that the provision of a linear array of equally spaced apart apertures enables the securing means to be secured to a particular or selected one of the apertures, as desired. The arrays of apertures also ensure that the primary structural members can be readily cut to a desired length to suit a particular building application. Accordingly, the modular building system can be readily made to suit a particular design, rather than having the design of a building dictated by the parts of the building system.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The linear array of equally spaced apart apertures also enables a structural wall section to be formed with primary structural members of varying lengths. A range of lengths can be used to provide a desired aesthetic effect and/or to readily form openings, such as door and window openings, in the structural wall section. In certain embodiments, cut-outs can also be made in the primary and secondary structural members to form the window and door openings.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Preferably, each aperture is a through opening. In preferred embodiments, each aperture is square, rectangular, circular or other suitable polygonal shape.

Furthermore, it is possible to use a locking pin of a single size for each location at which a securing means is required, as opposed to requiring different sized pins. This provides advantages both in terms of reducing the number of component parts required to provide a complete system and during installation as workers are not required to waste time trying to identify which size locking pin is required for a particular purpose.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Preferably, each spacer/washer is formed to have the same (external) shape/profile.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Preferably, the pair of force distributing elements defines a mounting formation for mounting secondary structural members to the structural wall section.

In particular, when the load-bearing structural wall section is subjected to external forces (e.g. earthquake loads, wind loads) such that it is in racking shear, the abutting flanges of the primary structural members together with the securing means resists in-plane forces shear of the wall, thereby to inhibit potential failure of the wall.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some embodiments, primary corner members are securable to the end of a structural wall section.

Preferably, at least one of the force distributing members has a channel adapted to at least partially receive a portion of the head of the locking member and/or the locking element (e.g. wedge).</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a primary corner member as described herein.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a corner system for a modular walling system as described herein.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a kit of parts for a modular walling system, the kit including:</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">a plurality of primary structural members; and</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">securing means as described herein for securing pairs of primary structural members in a side-by-side relationship.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">The kit preferably includes one or more of the following elements: a plurality of secondary structural members; a plurality of support brackets; a plurality of corner brackets, a plurality of floor brackets, a plurality of roof brackets, securing means as described herein, anchor bolts, wherein the various elements are interconnectable as described herein to form a structural wall of a building.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of erecting a modular walling system, the method including:</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">standing a pair of primary structural members side-by-side on a foundation; and</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">securing the pair of primary structural members together with a securing means, the securing means engaging the flanges of the primary structural members.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">In embodiments according this aspect, the securing means preferably includes the locking pin, a pair of spacers and a wedge assembly as described herein.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a modular walling system including:</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">a plurality of primary structural members, each primary structural member having a generally channel-shaped cross-sectional profile with an outer wall defining surface and two flanges extending away from the outer wall defining surface;</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">a plurality of support brackets, the support brackets being configured to retain pairs of primary structural members in a side-by-side relationship such that the respective outer wall defining surfaces are generally contiguous; and</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">securing means for securing each support bracket to adjacent flanges of the respective pairs of primary structural members such that the adjacent flanges are held together in secure face-to-face abutment.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">In embodiments according to this aspect of the invention, the support bracket may be a generally U- or channel-shaped bracket configured to extend around the adjacent longitudinal edges of abutting flanges of the primary structural members, more preferably, the primary structural wall members. Each channel-shaped support bracket preferably has a web and two side members extending from the web. Preferably, the side members are spaced apart for close fitting engagement around the abutting flanges.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">The side members preferably include mounting holes through which the securing means can secure the support bracket to the adjacent abutting flanges. Preferably, the mounting holes for the securing means are located towards the distal end of the side members such that they can be aligned with the passage of coaxially aligned apertures in the abutting flanges of the primary structural members. The mounting holes are preferably positioned such that the web is spaced from the flanges of the primary structural members to which the support bracket is secured. That is, there is preferably a gap between the ends of the flanges of the primary structural members and the web of the support bracket.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">The support brackets can be readily secured to the abutting flanges of the primary structural members via any one of the passages defined by the aligned apertures of the linear array of apertures in the flanges using the securing means discussed below. It will therefore be appreciated that linear array of apertures in the flanges of the primary support members allows the support bracket to be readily relocated to a desired position along the flanges to which it is secured. In other forms, the support bracket is not limited to being secured at one of a number of discrete positions determined by a linear array of apertures, but instead can be advantageously adapted to be securely located at any desired point along the height of the flange such as, for example, by sliding movement along the respective flanges. It will be appreciated that the ability to relocate the support bracket along the length of the flanges greatly enhances the versatility of the modular walling system. In particular, it enables the secondary structural members described below to be mounted to the structural wall sections at various desired positions relative to the primary structural members, including overlapping positions (as opposed to matched height mounting of primary and secondary structural members).</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">Preferably, at least two support brackets are secured to each pair of abutting flanges, with one support bracket preferably being arranged towards the top of the flanges and one arranged towards the bottom of the flanges. In other forms, each support bracket can be configured to span a predetermined number of passages such that two or more securing means can be used to secure each support bracket to the flanges of the primary structural members. It will thus be appreciated that the support brackets are not restricted to being secured in one particular position on the flanges and thus can be readily positioned to join together primary structural members of different lengths.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">In yet other forms, the support brackets can be approximately the same length (height) as the flanges and can include an array of mounting holes corresponding to the array of apertures in the flanges such that two or more securing means can be used to secure a single support bracket to the flanges.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">In certain preferred embodiments, the support bracket is formed of a sheet metal such as, for example, mild steel, stainless steel and aluminium. It will of course be appreciated that the support bracket could be formed of other suitable materials not listed above, including plastics.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">Preferably, each support bracket includes a mounting formation for supporting a secondary structural member such as for example a cladding member. In certain embodiments, the mounting formation is in the form of a pair of open ended slots, each slot being formed in an upper edge of the respective side member of the support bracket. In other preferred forms, the mounting formation is in the form of openings such as holes in the sides of the support bracket. Preferably, the mounting formation is arranged close to or adjacent the web of the support bracket such that the receiving formation lies between the web of the support bracket and the ends of the flanges to which it is secured.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">In other preferred forms, the mounting formation is in the form of a projection extending from a rear surface of the web of the support bracket. The rearward projection is preferably T-shaped, but could be any suitable shape for supporting the secondary structural member.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">In order to inhibit rotation of the support bracket about the securing means (and relative to the flanges of the primary structural members), the support brackets can be configured to reduce the size of the gap between the ends of the flanges and the web of the support bracket. Alternatively, the web of the support bracket can be angled such that its lower edge rests against the ends of the flanges whilst still providing a gap at the top for the securing means. Another alternative includes the use of an additional pin through the sides of the support bracket to inhibit rotation of the support bracket relative to the flanges of the primary structural members.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">Accordingly, in embodiments of the above aspect of the invention, the support bracket may serve the dual purpose of acting as a linking element between the two halves of the wall, as well as acting as the shear connector between the modules of the load bearing structural wall section.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention"

end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0169" num="0168">Referring to the drawings, the invention provides a modular walling system <b>1</b> having a plurality of longitudinal primary structural members <b>2</b>. The modular walling system <b>1</b> is preferably assembled and arranged such that the primary structural members <b>2</b> form the outer or external load bearing members of the walling system.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0169">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, each primary structural member <b>2</b> has a generally channel-shaped cross-sectional profile with an outer wall defining surface <b>3</b> and two flanges <b>4</b> extending away from the outer wall defining surface <b>3</b>. The flanges <b>4</b> preferably extend along the entire length of each primary structural member <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0170">Each flange <b>4</b> of the primary structural members <b>2</b> includes a linear array of apertures in the form of cylindrical through-bores <b>5</b> for cooperating with a securing means <b>6</b> for securing together pairs of primary structural members. The apertures <b>5</b> are equally spaced apart along the length of the respective flange <b>4</b>. The apertures <b>5</b> are arranged such that when pairs of primary structural members <b>2</b> are in face-to-face abutment, the apertures <b>5</b> of adjacent flanges <b>4</b> are coaxially aligned to define a passage for receiving a portion of the securing means <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0171">The securing means <b>6</b> includes a locking member in the form of a planar locking pin <b>7</b> formed of a flat plate material, a pair of spacers <b>8</b> and a locking element in the form of a wedge <b>9</b>. As most clearly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the securing means <b>6</b> is secured to adjacent flanges <b>4</b> of a pair of primary structural members <b>2</b> to retain the primary structural members in a side-by-side relationship such that the respective outer wall defining surfaces <b>3</b> are generally contiguous, thereby defining a generally planar structural wall section.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0172">In the illustrated embodiment, one securing means is securely located towards the top of the abutting flanges <b>4</b> and a second securing means is securely located towards the bottom of the flanges <b>4</b> to form a structural wall section.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0173">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b> to <b>16</b></figref>, the locking pin <b>7</b> has a flat or planar shaft body <b>12</b> and head <b>10</b> at one end and a securing formation in the form of a slot <b>11</b> at the other end for receiving the wedge <b>9</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b> and <b>16</b></figref>, the wedge <b>9</b> of the securing means has a tapered profile such that one end is wider than the other. It will be appreciated that the tapered profile facilitates driving the wedge <b>9</b> into the slot <b>11</b> of the locking pin <b>7</b> and provides a self-fitting type characteristic to match the size of the slot <b>11</b> for secure locking engagement.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0174">In addition, the length of the slot <b>11</b> is such that, in combination with the self-fitting characteristic of the wedge <b>9</b>, additional brackets (e.g. floor or corner brackets) can be secured onto the locking pin <b>7</b> without requiring a selection of pins of different lengths to accommodate the thickness of the additional brackets. The wedge <b>9</b> simply fits into the available length slot to securely engage the various components and retain these in place.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0175">It can also be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b> and <b>24</b></figref> that the distal end of the locking pin shaft body <b>12</b> is tapered to form a guide <b>13</b> for the locking pin <b>7</b> to facilitate inserting the pin into the apertures <b>5</b> of the flanges <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0176">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, the pair of spacers <b>8</b> of the securing means <b>6</b> is shown. Each spacer <b>8</b> is in the form of a cylindrical sleeve <b>14</b> having a through bore <b>15</b> for mounting the spacer <b>8</b> onto the shaft <b>12</b> of the locking pin <b>7</b>. The cylindrical sleeve <b>14</b> has a first plate <b>16</b> for distributing the securing force of the securing means <b>6</b> applied to the respective flange <b>4</b> to which it is secured. The spacer <b>8</b> also includes a second stop plate <b>16</b>&#x2032; at the opposite end of the sleeve <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0177">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, each stop plate <b>16</b>&#x2032; has a central groove or channel formed with a predetermined depth. Each groove or channel <b>17</b> has a width sufficient to enable the head <b>10</b> of the locking pin <b>7</b> to be at least partially received therein, when the second plate or disc <b>16</b> is arranged to face towards and be aligned with the head <b>10</b> of the locking pin <b>7</b>. Similarly, each groove or channel <b>17</b> has a width sufficient to enable the locking wedge <b>9</b> to be at least partially received therein, when the second plate or disc <b>16</b> is arranged to face towards and be aligned with the locking wedge. It will be appreciated that the provision of the central groove or channel <b>17</b> in the second plate or disc <b>16</b> advantageously enables the distance between the pair of spaces to be increased, thereby to facilitate the connection or installation of additional elements thereto (e.g. floor brackets, roof brackets and the like). Preferably, the thickness of the roof and floor brackets corresponds with the depth of the central groove or channel in the side of the washer such that only one washer (i.e. the one closest to the head of the locking pin) needs to be rotated and positioned with the head received therein, thereby to ensure the shaft of the pin can extend through the pair of adjacent flanges to a sufficient extent that the wedge can be received within the slot. In this way it is possible to use a locking pin of a single size for each location at which a securing means is required, as opposed to requiring different sized pins. This provides advantages both in terms of reducing the number of component parts required to provide a complete system and during installation as workers are not required to waste time trying to identify which size locking pin is required for a particular purpose.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0178">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, the pair of spacers <b>8</b> together define a mounting means for mounting a secondary structural member <b>20</b>. The portion of the cylindrical bodies (<b>14</b>) between the respective first and second plates defines a mounting surface <b>21</b> on which the secondary structural members <b>20</b> can be connected. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> shows a complete securing means <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0179">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>3</b></figref> the securing means <b>6</b> secures a pair of primary structural members <b>2</b> together in a side-by-side relationship such that the adjacent flanges <b>4</b> are abutting each other and the outer wall defining surfaces <b>3</b> form a generally planar outer wall surface. It can be seen that force distributing plates (<b>16</b>) abut against the respective flanges. One securing means <b>6</b> is preferably secured to the top or second most upper set of apertures <b>5</b> and a second securing means <b>6</b> is secured to the bottom second most lower set of apertures <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0180">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>-<b>12</b>A</figref>, a structural wall section of a desired length can be constructed by securing a number of primary structural members <b>2</b> together to form the wall section. The wall section of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>-<b>12</b>A</figref> includes primary structural members with cut-outs <b>22</b> for forming a window opening <b>23</b>. Additional securing means are preferably fitted to the flanges about the opening for increased structural integrity around the window opening <b>23</b>. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, secondary end panels are used to form internal corners and about a door or window opening (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref>).</p><p id="p-0182" num="0181">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>, <b>9</b> and <b>23</b></figref>, a corner system for adjoining two primary structural wall sections to form a corner of a building is shown. The primary corner member <b>24</b> is connectable between the primary structural member at the end of a first structural wall section and the primary structural member at the end of a second structural wall section. The primary corner member <b>24</b> has a first surface <b>25</b> against which the first structural wall section can be mounted and a second surface <b>26</b> against which the second structural wall section can be mounted, wherein the first structural wall section extends at a predetermined angle relative to the second structural wall section. In the illustrated embodiment, the first and second surfaces of the primary corner module <b>24</b> are arranged at 90 degrees to each other. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>23</b></figref>, the first surface <b>25</b> of the primary corner member <b>24</b> has substantially the same width as the length of the side flanges <b>4</b> of the primary structural members <b>2</b>.
