Conventional line coding used in fiber optic communications includes non-return-to-zero (NRZ), return-to-zero (RZ), and biphase, or Manchester. The binary bit stream derived from these line codes can be directly modulated onto wavelengths of light generated by the resonating frequency of a laser. Traditionally direct binary modulation based transmission offers an advantage with regard to the acceptable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the optical receiver, which is one of the reasons direct binary modulation methods are used in the Datacom Ethernet/IP, Storage Fiber-Channel/FC and Telecom SONET/SDH markets for transmission across nonmultiplexed unidirectional fiber links.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The performance of a fiber optic network can be measured by the maximum data throughput rate (or information carrying capacity) and the maximum distance between source and destination achievable (or reach). For Passive Optical Networks (PONs) in particular, additional measures of performance are the maximum number of Optical Networking Units (ONUs) and/or Optical Networking Terminals (ONTs) possible on a network and the minimum and maximum distance between the Optical Line Terminator (OLT) and an ONU/ONT. These performance metrics are constrained by, among other things, amplitude degradation and temporal distortions as a result of light traveling through an optical fiber.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Amplitude degradation is substantially a function of length or distance between two end points of an optical fiber. Temporal distortion mechanisms include intramodal (chromatic) dispersion and intermodal (modal) dispersion. Intramodal dispersion is the dominant temporal dispersion on Single-mode fiber (SMF), while intermodal dispersion is dominant on Multi-mode fiber (MMF). Both types of temporal distortions are measured as functions of frequency or rate of transmission (also referred as line rate of a communication protocol) over distance in MHz&#xb7;km. Temporal distortions are greater, hence a constraint on network performance, with increasing frequency transmission.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In general, in one aspect, the invention includes a method for processing a received optical signal in an optical communication network, the method including: determining a first set of coefficients to equalize a portion of an optical signal received over a first optical link including using a blind equalization method that does not use a known training sequence to equalize the portion of the optical signal, equalizing the portion of the optical signal using the determined coefficients, and demodulating the equalized portion of the optical signal according to an m-ary modulation format.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Aspects of the invention may include one or more of the following features.

M-ary modulation allows for increased data throughput for a given line rate due to an increase in the number of bits per symbol transmitted. Channel equalization reduces the effects of temporal distortions allowing for increased reach. Demultiplexing across multiple fibers allows lower lines rates for a given data throughput rate due to the increased aggregate data throughput from the multiplexing. Coding and error correction allows for a greater selection of qualifying optical components that can be used in the network and complements m-ary modulation and channel equalization for overall system performance improvement as measured by transmit energy per bit. These methods when combined (in part or in total) increase the data throughput and reach for fiber optic networks. For PONs in particular, these methods may increase the number of ONU/ONTs and the distance between OLT and ONU/ONT by decreasing the line rate as compared to a conventional communication system of equivalent data throughput.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a fiber optic data network.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a block diagram of a passive optical network.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a block diagram of a high-speed communication system for fiber optic networks.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a block diagram of an alternative high-speed communication system for fiber optic networks.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates a block diagram of an alternative high-speed communication system for fiber optic networks.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> illustrates a block diagram of an alternative high-speed communication system for fiber optic networks.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> illustrates a block diagram of an alternative high-speed communication system for fiber optic networks.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates a block diagram of an alternative high-speed communication system for fiber optic networks.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> illustrates an exemplary flow diagram for upstream burst mode communication processing.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref> illustrates another exemplary flow diagram for upstream burst mode communication processing.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary flow diagram for a downstream continuous mode communication equalization process.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a block diagram of a combined Physical Medium Attachment (PMA) and Physical Coding Sublayer (PCS) device according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a block diagram of a Physical Medium Dependent (PMD) device according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a block diagram of a combined PMA/PCS and PMD device called a PHY according to an embodiment of the invention.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a block diagram of an example PMA/PCS device according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is a block diagram of an example PMD device according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is a block diagram of an example PHY device according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, wherein like reference numerals designate identical or corresponding parts throughout the several views and embodiments, a high-level fiber optic data network <b>50</b> includes a first transceiver <b>100</b> in communication with a second transceiver <b>101</b> via a fiber <b>108</b>.

Other inner coding methods that are complementary to the outer code as well as inner coding methods that are designed to shape or control the relative intensity noise (RIN) of the optical transmitter to improve overall system performance may be used.

Channel equalization can include a training or convergence period in which characteristics of the channel are learned or accounted for and coefficients, filter variables, or weights are adapted before or while processing the received data. Decision-directed equalization is an equalization method in which a known training sequence is sent during the training period and the receiver/transceiver uses the knowledge of the training sequence to learn about the channel characteristics. The training sequence can be multiplexed within a PON's TC-Layer framing protocol. Blind equalization is a process during which an unknown input data sequence is recovered from the output signal of an unknown channel (i.e., current equalization data for a given channel is unknown or otherwise unavailable). Other equalization methods may be used, digital signal processing methods, or methods that improve the accuracy of processing received data signals or improve the efficiency of processing received data signals (e.g., reducing data acquisition time, reducing power consumed) by saving or storing a first set of settings generated by processing data from a first ONU/ONT and then load previously saved second set of settings previously generated by processing data from a second ONU/ONT before processing another set of data from the second ONU/ONT.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">One mode of communications used by a PON, e.g., for upstream data traffic (ONU/ONT to OLT direction), is &#x201c;burst mode&#x201d; communications. For example, upstream communications on a PON may include a link shared among multiple clients or ONUs/ONTs via time division multiplexing under control by an OLT. The upstream direction is divided into time slots; each time slot includes a defined number of bits. A given ONU/ONT is granted some number of time slots during which to transmit an upstream frame of data to an OLT. The upstream direction uses an orchestrated collection of bursts from the different ONU/ONTs, coordinated by the OLT that tries to maximize upstream traffic bandwidth efficiency by minimizing empty slots.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">A flow chart for an exemplary upstream burst mode communication equalization process is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>. To read or interpret the upstream data traffic from a client ONU/ONT, an OLT trains and/or equalizes the channel for that client ONU/ONT. Since the ONU/ONTs may be at different distances from the OLT and all do not share the same fiber, different channel characteristics result. Communication efficiencies may be obtained by determining <b>800</b> a set of equalization coefficients for a channel during a burst from a client, saving <b>801</b> the determined equalization coefficients, entering a wait period <b>802</b> (also known as a PON's silence period when no client ONU/ONTs are transmitting upstream), and loading <b>803</b> the stored equalization coefficients before a next burst from the client (during the wait period), to avoid re-training or re-equalizing on every burst communication. The OLT has prior knowledge of which ONU/ONT will be transmitting data during which time slots and can use this knowledge during the time between burst communications (during the wait period) to load <b>803</b> an appropriate set of coefficients pertaining to the particular ONU/ONT transmitting prior to receiving <b>804</b> its next upstream burst. This process continues for subsequent bursts. In one implementation, periodic (though not coincident with each communication burst) updates to the channel characteristics may be made (and stored). The OLT can save <b>801</b> coefficients that have converged or have been trained after receiving burst communications from the first ONU/ONT and load <b>803</b> a new set of coefficients during the wait period between bursts (i.e., before an incoming upstream burst from a second ONU/ONT). In another exemplary implementation, the OLT can save or store <b>801</b> coefficients or settings during the wait period <b>802</b> between burst as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>. In one implementation, in addition to or alternative to storage of coefficient data, the OLT may also save and load inner and/or outer coding states between bursts improving the efficiency of communication, similar to the equalization process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A-<b>8</b>B</figref>. Other methods that improve the accuracy and efficiency of processing burst mode data from specific ONUs/ONTs may be used following a similar process.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Another mode of communications used by a PON, e.g., for downstream data traffic (OLT to ONU/ONT direction), is &#x201c;continuous mode&#x201d; communications. In one implementation, a receiver, such as an ONU/ONT, equalizes a received data channel using either one of a blind equalization or a decision directed equalization method.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">A flow chart for an exemplary PON activation process is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. In a PON in which a decision directed method is used for training an ONU/ONT receiver, a continuous mode transmitter, such as an OLT transmitter, sends a training sequence <b>900</b> multiplexed within a PON's TC-Layer downstream frame protocol. In a PON in which a blind equalization method is used, the OLT needed not send this training sequence <b>900</b>. An ONU/ONT equalizes its received downstream channel <b>901</b> before it is able to receive and interpret PON network parameters <b>902</b>. If the OLT has not been previously informed of the existence of the ONU/ONT then the ONU/ONT awaits an upstream grant window <b>903</b> available for new ONU/ONTs to respond to the OLT with its serial number <b>904</b>. After the ONU/ONT has received an upstream grant window and processed PON system parameters, the ONU/ONT sends a training sequence <b>905</b> and then its serial number <b>904</b> to the OLT. In a PON in which blind equalization is used the ONU/ONT need not send a training sequence <b>905</b>. After the OLT has received the ONU/ONT serial number the OLT will assign and send the ONU/ONT an identification number. If the ONU/ONT does not receive an identification number <b>906</b><i>a</i>, the ONU/ONT returns to waiting for an upstream grant window for new ONU/ONTs <b>903</b>. Once the ONU/ONT receives an identification number <b>906</b><i>b</i>, the OLT performs ranging <b>907</b> to determine the distance between the OLT and ONU/ONT and then compensates for the communication timing delays. The ONU/ONT can perform updates continuously or periodically depending on the equalization method employed. After the downstream continuous mode channel and the upstream burst mode channel have been equalized, both ends of the PON transmission link are equalized and the ONU/ONT enters its normal operating state <b>908</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Link Connection Errors</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">A system has been proposed that includes demultiplexing across multiple fibers as is shown above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>6</b></figref>. In systems using demultiplexing across multiple fibers, fibers can be connected incorrectly at installation. For example, a first transceiver <b>100</b>, such as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, with fibers <b>314</b><i>a </i>and <b>314</b><i>b </i>can be connected to a second transceiver <b>101</b> with fiber <b>314</b><i>b </i>connected in place of fiber <b>314</b><i>a</i>, and fiber <b>314</b><i>a </i>connected in place of fiber <b>314</b><i>b</i>. The incorrect connection in this example may cause the first and second transceivers to not establish communications due to misalignment of bits during multiplexing of received data.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Information in a frame is used to synchronize a receiver (e.g., transceiver <b>101</b>) with the beginning of a frame (e.g., a &#x201c;frame delimiter&#x201d;). The process of discovering the beginning of a frame is called &#x201c;frame synchronization.&#x201d; In specific protocols such as G.984, the downstream frame delimiter is called Psync, the upstream frame delimiter is called Delimiter and the process of frame synchronization in the downstream is called the HUNT. In one implementation, TC-Layer/MAC <b>305</b> block performs frame synchronization. In one implementation, specific bit patterns or values for frame delimiters are used that are unique for each fiber to differentiate one fiber from another or the order of fiber connections to correctly multiplex received data. The use of unique frame delimiters allows the TC-Layer/MAC <b>305</b> block to change the alignment of received data bits during multiplexing to adjust for the order of the fiber connections, without having to physically change the connections. Management of the bit alignment in this implementation forms part of the TC-Layer/MAC's <b>305</b> block demultiplexing management responsibilities and functions.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Alternatively, the TC-Layer/MAC <b>305</b> block may assume an order for the fiber connections to determine the alignment of bits for multiplexing the received data and attempt frame synchronization. After a period of time with no frame synchronization success, the TC-Layer/MAC <b>305</b> block may assume a different order for the fiber connections and change the alignment of bits during multiplexing and attempt frame synchronization again. The process may repeat, including changing the alignment of bits to reflect other configurations during the multiplexing, and frame synchronization attempts continue until frame synchronization succeeds. In yet another alternative implementation, the TC-Layer/MAC <b>305</b> block may assume and attempt frame synchronization on all possible combinations of bit alignments in parallel, one of which will succeed in achieving frame synchronization.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a block diagram of a combined Physical Medium Attachment (PMA) and Physical Coding Sublayer (PCS) device <b>1000</b> according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention. The preferred exemplary embodiment would employ an asynchronous or synchronous interface that is represented by the TX Path <b>1001</b> and RX Path <b>1008</b> blocks. These blocks would manage the PMA/PCS interface that feed data into <b>1001</b> and get data from <b>1008</b> the TC-Layer block <b>1006</b>. The Transmission Convergence Layer (TC-Layer) <b>1006</b> block is crucial for a PON. The TC-layer is responsible to create the transport system that user traffic will exploit. The need for a TC-Layer arises in PONs because of its tree-based topology in a physical layer that must be hidden from higher layers where layer <b>2</b> bridging functions are performed. The TC-Layer could, for design performance of the embodiment, perform the additional functions of an Equalizer state machine and an outer encoder and outer decoder. The TC-Layer <b>1006</b> would send outgoing data to the Scrambler and Digital DEMUX block <b>1002</b>. The purpose of the scrambler <b>1002</b> would be to randomize the data for possible improvement of the transmission. The purpose of the Digital DEMUX <b>1002</b> would be to split into a plurality the transmitting data streams that would maintain the aggregated data rate equivalent to the input to the Digital DEMUX <b>1002</b>. As mentioned previously the envisioned embodiment would have two transmit and receive paths. The advantage in splitting transmit and receive paths is that the bit clock rates are reduced at the cost of an additional fibers. Reducing the bit clock on fiber has the effect of improving optical loss budget thereby increasing reach and/or number of clients in a point-to-multipoint PON network. Again embodiments of the invention need not split transmit and receive paths. After digital DEMUX, the two transmit paths have analogous processing blocks. In order to improve the energy per bit required to deliver the transmitting data an encoding method is employed and is represented by blocks <b>1003</b><i>a </i>&#x26; <b>1003</b><i>b</i>. If the TC-Layer <b>1006</b> employs an outer encoder/decoder then the encoding method of <b>1003</b><i>a </i>&#x26; <b>1003</b><i>b </i>would be an inner encoding method and the system would be enabling forward error correction (FEC) recovery of bit errors. To improve communications performance by enabling the transmitted signals to better withstand the effects of various channel impairments and to increase the number of bits per symbol transmitted by the invention, the Modulation (MOD) <b>1004</b><i>a </i>&#x26; <b>1004</b><i>b </i>is performed. Following MOD the transmitting data would be converted to an analog signal by a Digital to Analog Converter (DAC) <b>1005</b><i>a </i>and <b>1005</b><i>b </i>that would include ability to shape the signal for improved transmission performance. On the path of reception of data, the data would be received as an analog signal therefore an Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) <b>1012</b><i>a </i>&#x26; <b>1012</b><i>b </i>would be needed. To aid the ADC, a Clock Recovery (CR) <b>1013</b> device is needed that is capable of recovering the clock of m-ary data. A second CR is not needed because a Digital Delay Loop (DDL) <b>1014</b> can be used to aid the other ADC <b>1012</b><i>b</i>. Note that a PON system is assumed to have a closed clock loop where the OLTs transmit clock is used to synchronize the entire PON system, which implies that PON client's recovered receive clock is used for the upstream transmit transmission. Following the ADCs <b>1012</b><i>a </i>&#x26; <b>1012</b><i>b</i>, the received data is processed through an Equalization method <b>1011</b><i>a </i>&#x26; <b>1011</b><i>b </i>to remove unwanted noise added by various channel impairments. After equalization the received data would be sent into a De-Modulation/Decoder <b>1010</b><i>a </i>&#x26; <b>1010</b><i>b </i>block to demodulate and decode the received data. Next, the received data is descrambled and MUXed back together before being feed into the TC-Layer <b>1006</b> by the De-Scrambler and Digital MUX <b>1009</b> block.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a block diagram of a Physical Medium Dependent (PMD) device according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention.

Therefore a 1.25 GHz 5-bit DAC <b>1305</b><i>a </i>&#x26; <b>1305</b><i>b </i>with a corresponding 1.25G 6-bit ADC <b>1312</b><i>a </i>&#x26; <b>1312</b><i>b </i>are needed. The CR <b>1313</b> and DDL <b>1314</b> would be designed appropriately to handle the 1.25G Symbol/sec rates. Similarly, if the IOG user data rate PON were to be enabled via 12.5G 88/108 XAUI interface, a 12.5 Gbit/sec implementation would translate into a 1.56G symbol/sec modulation rate. The equalization method selected is a Decision Feedback Equalization <b>1311</b><i>a </i>&#x26; <b>1311</b><i>b </i>or possibly a blind equalization method. De-modulation and Viterbi decoding <b>1310</b><i>a </i>&#x26; <b>1310</b><i>b </i>are selected to complement the example design decisions already made.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is a block diagram of an example PMD device according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention.
