In the scope of these therapies, depending on the clinical picture, often a plurality of drugs and optionally parenteral feeding must be administered. Thus, there is a need of modular infusion devices adapted to be easily equipped with a plurality of fluid pumps/infusion pumps. For this purpose it is common to arrange the infusion pumps (but also syringe pumps) as a group during use in or at or by means of a supporting or holding device so as to ensure an intended operation and an intended use of the pumps.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The fluid pumps usually comprise a carrying handle for transport and for improving their handling. Thus, for instance, EP 2 700 424 A1 illustrates an infusion pump with a handlebar or carrying handle which is fastened immovably to a housing of the infusion pump.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Further, CN 1 02 266 599 A1 discloses an infusion pump having a pivotable carrying handle hinged thereto at the middle of its upper side. In a swiveled-in/folded-in position the carrying handle is received in a recess.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Moreover, also CN 2 03 634 569 U illustrates a further medical fluid pump with a pump housing and a carrying handle pivotably hinged thereto. The known fluid pumps, however, tend to tilt when they are carried by the carrying handle in a swiveled-out/folded-out position.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Objects and aims of the invention are to remedy or at least mitigate the disadvantages of the state of the art and to provide in particular a medical fluid pump with a carrying handle which guarantees a horizontal orientation of the fluid pump when the fluid pump is carried by the carrying handle. A horizontal orientation of the fluid pump means that the fluid pump does not tilt even after being lifted by the carrying handle.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with the disclosure the medical fluid pump is configured/adapted such that the carrying handle is hinged to the housing such that a handle portion/handle region of the carrying handle lies, in a swiveled-out state, in the direction of gravity (substantially) over a center of gravity of the fluid pump.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Thus, it may be ensured that the fluid pump does not tilt or does only tilt slightly/negligibly when lifted by the gripping handle.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In accordance with the disclosure, the medical fluid pump may be designed as an infusion/peristaltic pump or as a perfusion/syringe pump.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a preferred design, the carrying handle may, in the swiveled-out state, be arranged substantially perpendicular to a lid or top face of the housing, and, in a swiveled-in state, be oriented substantially parallel to the lid face. Thus, good gripping ability of the handle portion in the swiveled-out state and a space-saving accommodation of the handle portion at the fluid pump in the swiveled-in state may be guaranteed.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a particularly preferred manner the carrying handle may be hinged to a housing upper shell of the pump housing. This means that the pump housing preferably comprises at least a housing lower part and a housing upper shell, wherein the carrying handle is hinged to the housing upper shell.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Moreover, it is of advantage if the carrying handle, in the swiveled-in state, projects/protrudes at least partially over a rear side/rear face of the housing. Thus, the carrying handle is easier to grip in the swiveled-in state since&#x2014;if at all&#x2014;merely a part of the handle portion is covered by the housing.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In accordance with an advantageous further development the medical fluid pump may further comprise a spring element whose spring force/prestressing force counteracts a weight of the carrying handle so as to push the carrying handle to the swiveled-out state, which facilitates the swiveling-out/folding-out of the carrying handle since a user only has to overcome a part of the weight of the carrying handle. In other words, the user is supported by the spring element when folding out the carrying handle.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Furthermore, it may be expedient if the carrying handle comprises first locking means which, preferably by outputting an acoustic signal, especially a clicking noise, interlocks with second locking means arranged at the housing. The first locking means may interlock with the second locking means in the swiveled-in state and the swiveled-out state. Moreover, it is also of particular advantage if the first locking means is a spring-loaded disk with two grooves formed thereon, in which a rib arranged at the housing engages as a second locking means. The locking means ensure that the carrying handle is kept in the desired position, i.e., in the swiveled-in or the swiveled-out state. By the output of an acoustic signal the user moreover obtains feedback as to whether and/or when the carrying handle is swiveled-out and/or swiveled-in completely.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In accordance with a further advantageous design the carrying handle may comprise at least one damping element, preferably in the form of a plastic element received in a blind hole of the carrying handle, which rests on the housing in the swiveled-in state. Thus, it may be prevented that the carrying handle hits the pump housing during swiveling-in/folding-in.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Moreover, the fluid pump in accordance with the disclosure may, in a preferred further development, comprise a coupling structure for connecting the medical fluid pump with a further medical fluid pump. Moreover, it may be of advantage if the carrying handle of the medical fluid pump is adapted to carry a plurality of, especially three, medical fluid pumps connected with each other.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Furthermore, the disclosure relates to a supporting or holding device for the (position-safe) holding of at least one medical fluid pump in accordance with the disclosure during operation thereof, with a preferably columnar basic or main body, from the one side face of which a plurality of trays project which are each adapted to hold a pump in an operating position, wherein a carrying handle receiving recess or concavity receiving a carrying handle of the respective fluid pump is formed in the basic body for each tray.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Moreover, the disclosure relates to a supporting or holding system comprising<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0020">at least one medical fluid pump in accordance with the disclosure, and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0021">a supporting or holding device in accordance with the disclosure with at least one tray provided to hold the fluid pump in an operating position.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0022">In the following, the disclosure will be explained by means of a preferred embodiment with the aid of Figures, of which:</p><p id="p-0022" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of a supporting or holding system in accordance with the disclosure according to a preferred embodiment;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective view of a medical fluid pump in accordance with the disclosure according to the preferred embodiment;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is perspective partial view of a group of a plurality of medical fluid pumps in accordance with the preferred embodiment;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a perspective partial view of the medical fluid pump in accordance with the disclosure according to the preferred embodiment;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a rear view of the medical fluid pump in accordance with the disclosure according to the preferred embodiment;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a side view of the medical fluid pump in accordance with the disclosure according to the preferred embodiment;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a partial sectional view of a carrying handle hinge mechanism of the medical fluid pump in accordance with the disclosure according to the preferred embodiment;</p><p id="p-0029" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a perspective partial view of a catching means of a carrying handle of the medical fluid pump in accordance with the disclosure according to the preferred embodiment;</p><p id="p-0030" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a perspective partial view of a catching means of a pump housing of the medical fluid pump in accordance with the disclosure according to the preferred embodiment;</p><p id="p-0031" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a perspective partial view of the supporting or holding system in accordance with the disclosure according to the preferred embodiment; and</p><p id="p-0032" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a perspective partial sectional view of the supporting or holding system in accordance with the disclosure according to the preferred embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0033" num="0034">The Figures are of schematic nature and serve merely for the understanding of the disclosure.

As is shown by way of example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, every two infusion pumps/peristaltic pumps/tube pumps <b>4</b> and two perfusion pumps/syringe pumps <b>5</b> are arranged in the rack <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0036">The rack has a basic body <b>6</b> extending in a vertical and/or column longitudinal direction, at which the fluid pumps <b>3</b> are arranged one above the other. The fluid pumps <b>3</b> are arranged such that rear sides of the fluid pump <b>3</b> abut on a front side of the basic body <b>6</b> and/or are positioned at a small distance thereto. As explained in detail in the following, four trays <b>7</b> for receiving a respective fluid pump <b>3</b> project from the basic body <b>6</b> at the front side of the basic body <b>6</b>. The trays <b>7</b> are designed as substantially rectangular plates. Furthermore, the rack <b>2</b> comprises, at a front face of the basic body <b>6</b>, a cover <b>8</b>. The rack side to which the cover <b>8</b> is fastened is the top side of the rack <b>2</b>. The cover <b>8</b> is connectable to the basic body <b>6</b> and comprises an output unit <b>9</b> for the output of acoustic and visual alarm signals. Moreover, the rack <b>2</b> has a carrying handle <b>10</b> fastened to a rear side of the basic body <b>6</b> which faces away from the trays <b>7</b>. By means of the carrying handle <b>10</b> the supporting or holding system <b>1</b>, i.e. the rack <b>2</b> along with the fluid pumps arranged therein, may be carried.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0037">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> the medical fluid pump <b>3</b> in accordance with the preferred embodiment is shown. The medical fluid pump <b>3</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is designed as an infusion pump <b>4</b>. It is to be understood that the medical fluid pump <b>3</b> in accordance with the disclosure may also be designed as a syringe pump <b>5</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the fluid pump <b>3</b> comprises a substantially cuboid pump housing <b>11</b> to the front side of which, i.e., in the installed state to the side facing away from the rack <b>2</b>, a front lid <b>12</b> is pivotably hinged. A plurality of operating keys <b>13</b>, a plurality of signal lights <b>14</b>, and a touch display <b>15</b> are arranged on a front side of the front lid <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0038">The pump housing <b>11</b> further comprises a housing upper shell <b>16</b> and a housing lower part/housing lower shell <b>17</b> which are preferably adapted to be detachably connected with each other and thus form the pump housing <b>11</b>. A carrying handle <b>18</b> formed as a U-shaped handle bracket is pivotably hinged to the housing upper shell <b>16</b>. The carrying handle <b>18</b> encompasses the housing upper shell <b>16</b> in a width direction of the fluid pump <b>3</b> and/or a front lid longitudinal direction, so that the carrying handle <b>18</b> is hinged to both side faces of the housing upper shell <b>16</b> and/or the pump housing <b>11</b>. In other words, the carrying handle <b>18</b> has two fastening struts <b>19</b> hinged to the side faces of the housing upper shell <b>16</b> and a handle portion/handle region <b>20</b> formed there between.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0039">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, in accordance with the preferred embodiment three medical fluid pumps <b>3</b> may be stacked one upon the other, be connected/coupled with each other directly (i.e. without the use of a rack), and then be carried with the carrying handle <b>18</b> of the uppermost fluid pump <b>3</b>. This means that the carrying handle <b>18</b> of the/each medical fluid pump <b>3</b> is adapted and dimensioned to carry a (direct) group of three fluid pumps <b>3</b> coupled with one another. In order to couple the fluid pump <b>3</b> with a further fluid pump <b>3</b>, the fluid pump <b>3</b> comprises a coupling structure in the form of a skid-rail-system. For this purpose, the/each fluid pump <b>3</b> has on its upper side/lid face, i.e. at the housing upper shell <b>16</b>, rails extending on both sides in the depth direction. At the lower side and/or at the housing lower shell <b>17</b> the fluid pump <b>3</b> furthermore comprises skids <b>22</b> extending on both sides in the depth direction. If, now, the fluid pump <b>3</b> is to be coupled with a further fluid pump <b>3</b>, the skids <b>22</b> of the one fluid pump <b>3</b> engage in the rails <b>21</b> of the further fluid pump <b>3</b> and are guided in them. Now, the two fluid pumps <b>3</b> are shifted against each other in the depth direction until a locking mechanism (not illustrated in detail here) interlocks and/or fixes the two fluid pumps <b>3</b> with/to each other.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0040">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the fluid pump <b>3</b> in accordance with the preferred embodiment is illustrated with a swiveled-out/folded-out carrying handle <b>18</b>. In the swiveled-out state the carrying handle <b>18</b>, i.e. the fastening struts <b>19</b>, is positioned substantially perpendicular to the lid face of the housing upper shell <b>16</b>. As may be recognized in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, the carrying handle <b>18</b> extends in the folded-in state substantially parallel to the lid face. A swivel axis A of the carrying handle <b>18</b>, i.e. the axis extending through the two pivot points of the fastening struts <b>19</b>, is arranged in the height direction of the pump housing <b>11</b> in an upper end portion of the housing upper shell <b>16</b>, so that the carrying handle <b>18</b> does not project over the pump housing <b>11</b> in the height direction in the folded-in state. Moreover, the swivel axis A of the carrying handle <b>18</b> is arranged in the depth direction of the pump housing <b>11</b> such that the carrying handle <b>18</b> projects over a rear side of the pump housing <b>11</b> in the folded-in state (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>). Thus, it is easier to grip the carrying handle <b>18</b> in the folded-in state and to fold it out. This means that the handle portion <b>20</b> of the carrying handle <b>18</b> is, in the folded-in state, only covered partially by the pump housing <b>11</b> in a view from the bottom on the pump housing <b>11</b>, so that a partial region of the handle portion <b>20</b> remains permanently grippable. Moreover, the swivel axis A of the carrying handle <b>18</b> is, as explained in detail in the following, arranged at the pump housing <b>11</b>, i.e., the carrying handle <b>18</b> is hinged to the housing upper shell <b>16</b>, such that the handle portion <b>20</b> of the carrying handle <b>18</b> lies, in the folded-out state, in a direction of gravity (substantially) over the center of gravity of the fluid pump <b>3</b> and tilting of the fluid pump <b>3</b> may be prevented and/or tilting is negligibly slight.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0041">As is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, damping elements <b>23</b> are arranged at an underside/bottom side of the carrying handle <b>18</b>, i.e., at a side opposing the pump housing <b>11</b> in the height direction in the folded-in state. These damping elements are, in the preferred embodiment, designed as plastic elements and are received in appropriate blind holes <b>24</b> (covered by the damping elements <b>23</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) in the carrying handle <b>18</b>. In the folded-in state the damping elements <b>23</b> are in contact with the pump housing <b>11</b>, i.e., the carrying handle <b>18</b> rests on the pump housing <b>11</b> in the folded-in state via the damping elements <b>23</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a partial view of a sectional representation of the medical fluid pump <b>3</b>, wherein the intersecting plane is spanned through the vertical axis and the swivel axis A. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates a hinge mechanism by which the carrying handle <b>18</b> is fixed to the pump housing <b>11</b> in one of the two pivot points. For this purpose, the carrying handle <b>18</b> comprises a fastening pin <b>26</b> projecting from an inner side of the fastening strut <b>19</b> and passing through a through-hole <b>25</b> in the pump housing <b>11</b>. This means that the fastening pin <b>26</b> passes through the through-hole <b>25</b> to an inner side of the pump housing <b>11</b>. At the inner side of the pump housing <b>11</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, a groove disk <b>27</b> and a spring element <b>28</b> are arranged and supported on the fastening pin <b>26</b>.

Moreover, a counter plate <b>29</b> is screwed with the fastening pin <b>26</b> such that the spring element <b>28</b> biases the groove disk <b>27</b> against and/or pushes it away from the counter plate <b>29</b>. In other words, in an axial direction of the fastening pin <b>26</b>, the groove disk <b>27</b>, the spring element <b>28</b>, and the counter plate <b>29</b> are arranged on or at the fastening pin <b>26</b> in this order.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0043">Furthermore, as may be recognized in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, a rib <b>30</b> is formed in the region of the through-hole <b>25</b> at the pump housing <b>11</b> on the inner side of the pump housing <b>11</b>.

At the groove disk, in turn, a first groove <b>31</b> and a second groove <b>32</b> are formed, wherein the first groove <b>31</b> and the second groove <b>32</b> are oriented at a defined angle to each other. In the preferred embodiment this angle is approx. 90&#xb0;, i.e., the first groove <b>31</b> and the second groove <b>32</b> are substantially orthogonal/perpendicular to each other.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0044">When the carrying handle <b>18</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, is in the folded-in state, the spring element <b>28</b> presses the groove disk <b>27</b> against the pump housing <b>11</b> such that the first groove <b>31</b> encompasses the rib <b>30</b>. In other words, the groove disk <b>27</b>, especially the first groove <b>31</b> of the groove disk <b>27</b>, interlocks in the folded-in state of the carrying handle <b>18</b> with the rib <b>30</b> of the pump housing <b>11</b> such that the carrying handle <b>18</b> is thereby fixed to the pump housing <b>11</b>. If, now, the carrying handle <b>18</b> is swiveled from the folded-in state to the folded-out state, an additional force has to be exerted first of all so as to release the locking between the first groove <b>31</b> and the rib <b>30</b>. After the releasing of the locking, the fastening pin <b>26</b> and hence, as mentioned before, the groove disk <b>27</b> rotates relative to the pump housing <b>11</b> until the rib <b>30</b> finally locks with the second groove <b>32</b> of the groove disk <b>27</b>. This means, the carrying handle <b>18</b> is held in the folded-out state by the locking between the rib <b>30</b> and the second groove <b>32</b>. The second groove <b>32</b> is oriented at the groove disk <b>27</b> such that the handle portion <b>20</b> of the carrying handle is, in the folded-out state, arranged in a gravity direction above/over the center of gravity of the fluid pump <b>3</b>, so that tilting of the fluid pump <b>3</b> during lifting of the fluid pump <b>3</b> by the carrying handle <b>18</b> can be prevented.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0045">In the preferred embodiment the groove disk <b>27</b> thus serves as a first locking means of the carrying handle <b>18</b> and the rib <b>30</b> as a second locking means of the pump housing <b>11</b>. When the groove disk <b>27</b>, as explained before, locks with the rib <b>30</b>, i.e., when the rib <b>30</b> engages in the first groove <b>31</b> and/or in the second groove <b>32</b>, the fluid pump <b>3</b> outputs an acoustic signal in the form of a clicking noise, which indicates and/or ensures a proper locking of the carrying handle <b>18</b> to the user.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0046">As explained before, the spring element <b>28</b> biases the groove disk <b>27</b> against the counter plate <b>29</b> so as to press the groove disk <b>27</b> against the pump housing <b>11</b>. Additionally, however, the spring element <b>28</b> may also fulfil the function of a torsion spring so as to support the user when swiveling the carrying handle <b>18</b> from the folded-in state to the folded-out state. In other words, the spring element <b>8</b> is designed as a pressure and torsion spring, wherein the spring force amount of the torsion spring counteracts gravity and thus pushes the carrying handle <b>18</b> to the folded-out state. Thus, the handling of the carrying handle <b>18</b> can be improved substantially.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0047">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> and <b>11</b></figref> the supporting or holding system <b>1</b> is illustrated, wherein only one fluid pump <b>3</b> is arranged here at the supporting or holding device <b>2</b>. At the front side of the basic body <b>6</b>, a recess/set-off/concavity <b>33</b> is formed for each tray <b>7</b>, which extends over the entire width of the basic body <b>6</b>. As can be recognized especially in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the recess <b>33</b> is designed such that the carrying handle <b>18</b>, when the fluid pump <b>3</b> is firmly arranged at the supporting or holding device <b>2</b>, engages in the recess <b>33</b> and/or gets to rest therein. This means that the carrying handle <b>18</b> is received in the recess <b>33</b>. Thus, the distance between the fluid pump <b>3</b> and the basic body <b>6</b> may be reduced in the coupled state although the carrying handle <b>18</b>, as mentioned before, projects over the rear side of the fluid pump <b>3</b> for better handling.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0048">The present disclosure has been explained above by means of a fluid pump <b>3</b> designed as an infusion pump <b>4</b>.
