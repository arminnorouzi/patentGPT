id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to compositions and methods for treating and preventing disorders caused by the uptake of allergens to a human or mammal body.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">During the sensitization phase of allergies, professional antigen-presenting cells phagocytose antigens (with regard to allergies referred to as allergens) and cross-present processed antigens to T<sub>H</sub>2 lymphocytes. These cells respond to allergen-encounter by release of interleukin 4 and interact with B lymphocytes. Activated B cells, together with IL-4, produce type E immunoglobulins (IgE) directed against the allergen. Secreted IgE is bound by IgE-specific receptors present on, e.g., mast cells. These immune cells are thereby sensitized to the allergen. Re-exposure results in binding of the allergen to IgE-coated immune cells, which, after receptor crosslinking, causes activation of sensitized cells. Activated mast cells respond by vast release of immune mediators, such as histamine, cytokines, and pro-inflammatory lipid species, from intracellular granules. Released mediators have pleiotropic effects, including vasodilation, mucus secretion, and nerve stimulation, which result in itchiness and redness. These symptoms might be local or systemic.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Mast cells predominantly reside in tissues repeatedly confronted with pathogenic stimuli, such as the skin, the airways, and the gastrointestinal tract. Commonly, mast cells are activated by immunologic signals, such as Fc&#x3b3; receptors crosslinked by antigen/IgE complexes, proteins of the complement system, or toll-like receptor agonists. Mast cells respond to activation with the vast release of immune mediators. Mast cells are best known for their role in IgE-dependent allergic reactions and targeting mast cell function, such as degranulation, might help alleviating most painful symptoms associated with allergic reactions.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is an object of the present invention to provide methods and means to prevent or treat allergic reactions caused by allergens administered to a human or mammal body.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention relates to a composition comprising a supernatant of a peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cell culture for use in the treatment or prevention of an allergy or an allergic reaction caused by the administration of at least one food and/or inhalation allergen or by the systemic administration of at least one drug to a human or mammal body, wherein the PBMCs are subjected to ionizing radiation before or during cultivation.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It turned surprisingly out that a supernatant of a PBMC culture can be used to treat or prevent allergies and allergic reactions caused by food or inhalation allergens which are administered to a human or mammal. Furthermore, the composition of the present invention can also be used to treat or prevent allergies or allergic reactions caused by the systemic administration of at least one allergen.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">For a long time, stem cell-based therapies have been considered a promising tool for regeneration of various injured tissues and organs. Ever since, numerous works have challenged this concept by reporting that secreted factors, rather than the cells themselves, exerted the observed regenerative effect. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) represent, in contrast to stem cells, an attractive and easily accessible source for cellular secretomes with versatile features. Though immunomodulatory effects have been attributed to the secretome of preferably &#x3b3;-irradiated PBMC (Aposec), it is surprising that supernatants of PBMC cultures show beneficial effects with regard to allergic reactions and allergy, in particular when the triggering allergens.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A further aspect of the present invention relates to a method for treating or preventing an allergy or an allergic reaction caused by an uptake of at least one allergen to a human or mammal body comprising the step of administering a composition as defined herein.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another aspect of the present invention relates to a method for determining the suitability of a composition as defined herein to be used in the treatment or prevention of a an allergy or allergic reactions caused the administration of at least one food and/or inhalation allergen or by the systemic administration of at least one drug to a human or mammal body comprising the steps of<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0010">a) contacting at least two skin regions on a mammal with an allergen,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0011">b) administering a composition as defined in any one of claims <b>1</b> to <b>17</b> to at least one of said skin regions, wherein at least one of said skin regions is not treated with said composition,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0012">c) comparing the skin regions contacted with the allergen with the skin regions contacted with the allergen and said composition,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0013">d) identifying a difference between said regions and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0014">e) determining whether the composition is suited to treat or prevent said disorder or disease.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows that MNCaposec prevents compound 48/80- and IgE/anti-IgE-induced mediator release by primary human mast cells.

The so obtained conditioned culture media can be used in the treatment and/or prevention of various diseases and disorders. For instance, WO 2010/070105 and WO 2010/079086 disclose conditioned culture media (&#x201c;supernatants&#x201d;) which are obtained by cultivation of PBMCs and which can be used in the treatment of various inflammatory conditions. Hence, &#x201c;a supernatant of a peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cell culture&#x201d;, as used herein, refers to any supernatant obtainable by cultivating PBMCs in vitro in a culture medium. After the cultivation step the cultivated PBMCs are removed from the culture medium in order to obtain the substantially cell-free, preferably completely cell-free, supernatant. The supernatant of the PBMC culture comprises next to components of the cultivation medium substances produced and secreted by the PBMCs and/or even lysed PBMCs. &#x201c;Supernatant&#x201d; can be used interchangeable with conditioned culture medium obtainable by cultivating PBMCs.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0019">The supernatant of the present invention is obtainable by cultivating PBMCs, which are subjected to ionizing radiation before or during cultivation. The ionizing radiation is preferably gamma radiation.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0020">&#x201c;An allergy or an allergic reaction caused by the administration of at least one food and/or inhalation allergen or by the systemic administration of at least one drug to a human or mammal body&#x201d;, as used herein, refers to any adverse reaction caused by the administration of a food and/or inhalation allergen into a human or mammal body. Food allergens are usually administered orally to a human or mammal body. Inhalative allergens are typically administered by inhalation through the nose or mouth into the lung and the airways. Some drugs used to treat human and mammal bodies can cause allergic reactions once administered systemically to such bodies. Such drugs can be administered orally, by inhalation, parenterally or any other route of administration to human or mammal bodies resulting in a systemic distribution of the drug within such bodies. Parenteral administration of a drug may include intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous and other routes of administration. Topical administration of a drug allergen or any other allergen on the skin does not result in a systemic spread and hence systemic administration to a human or mammal body.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0021">Allergens causing allergy or allergic reactions when administered to a human or mammal body include food allergens, drug allergens, inhalation allergens (e.g. pollen, chemical substances) and all kind of allergens which are administered/introduced into a human or mammal body. Hence, typical allergic reactions caused by the administration of allergens to a human or mammal body include, among others, runny nose, trouble breathing, nausea, diarrhea, nosebleeds, ear problems, wheezing, coughing or even anaphylaxis, when the allergen is introduced, for instance, into the blood stream.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0022">&#x201c;Allergen&#x201d;, as used herein, refers to an antigen that is capable of stimulating a hypersensitivity reaction in a human and/or mammal body through immunoglobulin E (IgE) responses typically resulting in an excessive release of histamine from mast cells. The term &#x201c;allergen&#x201d; includes&#x2014;if the allergen is of biological origin and is a protein or polypeptide&#x2014;also fragments of such naturally occurring allergens when these fragments exhibit similar effects as the naturally occurring allergen in regard to the release of histamine within a human or mammal body.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0023">The terms &#x201c;preventing&#x201d; and &#x201c;prevention&#x201d;, as used herein, refer to the prevention or inhibition of the recurrence, onset and development of an allergy or a symptom thereof in a human and mammal body resulting from the administration of the supernatant according to the present invention. In some embodiments &#x201c;preventing&#x201d; and &#x201c;prevention&#x201d; refers to the reduction of the risk to develop an allergy against specific allergens. The term &#x201c;preventing&#x201d; covers measures not only to prevent the occurrence of an allergy, but also to arrest its progress and reduce its consequences once established.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0024">The terms &#x201c;treatment&#x201d; and &#x201c;treating&#x201d;, as used herein, refer to the reduction or inhibition of the progression and duration of an allergy, the reduction or amelioration of the severity of the allergy and the amelioration of one or more symptoms thereof. &#x201c;Treatment&#x201d; encompasses also the improvement and/or reversal of the symptoms of an allergy or allergic reactions. The term &#x201c;treatment&#x201d; refers to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic measures. For example, those who may benefit from treatment with compositions and methods of the present invention include those already with an allergy as well as those in which the allergy is to be prevented.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0025">According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention the at least one allergen is a biological or chemical allergen.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0026">Biological allergens include allergens derived from a biological system like plants, animals (e.g. insects, arachnids) or microbes (e.g. moulds, bacteria).
