Once retinal detachment lesions reaches the macula, it may directly affect the patient's vision and even cause blindness. At present, the conventional methods for clinical treatment of retinal detachment are scleral buckling surgery and vitrectomy. For a fresh, single hole with a well-defined position, scleral buckling may be selected. During the surgery, the position of the hole is accurately positioned, and a silicone pad is fixed with a encircling band on the eyeball wall to press inward and seal the hole, thereby achieving a therapeutic effect. This method cause relatively less damage to the eyeball. For a patient with a plurality of holes in different body parts at the same time, the treatment from the inside with vitrectomy is required to close the plurality of holes. However, the vitrectomy is very harmful to the inside of the eyeball, and the eyeball needs to be filled with media after surgery until it heals. Besides, these two methods are different choices corresponding to the severity of the patient's condition. If the scleral buckling surgery fails to cure the patient successfully, the vitrectomy may be an option to cure the patient, but the surgery result of vitrectomy is not capable of being reversed.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the prior art, a patent with an publication number US 2010305694 A1 describes a scleral encircling band, the design of which focuses on solving the problem of suturing a plurality of body parts during the surgery, but the treatment idea does not break through the concept of encircling band, but the surgical method is more optimized, such that the defects of encircling band surgery is not solved. A patent with a publication US 2018185288 A1 describes a substance and a device for injecting the substance into the vitreous cavity of eyeball. The substance can slow down the flow rate of the fluid in the vitreous cavity, increase the viscosity of the fluid, and cause the effusion to be automatically absorbed, so that the effect of treatment is achieved. However, the parts where the substance acts is not targeted, the substance acts on the metabolic balance in the vitreous cavity, and the surgical method involves the intraocular vitreous body. Therefore, all interventions on the natural vitreous body of the human eye by surgery are irreversible, and this surgical method may cause great damage to the vitreous body of the patient.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, it is necessary to provide a foldable pressing balloon structure that reduces the incision during the surgery, does not stretch the extraocular muscles, and does not cause discomfort to the patient after surgery, and has simple operation, low difficulty, and short surgery time.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A foldable pressing balloon structure includes a balloon body configured to be provided in a fascia bulbi of an eyeball and a self-sealing drainage component. The balloon body has a balloon cavity configured to be filled with normal saline or air. The balloon body has a first surface having flat shape and a second surface having a curved shape. A height of the balloon body along the first surface is in a range from 0.2 cm to 2.0 cm. The drainage component is connected to the second surface of the balloon body and in communication with the balloon cavity.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In an embodiment, one of surfaces of the drainage component is flush with the first surface.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In an embodiment, the drainage component includes a drainage tube and a drainage valve, and the drainage valve is connected to the balloon body and in communication with the balloon cavity through the drainage tube.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In an embodiment, an outer surface of the drainage valve has a curved shape.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In an embodiment, the drainage valve has a columnar structure, and a radial dimension of the drainage valve is decreased gradually from an end of the drainage valve connected to the drainage tube to the opposite end of the drainage valve.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In an embodiment, a maximum radial dimension of the drainage valve is in a range from 0.1 cm to 1.0 cm, and a minimum radial dimension is in a range from 0.1 cm to 1.0 cm.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In an embodiment, a diameter of the drainage tube is smaller than the minimum radial dimension of the drainage valve.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In an embodiment, the foldable pressing balloon structure further includes a fixing body, the fixing body is connected to the second surface of the balloon body, and a tail end of the fixing body facing outward has a rounded shape.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In an embodiment, the number of the fixing bodies is at least two.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In an embodiment, at least a pair of the fixing bodies are arranged in opposite positions.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The foldable pressing balloon structure of the present disclosure has the following beneficial effects:</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">(1) In the foldable pressing balloon structure of the present disclosure, the balloon body has the first surface having a flat shape and the second surface having a curved shape, and the height of the balloon body along the first surface is in a range from 0.2 cm to 2.0 cm, which is more suitable for implantation under the fascia bulbi, and there is no need to be implanted into the vitreous cavity as in the conventional technique. Implanting the balloon body under the fascia bulbi of the eyeball is intended to act as a soft pressing object, so that under an external force, the detached retina is attached to the detached part, and then by cooperating with laser or condensation, the hole is sealed, thereby achieving the effect of treatment.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">(2) The filling inside the balloon cavity is different from the conventional technology. In the conventional technology, the filling material is silicone oil. A diameter of the silicone oil molecule is larger than that of the pores in the surface of the balloon, such that the silicone oil may not leak out and may be permanently stored in an eye. The filling material inside the balloon cavity of the present disclosure is normal saline or air. Diameters of the water molecule and the gas molecule are smaller than that of the pores in the surface of the balloon, such that normal saline or air may gradually leak out, and the pressing action of the balloon at the implantation position may be gradually reduced as the patient recovers after surgery. When the patient heals after the surgery, the balloon is punctured to release the filling medium inside, or the balloon is removed directly.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">(3) The drainage valve has a columnar structure, and the radial dimension of the drainage valve gradually decreases from an end of the drainage valve connected to the drainage tube to the opposite end of the drainage valve, and the drainage valve is designed as a circular truncated structure, which effectively reduces the volume of the drainage valve and is more suitable for balloon implantation under the fascia bulbi.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">(4) In the present disclosure, fixing bodies are provided on both sides of the balloon body. The function of the fixing bodies is to fix the balloon body, prevent the balloon body from being displaced, improve the stability of the foldable pressing balloon structure, and improve the treatment effect.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">(5) In the present disclosure, the balloon body is implanted under the fascia bulbi of the eyeball, and filling the medium inside the balloon body to press and seal the hole. Compared with the scleral encircling band in the conventional technology, there is no need for the encircling band fixing in the present disclosure, and it only needs to sew and fix the position of the drainage component to prevent displacement, such that the incision during the surgery is reduced, and since no encircling band fixing is required, the extraocular muscle is not stretched, and the patient has no discomfort after the surgery. In addition, the surgery time is greatly shortened due to the simple operation and reduced difficulty of the surgery. Further, since the surgery method of the foldable pressing balloon structure of the present disclosure does not involve the operation in the vitreous cavity during implantation, it does not interfere with the natural vitreous of the human body, and the original natural vitreous of the human eye of the patient is preserved.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic structural view illustrating a foldable pressing balloon according to an embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic view illustrating a drainage component of the foldable pressing balloon structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic view illustrating a mounting position of the foldable pressing balloon structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><b>10</b>: foldable pressing balloon structure; <b>100</b>: balloon body; <b>110</b>: first surface; <b>120</b>: second surface; <b>200</b>: drainage component; <b>210</b>: drainage valve; <b>220</b>: drainage tube; <b>300</b>: fixing body.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In order to facilitate the understanding of the present disclosure, the present disclosure will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the related accompanying drawings.
