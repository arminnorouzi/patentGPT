Embodiments of the invention may also be used for joining building panels in general which preferably contain a board material for instance wall panels, ceilings, furniture components and similar.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The following description of known technique, problems of known systems and objects and features of the invention will therefore, as a non-restrictive example, be aimed above all at this field of application and in particular at ceramic tiles intended to be mechanically joined to each other vertically and horizontally on all four edges.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Long and short edges are used to simplify the descriptions. The tiles may also be square.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Ceramic tiles are one of the major materials used for flooring and wall coverings. The raw materials used to form tiles comprise clay minerals, feldspar and chemical additives required for the shaping process. One common method to produce ceramic tiles uses the following production steps. The raw materials are milled into powder and mixed.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Sometimes, water is then added and the ingredients are wet milled. The water is removed using filter pressing followed by spray drying into powder form. The resulting powder is then dry pressed under a very high pressure (about 400 bars) to a tile body with a thickness of 3-10 mm. The tile body is further dried to remove remaining moisture and to stabilize the tile body to a solid homogenous material. One or several layers of glaze, which is a glass like substance, are applied on the tile body by dry or wet methods. The purpose of tile glazing is to protect the tile. The glaze is available in many different colours and designs.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Some glazes may create different textures. The tile is after glazing fired in a furnace or kiln at very high temperatures (1.300&#xb0; C.). During firing, the glaze particles melt into each other and form a wear resistant layer.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">New dry methods have been introduced recently and a tile may be formed by scattering, pressing and firing in a continuous production line with a total production time of about one hour. Large tile blanks may be formed that after firing are divided into individual tiles by for example laser cutting. This new production technology provides improved strengths, flexibility and size tolerances.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Roller screens are often used to create a decorative pattern. The contact nature of the rotary screen-printing has many disadvantages such as breakages and long set-up times.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Several tile producers have therefore recently replaced this conventional printing technology with digital ink jet printing technology that offers several advantages mainly related to production flexibility and costs</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Tiles are generally installed side by side on a surface such as a floor or wall. An adhesive compound is used as a base. After connection to the sub floor or a wall a grout is spread over and between the tiles to further bind the tiles and to fill spaces between adjacent tiles.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The major advantage of a tile-based floor is that the tiles are moister proof and they do not swell and shrink in changed humidity as other floors, for example laminate and wood floors.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Tile floors have several disadvantages compared to laminate and wood floors. One major disadvantage is that conventional tiles have significant dimensional variances in length, width and thickness. However, such production variances are decreasing continuously when new and advanced production methods based on dry forming are introduced and combined with edge trimming. Another major disadvantage is that installation of tiles is labour intensive. Ceramic tiles are very brittle and they break without significant deformation. They must be installed on rather rigid sub floors and the adhesive compound layer may break if the sub floor expands and shrinks. Rather costly and moisture stable sub floor must be used such as cement bonded particleboard and similar.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Floor elements comprising thin stone material are similar to ceramic tiles. They have similar properties and are installed in a similar way.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">There is a need for a tile or stone floor and wall system that is simple to install, that may cover large floor areas without expansion joints, that may be easy to disassemble and that may be installed on more cost efficient sub floors that have a higher moisture movement than the ceramic tiles.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DEFINITION OF SOME TERMS</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the following text, the visible surface of the installed floor or wall is called &#x201c;front side&#x201d;, while the opposite side, facing the sub floor or the wall, is called &#x201c;rear side&#x201d;. The edge between the front and rear side is called &#x201c;joint edge&#x201d;. By &#x201c;horizontal plane&#x201d; is meant a plane, which extends parallel to the outer part of the surface layer. Upper and outer parts of an edge define a &#x201c;vertical plane&#x201d; perpendicular to the horizontal plane. By &#x201c;vertical locking&#x201d; is meant locking parallel to the vertical plane. By &#x201c;horizontal locking&#x201d; is meant locking parallel to the horizontal plane.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">By &#x201c;up&#x201d; is meant towards the front side, by &#x201c;down&#x201d; towards the rear side, by &#x201c;inwardly&#x201d; mainly horizontally towards an inner and centre part of the tile and by &#x201c;outwardly&#x201d; mainly horizontally away from the centre part of the tile.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Related Art and Problems Thereof</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Laminate flooring usually comprise a wood based core, an upper decorative surface layer of laminate and lower balancing layer. A laminate surface comprises melamine-impregnated paper. The most common core material is fibreboard with high density and good stability usually called HDF&#x2014;High Density Fibreboard.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Laminate floor panels of this type are installed floating on a sub floor and joined mechanically by means of so-called mechanical locking systems. These systems comprise locking means, which lock the panels horizontally and vertically. The mechanical locking systems are usually formed by machining of the core of the panel. Alternatively, parts of the locking system may be formed of separate materials, for instance aluminium or HDF, which are integrated with the floor panel, i.e. joined with the floor panel in connection with the manufacture thereof.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The main advantages of floating floors with mechanical locking systems are that they are easy to install. They may also easily be taken up again and used once more at a different location.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">It is known that mechanical joining of long edges as well as short edges in the vertical and horizontal direction may be made I several ways. One of the most used methods is the angle-snap method. The long edges are installed by angling. The panel is then displaced in locked position along the long side. The short edges are locked by horizontal snapping. The vertical connection is generally a tongue and a groove. During the horizontal displacement, a strip with a locking element is bent and when the edges are in contact, the strip springs back and a locking element enters a locking groove and locks the panels horizontally. Such a snap connection is complicated since a hammer and a tapping block has to be used to overcome the friction between the long edges and to bend the strip during the snapping action.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Similar locking systems may also be produced with a rigid strip and they are connected with an angling-angling method where both short and long edges are angled into a locked position. Such installation method is difficult to use if the panels are large and heavy.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Recently advance so called fold down locking systems have been introduced that allow a very easy single action installation with an angling action only that locks the long and short edges. A flexible tongue attached to the short edge is used to connect the short edges with a scissor like movement when a long edge is locked with angling.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The majority of all mechanical locking systems used in laminate and wood floorings are formed by rotating diamond tools. Such forming may be made in high speed and with high precision. The locking systems comprise protruding parts such as a tongue for the vertical locking and a strip for the horizontal locking.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Protruding parts are difficult and practically impossible to form in ceramic material especially in thin ceramic tiles that comprise brittle edges. Spaces between the edges provide additional problems since a tongue must extend over a considerable distance from an edge to cover the space between the edges and to enter into a tongue groove of an adjacent edge.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Diamond tools may be used to form the tile edges. However, the production speed is a fraction of the speed that is used to form advanced joint geometries in wood and plastic based materials. Special cooling systems, generally based on water-cooling must be used to form tile and stone material.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Several attempts have been made to improve tile installations by attaching ceramic and stone tiles to a separate sheet shaped material that may be formed with a mechanical locking system comprising protruding parts such that a floating installation similar to laminate floorings may be obtained.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">U.S. Pat. No. 8,156,705 describes a tile having at least one coupling member hat cooperatively engages a coupling member of an adjacent tile, such that adjacent tiles may be reasonably secured to one another without the use of grout. The tiles are moulded into a synthetic support structure that comprises a conventional mechanical locking system.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">US 2011/0113713 describes a method for arranging a tile in a mould, and injecting a polymer into the mould. The injected material mechanically anchors the substrate to the tile. A mechanical locking and a surrounding grout gasket may also be formed.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Attaching tiles to a separate sheet material or a mould is expensive. The floor thickness increases and a moisture stable tile is difficult to combine with wood base sheet material that expands and shrinks when relative humidity varies between dry and wet conditions.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">It is known that a locking strip may be formed of a separate material such as aluminium or HDF and that such strip may be clamped in undercut grooves or attached into a horizontally extending groove formed at an edge of a laminate panel by snapping pressing and/or turning. Such systems are described in WO 94/26999 and WO 03/083234 (Valinge Innovation AB). It is also known that several strip parts spaced form each other may be attached to a long side edge in order to obtain further cost savings.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">WO 2001075247 describes a locking system for joining sheet shaped flooring elements with tight joints. The floor elements are constituted of solid wood, fibreboard or particleboard. Long edges are locked with conventional locking system comprising a protruding tongue and a protruding strip. The short edges are joined by vertical displacement and by means of a separate vertical assembly joining profile. The short edge comprises an edge geometry, which requires that substantial amounts of the edge material are removed. The locking system is not suitable to install tiles, which are spaced from each other.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">WO 03/083234 describes a locking system that comprises a strip and a tongue made of separate material. This system is not suitable to lock tiles with edges that are spaced from each other. The geometry of the locking system is very complicated to produce in ceramic material.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">As a summary it may be mentioned that known locking systems are not suitable to connect ceramic tiles having a brittle tile body since the necessary strength and flexibility of protruding portions formed in ceramic material is not sufficient and the geometry of the edges is difficult to produce with moulding or machining of ceramic material.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The above description of various known aspects is the applicant's characterization of such, and is not an admission that any of the above description is considered as prior art.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0040" num="0039">An overall objective of embodiments of the present invention is to provide an improved and more cost efficient locking system for primarily floating installation of ceramic and stone tiles which allows that the edges may be locked to each other mechanically with angling, and/or horizontal snapping and/or vertical snapping.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">A specific objective is to form a locking system that comprises a very simple joint geometry and minimum amount of separate material attached to a tile and that may be formed with smallest possible machining of the tile edges, preferably without any brittle protruding parts.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Other specific objectives are to provide tiles with an integrated grout material, improved d&#xe9;cor properties, to eliminate size tolerances and to provide panels comprising combination of ceramic material and other lighter and more cost efficient materials.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The above objects of embodiments of the invention may be achieved wholly or partly by locking systems and tiles formed according to the disclosure.

end="lead"?><heading id="h-0009" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0102" num="0101">To facilitate understanding, several locking systems in the figures are shown schematically.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">It should be emphasized that improved or different functions may be achieved using combinations of the embodiments.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">All embodiments may be used separately or in combinations. Angles, dimensions, rounded parts, spaces between surfaces etc. are only examples and may be adjusted within the basic principles of the invention.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b </i></figref>show a known locking system used in laminate and wood floors that are locked with angling. The horizontal locking is obtained by a locking strip <b>6</b> with a locking element <b>8</b> formed at one panel edge <b>1</b> that locks into a locking groove <b>14</b> formed in another adjacent panel edge <b>1</b>&#x2032;. The forming of the strip <b>6</b> creates a waste Ws as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>b </i></figref>when considerable amounts of material are removed. The locking system comprises protruding parts such as a tongue <b>10</b> and a strip <b>6</b> that are formed by machining of the panel edge.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>c </i></figref>shows a known locking system used in laminate floors comprising a separate aluminium strip <b>6</b> attached to a lower part of a panel edge. A part of the strip <b>6</b> is bent around an inwardly inclined vertically extending surface. Such connection of the strip <b>6</b> to the panel edge is made in a separate operation than the machining of the edge. The strip comprises three different cross section A-A, B-B and C-C that are used to connect the strip to the panel edge and to lock the panels horizontally. The length L of the strip is the same along the width W. The part of the strip that extends from the edge comprises a small cavity <b>23</b>, which is formed when a part of the strip body is punched and bent around a panel edge. A protruding tongue made in one piece with the core is used for the vertical connection.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>d </i></figref>shows a strip <b>6</b>, which is attached with snapping into a horizontally extending groove. This strip is formed by machining and has the same cross section along its length.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">An advanced edge profile is required to fix the strip to the edge. The locking system may also comprise a separate flexible tongue. Such locking systems suffer from several disadvantages. The material content is high due to the design and only limited material savings may be reached. The fixing of the strip to the edge is rather complicated and slow.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>a</i>-<b>2</b><i>b </i></figref>show a locking system with a separate flexible displaceable tongue <b>10</b><i>a </i>inserted in a horizontally extending displacement groove <b>9</b><i>a </i>formed on the short edge of a panel. The separate tongue is inserted in high speed and is mainly used to obtain higher flexibility when the panels are locked with a vertical snapping. The locking system may be used to connect tiles. The locking system is difficult to produce in thin ceramic tile material since the protruding strip <b>6</b> may break.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b><i>c </i>and <b>2</b><i>d </i></figref>shows locking systems comprising a separate plastic strip part <b>6</b> that may be connected to a tile edge. This locking system is also difficult to produce in ceramic and stone material since a lot of material must be removed by rotating tools. The protruding tongue <b>10</b> is brittle and may crack.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>a </i></figref>shows a known conventional panel with a strip <b>6</b> that extends along the whole long edge. Material savings may be increased if several strip parts <b>6</b> are connected on a long side of a panel as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">One of the basic principles of the invention is the understanding that simple grooves may be formed in the tile body and that such grooves may be used to connect separate materials comprising protruding parts and to form locking system allowing a strong mechanical locking in a floating manner.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b><i>a</i>-<b>4</b><i>d </i></figref>show a locking system according to one embodiment of the invention that may be connected with angling, vertical snapping and horizontal snapping. The locking system may also be unlocked with angling and sliding along the edge. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b><i>a</i>, <b>4</b><i>b </i>and <b>4</b><i>c </i></figref>are side views and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b><i>d </i>and <b>4</b><i>e </i></figref>are top views.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>a </i></figref>shows two adjacent edges <b>1</b>, <b>1</b>&#x2032; of a first <b>1</b><i>a </i>and a second <b>1</b><i>b </i>tile. Each tile <b>1</b><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>b </i>comprises a first horizontal groove <b>9</b><i>a </i>formed in the first edge <b>1</b>, a second horizontal groove <b>9</b><i>b </i>formed in the second edge <b>1</b>&#x2032;, a first vertical groove <b>14</b><i>a </i>formed in the first edge <b>1</b> and a second vertical groove <b>14</b><i>b </i>formed in the second edge <b>1</b>&#x2032; and a strip part <b>6</b> connected mechanically to the first horizontal <b>9</b><i>a </i>and vertical <b>14</b><i>a </i>grooves.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">The horizontal grooves <b>9</b><i>a</i>, <b>9</b><i>b </i>are formed in the outer vertical portion of tile edge. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>b </i></figref>show that the horizontal grooves <b>9</b><i>a</i>, <b>9</b><i>b </i>comprise a horizontal grove opening <b>17</b> at a vertical plane VP located at the upper and outer part of the tile edge, an upper lip <b>12</b> a lower lip <b>11</b>, an upper groove wall <b>18</b> a lower groove wall <b>19</b> and a groove bottom <b>20</b>. The vertically grooves <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>14</b><i>b </i>are formed at the rear side of the tile and are spaced from the outer edges. The vertical grooves <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>14</b><i>b </i>comprise a vertical groove opening pointing <b>23</b> downwards, with a first <b>24</b> and a second <b>25</b> groove wall and an inner groove wall <b>25</b> located at the upper part of the vertical grooves <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>14</b><i>b</i>. The first <b>24</b> groove wall is located closer to the vertical plane VP than the second groove wall <b>25</b>.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">The strip part <b>6</b> is according to the invention preferably used to lock the edges <b>1</b>,<b>1</b>&#x2032; horizontally inwardly and outwardly and vertically upwards and downwards. The upper edges are preferably connected to each other with a pre-determined horizontal space S.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">This is a major difference compared to conventional technology where the upper edges are locked in contact with each other and the strip part <b>6</b> is only used to preventing horizontal separation. The space S may be used to form a specific locking system with a favorable geometry and function as described below. Angling and snapping properties may be improved and the locking system may be formed with a more cost efficient geometry.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">The locking system comprises a strip part <b>6</b> having a strip body <b>7</b> and upwardly extending first <b>8</b><i>a </i>and a second <b>8</b><i>b </i>locking element at opposite and outer part of the strip body <b>7</b>. An upper part of the second locking element <b>8</b><i>b </i>comprises preferably an upper guiding surface <b>22</b> that is used to guide the locking element <b>8</b><i>b </i>into the second vertical groove <b>14</b><i>b </i>during angling, horizontal snapping and vertical locking.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">The strip body <b>7</b> comprises a first <b>10</b><i>a </i>and a second <b>10</b><i>b </i>upwardly extending flexible tongue. The tongues <b>10</b><i>a</i>, <b>10</b><i>b </i>have preferably a vertically extending flexible tongue body <b>30</b>, an upper sliding surface <b>31</b> that may be flexible and a tongue locking surface <b>32</b>.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">The tongue body <b>30</b> is preferably at least partly located in the space S formed by the adjacent edges. Such a locking system provides the advantage that no material has to be removed from the edge in order to accommodate a vertically extending tongue body <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">The space S may also be used to allow the tongue body <b>30</b> to be displaced horizontally in the space S during vertical and/or horizontal snapping.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">The strip part <b>6</b> is configured to be locked to the first edge <b>1</b> by the first tongue <b>10</b><i>a </i>that is inserted into the first horizontal groove <b>9</b><i>a </i>and by the first locking element <b>8</b><i>a </i>that is inserted into the first vertical groove <b>14</b><i>a</i>. The strip body <b>7</b> comprises preferably a fixing element <b>16</b> at an outer part that may be used in some embodiments to obtain a firm connection of the strip part <b>6</b> to the tile. The fixing element may be flexible and may lock against the second groove wall <b>25</b>.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">The locking elements <b>8</b><i>a</i>, <b>8</b><i>b </i>cooperate with the vertical grooves <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>14</b><i>b </i>and locks the edges <b>1</b>, <b>1</b>&#x2032; in a horizontal direction and prevents horizontal separation. The flexible tongues <b>10</b><i>a</i>, <b>10</b><i>b </i>cooperate with the horizontal grooves <b>9</b><i>a</i>, <b>9</b><i>b </i>and locks the edges <b>1</b>, <b>1</b>&#x2032; vertically and prevents horizontal displacement of the panel edges towards each other.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">Other parts formed on the strip body may be used to prevent such horizontal displacement of the panels towards each other.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">Tile and stone material may be formed by rotating hard metal or diamond tools. Even stationary carving, scraping or grinding tools may be used.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">Test production shows that small grooves may be formed in a cost efficient way with rotating diamond tools and that such grooves may have sufficient strength even in brittle materials such as ceramic or stone material if the material content adjacent to the groove is sufficient in relation to the groove width and depth. A joint geometry with high strengths may be obtained if the edge preferably only comprises very small parts or even more preferably no parts that extend horizontally beyond the upper edge.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">The locking system according to the invention has preferably no protruding parts such as a tongue or a strip that are formed in the tile body and that protrudes beyond the upper edge.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">Rather small grooves that extend inwardly for example 0.5-2 mm into an edge or at a rear side may be formed and such grooves may have sufficient strength even in thin and brittle ceramic and stone materials. Preferably there are no or only very small protruding parts extending beyond the upper edge, especially if such protruding parts are formed by machining of the tile edges.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">A strong edge groove with for example 2 mm debt may be formed in high speed with five rotating tools where each tool removes about 0.4 mm of material. The forming may be made when a tile is displaced in relation to rotating tools. The tile may also be connected to a stationary holder and the tools are displaced in one or several machining steps in relation to the tile edge.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">It is an advantage if no material or very small amounts of material are removed at the upper part of the edges, especially if such edges are formed with bevels or rounded parts.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">Tiles are general not completely square or rectangular and one edge may have a different length than another edge. Two edges that meet each other may not be completely perpendicular.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">Such production tolerances are generally eliminated by the spaces between the edges that are filled with grout material. It is a major advantage if the locking system is formed and configured such that the tiles are installed and aligned with a pre-determined average distance between the edges and that the distance deviations are minimized. Preferably the horizontal grooves are formed more precisely than the upper edges. This means that the depth of one or several horizontal grooves, measured as the horizontal distance from a vertical plane located at the upper and outer part of a tile edge and to the inner surface a horizontal groove, may vary along the edge. The groove depth of a horizontal groove may be at least 0.10 mm or even 0.20 mm larger at one part of the edge than at another part of the same edge. The horizontal groove at all four edges of a tile may be formed with smaller tolerances the upper edges. For example a set of tiles according to the invention may have long edges of 40.0+&#x2212;0.2 mm and short edges of 30.0+&#x2212;0.2 mm measured at the upper parts of the tile. The distance between the inner surfaces of the horizontal grooves may be 36.0+&#x2212;0.10 mm and 26.0+&#x2212;0.10 mm when 2 mm deep grooves are formed in the edge.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">The locking system according to the invention will align all tiles automatically in a pre-determined position vertically and horizontally. This allows that the space S between the tiles may be decreased compared to conventional installation. A space S of 2-3 mm may be sufficient and such a small space may be used to decrease the amount of grout material.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">The grooves are preferably formed in the tile body with rotating diamond tools in a separate production step after the production of the tile. The grooves may also be formed in two steps. The first step may be a rough forming that is formed during the tile production. The second step is the final forming with diamond tools. This two-step forming may be used to reduce the amount of material that must be removed in order to obtain a joint geometry that is needed for a high quality locking system that guides the tiles into a correct position vertically and horizontally during installation.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">New and advanced production methods to produce tiles are under development and such methods will make it possible to produce grooves with sufficient accuracy in line with the tile production. No further machining or forming may be needed to form a locking system.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">The strip part <b>6</b> may be formed from metal material, preferably from steel or aluminium.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">The strip part <b>6</b> is in this embodiment formed by punching and pressing.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>d </i></figref>shows that the flexible tongues may <b>10</b><i>a</i>, <b>10</b><i>b </i>may be spaced from each other in the length direction of the tile edge. The material, which is needed to form a tongue <b>10</b>, is obtained from the strip body. A cavity <b>59</b> is formed when the tongue is formed by punching a metal sheet. A cavity is in this embodiment formed between the first tongue <b>10</b><i>a </i>and the second locking element <b>8</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0139" num="0138"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b><i>a</i>-<b>5</b><i>e </i></figref>show a method to fix a strip part <b>6</b>, as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b><i>a</i>-<b>4</b><i>e</i></figref>, to an edge of a tile or stone material. The strip may be angled and snapped into the edge from the rear side as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>a </i></figref>whereby the flexible tongue <b>10</b><i>a </i>is bended and/or compressed. Alternatively the strip may be inserted along the edge from one of the tile corners or the tongue <b>10</b><i>a </i>may be inserted in the groove <b>9</b><i>a </i>and the locking element <b>8</b><i>a </i>may be pressed into the vertical groove <b>14</b><i>a </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref><i>d. </i></p><p id="p-0140" num="0139"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>b </i></figref>shows a connection with angling of the second edge <b>1</b>&#x2032; against the first edge <b>1</b>.

The advantage is that a strong locking system may be formed with a compact strip part and less material will be needed to form the locking system.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">A tile <b>1</b><i>a </i>with an edge <b>1</b> comprising a strip part <b>6</b> that is attached prior to installation, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>c</i></figref>, is referred to as a &#x201c;strip tile&#x201d; A tile <b>1</b><i>b </i>with an edge that is connected to the strip tile <b>1</b><i>a </i>with vertical folding or vertical displacement is referred to as a &#x201c;fold tile&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">A flexible tongue that may be used to connect the edges with a vertical displacement may have flexible protrusions in its inner or outer parts.

The locking system is preferably formed with the rear side as the reference side. High quality tiles have already sufficient thickness tolerances to allow a high quality installation with a mechanical locking system. The thickness tolerance may be improved and this allows that the space S between tiles may be decreased considerably to about 1 mm and that tiles may be formed without beveled edges. Further improvement may be obtained if filler layers <b>34</b><i>a</i>, <b>34</b><i>b </i>are applied on the rear side of the tile as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b><i>a</i></figref>, preferably after the firing in the furnace.
