In addition, an analog RoF system can support technologies such as subcarrier modulation, wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM), and polarization multiplexing, to implement co-existence and co-transmission of signals of multi-frequency bands and multi-communications standards (for example, a baseband digital signal, a Long-Term Evolution (LTE) signal, a mobile telecommunications system (, e.g., a Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS)) signal, a Wi-Fi signal, a millimeter wave signal, and the like). This feature can further improve performance of a central access network (e.g., a Cloud-Radio Access Network (C-RAN)) in terms of compatibility, quantity of access users, and throughput.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, in the RoF system, there are a large quantity of nonlinear elements on a downlink, for example, an optical-electro (O/E) conversion component, an electro-optical (E/O) conversion component, and a power amplifier (PA), causing nonlinear distortion of a downlink signal. In a conventional technology, to compensate for the nonlinear distortion on the downlink, a feedback link is generally disposed from an RRU side to a BBU side, and a downlink signal on the RRU side is fed back to the BBU through the feedback link. In addition, a predistortion module is disposed on the RRU side. The predistortion module determines a nonlinear characteristic of the downlink based on an input signal of the downlink and a feedback signal transmitted back through the feedback link, and then performs digital predistortion (DPD) on the downlink to compensate for the nonlinear distortion of the downlink.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the conventional technology, to reduce hardware complexity, the feedback signal and uplink data generally share a same transmission link. Therefore, a control circuit needs to be added on the RRU side to implement switching between the uplink data and feedback information. In addition, to implement that the feedback signal is transmitted from the remote RRU back to the BBU, new nonlinear elements such as the E/O, the O/E, and the PA need to be introduced into the feedback link. However, the introduction of the control circuit and the new components such as the E/O, the O/E, and the PA may cause additional nonlinear distortion to the RoF system. Consequently, the predistortion module cannot obtain a correct nonlinear characteristic of the downlink. Finally, the predistortion module actually performs modeling and compensation for nonlinearity of all uplinks and downlinks. Therefore, the RoF system in the conventional technology still has a poor linearization effect.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Embodiments of this application provide an RoF system and a nonlinear compensation method, to improve a linearization effect of the RoF system.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to a first aspect, an embodiment of this application provides an RoF system.

A core of this scheme is an optical dispersion model based on by an optical fiber and another optical component. Theoretical analysis shows that dispersion distortion caused when an optical signal is transmitted in an RoF system is a function of a current input to a laser source. Therefore, corresponding analog predistortion processing is performed on the current input to the laser source, and compensation for optical domain dispersion can be achieved.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">For example, it is assumed that P<sub>out</sub>(t) is output power of an optical detector (PD) of the RoF system, P<sub>in</sub>(t) is input power of radio frequency signals converging into the laser source, &#x3c4;(&#x3bb;) is a transmission delay of the optical signal and is a function related to a wavelength &#x3bb; of the optical signal, and &#x3b1; indicates attenuation of an entire RoF link.

The formula (Eq.1) shows dispersion of the RoF system. According to a power calculation formula P=I<sup>2</sup>R, the input and output power of the RoF system can be expressed as a function of an input current I of the laser source. Therefore, analog predistortion is performed on the input current I, such that compensation can be performed for distortion caused by the dispersion of the RoF system.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0071">However, in this scheme, compensation can only be performed for optical domain dispersion distortion caused by an optical component in the RoF system, and nonlinear distortion caused by the electrical component in the RoF system and nonlinear distortion caused by a memory characteristic of the component are not considered. In addition, the compensation scheme is sensitive to parameters such as a wavelength for transmitting a light wave, a length of an optical fiber, and an operating temperature of the component. Therefore, universality and robustness are relatively poor. Therefore, a linearization effect of the RoF system is still poor.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0072">Scheme 2: Digital Predistortion (DPD) Scheme</p><p id="p-0075" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of the digital predistortion scheme. In this scheme, a feedback link is disposed from an antenna on an RRU side to a BBU, such that one beam of a downlink signal of the RRU is sent out through the antenna, and the other beam of the downlink signal of the RRU is transmitted back to the BBU through the feedback link. A digital predistortion module (Digi predis) is disposed on the RRU side. The digital predistortion module may perform modeling on a nonlinear characteristic of a downlink based on an input signal of the downlink and a feedback signal transmitted back through the feedback link, and then perform digital predistortion on the downlink, to compensate for nonlinear distortion of the downlink.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0074">It can be learned from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> that, in this scheme, the feedback link needs to be established from the RRU side to the BBU side. To reduce hardware complexity, in this scheme, the feedback signal and uplink data share a same link. However, in this case, a control circuit needs to be added on the RRU side, to implement switching between an uplink signal and the feedback signal on the feedback link. In addition, new nonlinear components such as an EO/OE module, an optical fiber, and a power amplifier (PA) are introduced into the feedback link. Existence of the new nonlinear components also brings additional nonlinear distortion to the RoF system, such that a DPD operation finally performed by the predistortion module is actually modeling and compensation for nonlinearity of all uplinks and downlinks, instead of modeling and compensation only for nonlinearity of the downlink, which is actually needed. Therefore, a linearization effect of the RoF system is still poor.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0075">Scheme 3: DPD Scheme Based on a Wavelength Division Multiplexer (WDM)</p><p id="p-0078" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a linearization scheme of a WDM-based multi-wavelength RoF system. In this scheme, due to introduction of the WDM component, one optical fiber may transmit signals of different wavelengths. In this way, the system may use different wavelengths to transmit uplink, downlink, and feedback information. For example, a wavelength of 1550 nm transmits a downlink data signal, and a wavelength of 1310 nm transmits uplink data and feedback information.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0077">In this scheme, electrical domain digital compensation is also performed for nonlinearity of an entire link of the RoF system. Because nonlinear performance of the RoF link is in direct proportion to light intensity of a transmit signal, and intensity of the light intensity of the signal is directly related to intensity of a signal accessing a laser source, in this scheme, a variable attenuator is usually added to the feedback link to adjust intensity of a feedback signal. This can only reduce additional nonlinear distortion introduced by an E/O on the feedback link, but actually there is still additional distortion introduced to the feedback link (signal power attenuation and dispersion caused by a long feedback optical fiber). In addition, when a plurality of wavelengths transmit downlink data in parallel, the introduction of the WDM further causes problems such as four-wave mixing, optical domain crosstalk, and cross-modulation between a plurality of electrical domain signals, and may further introduce more nonlinearity, resulting in more complex DPD parameter learning. In addition, this scheme uses an offline DPD parameter estimation method, which still has a gap with an actual scenario-based application.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0078">To resolve the foregoing one or more technical problems, embodiments of this application provide an RoF system and a nonlinear compensation method, to improve a linearization effect of the RoF system.

Raman scattering is related to thermal vibrations of fiber molecules. Therefore, the Raman scattering is sensitive to temperature and can be used for temperature measurement. Raman scattering light includes two frequencies of light. Stokes light and anti-Stokes light. Their frequencies are distributed on two sides of an incident light frequency and the Stokes light and the anti-Stokes light travel backwards. The anti-Stokes scattering light is sensitive to temperature and intensity of the anti-Stokes scattering light is modulated by the temperature. However, the Stokes scattering light is basically irrelevant to temperature, and therefore a ratio of light intensity of the Anti-Stokes scattering light to light intensity of the Stokes scattering light is only related to temperature of the optical fiber.

Based on an amplitude-amplitude (AM-AM) conversion diagram and a phase-amplitude (PM-AM) conversion diagram obtained through actual testing by the PA, nonlinear model fitting of the PA can be implemented by adjusting the parameter values in the foregoing formulas. When operating temperature of the PA changes, the AM-AM curve and the PM-AM curve change accordingly. In this case, the parameters in the foregoing formulas need to be finely adjusted to complete model fitting again.
