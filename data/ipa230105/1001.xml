Dystrophinopathies include Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Becker muscular dystrophy, and X-linked dilated cardiomyopathy. Dystrophin (DMD) is a large gene, containing 79 exons and &#x2dc;2.6 million total base pairs. Numerous mutations in DMD, including exonic frameshift, deletion, substitution, and duplicative mutations, are able to diminish the expression of functional dystrophin, leading to dystrophinopathies. One agent that targets exon 51 of human DMD, eteplirsen, has been preliminarily approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) however its efficacy is still being evaluated.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to some aspects, the disclosure provides complexes that target muscle cells for purposes of delivering molecular payloads to those cells. In some embodiments, complexes provided herein are particularly useful for delivering molecular payloads that increase or restore expression or activity of functional DMD. In some embodiments, complexes comprise oligonucleotide based molecular payloads that promote normal expression of functional DMD through an in-frame exon skipping mechanism or suppression of stop codons. In other embodiments, complexes are configured for delivering a mini-dystrophin gene or synthetic mRNA that increases or restores functional dystrophin activity. Accordingly, in some embodiments, complexes provided herein comprise muscle-targeting agents (e.g., muscle targeting antibodies) that specifically bind to receptors on the surface of muscle cells for purposes of delivering molecular payloads to the muscle cells. In some embodiments, the complexes are taken up into the cells via a receptor mediated internalization, following which the molecular payload may be released to perform a function inside the cells. For example, complexes engineered to deliver oligonucleotides may release the oligonucleotides such that the oligonucleotides can promote expression of functional DMD (e.g., through an exon skipping mechanism) in the muscle cells. In some embodiments, the oligonucleotides are released by endosomal cleavage of covalent linkers connecting oligonucleotides and muscle-targeting agents of the complexes.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Some aspects of the disclosure comprise a complex comprising a muscle-targeting agent covalently linked to a molecular payload configured for promoting the expression or activity of a DMD, wherein the muscle-targeting agent specifically binds to an internalizing cell surface receptor on muscle cells.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some embodiments, the muscle-targeting agent is a muscle-targeting antibody. In some embodiments, a muscle-targeting antibody is an antibody that specifically binds to an extracellular epitope of a transferrin receptor (e.g., an epitope of the apical domain of the transferrin receptor). A muscle-targeting antibody may specifically binds to an epitope of a sequence in the range of C89 to F760 of SEQ ID NO: 1-3. In some embodiments, the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of binding of a muscle-targeting antibody to a transferrin receptor is in a range from 10<sup>&#x2212;11 </sup>M to 10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>M.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, a muscle-targeting antibody of a complex competes for specific binding to an epitope of a transferrin receptor with an antibody listed in Table 1 (e.g., competes for specific binding to an epitope of a transferrin receptor with an Kd of less than or equal to 10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>M, e.g., in a range of 10<sup>&#x2212;11 </sup>M to 10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>M).</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, a muscle-targeting antibody of a complex does not specifically bind to the transferrin binding site of a transferrin receptor and/or does not inhibit binding of transferrin to a transferrin receptor. In some embodiments, a muscle-targeting antibody of a complex is cross-reactive with extracellular epitopes of two or more of a human, non-human primate and rodent transferrin receptor. In some embodiments, a muscle-targeting antibody of a complex is configured to promote transferrin receptor mediated internalization of the molecular payload into a muscle cell.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A muscle-targeting antibody (e.g., muscle-targeting antibody is an antibody that specifically binds to an extracellular epitope of a transferrin receptor) is a chimeric antibody, wherein optionally the chimeric antibody is a humanized monoclonal antibody. A muscle-targeting antibody may be in the form of a ScFv, Fab fragment, Fab&#x2032; fragment, F(ab&#x2032;)2 fragment, or Fv fragment.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, a molecular payload of a complex is an oligonucleotide.

As described herein, the present disclosure provides complexes comprising muscle-targeting agents covalently linked to molecular payloads in order to overcome such challenges. In some embodiments, the complexes are particularly useful for delivering molecular payloads that modulate (e.g., promote) the expression or activity of target genes in muscle cells, e.g., in a subject having or suspected of having a rare muscle disease. For example, in some embodiments, complexes are provided for targeting DMD, e.g., a mutated DMD allele. In some embodiments, complexes provided herein may comprise oligonucleotides that promote normal expression and activity of DMD. As another example, complexes may comprise oligonucleotides that induce skipping of exon of DMD mRNA. In some embodiments, synthetic nucleic acid payloads (e.g., DNA or RNA payloads) may be used that express one or more proteins that promote normal expression and activity of DMD.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some embodiments, complexes may comprise molecular payloads of synthetic cDNAs and/or synthetic mRNAs, e.g., that express dystrophin or fragments thereof (e.g., a dystrophin mini gene). In some embodiments, complexes may comprise molecular payloads such as guide molecules (e.g., guide RNAs) that are capable of targeting nucleic acid programmable nucleases (e.g., Cas9) to a sequence at or near a disease-associated mutation of DMD, e.g., a mutated DMD exon. In some embodiments, such nucleic programmable nucleases could be used to cleave part or all of a disease-associated mutation of DMD, e.g., a mutated DMD exon, to promote expression of functional DMD. In some embodiments, complexes may comprise molecular payloads that upregulate the expression and/or activity of genes that can replace the function of dystrophin, such as utrophin.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Further aspects of the disclosure, including a description of defined terms, are provided below.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">I.

In some embodiments, an antibody is a full-length antibody. In some embodiments, an antibody is a chimeric antibody. In some embodiments, an antibody is a humanized antibody. However, in some embodiments, an antibody is a Fab fragment, a F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>fragment, a Fv fragment or a scFv fragment. In some embodiments, an antibody is a nanobody derived from a camelid antibody or a nanobody derived from shark antibody. In some embodiments, an antibody is a diabody. In some embodiments, an antibody comprises a framework having a human germline sequence. In another embodiment, an antibody comprises a heavy chain constant domain selected from the group consisting of IgG, IgG1, IgG2, IgG2A, IgG2B, IgG2C, IgG3, IgG4, IgA1, IgA2, IgD, IgM, and IgE constant domains. In some embodiments, an antibody comprises a heavy (H) chain variable region (abbreviated herein as VH), and/or a light (L) chain variable region (abbreviated herein as VL). In some embodiments, an antibody comprises a constant domain, e.g., an Fc region. An immunoglobulin constant domain refers to a heavy or light chain constant domain. Human IgG heavy chain and light chain constant domain amino acid sequences and their functional variations are known. With respect to the heavy chain, in some embodiments, the heavy chain of an antibody described herein can be an alpha (&#x3b1;), delta (&#x394;), epsilon (&#x3b5;), gamma (&#x3b3;) or mu (&#x3bc;) heavy chain. In some embodiments, the heavy chain of an antibody described herein can comprise a human alpha (&#x3b1;), delta (&#x394;), epsilon (&#x3b5;), gamma (&#x3b3;) or mu (&#x3bc;) heavy chain. In a particular embodiment, an antibody described herein comprises a human gamma 1 CH1. CH2, and/or CH3 domain. In some embodiments, the amino acid sequence of the VH domain comprises the amino acid sequence of a human gamma (&#x3b3;) heavy chain constant region, such as any known in the art. Non-limiting examples of human constant region sequences have been described in the art, e.g., see U.S. Pat. No. 5,693,780 and Kabat E A et al., (1991) supra. In some embodiments, the VH domain comprises an amino acid sequence that is at least 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 98%, or at least 99% identical to any of the variable chain constant regions provided herein. In some embodiments, an antibody is modified, e.g., modified via glycosylation, phosphorylation, sumoylation, and/or methylation. In some embodiments, an antibody is a glycosylated antibody, which is conjugated to one or more sugar or carbohydrate molecules. In some embodiments, the one or more sugar or carbohydrate molecule are conjugated to the antibody via N-glycosylation, O-glycosylation, C-glycosylation, glypiation (GPI anchor attachment), and/or phosphoglycosylation. In some embodiments, the one or more sugar or carbohydrate molecule are monosaccharides, disaccharides, oligosaccharides, or glycans. In some embodiments, the one or more sugar or carbohydrate molecule is a branched oligosaccharide or a branched glycan. In some embodiments, the one or more sugar or carbohydrate molecule includes a mannose unit, a glucose unit, an N-acetylglucosamine unit, an N-acetylgalactosamine unit, a galactose unit, a fucose unit, or a phospholipid unit. In some embodiments, an antibody is a construct that comprises a polypeptide comprising one or more antigen binding fragments of the disclosure linked to a linker polypeptide or an immunoglobulin constant domain. Linker polypeptides comprise two or more amino acid residues joined by peptide bonds and are used to link one or more antigen binding portions. Examples of linker polypeptides have been reported (see e.g., Holliger, P., et al. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:6444-6448; Poljak, R. J., et al. (1994) Structure 2:1121-1123). Still further, an antibody may be part of a larger immunoadhesion molecule, formed by covalent or noncovalent association of the antibody or antibody portion with one or more other proteins or peptides. Examples of such immunoadhesion molecules include use of the streptavidin core region to make a tetrameric scFv molecule (Kipriyanov, S. M., et al. (1995) Human Antibodies and Hybridomas 6:93-101) and use of a cysteine residue, a marker peptide and a C-terminal polyhistidine tag to make bivalent and biotinylated scFv molecules (Kipriyanov, S. M., et al. (1994) Mol. Immunol. 31:1047-1058).</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">CDR: As used herein, the term &#x201c;CDR&#x201d; refers to the complementarity determining region within antibody variable sequences. There are three CDRs in each of the variable regions of the heavy chain and the light chain, which are designated CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3, for each of the variable regions. The term &#x201c;CDR set&#x201d; as used herein refers to a group of three CDRs that occur in a single variable region capable of binding the antigen. The exact boundaries of these CDRs have been defined differently according to different systems. The system described by Kabat (Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1987) and (1991)) not only provides an unambiguous residue numbering system applicable to any variable region of an antibody, but also provides precise residue boundaries defining the three CDRs. These CDRs may be referred to as Kabat CDRs. Sub-portions of CDRs may be designated as L1, L2 and L3 or H1, H2 and H3 where the &#x201c;L&#x201d; and the &#x201c;H&#x201d; designates the light chain and the heavy chains regions, respectively. These regions may be referred to as Chothia CDRs, which have boundaries that overlap with Kabat CDRs. Other boundaries defining CDRs overlapping with the Kabat CDRs have been described by Padlan (FASEB J. 9:133-139 (1995)) and MacCallum (J Mol Biol 262(5):732-45 (1996)). Still other CDR boundary definitions may not strictly follow one of the above systems, but will nonetheless overlap with the Kabat CDRs, although they may be shortened or lengthened in light of prediction or experimental findings that particular residues or groups of residues or even entire CDRs do not significantly impact antigen binding. The methods used herein may utilize CDRs defined according to any of these systems, although preferred embodiments use Kabat or Chothia defined CDRs.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">CDR-grafted antibody: The term &#x201c;CDR-grafted antibody&#x201d; refers to antibodies which comprise heavy and light chain variable region sequences from one species but in which the sequences of one or more of the CDR regions of VH and/or VL are replaced with CDR sequences of another species, such as antibodies having murine heavy and light chain variable regions in which one or more of the murine CDRs (e.g., CDR3) has been replaced with human CDR sequences.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Chimeric antibody: The term &#x201c;chimeric antibody&#x201d; refers to antibodies which comprise heavy and light chain variable region sequences from one species and constant region sequences from another species, such as antibodies having murine heavy and light chain variable regions linked to human constant regions.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Complementary: As used herein, the term &#x201c;complementary&#x201d; refers to the capacity for precise pairing between two nucleotides or two sets of nucleotides. In particular, complementary is a term that characterizes an extent of hydrogen bond pairing that brings about binding between two nucleotides or two sets of nucleotides. For example, if a base at one position of an oligonucleotide is capable of hydrogen bonding with a base at the corresponding position of a target nucleic acid (e.g., an mRNA), then the bases are considered to be complementary to each other at that position. Base pairings may include both canonical Watson-Crick base pairing and non-Watson-Crick base pairing (e.g., Wobble base pairing and Hoogsteen base pairing). For example, in some embodiments, for complementary base pairings, adenosine-type bases (A) are complementary to thymidine-type bases (T) or uracil-type bases (U), that cytosine-type bases (C) are complementary to guanosine-type bases (G), and that universal bases such as 3-nitropyrrole or 5-nitroindole can hybridize to and are considered complementary to any A, C, U, or T. Inosine (I) has also been considered in the art to be a universal base and is considered complementary to any A, C, U or T.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Conservative amino acid substitution: As used herein, a &#x201c;conservative amino acid substitution&#x201d; refers to an amino acid substitution that does not alter the relative charge or size characteristics of the protein in which the amino acid substitution is made. Variants can be prepared according to methods for altering polypeptide sequence known to one of ordinary skill in the art such as are found in references which compile such methods, e.g. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, J. Sambrook, et al., eds., Fourth Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 2012, or Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, F. M. Ausubel, et al., eds., John Wiley &#x26; Sons, Inc., New York. Conservative substitutions of amino acids include substitutions made amongst amino acids within the following groups: (a) M, I, L, V; (b) F, Y, W; (c) K, R, H; (d) A, G; (e) S, T; (f) Q, N; and (g) E, D.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Covalently linked: As used herein, the term &#x201c;covalently linked&#x201d; refers to a characteristic of two or more molecules being linked together via at least one covalent bond. In some embodiments, two molecules can be covalently linked together by a single bond, e.g., a disulfide bond or disulfide bridge, that serves as a linker between the molecules. However, in some embodiments, two or more molecules can be covalently linked together via a molecule that serves as a linker that joins the two or more molecules together through multiple covalent bonds. In some embodiments, a linker may be a cleavable linker. However, in some embodiments, a linker may be a non-cleavable linker.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Cross-reactive: As used herein and in the context of a targeting agent (e.g., antibody), the term &#x201c;cross-reactive,&#x201d; refers to a property of the agent being capable of specifically binding to more than one antigen of a similar type or class (e.g., antigens of multiple homologs, paralogs, or orthologs) with similar affinity or avidity. For example, in some embodiments, an antibody that is cross-reactive against human and non-human primate antigens of a similar type or class (e.g., a human transferrin receptor and non-human primate transferring receptor) is capable of binding to the human antigen and non-human primate antigens with a similar affinity or avidity. In some embodiments, an antibody is cross-reactive against a human antigen and a rodent antigen of a similar type or class. In some embodiments, an antibody is cross-reactive against a rodent antigen and a non-human primate antigen of a similar type or class. In some embodiments, an antibody is cross-reactive against a human antigen, a non-human primate antigen, and a rodent antigen of a similar type or class.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">DMD: As used herein, the term &#x201c;DMD&#x201d; refers to a gene that encodes dystrophin protein, a key component of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex, which bridges the inner cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix in muscle cells, particularly muscle fibers. Deletions, duplications, and point mutations in DMD may cause dystrophinopathies, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Becker muscular dystrophy, or cardiomyopathy. Alternative promoter usage and alternative splicing result in numerous distinct transcript variants and protein isoforms for this gene. In some embodiments, a dystrophin gene may be a human (Gene ID: 1756), non-human primate (e.g., Gene ID: 465559), or rodent gene (e.g., Gene ID: 13405; Gene ID: 24907). In addition, multiple human transcript variants (e.g., as annotated under GenBank RefSeq Accession Numbers: NM_000109.3, NM_004006.2 (SEQ ID NO: 295), NM_004009.3, NM_004010.3 and NM_004011.3) have been characterized that encode different protein isoforms.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">DMD allele: As used herein, the term &#x201c;DMD allele&#x201d; refers to any one of alternative forms (e.g., wild-type or mutant forms) of a DMD gene. In some embodiments, a DMD allele may encode for dystrophin that retains its normal and typical functions. In some embodiments, a DMD allele may comprise one or more mutations that results in muscular dystrophy. Common mutations that lead to duchenne muscular dystrophy involve frameshift, deletion, substitution, and duplicative mutations of one or more of 79 exons present in a dystrophin allele, e.g., exon 8, exon 23, exon 41, exon 44, exon 50, exon 51, exon 52, exon 53, or exon 55. Further examples of DMD mutations are disclosed, for example, in Flanigan K M, et al., <i>Mutational spectrum of DMD mutations in dystrophinopathy patients: application of modern diagnostic techniques to a large cohort</i>. Hum Mutat, 2009 December; 30 (12):1657-66, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Dystrophinopathy: As used herein, the term &#x201c;dystrophinopathy&#x201d; refers to a muscle disease results from one or more mutated DMD alleles. Dystrophinopathies include a spectrum of conditions (ranging from mild to severe) that includes Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Becker muscular dystrophy, and DMD-associated dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). In some embodiments, at one end of the spectrum, dystrophinopathy is phenotypically associated with an asymptomatic increase in serum concentration of creatine phosphokinase (CK) and/or muscle cramps with myoglobinuria. In some embodiments, at the other end of the spectrum, dystrophinopathy is phenotypically associated with progressive muscle diseases that are generally classified as Duchenne or Becker muscular dystrophy when skeletal muscle is primarily affected and as DMD-associated dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) when the heart is primarily affected. Symptoms of Duchenne muscular dystrophy include muscle loss or degeneration, diminished muscle function, pseudohypertrophy of the tongue and calf muscles, higher risk of neurological abnormalities, and a shortened lifespan. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is associated with Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) Entry #310200. Becker muscular dystrophy is associated with OMIM Entry #300376. Dilated cardiomyopathy is associated with OMIM Entry X #302045.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Framework: As used herein, the term &#x201c;framework&#x201d; or &#x201c;framework sequence&#x201d; refers to the remaining sequences of a variable region minus the CDRs. Because the exact definition of a CDR sequence can be determined by different systems, the meaning of a framework sequence is subject to correspondingly different interpretations. The six CDRs (CDR-L1, CDR-L2, and CDR-L3 of light chain and CDR-H1, CDR-H2, and CDR-H3 of heavy chain) also divide the framework regions on the light chain and the heavy chain into four sub-regions (FR1, FR2, FR3 and FR4) on each chain, in which CDR1 is positioned between FR1 and FR2, CDR2 between FR2 and FR3, and CDR3 between FR3 and FR4. Without specifying the particular sub-regions as FR1, FR2, FR3 or FR4, a framework region, as referred by others, represents the combined FRs within the variable region of a single, naturally occurring immunoglobulin chain. As used herein, a FR represents one of the four sub-regions, and FRs represents two or more of the four sub-regions constituting a framework region Human heavy chain and light chain acceptor sequences are known in the art. In one embodiment, the acceptor sequences known in the art may be used in the antibodies disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Human antibody: The term &#x201c;human antibody&#x201d;, as used herein, is intended to include antibodies having variable and constant regions derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences. The human antibodies of the disclosure may include amino acid residues not encoded by human germline immunoglobulin sequences (e.g., mutations introduced by random or site-specific mutagenesis in vitro or by somatic mutation in vivo), for example in the CDRs and in particular CDR3. However, the term &#x201c;human antibody&#x201d;, as used herein, is not intended to include antibodies in which CDR sequences derived from the germline of another mammalian species, such as a mouse, have been grafted onto human framework sequences.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Humanized antibody: The term &#x201c;humanized antibody&#x201d; refers to antibodies which comprise heavy and light chain variable region sequences from a non-human species (e.g., a mouse) but in which at least a portion of the VH and/or VL sequence has been altered to be more &#x201c;human-like&#x201d;, i.e., more similar to human germline variable sequences. One type of humanized antibody is a CDR-grafted antibody, in which human CDR sequences are introduced into non-human VH and VL sequences to replace the corresponding nonhuman CDR sequences. In one embodiment, humanized anti-transferrin receptor antibodies and antigen binding portions are provided. Such antibodies may be generated by obtaining murine anti-transferrin receptor monoclonal antibodies using traditional hybridoma technology followed by humanization using in vitro genetic engineering, such as those disclosed in Kasaian et al PCT publication No. WO 2005/123126 A2.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Internalizing cell surface receptor: As used herein, the term, &#x201c;internalizing cell surface receptor&#x201d; refers to a cell surface receptor that is internalized by cells, e.g., upon external stimulation. e.g., ligand binding to the receptor. In some embodiments, an internalizing cell surface receptor is internalized by endocytosis. In some embodiments, an internalizing cell surface receptor is internalized by clathrin-mediated endocytosis. However, in some embodiments, an internalizing cell surface receptor is internalized by a clathrin-independent pathway, such as, for example, phagocytosis, macropinocytosis, caveolae- and raft-mediated uptake or constitutive clathrin-independent endocytosis. In some embodiments, the internalizing cell surface receptor comprises an intracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and/or an extracellular domain, which may optionally further comprise a ligand-binding domain. In some embodiments, a cell surface receptor becomes internalized by a cell after ligand binding. In some embodiments, a ligand may be a muscle-targeting agent or a muscle-targeting antibody. In some embodiments, an internalizing cell surface receptor is a transferrin receptor.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Isolated antibody: An &#x201c;isolated antibody&#x201d;, as used herein, is intended to refer to an antibody that is substantially free of other antibodies having different antigenic specificities (e.g., an isolated antibody that specifically binds transferrin receptor is substantially free of antibodies that specifically bind antigens other than transferrin receptor). An isolated antibody that specifically binds transferrin receptor complex may, however, have cross-reactivity to other antigens, such as transferrin receptor molecules from other species. Moreover, an isolated antibody may be substantially free of other cellular material and/or chemicals.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Kabat numbering: The terms &#x201c;Kabat numbering&#x201d;, &#x201c;Kabat definitions and &#x201c;Kabat labeling&#x201d; are used interchangeably herein. These terms, which are recognized in the art, refer to a system of numbering amino acid residues which are more variable (i.e. hypervariable) than other amino acid residues in the heavy and light chain variable regions of an antibody, or an antigen binding portion thereof (Kabat et al. (1971) Ann. NY Acad, Sci. 190:382-391 and, Kabat, E. A., et al. (1991) Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. NIH Publication No. 91-3242). For the heavy chain variable region, the hypervariable region ranges from amino acid positions 31 to 35 for CDR1, amino acid positions 50 to 65 for CDR2, and amino acid positions 95 to 102 for CDR3. For the light chain variable region, the hypervariable region ranges from amino acid positions 24 to 34 for CDR1, amino acid positions 50 to 56 for CDR2, and amino acid positions 89 to 97 for CDR3.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Molecular payload: As used herein, the term &#x201c;molecular payload&#x201d; refers to a molecule or species that functions to modulate a biological outcome. In some embodiments, a molecular payload is linked to, or otherwise associated with a muscle-targeting agent. In some embodiments, the molecular payload is a small molecule, a protein, a peptide, a nucleic acid, or an oligonucleotide. In some embodiments, the molecular payload functions to modulate the transcription of a DNA sequence, to modulate the expression of a protein, or to modulate the activity of a protein.

The antigen in or on muscle cells may be a membrane protein, for example an integral membrane protein or a peripheral membrane protein. Typically, a muscle-targeting agent specifically binds to an antigen on muscle cells that facilitates internalization of the muscle-targeting agent (and any associated molecular payload) into the muscle cells. In some embodiments, a muscle-targeting agent specifically binds to an internalizing, cell surface receptor on muscles and is capable of being internalized into muscle cells through receptor mediated internalization. In some embodiments, the muscle-targeting agent is a small molecule, a protein, a peptide, a nucleic acid (e.g., an aptamer), or an antibody. In some embodiments, the muscle-targeting agent is linked to a molecular payload.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Muscle-targeting antibody: As used herein, the term, &#x201c;muscle-targeting antibody,&#x201d; refers to a muscle-targeting agent that is an antibody that specifically binds to an antigen found in or on muscle cells.

In some embodiments, an oligonucleotide may comprise one or more phosphorothioate linkages, which may be in the Rp or Sp stereochemical conformation.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Recombinant antibody: The term &#x201c;recombinant human antibody&#x201d;, as used herein, is intended to include all human antibodies that are prepared, expressed, created or isolated by recombinant means, such as antibodies expressed using a recombinant expression vector transfected into a host cell (described in more details in this disclosure), antibodies isolated from a recombinant, combinatorial human antibody library (Hoogenboom H. R., (1997) TIB Tech. 15:62-70; Azzazy H., and Highsmith W. E., (2002) Clin. Biochem. 35:425-445; Gavilondo J. V., and Larrick J. W. (2002) BioTechniques 29:128-145; Hoogenboom H., and Chames P. (2000) Immunology Today 21:371-378), antibodies isolated from an animal (e.g., a mouse) that is transgenic for human immunoglobulin genes (see e.g., Taylor, L. D., et al. (1992) Nucl. Acids Res. 20:6287-6295; Kellermann S A., and Green L. L. (2002) Current Opinion in Biotechnology 13:593-597; Little M. et al (2000) Immunology Today 21:364-370) or antibodies prepared, expressed, created or isolated by any other means that involves splicing of human immunoglobulin gene sequences to other DNA sequences. Such recombinant human antibodies have variable and constant regions derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences. In certain embodiments, however, such recombinant human antibodies are subjected to in vitro mutagenesis (or, when an animal transgenic for human Ig sequences is used, in vivo somatic mutagenesis) and thus the amino acid sequences of the VH and VL regions of the recombinant antibodies are sequences that, while derived from and related to human germline VH and VL sequences, may not naturally exist within the human antibody germline repertoire in vivo. One embodiment of the disclosure provides fully human antibodies capable of binding human transferrin receptor which can be generated using techniques well known in the art, such as, but not limited to, using human Ig phage libraries such as those disclosed in Jernutus et al., PCT publication No. WO 2005/007699 A2.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Region of complementarity: As used herein, the term &#x201c;region of complementarity&#x201d; refers to a nucleotide sequence, e.g., of a oligonucleotide, that is sufficiently complementary to a cognate nucleotide sequence, e.g., of a target nucleic acid, such that the two nucleotide sequences are capable of annealing to one another under physiological conditions (e.g., in a cell). In some embodiments, a region of complementarity is fully complementary to a cognate nucleotide sequence of target nucleic acid. However, in some embodiments, a region of complementarity is partially complementary to a cognate nucleotide sequence of target nucleic acid (e.g., at least 80%, 90%, 95% or 99% complementarity). In some embodiments, a region of complementarity contains 1, 2, 3, or 4 mismatches compared with a cognate nucleotide sequence of a target nucleic acid.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Specifically binds: As used herein, the term &#x201c;specifically binds&#x201d; refers to the ability of a molecule to bind to a binding partner with a degree of affinity or avidity that enables the molecule to be used to distinguish the binding partner from an appropriate control in a binding assay or other binding context. With respect to an antibody, the term, &#x201c;specifically binds&#x201d;, refers to the ability of the antibody to bind to a specific antigen with a degree of affinity or avidity, compared with an appropriate reference antigen or antigens, that enables the antibody to be used to distinguish the specific antigen from others, e.g., to an extent that permits preferential targeting to certain cells, e.g., muscle cells, through binding to the antigen, as described herein. In some embodiments, an antibody specifically binds to a target if the antibody has a K<sub>D </sub>for binding the target of at least about 10<sup>&#x2212;4 </sup>M, 10<sup>&#x2212;5 </sup>M, 10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>M, 10<sup>&#x2212;7 </sup>M, 10<sup>&#x2212;8 </sup>M, 10<sup>&#x2212;9 </sup>M, 10<sup>&#x2212;10 </sup>M, 10<sup>&#x2212;11 </sup>M, 10<sup>&#x2212;12 </sup>M, 10<sup>&#x2212;13 </sup>M, or less. In some embodiments, an antibody specifically binds to the transferrin receptor. e.g., an epitope of the apical domain of transferrin receptor.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Subject: As used herein, the term &#x201c;subject&#x201d; refers to a mammal. In some embodiments, a subject is non-human primate, or rodent. In some embodiments, a subject is a human. In some embodiments, a subject is a patient, e.g., a human patient that has or is suspected of having a disease. In some embodiments, the subject is a human patient who has or is suspected of having a disease resulting from a mutated DMD gene sequence, e.g., a mutation in an exon of a DMD gene sequence. In some embodiments, a subject has a dystrophinopathy, e.g., Duchenne muscular dystrophy.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Transferrin receptor: As used herein, the term, &#x201c;transferrin receptor&#x201d; (also known as TFRC, CD71, p90, or TFR1) refers to an internalizing cell surface receptor that binds transferrin to facilitate iron uptake by endocytosis. In some embodiments, a transferrin receptor may be of human (NCBI Gene ID 7037), non-human primate (e.g., NCBI Gene ID 711568 or NCBI Gene ID 102136007), or rodent (e.g., NCBI Gene ID 22042) origin. In addition, multiple human transcript variants have been characterized that encoded different isoforms of the receptor (e.g., as annotated under GenBank RefSeq Accession Numbers: NP_001121620.1, NP_003225.2, NP_001300894.1, and NP_001300895.1).</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">II. Complexes</heading><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Provided herein are complexes that comprise a targeting agent, e.g. an antibody, covalently linked to a molecular payload. In some embodiments, a complex comprises a muscle-targeting antibody covalently linked to a oligonucleotide. A complex may comprise an antibody that specifically binds a single antigenic site or that binds to at least two antigenic sites that may exist on the same or different antigens.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">A complex may be used to modulate the activity or function of at least one gene, protein, and/or nucleic acid. In some embodiments, the molecular payload present with a complex is responsible for the modulation of a gene, protein, and/or nucleic acids. A molecular payload may be a small molecule, protein, nucleic acid, oligonucleotide, or any molecular entity capable of modulating the activity or function of a gene, protein, and/or nucleic acid in a cell. In some embodiments, a molecular payload is an oligonucleotide that targets a disease-associated repeat in muscle cells.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In some embodiments, a complex comprises a muscle-targeting agent, e.g. an anti-transferrin receptor antibody, covalently linked to a molecular payload, e.g. a mixmer antisense oligonucleotide that targets a mutated DMD allele to promote exon skipping. A. Muscle-Targeting Agents</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Some aspects of the disclosure provide muscle-targeting agents, e.g., for delivering a molecular payload to a muscle cell. In some embodiments, such muscle-targeting agents are capable of binding to a muscle cell, e.g., via specifically binding to an antigen on the muscle cell, and delivering an associated molecular payload to the muscle cell. In some embodiments, the molecular payload is bound (e.g., covalently bound) to the muscle targeting agent and is internalized into the muscle cell upon binding of the muscle targeting agent to an antigen on the muscle cell, e.g., via endocytosis. It should be appreciated that various types of muscle-targeting agents may be used in accordance with the disclosure. For example, the muscle-targeting agent may comprise, or consist of, a nucleic acid (e.g., DNA or RNA), a peptide (e.g., an antibody), a lipid (e.g., a microvesicle), or a sugar moiety (e.g., a polysaccharide). Exemplary muscle-targeting agents are described in further detail herein, however, it should be appreciated that the exemplary muscle-targeting agents provided herein are not meant to be limiting.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Some aspects of the disclosure provide muscle-targeting agents that specifically bind to an antigen on muscle, such as skeletal muscle, smooth muscle, or cardiac muscle. In some embodiments, any of the muscle-targeting agents provided herein bind to (e.g., specifically bind to) an antigen on a skeletal muscle cell, a smooth muscle cell, and/or a cardiac muscle cell.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">By interacting with muscle-specific cell surface recognition elements (e.g., cell membrane proteins), both tissue localization and selective uptake into muscle cells can be achieved. In some embodiments, molecules that are substrates for muscle uptake transporters are useful for delivering a molecular payload into muscle tissue. Binding to muscle surface recognition elements followed by endocytosis can allow even large molecules such as antibodies to enter muscle cells. As another example molecular payloads conjugated to transferrin or anti-transferrin receptor antibodies can be taken up by muscle cells via binding to transferrin receptor, which may then be endocytosed, e.g., via clathrin-mediated endocytosis.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The use of muscle-targeting agents may be useful for concentrating a molecular payload (e.g., oligonucleotide) in muscle while reducing toxicity associated with effects in other tissues. In some embodiments, the muscle-targeting agent concentrates a bound molecular payload in muscle cells as compared to another cell type within a subject. In some embodiments, the muscle-targeting agent concentrates a bound molecular payload in muscle cells (e.g., skeletal, smooth, or cardiac muscle cells) in an amount that is at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, or 100 times greater than an amount in non-muscle cells (e.g., liver, neuronal, blood, or fat cells). In some embodiments, a toxicity of the molecular payload in a subject is reduced by at least 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 90%, or 95% when it is delivered to the subject when bound to the muscle-targeting agent.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In some embodiments, to achieve muscle selectivity, a muscle recognition element (e.g., a muscle cell antigen) may be required. As one example, a muscle-targeting agent may be a small molecule that is a substrate for a muscle-specific uptake transporter. As another example, a muscle-targeting agent may be an antibody that enters a muscle cell via transporter-mediated endocytosis. As another example, a muscle targeting agent may be a ligand that binds to cell surface receptor on a muscle cell. It should be appreciated that while transporter-based approaches provide a direct path for cellular entry, receptor-based targeting may involve stimulated endocytosis to reach the desired site of action.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">i. Muscle-Targeting Antibodies</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In some embodiments, the muscle-targeting agent is an antibody. Generally, the high specificity of antibodies for their target antigen provides the potential for selectively targeting muscle cells (e.g., skeletal, smooth, and/or cardiac muscle cells). This specificity may also limit off-target toxicity. Examples of antibodies that are capable of targeting a surface antigen of muscle cells have been reported and are within the scope of the disclosure. For example, antibodies that target the surface of muscle cells are described in Arahata K., et al. &#x201c;Immunostaining of skeletal and cardiac muscle surface membrane with antibody against Duchenne muscular dystrophy peptide&#x201d; Nature 1988; 333: 861-3; Song K.

H. et al., &#x201c;Cell type specific targeted intracellular delivery into muscle of a monoclonal antibody that binds myosin IIb&#x201d; <i>Mol Immunol. </i>2003 March, 39(13):78309; the entire contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">a. Anti-Transferrin Receptor Antibodies</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Some aspects of the disclosure are based on the recognition that agents binding to transferrin receptor, e.g., anti-transferrin-receptor antibodies, are capable of targeting muscle cell. Transferrin receptors are internalizing cell surface receptors that transport transferrin across the cellular membrane and participate in the regulation and homeostasis of intracellular iron levels. Some aspects of the disclosure provide transferrin receptor binding proteins, which are capable of binding to transferrin receptor. Accordingly, aspects of the disclosure provide binding proteins (e.g., antibodies) that bind to transferrin receptor. In some embodiments, binding proteins that bind to transferrin receptor are internalized, along with any bound molecular payload, into a muscle cell. As used herein, an antibody that binds to a transferrin receptor may be referred to as an anti-transferrin receptor antibody. Antibodies that bind, e.g. specifically bind, to a transferrin receptor may be internalized into the cell, e.g. through receptor-mediated endocytosis, upon binding to a transferrin receptor.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">It should be appreciated that anti-transferrin receptor antibodies may be produced, synthesized, and/or derivatized using several known methodologies, e.g. library design using phage display. Exemplary methodologies have been characterized in the art and are incorporated by reference (Diez, P. et al. &#x201c;High-throughput phage-display screening in array format&#x201d;, Enzyme and microbial technology, 2015, 79, 34-41; Christoph M.

e.g., through the use of recombinant DNA protocols. In some embodiments, an antibody may also be produced through the generation of hybridomas (see, e.g., Kohler, G and Milstein, C. &#x201c;Continuous cultures of fused cells secreting antibody of predefined specificity&#x201d; Nature, 1975, 256: 495-497). The antigen-of-interest may be used as the immunogen in any form or entity, e.g., recombinant or a naturally occurring form or entity. Hybridomas are screened using standard methods, e.g. ELISA screening, to find at least one hybridoma that produces an antibody that targets a particular antigen. Antibodies may also be produced through screening of protein expression libraries that express antibodies, e.g., phage display libraries. Phage display library design may also be used, in some embodiments, (see, e.g. U.S. Pat.

In some embodiments, an antigen-of-interest may be used to immunize a non-human animal, e.g., a rodent or a goat. In some embodiments, an antibody is then obtained from the non-human animal, and may be optionally modified using a number of methodologies, e.g., using recombinant DNA techniques.

By designing peptides to interact with specific cell surface antigens (e.g., receptors), selectivity for a desired tissue, e.g., muscle, can be achieved. Skeletal muscle-targeting has been investigated and a range of molecular payloads are able to be delivered. These approaches may have high selectivity for muscle tissue without many of the practical disadvantages of a large antibody or viral particle. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the muscle-targeting agent is a muscle-targeting peptide that is from 4 to 50 amino acids in length. In some embodiments, the muscle-targeting peptide is 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, or 50 amino acids in length. Muscle-targeting peptides can be generated using any of several methods, such as phage display.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0148">In some embodiments, a muscle-targeting peptide may bind to an internalizing cell surface receptor that is overexpressed or relatively highly expressed in muscle cells, e.g. a transferrin receptor, compared with certain other cells. In some embodiments, a muscle-targeting peptide may target, e.g., bind to, a transferrin receptor. In some embodiments, a peptide that targets a transferrin receptor may comprise a segment of a naturally occurring ligand, e.g., transferrin. In some embodiments, a peptide that targets a transferrin receptor is as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,743,893, filed Nov. 30, 2000, &#x201c;RECEPTOR-MEDIATED UPTAKE OF PEPTIDES THAT BIND THE HUMAN TRANSFERRIN RECEPTOR&#x201d;.

For example, muscle-specific peptides were identified using phage display library presenting surface heptapeptides. As one example a peptide having the amino acid sequence ASSLNIA (SEQ ID NO: 6) bound to C2C12 murine myotubes in vitro, and bound to mouse muscle tissue in vivo. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the muscle-targeting agent comprises the amino acid sequence ASSLNIA (SEQ ID NO: 6). This peptide displayed improved specificity for binding to heart and skeletal muscle tissue after intravenous injection in mice with reduced binding to liver, kidney, and brain. Additional muscle-specific peptides have been identified using phage display. For example, a 12 amino acid peptide was identified by phage display library for muscle targeting in the context of treatment for DMD. See, Yoshida D., et al., &#x201c;Targeting of salicylate to skin and muscle following topical injections in rats.&#x201d; <i>Int J Pharm </i>2002; 231: 177-84; the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. Here, a 12 amino acid peptide having the sequence SKTFNTHPQSTP (SEQ ID NO: 7) was identified and this muscle-targeting peptide showed improved binding to C2C12 cells relative to the ASSLNIA (SEQ ID NO: 6) peptide.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0150">An additional method for identifying peptides selective for muscle (e.g., skeletal muscle) over other cell types includes in vitro selection, which has been described in Ghosh D., et al., &#x201c;Selection of muscle-binding peptides from context-specific peptide-presenting phage libraries for adenoviral vector targeting&#x201d; <i>J Virol </i>2005; 79: 13667-72; the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

Following rounds of selection the 12 amino acid peptide TARGEHKEEELI (SEQ ID NO: 8) appeared most frequently. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the muscle-targeting agent comprises the amino acid sequence TARGEHKEEELI (SEQ ID NO: 8).</p><p id="p-0164" num="0151">A muscle-targeting agent may an amino acid-containing molecule or peptide. A muscle-targeting peptide may correspond to a sequence of a protein that preferentially binds to a protein receptor found in muscle cells. In some embodiments, a muscle-targeting peptide contains a high propensity of hydrophobic amino acids, e.g. valine, such that the peptide preferentially targets muscle cells. In some embodiments, a muscle-targeting peptide has not been previously characterized or disclosed. These peptides may be conceived of, produced, synthesized, and/or derivatized using any of several methodologies, e.g. phage displayed peptide libraries, one-bead one-compound peptide libraries, or positional scanning synthetic peptide combinatorial libraries. Exemplary methodologies have been characterized in the art and are incorporated by reference (Gray, B. P. and Brown, K.

In some embodiments, a muscle-targeting peptide may comprise about 2-25 amino acids, about 2-20 amino acids, about 2-15 amino acids, about 2-10 amino acids, or about 2-5 amino acids. Muscle-targeting peptides may comprise naturally-occurring amino acids, e.g. cysteine, alanine, or non-naturally-occurring or modified amino acids. Non-naturally occurring amino acids include &#x3b2;-amino acids, homo-amino acids, proline derivatives, 3-substituted alanine derivatives, linear core amino acids, N-methyl amino acids, and others known in the art. In some embodiments, a muscle-targeting peptide may be linear; in other embodiments, a muscle-targeting peptide may be cyclic. e.g. bicyclic (see, e.g. Silvana, M. G. et al. Mol.

Muscle-Targeting Receptor Ligands</p><p id="p-0166" num="0153">A muscle-targeting agent may be a ligand, e.g. a ligand that binds to a receptor protein. A muscle-targeting ligand may be a protein, e.g. transferrin, which binds to an internalizing cell surface receptor expressed by a muscle cell. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the muscle-targeting agent is transferrin, or a derivative thereof that binds to a transferrin receptor. A muscle-targeting ligand may alternatively be a small molecule, e.g. a lipophilic small molecule that preferentially targets muscle cells relative to other cell types. Exemplary lipophilic small molecules that may target muscle cells include compounds comprising cholesterol, cholesteryl, stearic acid, palmitic acid, oleic acid, oleyl, linolene, linoleic acid, myristic acid, sterols, dihydrotestosterone, testosterone derivatives, glycerine, alkyl chains, trityl groups, and alkoxy acids.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0154">iv. Muscle-Targeting Aptamers</p><p id="p-0168" num="0155">A muscle-targeting agent may be an aptamer, e.g. an RNA aptamer, which preferentially targets muscle cells relative to other cell types. In some embodiments, a muscle-targeting aptamer has not been previously characterized or disclosed. These aptamers may be conceived of, produced, synthesized, and/or derivatized using any of several methodologies, e.g. Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment. Exemplary methodologies have been characterized in the art and are incorporated by reference (Yan, A.

J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2013; 4: 27-40). In some embodiments, a muscle-targeting aptamer has been previously disclosed (see, e.g. Phillippou, S. et al. &#x201c;Selection and Identification of Skeletal-Muscle-Targeted RNA Aptamers.&#x201d; Mol Ther Nucleic Acids. 2018, 10:199-214; Thiel, W. H. et al. &#x201c;Smooth Muscle Cell-targeted RNA Aptamer Inhibits Neointimal Formation.&#x201d; Mol Ther. 2016, 24:4, 779-87). Exemplary muscle-targeting aptamers include the A01B RNA aptamer and RNA Apt 14. In some embodiments, an aptamer is a nucleic acid-based aptamer, an oligonucleotide aptamer or a peptide aptamer. In some embodiments, an aptamer may be about 5-15 kDa, about 5-10 kDa, about 10-15 kDa, about 1-5 Da, about 1-3 kDa, or smaller.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0156">v. Other Muscle-Targeting Agents</p><p id="p-0170" num="0157">One strategy for targeting a muscle cell (e.g., a skeletal muscle cell) is to use a substrate of a muscle transporter protein, such as a transporter protein expressed on the sarcolemma. In some embodiments, the muscle-targeting agent is a substrate of an influx transporter that is specific to muscle tissue. In some embodiments, the influx transporter is specific to skeletal muscle tissue. Two main classes of transporters are expressed on the skeletal muscle sarcolemma, (1) the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding cassette (ABC) superfamily, which facilitate efflux from skeletal muscle tissue and (2) the solute carrier (SLC) superfamily, which can facilitate the influx of substrates into skeletal muscle. In some embodiments, the muscle-targeting agent is a substrate that binds to an ABC superfamily or an SLC superfamily of transporters. In some embodiments, the substrate that binds to the ABC or SLC superfamily of transporters is a naturally-occurring substrate. In some embodiments, the substrate that binds to the ABC or SLC superfamily of transporters is a non-naturally occurring substrate, for example, a synthetic derivative thereof that binds to the ABC or SLC superfamily of transporters.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0158">In some embodiments, the muscle-targeting agent is a substrate of an SLC superfamily of transporters. SLC transporters are either equilibrative or use proton or sodium ion gradients created across the membrane to drive transport of substrates. Exemplary SLC transporters that have high skeletal muscle expression include, without limitation, the SATT transporter (ASCT1; SLC1A4), GLLUT4 transporter (SLC2A4). GLUT7 transporter (GLUT7; SLC2A7), ATRC2 transporter (CAT-2; SLC7A2), LAT3 transporter (KIAA0245; SLC7A6), PHT1 transporter (PTR4; SLC15A4), OATP-J transporter (OATP5A1; SLC21A15), OCT3 transporter (EMT; SLC22A3), OCTN2 transporter (FLJ46769; SLC22A5), ENT transporters (ENT1; SLC29A1 and ENT2; SLC29A2), PAT2 transporter (SLC36A2), and SAT2 transporter (KIAA1382; SLC38A2). These transporters can facilitate the influx of substrates into skeletal muscle, providing opportunities for muscle targeting.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0159">In some embodiments, the muscle-targeting agent is a substrate of an equilibrative nucleoside transporter 2 (ENT2) transporter. Relative to other transporters, ENT2 has one of the highest mRNA expressions in skeletal muscle. While human ENT2 (hENT2) is expressed in most body organs such as brain, heart, placenta, thymus, pancreas, prostate, and kidney, it is especially abundant in skeletal muscle. Human ENT2 facilitates the uptake of its substrates depending on their concentration gradient. ENT2 plays a role in maintaining nucleoside homeostasis by transporting a wide range of purine and pyrimidine nucleobases. The hENT2 transporter has a low affinity for all nucleosides (adenosine, guanosine, uridine, thymidine, and cytidine) except for inosine. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the muscle-targeting agent is an ENT2 substrate. Exemplary ENT2 substrates include, without limitation, inosine, 2&#x2032;,3&#x2032;-dideoxyinosine, and clofarabine. In some embodiments, any of the muscle-targeting agents provided herein are associated with a molecular payload (e.g., oligonucleotide payload). In some embodiments, the muscle-targeting agent is covalently linked to the molecular payload. In some embodiments, the muscle-targeting agent is non-covalently linked to the molecular payload.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0160">In some embodiments, the muscle-targeting agent is a substrate of an organic cation/carnitine transporter (OCTN2), which is a sodium ion-dependent, high affinity carnitine transporter. In some embodiments, the muscle-targeting agent is carnitine, mildronate, acetylcarnitine, or any derivative thereof that binds to OCTN2. In some embodiments, the carnitine, mildronate, acetylcarnitine, or derivative thereof is covalently linked to the molecular payload (e.g., oligonucleotide payload).</p><p id="p-0174" num="0161">A muscle-targeting agent may be a protein that is protein that exists in at least one soluble form that targets muscle cells. In some embodiments, a muscle-targeting protein may be hemojuvelin (also known as repulsive guidance molecule C or hemochromatosis type 2 protein), a protein involved in iron overload and homeostasis. In some embodiments, hemojuvelin may be full length or a fragment, or a mutant with at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 98% or at least 99% sequence identity to a functional hemojuvelin protein. In some embodiments, a hemojuvelin mutant may be a soluble fragment, may lack a N-terminal signaling, and/or lack a C-terminal anchoring domain. In some embodiments, hemojuvelin may be annotated under GenBank RefSeq Accession Numbers NM_001316767.1, NM_145277.4, NM_202004.3, NM_213652.3, or NM_213653.3.

In some embodiments, such molecular payloads are capable of targeting to a muscle cell, e.g., via specifically binding to a nucleic acid or protein in the muscle cell following delivery to the muscle cell by an associated muscle-targeting agent. It should be appreciated that various types of muscle-targeting agents may be used in accordance with the disclosure. For example, the molecular payload may comprise, or consist of, an oligonucleotide (e.g., antisense oligonucleotide), a peptide (e.g., a peptide that binds a nucleic acid or protein associated with disease in a muscle cell), a protein (e.g., a protein that binds a nucleic acid or protein associated with disease in a muscle cell), or a small molecule (e.g., a small molecule that modulates the function of a nucleic acid or protein associated with disease in a muscle cell).

In some embodiments, the oligonucleotide may be designed to induce exon skipping, e.g., EXONDYS 51 oligonucleotide (Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc.), which comprises SEQ ID NO: 195 (CUCCAACAUCAAGGAAGAUGGCAUUUCUAG); WVE-210201 (Wave Life Sciences), which comprises SEQ ID NO: 186 (UCAAGGAAGAUGGCAUUUCU); Casimersen (Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc.), which comprises SEQ ID NO: 159 (CAAUGCCAUCCUGGAGUUCCUG); or Golodirsen (Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc.), which comprises SEQ ID NO: 231 (GUUGCCUCCGGUUCUGAAGGUGUUC).</p><p id="p-0179" num="0166">In some embodiments, the oligonucleotide may be designed to cause degradation of an mRNA (e.g., the oligonucleotide may be a gapmer, an siRNA, a ribozyme or an aptamer that causes degradation). In some embodiments, the oligonucleotide may be designed to block translation of an mRNA (e.g., the oligonucleotide may be a mixmer, an siRNA or an aptamer that blocks translation). In some embodiments, an oligonucleotide may be designed to cause degradation and block translation of an mRNA. In some embodiments, the oligonucleotide may be designed to promote stability of an mRNA. In some embodiments, the oligonucleotide may be designed to promote translation of an mRNA. In some embodiments, an oligonucleotide may be designed to promote stability and promote translation of an mRNA. In some embodiments, an oligonucleotide may be a guide nucleic acid (e.g., guide RNA) for directing activity of an enzyme (e.g., a gene editing enzyme). In some embodiments, a guide nucleic acid may direct an enzyme to delete the entirety or a part of a mutated DMD allele (e.g., to facilitate in-frame exon skipping). In some embodiments, the oligonucleotide may be designed to target repressive regulators of DMD expression, e.g., miR-31. Other examples of oligonucleotides are provided herein. It should be appreciated that, in some embodiments, oligonucleotides in one format (e.g., antisense oligonucleotides) may be suitably adapted to another format (e.g., siRNA oligonucleotides) by incorporating functional sequences (e.g., antisense strand sequences) from one format to the other format.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0167">Examples of oligonucleotides useful for targeting DMD are provided in U.S. patent application publication US20100130591A1, published on May 27, 2010, entitled &#x201c;MULTIPLE EXON SKIPPING COMPOSITIONS FOR DMD&#x201d;; U.S. Pat.

Jun. 6, 2013, entitled &#x201c;MEGANUCLEASE VARIANTS CLEAVING A DNA TARGET SEQUENCE FROM THE DYSTROPHIN GENE AND USES THEREOF&#x201d;, the contents of each of which are incorporated herein in their entireties. In some embodiments, an oligonucleotide may have a region of complementarity to DMD gene sequences of multiple species, e.g., selected from human, mouse and non-human species.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0170">In some embodiments, the oligonucleotide may have region of complementarity to a mutant DMD allele, for example, a DMD allele with at least one mutation in any of exons 1-79 of DMD in humans that leads to a frameshift and improper RNA splicing/processing.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0171">In some embodiments, the oligonucleotide may target lncRNA or mRNA, e.g., for degradation. In some embodiments, the oligonucleotide may target, e.g., for degradation, a nucleic acid encoding a protein involved in a mismatch repair pathway. e.g., MSH2, MutLalpha, MutSbeta, MutLalpha. Non-limiting examples of proteins involved in mismatch repair pathways, for which mRNAs encoding such proteins may be targeted by oligonucleotides described herein, are described in Iver, R. R. et al., &#x201c;<i>DNA triplet repeat expansion and mismatch repair</i>&#x201d; Annu Rev Biochem. 2015; 84:199-226; and Schmidt M. H. and Pearson C. E., &#x201c;Disease-associated repeat instability and mismatch repair&#x201d; DNA Repair (Amst). 2016 February; 38:117-26.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0172">a. Oligonucleotide Size/Sequence</p><p id="p-0187" num="0173">Oligonucleotides may be of a variety of different lengths, e.g., depending on the format. In some embodiments, an oligonucleotide is 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 75, or more nucleotides in length. In a some embodiments, the oligonucleotide is 8 to 50 nucleotides in length, 8 to 40 nucleotides in length, 8 to 30 nucleotides in length, 10 to 15 nucleotides in length, 10 to 20 nucleotides in length, 15 to 25 nucleotides in length, 21 to 23 nucleotides in lengths, etc.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0174">In some embodiments, a complementary nucleic acid sequence of an oligonucleotide for purposes of the present disclosure is specifically hybridizable or specific for the target nucleic acid when binding of the sequence to the target molecule (e.g., mRNA) interferes with the function of the target (e.g., mRNA) to cause a change of activity (e.g., inhibiting translation, altering splicing, exon skipping) or expression (e.g., degrading a target mRNA) and there is a sufficient degree of complementarity to avoid non-specific binding of the sequence to non-target sequences under conditions in which avoidance of non-specific binding is desired, e.g., under physiological conditions in the case of in vivo assays or therapeutic treatment, and in the case of in vitro assays, under conditions in which the assays are performed under suitable conditions of stringency. Thus, in some embodiments, an oligonucleotide may be at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99% or 100% complementary to the consecutive nucleotides of an target nucleic acid. In some embodiments a complementary nucleotide sequence need not be 100% complementary to that of its target to be specifically hybridizable or specific for a target nucleic acid.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0175">In some embodiments, an oligonucleotide comprises region of complementarity to a target nucleic acid that is in the range of 8 to 15, 8 to 30, 8 to 40, or 10 to 50, or 5 to 50, or 5 to 40 nucleotides in length. In some embodiments, a region of complementarity of an oligonucleotide to a target nucleic acid is 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, or 50 nucleotides in length. In some embodiments, the region of complementarity is complementary with at least 8 consecutive nucleotides of a target nucleic acid. In some embodiments, an oligonucleotide may contain 1, 2 or 3 base mismatches compared to the portion of the consecutive nucleotides of target nucleic acid. In some embodiments the oligonucleotide may have up to 3 mismatches over 15 bases, or up to 2 mismatches over 10 bases.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0176">b. Oligonucleotide Modifications:</p><p id="p-0191" num="0177">The oligonucleotides described herein may be modified, e.g., comprise a modified sugar moiety, a modified internucleoside linkage, a modified nucleotide and/or combinations thereof. In addition, in some embodiments, oligonucleotides may exhibit one or more of the following properties: do not mediate alternative splicing; are not immune stimulatory; are nuclease resistant; have improved cell uptake compared to unmodified oligonucleotides; are not toxic to cells or mammals; have improved endosomal exit internally in a cell; minimizes TLR stimulation; or avoid pattern recognition receptors. Any of the modified chemistries or formats of oligonucleotides described herein can be combined with each other.

Mixmers generally have higher binding affinity than unmodified oligonucleotides and may be used to specifically bind a target molecule, e.g., to block a binding site on the target molecule. Generally, mixmers do not recruit an RNAse to the target molecule and thus do not promote cleavage of the target molecule.

RNA Interference (RNAi)</p><p id="p-0226" num="0212">In some embodiments, oligonucleotides provided herein may be in the form of small interfering RNAs (siRNA), also known as short interfering RNA or silencing RNA. SiRNA, is a class of double-stranded RNA molecules, typically about 20-25 base pairs in length that target nucleic acids (e.g., mRNAs) for degradation via the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway in cells. Specificity of siRNA molecules may be determined by the binding of the antisense strand of the molecule to its target RNA. Effective siRNA molecules are generally less than 30 to 35 base pairs in length to prevent the triggering of non-specific RNA interference pathways in the cell via the interferon response, although longer siRNA can also be effective.</p><p id="p-0227" num="0213">Following selection of an appropriate target RNA sequence, siRNA molecules that comprise a nucleotide sequence complementary to all or a portion of the target sequence, i.e. an antisense sequence, can be designed and prepared using appropriate methods (see, e.g., PCT Publication Number WO 2004/016735; and U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 2004/0077574 and 2008/0081791).</p><p id="p-0228" num="0214">The siRNA molecule can be double stranded (i.e. a dsRNA molecule comprising an antisense strand and a complementary sense strand) or single-stranded (i.e. a ssRNA molecule comprising just an antisense strand). The siRNA molecules can comprise a duplex, asymmetric duplex, hairpin or asymmetric hairpin secondary structure, having self-complementary sense and antisense strands.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0215">Double-stranded siRNA may comprise RNA strands that are the same length or different lengths. Double-stranded siRNA molecules can also be assembled from a single oligonucleotide in a stem-loop structure, wherein self-complementary sense and antisense regions of the siRNA molecule are linked by means of a nucleic acid based or non-nucleic acid-based linker(s), as well as circular single-stranded RNA having two or more loop structures and a stem comprising self-complementary sense and antisense strands, wherein the circular RNA can be processed either in vivo or in vitro to generate an active siRNA molecule capable of mediating RNAi. Small hairpin RNA (shRNA) molecules thus are also contemplated herein. These molecules comprise a specific antisense sequence in addition to the reverse complement (sense) sequence, typically separated by a spacer or loop sequence. Cleavage of the spacer or loop provides a single-stranded RNA molecule and its reverse complement, such that they may anneal to form a dsRNA molecule (optionally with additional processing steps that may result in addition or removal of one, two, three or more nucleotides from the 3&#x2032; end and/or the 5&#x2032; end of either or both strands). A spacer can be of a sufficient length to permit the antisense and sense sequences to anneal and form a double-stranded structure (or stem) prior to cleavage of the spacer (and, optionally, subsequent processing steps that may result in addition or removal of one, two, three, four, or more nucleotides from the 3&#x2032; end and/or the 5&#x2032; end of either or both strands). A spacer sequence is may be an unrelated nucleotide sequence that is situated between two complementary nucleotide sequence regions which, when annealed into a double-stranded nucleic acid, comprise a shRNA.</p><p id="p-0230" num="0216">The overall length of the siRNA molecules can vary from about 14 to about 100 nucleotides depending on the type of siRNA molecule being designed. Generally between about 14 and about 50 of these nucleotides are complementary to the RNA target sequence, i.e. constitute the specific antisense sequence of the siRNA molecule. For example, when the siRNA is a double- or single-stranded siRNA, the length can vary from about 14 to about 50 nucleotides, whereas when the siRNA is a shRNA or circular molecule, the length can vary from about 40 nucleotides to about 100 nucleotides.</p><p id="p-0231" num="0217">An siRNA molecule may comprise a 3&#x2032; overhang at one end of the molecule, The other end may be blunt-ended or have also an overhang (5&#x2032; or 3&#x2032;). When the siRNA molecule comprises an overhang at both ends of the molecule, the length of the overhangs may be the same or different.

Typically, miRNAs are generated from large RNA precursors (termed pri-miRNAs) that are processed in the nucleus into approximately 70 nucleotide pre-miRNAs, which fold into imperfect stem-loop structures. These pre-miRNAs typically undergo an additional processing step within the cytoplasm where mature miRNAs of 18-25 nucleotides in length are excised from one side of the pre-miRNA hairpin by an RNase III enzyme, Dicer.</p><p id="p-0234" num="0220">As used herein, miRNAs including pri-miRNA, pre-miRNA, mature miRNA or fragments of variants thereof that retain the biological activity of mature miRNA.

Aptamers</p><p id="p-0236" num="0222">In some embodiments, oligonucleotides provided herein may be in the form of aptamers. Generally, in the context of molecular payloads, aptamer is any nucleic acid that binds specifically to a target, such as a small molecule, protein, nucleic acid in a cell. In some embodiments, the aptamer is a DNA aptamer or an RNA aptamer. In some embodiments, a nucleic acid aptamer is a single-stranded DNA or RNA (ssDNA or ssRNA). It is to be understood that a single-stranded nucleic acid aptamer may form helices and/or loop structures. The nucleic acid that forms the nucleic acid aptamer may comprise naturally occurring nucleotides, modified nucleotides, naturally occurring nucleotides with hydrocarbon linkers (e.g., an alkylene) or a polyether linker (e.g., a PEG linker) inserted between one or more nucleotides, modified nucleotides with hydrocarbon or PEG linkers inserted between one or more nucleotides, or a combination of thereof. Exemplary publications and patents describing aptamers and method of producing aptamers include, e.g., Lorsch and Szostak, 1996; Jayasena, 1999; U.S. Pat.

Ribozymes</p><p id="p-0238" num="0224">In some embodiments, oligonucleotides provided herein may be in the form of a ribozyme. A ribozyme (ribonucleic acid enzyme) is a molecule, typically an RNA molecule, that is capable of performing specific biochemical reactions, similar to the action of protein enzymes. Ribozymes are molecules with catalytic activities including the ability to cleave at specific phosphodiester linkages in RNA molecules to which they have hybridized, such as mRNAs, RNA-containing substrates, lncRNAs, and ribozymes, themselves.</p><p id="p-0239" num="0225">Ribozymes may assume one of several physical structures, one of which is called a &#x201c;hammerhead.&#x201d; A hammerhead ribozyme is composed of a catalytic core containing nine conserved bases, a double-stranded stem and loop structure (stem-loop II), and two regions complementary to the target RNA flanking regions the catalytic core. The flanking regions enable the ribozyme to bind to the target RNA specifically by forming double-stranded stems I and III. Cleavage occurs in cis (i.e., cleavage of the same RNA molecule that contains the hammerhead motif) or in trans (cleavage of an RNA substrate other than that containing the ribozyme) next to a specific ribonucleotide triplet by a transesterification reaction from a 3&#x2032;. 5&#x2032;-phosphate diester to a 2&#x2032;, 3&#x2032;-cyclic phosphate diester. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that this catalytic activity requires the presence of specific, highly conserved sequences in the catalytic region of the ribozyme.</p><p id="p-0240" num="0226">Modifications in ribozyme structure have also included the substitution or replacement of various non-core portions of the molecule with non-nucleotidic molecules. For example, Benseler et al. (J. Am. Chem. Soc. (1993) 115:8483-8484) disclosed hammerhead-like molecules in which two of the base pairs of stem II, and all four of the nucleotides of loop II were replaced with non-nucleoside linkers based on hexaethylene glycol, propanediol, bis(triethylene glycol) phosphate, tris(propanediol)bisphosphate, or bis(propanediol) phosphate. Ma et al. (Biochem. (1993) 32:1751-1758; Nucleic Acids Res. (1993) 21:2585-2589) replaced the six nucleotide loop of the TAR ribozyme hairpin with non-nucleotidic, ethylene glycol-related linkers. Thomson et al. (Nucleic Acids Res. (1993) 21:5600-5603) replaced loop II with linear, non-nucleotidic linkers of 13, 17, and 19 atoms in length.</p><p id="p-0241" num="0227">Ribozyme oligonucleotides can be prepared using well known methods (see. e.g., PCT Publications WO9118624; WO9413688; WO9201806; and WO 92/07065; and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,436,143 and 5,650,502) or can be purchased from commercial sources (e.g., U.S. Biochemicals) and, if desired, can incorporate nucleotide analogs to increase the resistance of the oligonucleotide to degradation by nucleases in a cell. The ribozyme may be synthesized in any known manner, e.g., by use of a commercially available synthesizer produced, e.g., by Applied Biosystems, Inc. or Milligen. The ribozyme may also be produced in recombinant vectors by conventional means. See, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (Current edition). The ribozyme RNA sequences may be synthesized conventionally, for example, by using RNA polymerases such as T7 or SP6.</p><p id="p-0242" num="0228">n. Guide Nucleic Acids</p><p id="p-0243" num="0229">In some embodiments, oligonucleotides are guide nucleic acid, e.g., guide RNA (gRNA) molecules. Generally, a guide RNA is a short synthetic RNA composed of (1) a scaffold sequence that binds to a nucleic acid programmable DNA binding protein (napDNAbp), such as Cas9, and (2) a nucleotide spacer portion that defines the DNA target sequence (e.g., genomic DNA target) to which the gRNA binds in order to bring the nucleic acid programmable DNA binding protein in proximity to the DNA target sequence. In some embodiments, the napDNAbp is a nucleic acid-programmable protein that forms a complex with (e.g., binds or associates with) one or more RNA(s) that targets the nucleic acid-programmable protein to a target DNA sequence (e.g., a target genomic DNA sequence). In some embodiments, a nucleic acid-programmable nuclease, when in a complex with an RNA, may be referred to as a nuclease:RNA complex. Guide RNAs can exist as a complex of two or more RNAs. or as a single RNA molecule.</p><p id="p-0244" num="0230">Guide RNAs (gRNAs) that exist as a single RNA molecule may be referred to as single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs), though gRNA is also used to refer to guide RNAs that exist as either single molecules or as a complex of two or more molecules. Typically, gRNAs that exist as a single RNA species comprise two domains: (1) a domain that shares homology to a target nucleic acid (i.e., directs binding of a Cas9 complex to the target); and (2) a domain that binds a Cas9 protein. In some embodiments, domain (2) corresponds to a sequence known as a tracrRNA and comprises a stem-loop structure. In some embodiments, domain (2) is identical or homologous to a tracrRNA as provided in Jinek et al., Science 337:816-821 (2012), the entire contents of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0245" num="0231">In some embodiments, a gRNA comprises two or more of domains (1) and (2), and may be referred to as an extended gRNA. For example, an extended gRNA will bind two or more Cas9 proteins and bind a target nucleic acid at two or more distinct regions, as described herein. The gRNA comprises a nucleotide sequence that complements a target site, which mediates binding of the nuclease/RNA complex to said target site, providing the sequence specificity of the nuclease:RNA complex. In some embodiments, the RNA-programmable nuclease is the (CRISPR-associated system) Cas9 endonuclease, for example, Cas9 (Csn1) from <i>Streptococcus pyogenes </i>(see, e.g., &#x201c;Complete genome sequence of an M1 strain of <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i>.&#x201d; Ferretti J.

Completion of the reaction was verified by Kaiser test. Excess linker and organic solvents were removed by gel permeation chromatography. The purified, maleimide functionalized sense strand of siHPRT was then coupled to DTX-A-002 antibody using a Michael addition reaction.</p><p id="p-0332" num="0305">The product of the antibody coupling reaction was then subjected to hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC-HPLC), antiTfR-siHPRT complexes comprising one or two siHPRT molecules covalently attached to DTX-A-002 antibody were purified. Densitometry confirmed that the purified sample of complexes had an average siHPRT to antibody ratio of 1.46. SDS-PAGE analysis demonstrated that &#x3e;90% of the purified sample of complexes comprised DTX-A-002 linked to either one or two siHPRT molecules.</p><p id="p-0333" num="0306">Using the same methods as described above, a control IgG2a-siHPRT complex was generated comprising the HPRT siRNA used in Example 1 (siHPRT) covalently linked via the GMBS linker to an IgG2a (Fab) antibody (DTX-A-003). Densitometry confirmed that DTX-C-001 had an average siHPRT to antibody ratio of 1.46 and SDS-PAGE demonstrated that &#x3e;90% of the purified sample of control complexes comprised DTX-A-003 linked to either one or two siHPRT molecules.</p><p id="p-0334" num="0307">The antiTfR-siHPRT complex was then tested for cellular internalization and inhibition of HPRT in cellulo. Hepa 1-6 cells, which have relatively high expression levels of transferrin receptor, were incubated in the presence of vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline), IgG2a-siHPRT (100 nM), antiTfR-siCTRL (100 nM), or antiTfR-siHPRT (100 nM), for 72 hours. After the 72 hour incubation, the cells were isolated and assayed for expression levels of HPRT (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). Cells treated with the antiTfR-siHPRT demonstrated a reduction in HPRT expression by &#x2dc;50% relative to the cells treated with the vehicle control. Meanwhile, cells treated with either of the IgG2a-siHPRT or antiTfR-siCTRL had HPRT expression levels comparable to the vehicle control (no reduction in HPRT expression). These data indicate that the anti-transferrin receptor antibody of the antiTfR-siHPRT enabled cellular internalization of the complex, thereby allowing the siHPRT to inhibit expression of HPRT.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="1">Example 3: Targeting HPRT in Mouse Muscle Tissues with a Muscle-Targeting Complex</heading><p id="p-0335" num="0308">The muscle-targeting complex described in Example 2, antiTfR-siHPRT, was tested for inhibition of HPRT in mouse tissues.

These data indicate that the anti-transferrin receptor antibody of the antiTfR-siHPRT complex enabled cellular internalization of the complex into muscle-specific tissues in an in vivo mouse model, thereby allowing the siHPRT to inhibit expression of HPRT.
