In one or more implementations, structures and components are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the concepts of the subject technology.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">As smart devices proliferate into homes and vehicles, the use of physical keys to access homes, vehicles, etc. may give way to the use of digital keys stored on electronic devices, such as watches, phones, tablets, etc. For example, a user may open a lock on a door to their house and/or car using their phone (e.g., instead of a physical key). As physical keys move towards obsolescence, so too may the traditional manner of revoking access to a home and/or vehicle from another person, e.g. asking the person to hand over their copy of the physical key for accessing the home and/or vehicle.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Since digital keys can often be copied with relative ease, and then provided to a home or vehicle as the original valid digital key (assuming the digital key has not expired), removing or deleting a digital key from an electronic device may not have the same security effect as receiving a physical copy of a key back from a person. Thus, the subject system provides various mechanisms for revoking digital keys that have been granted to another person and/or device, as well as a synchronization system that ensures that a secure device, such as a home or a vehicle, does not accept a revoked (but unexpired) digital key as the original valid digital key.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example network environment <b>100</b> in which a digital credential revocation system may be implemented in accordance with one or more implementations.

In this regard, the secure devices <b>104</b>A-B may also maintain a revocation list of revoked digital credentials (and/or corresponding identifiers) in order to ensure that a revoked digital credential (or copy thereof) is not used to access the secure devices <b>104</b>A-B. However, since the digital credentials can be revoked prior to their expiration time, the secure devices <b>104</b>A-B may not be able to differentiate between a valid digital credential and a digital credential that has been revoked prior to its expiration time. Thus, if the electronic device <b>102</b>A keeps a copy of a digital credential (after the digital credential has been revoked but before the digital credential's expiration time), the electronic device <b>102</b>A may be able to use the digital credential to improperly access one or more of the secure devices <b>104</b>A-B.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Thus, the subject system implements a synchronization counter value that is separately maintained by the owner electronic device <b>102</b>A and the corresponding secure devices <b>104</b>A-B.

Such personal information data can include financial data, demographic data, location-based data, telephone numbers, email addresses, twitter ID's, home addresses, data or records relating to a user's health or level of fitness (e.g., vital signs measurements, medication information, exercise information), date of birth, or any other identifying or personal information.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The present disclosure recognizes that the use of such personal information data, in the present technology, can be used to the benefit of users. For example, the personal information data can be used to deliver targeted content that is of greater interest to the user. Accordingly, use of such personal information data enables users to calculated control of the delivered content. Further, other uses for personal information data that benefit the user are also contemplated by the present disclosure. For instance, health and fitness data may be used to provide insights into a user's general wellness, or may be used as positive feedback to individuals using technology to pursue wellness goals.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">The present disclosure contemplates that the entities responsible for the collection, analysis, disclosure, transfer, storage, or other use of such personal information data will comply with well-established privacy policies and/or privacy practices. In particular, such entities should implement and consistently use privacy policies and practices that are generally recognized as meeting or exceeding industry or governmental requirements for maintaining personal information data private and secure. Such policies should be easily accessible by users, and should be updated as the collection and/or use of data changes. Personal information from users should be collected for legitimate and reasonable uses of the entity and not shared or sold outside of those legitimate uses. Further, such collection/sharing should occur after receiving the informed consent of the users. Additionally, such entities should consider taking any needed steps for safeguarding and securing access to such personal information data and ensuring that others with access to the personal information data adhere to their privacy policies and procedures. Further, such entities can subject themselves to evaluation by third parties to certify their adherence to widely accepted privacy policies and practices. In addition, policies and practices should be adapted for the particular types of personal information data being collected and/or accessed and adapted to applicable laws and standards, including jurisdiction-specific considerations. For instance, in the US, collection of, or access to, certain health data may be governed by federal and/or state laws, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA); whereas health data in other countries may be subject to other regulations and policies and should be handled accordingly. Hence different privacy practices should be maintained for different personal data types in each country.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">Despite the foregoing, the present disclosure also contemplates embodiments in which users selectively block the use of, or access to, personal information data. That is, the present disclosure contemplates that hardware and/or software elements can be provided to prevent or block access to such personal information data. For example, in the case of advertisement delivery services, the present technology can be configured to allow users to select to &#x201c;opt in&#x201d; or &#x201c;opt out&#x201d; of participation in the collection of personal information data during registration for services or anytime thereafter. In another example, users can select not to provide mood-associated data for targeted content delivery services. In yet another example, users can select to limit the length of time mood-associated data is maintained or entirely prohibit the development of a baseline mood profile. In addition to providing &#x201c;opt in&#x201d; and &#x201c;opt out&#x201d; options, the present disclosure contemplates providing notifications relating to the access or use of personal information. For instance, a user may be notified upon downloading an app that their personal information data will be accessed and then reminded again just before personal information data is accessed by the app.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Moreover, it is the intent of the present disclosure that personal information data should be managed and handled in a way to minimize risks of unintentional or unauthorized access or use. Risk can be minimized by limiting the collection of data and deleting data once it is no longer needed. In addition, and when applicable, including in certain health related applications, data de-identification can be used to protect a user's privacy. De-identification may be facilitated, when appropriate, by removing specific identifiers (e.g., date of birth, etc.), controlling the amount or specificity of data stored (e.g., collecting location data a city level rather than at an address level), controlling how data is stored (e.g., aggregating data across users), and/or other methods.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Therefore, although the present disclosure broadly covers use of personal information data to implement one or more various disclosed embodiments, the present disclosure also contemplates that the various embodiments can also be implemented without the need for accessing such personal information data. That is, the various embodiments of the present technology are not rendered inoperable due to the lack of all or a portion of such personal information data. For example, content can be selected and delivered to users by inferring preferences based on non-personal information data or a bare minimum amount of personal information, such as the content being requested by the device associated with a user, other non-personal information available to the content delivery services, or publicly available information.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Implementations within the scope of the present disclosure can be partially or entirely realized using a tangible computer-readable storage medium (or multiple tangible computer-readable storage media of one or more types) encoding one or more instructions.

In one or more implementations, the tangible computer-readable storage medium can be directly coupled to a computing device, while in other implementations, the tangible computer-readable storage medium can be indirectly coupled to a computing device, e.g., via one or more wired connections, one or more wireless connections, or any combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">Instructions can be directly executable or can be used to develop executable instructions. For example, instructions can be realized as executable or non-executable machine code or as instructions in a high-level language that can be compiled to produce executable or non-executable machine code.
