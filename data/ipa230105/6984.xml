In situations where the user is not the owner of the other device (e.g., a public device), the connection process can be cumbersome. For example, the user may not seamlessly be able to connect to the secondary device. While traditional computer processors may receive/transmit connection requests, these systems still fail to solve the aforementioned problem when implemented in computer systems as they fail to account for the issues created when a user is attempting to connect to a public device, namely: (i) the device the user is attempting to connect to is incompatible with the user's media device; (ii) the device may not be detectable to the user's media device; (iii) the connection process may require an amount of processing that the user's device/the secondary device cannot sustain/withstand; (iv) the device the user is attempting to connect to does not have the proper applications to access the media content because it is not previously configured by the user; (v) the devices have poor connectivity; and/or (vi) the connection poses security risks. Conventional solutions to these problems rely on the use of dongles inserted into the secondary device or require the secondary device to have particular hardware, or pre-installed software, compatible with hardware or software of a user's device. Thus, these conventional solutions require the user to have access to the secondary device (e.g., to insert a dongle) and/or are limited to secondary devices with a particular hardware and/or software configuration.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Accordingly, to overcome the problems in computer systems when connecting a private device to a public device, systems and methods are described herein for a media guidance application that identifies public devices, bridges the communication between the private device of the user and the public device, and connects the respective devices without requiring the user to have access to the secondary device (e.g., to insert a dongle) and/or requiring the secondary devices to have a particular hardware and/or software configuration. These solutions are provided for through the use of specialized authorization keys.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, a user may wish to connect his/her smartphone to a public display in a mall. A media guidance application, installed on the user's smartphone or on an external server, may communicate with the public display, requesting to connect the public display with the user's smartphone. In response to receiving the request to connect and authenticating the user's credentials (e.g., to retrieve information/content if necessary), the public display may generate an authorization key that enables communication between the user's smartphone and the public display and may transmit the authorization key to the user's smartphone. Specifically, the authorization key may consist of connection parameters (e.g., information about minimum data transfer rates, time limits, predetermined proximity requirements, etc.) to ensure a secure, stable, and easy-to-initiate connection. These connection parameters, selected based on the situation or the desire connection goal, provide the aforementioned solutions. For example, the user's smartphone may accordingly be able to send commands (e.g., generate for display content, browse the Internet, communicate with an external device, etc.) in conjunction with the authorization key, to the public display. The media guidance application may moderate the connection between the respective devices by validating the authorization key when a command is received at the public device. In response to determining that the authorization key is valid, the public device may execute the command (e.g., display a requested media asset).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In some aspects, a media guidance application may receive a communication from a private device, implementing a private interface application, indicating that a user wishes to use a public device. The private device may be any electronic device that the user has access to and/or owns, and that is capable of communicating with other devices. The public device may be any electronic device that is available for access by several users and is capable of communicating with other devices. Examples of private and public devices include, but are not limited to, displays, smartphones, smartwatches, smart speakers, computers, biometric devices, video game consoles, etc. The communication received from the private device may be in the form of a communication protocol data unit (e.g., a packet, a frame, a cell, etc.) in which the destination of the data unit is the communication address of the public device.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some embodiments, the communication from the private device is transmitted to the public device in response to receiving, at the private device, a broadcast message inviting the private device to access the public device. In some embodiments, the broadcast message inviting the private device to access the public device is transmitted by the public device, in response to determining that the private device is within a predetermined displacement from the public device. For example, the public device may broadcast discovery messages in order to detect devices. In response, the public device may receive acknowledgment responses with received signal strength indicator (RSSI) values from the devices that received the discovery message. The media guidance application may determine, using a lookup table which returns distance as a function of RSSI, the distance between the public device and the acknowledging device. In response to determining that the distance is within a predetermined displacement from the public device, the media guidance application of the public device may transmit the message inviting the acknowledging device (e.g., the user's private device) to access the public device. In some embodiments, the distance between the public and private device may be determined using the difference of their respective GPS coordinates, using NFC technology.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">For example, if the private device is the user's smartphone, on which the media guidance application is installed, the private interface application (e.g., the YouTube mobile app, the Spotify app, etc.) may be either stored or actively running on the private device. The user may specifically wish to transmit, from the private device to the public device, a command that is associated with the private interface application. In some embodiments, the media guidance application may display information about all public devices available for access in the vicinity of the private device. For example, the media guidance application may provide a map/list of the public devices nearby and may allow the user to select a public device in order to send a request to connect. It should be noted that the media guidance application may be installed on a remote server, instead of the user's device. Accordingly, the remote server may communicate with the private device in order to provide the list/map of accessible public devices in the user's vicinity. Furthermore, the media guidance application may be integrated with the private interface application. Thus, the user may be able to view the map/list from the private interface application directly. In another example, if the public device is a large touchscreen display located in a mall, the public display may receive the user's request to connect from the user's smartphone. The communication between the private device and the public device may be implemented over various communication infrastructures including, but not limited to, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular networks, wired connections (e.g., Ethernet), etc. Various servers, routers, switches, hubs, etc., may serve as intermediate devices configured to pass data between the public device and the private device.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, the public device and the private device may not be compatible. For example, the public device may be a public display with a Windows&#x2122;-based operating system and the private device may be a smartphone with an iOS&#x2122;-based operating system. In some cases, the two respective devices may be unable to communicate due to their differences in programming. As a result, the media guidance application may determine that the private device is of a first operating system type and the public device is of a second operating system type. The media guidance application may determine that the first operating system type is incompatible with the second operating system type. In response to receiving a first message (e.g., command, request, data packet) that is encoded using the first operating system type by the private interface application and is to be sent to the public device, the media guidance application may translate the content of the first message and generate a second message encoded using the second operating system type that includes the content of the first message. The media guidance application may then record the first message in a log and may transmit the second message to the public device.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The media guidance application may request, from the private device, both user authorization information and an identifier for the private interface application. In response to the user making a selection of the public device, the media guidance application may create a temporary connection between the private device and the public device. The temporary connection may allow the private device and the public device to communicate without providing access to the functionality of either device (e.g., the ability to access and display the content). Accordingly, the private device may receive, from either the public device or a remote server with the media guidance application, a request for user authorization information and an identifier of the private interface application. The user authorization information may comprise data required to verify the user's identity with the content provider. For example, the user authorization information may list the subscriptions the user possesses and the respective login keys (e.g., username, password, security questions, PIN codes, etc.) to access the subscriptions. The identifier of the private interface application may be any descriptive attribute of the private interface application including, but not limited to, a name, a logo, a developer name, software details (e.g., build number, version, compatible operating system), a screenshot of the user interface, etc. It should be noted that the identifier may comprise a combination of descriptive attributes. For example, an identifier may include the name of a content provider (e.g., Netflix&#x2122;) associated with the private interface application, the version of the private interface application (e.g., version 5.6), and the compatible operating systems (e.g., iOS&#x2122;, Android&#x2122;). Thus, in this example, the identifier that the private device may provide to the public device is &#x201c;Netflix&#x2122;, Android&#x2122; application version 5.6.&#x201d; It should be noted that the content provider may be a third-party source (e.g., Google&#x2122; Play Store, App Store) as well.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, the user authorization information may be stored on a server. The public device may scan the user's face and/or fingerprint and run facial/fingerprint recognition analysis using a facial/fingerprint database that may be stored on the server. In response to identifying a match, the media guidance application may retrieve the user authorization information associated with the match.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The media guidance application may then generate, at the public device, an authorization key unique to the private device based on (i) the user authorization information, (ii) the identifier and (iii) connection parameters, wherein the authorization key is required to cause the public device to execute commands received from the private device during a session. Continuing from the previous example, suppose that the identifier for the private interface application is &#x201c;Netflix&#x2122;, Android&#x2122; application version 5.6.&#x201d; The user authorization information may thus comprise a username and password to the user's Netflix&#x2122; account. The connection parameters represent conditions that must be met in order to maintain the connection between the public device and the private device. For example, the connection parameters may comprise a predetermined proximity to the public device, within which the private device must remain in order for the authorization key to remain valid. The connection parameters may comprise restrictions on certain commands that the user may request. For example, the user may request that the public device perform a task that demands heavy processing as it requires high-end graphics (e.g., the command may be to generate for display a video game). In this example, the public device cannot generate for display the video game because the requirements of the video game exceed the public device's technical capabilities. For example, the public device may have limitations in CPU processing power, memory, graphics (e.g., resolution), or connectivity (e.g., network bandwidth). In the absence of connection parameters, the public device may get damaged while trying to generate for display the video game (e.g., may cause corrupted files and/or overheating at the motherboard).</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Accordingly, the media guidance application may take the public device's technical capabilities into consideration and limit the user to commands that the public device can implement, information about which may be included in the connection parameters. Similarly, the connection parameters may include information such as the connection type (e.g., Wi-Fi, cellular data, etc.) established between the private device and public device, the location of the respective devices, time limits for accessing the public device (e.g., allow the connection between the public device and the private device for one hour only), etc. The authorization key may be encrypted by symmetric and/or public/private encryption method. This provides security and prevents other devices from sending commands on behalf of the private device. An example of an authorization key may be &#x201c;AUTH:username-password_ID:identifierPARA:parameters.&#x201d; Therefore, if the username of a user is &#x201c;user123,&#x201d; the password is &#x201c;pass123,&#x201d; the identifier is &#x201c;Netflix&#x2122;, Android&#x2122; application version 5.6,&#x201d; and the connection parameters include a predetermined proximity, the private device serial number, public device serial number, connection type, minimum data transfer rate, and time limit (e.g., 5m-private123-public321-bluetooth-100 kbps-60 min), the authorization key in its entirety may be &#x201c;AUTH:user123-pass123_ID:Netflix&#x2122;[Android&#x2122;, v5.6]_PARA: 5m-private123-public321-bluetooth-100 kbps-60 min.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some embodiments, the user may not need to provide user authorization information because the user may be interested in accessing a publicly accessible application on the public device. For example, if the user possesses a cellphone that does not have smartphone features, the user may wish to read the news, look up the weather, or browse the Internet. Accordingly, the user may not be able to perform those tasks on the private device and also does not need authorization information to pull up the user's profile (e.g., Netflix&#x2122; account with preferences). Thus, when the media guidance application requests user authorization information, the user may not provide user authorization information. In response, the media guidance application may not include user authorization information in the authorization key (e.g., leave the text after &#x201c;AUTH&#x201d; empty).</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The media guidance application may then transmit, to the private device, the authorization key and in response to transmitting the authorization key, the media guidance application may initiate a session, at the public device, with the private device. The session may be a formal connection between the public device and the private device in which commands can be exchanged between the respective devices. The formal connection may be established over various communication infrastructures including, but not limited to, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular networks, wired connections (e.g., Ethernet), etc. It should be noted that the authorization key is required to execute commands, at the public device, received from the private device during the session.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The media guidance application may then receive, at the public device, a first communication from the private interface application. The media guidance application may parse, at the public device, the first communication to identify the authorization key and a command to execute on the public device. The command is a task that the user assigns to the public device. Furthermore, the command may be associated specifically with the private interface application. For example, if the private interface application is a video streaming application such as the Netflix&#x2122; mobile app, the user may initiate a first communication with the public device by sending a command that requests that the public device download a public interface application (e.g., a corresponding Netflix&#x2122; application) that is compatible with the private interface application. The command may also be to change a setting of the public device (e.g., increase volume, decrease brightness, etc.). The commands may be transmitted as text from the private device to the public device, verbally from the user to the public device, via gestures or any visual indication of a command from the user/private device to the public device, or biometric changes (e.g., changes in heart rate, tightening of muscles, etc.). It should be noted that not all public devices may have displays (e.g., smart speakers, augmented reality devices, hologram generators, etc.). For those particular public devices, an appropriate user interface that is compatible with the public device and allows user interaction via the private interface application may be used. Based on the examples listed above, these substitute user interfaces may be an audio user interface (e.g., where a menu is read aloud to the user), augmented reality user interface (e.g., allows the user to see an augmented reality screen via the private device), or a holographic projection user interface (e.g., where the menu is projected). In some embodiments, the private interface application and/or the public interface application may be browser-based (e.g., implemented in HTML5).</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The media guidance application may then validate, at the public device, the authorization key. Validating the authorization key may involve two steps: (1) determining whether the authorization key received from the private device matches the authorization key transmitted by the public device to the private device and (2) determining whether the connection parameters are satisfied. For example, the media guidance application may store a copy of the authorization key for a threshold time (e.g., three minutes) when transmitting the authorization key to the private device. Thus, the private device must send a command within the threshold time before the media guidance application erases the authorization key from the memory of the public device. In response to receiving a command (e.g., as a first communication), the media guidance application may decrypt the authorization key at the public device and determine whether the received authorization key matches the authorization key in the memory of the public device. If the respective authorization keys match, the media guidance application may determine whether the connection parameters of the authorization key are satisfied (e.g., whether the connection type is the same, the data transfer rate is locked to a threshold speed, the private device is within the predetermined proximity, the time elapsed within the time limit, etc.). If the received authorization key matches and each connection parameter is satisfied, the media guidance application may validate the authorization key. In response to validating the authorization key, the media guidance application may execute, at the public device, the command. For example, the command may be to generate for display, on the public device, a media asset selected on the private interface application (e.g., a movie selected on the Netflix&#x2122; mobile application).</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some embodiments, the authorization key may be different for each communication exchanged between the public device and the private device (e.g., in order to improve security). For example, the authorization key may additionally comprise a timestamp in order to allow the media guidance application to determine the order at which communications were received and also to distinguish each private device that may be sending communications to the public device (e.g., when multiple private devices are connected to the public device). In response to the initiation of a session between the public device and the private device, the media guidance application of the private device may begin sending commands from the private interface application to the public device. The authorization key previously sent by the public device may accompany the command from the private device. In response to receiving the command and the authorization key, the media guidance application may parse the authorization key to determine whether it matches the authorization key generated at the public device. In response to determining a match, the media guidance application of the public device may execute the command sent by the private interface application. In response to determining that the authorization key does not match, the media guidance application of the public device may end the session. Furthermore, the media guidance application of the public device may generate a new authorization key and transmit the new authorization key to the private device, in response to receiving a command from the private interface application that is accompanied by an authorization key that matches the authorization previously transmitted by the public device.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some embodiments, the connection parameters may comprise a predetermined proximity to the public device within which the private device must remain in order for the authorization key to remain valid (e.g., in order to prevent a user from connecting to a device to which he/she cannot view or use). The predetermined proximity may be a physical distance/displacement that represents the furthest point the private device can be from the public device in a particular direction. For simplicity, the predetermined proximity may be interpreted as a connection &#x201c;sphere&#x201d; of a certain radius (e.g., five meters). Accordingly, the private device may be up to five meters from the public device in any direction in order for the private interface application to communicate with the public interface application. Due to the presence of obstacles (e.g., walls, objects, etc.), the predetermined proximity may not be the same in all directions. For example, the predetermined proximity perpendicular to the display of the public device and parallel to the floor may be five meters. However, the predetermined proximity perpendicular to the floor and the display of the public device (e.g., pointing upwards) may be three meters due to the presence of a ceiling (e.g., the ceiling may significantly reduce the signal strength). The public device may further generate, for display/audio, the predetermined proximity for the user on the public device.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The media guidance application may generate, at the public device, the authorization key by retrieving a device identifier of the private device (e.g., in order to precisely identify the user and/or data associated with the user). The device identifier may be a descriptive attribute of the private device such as at least one of the device name, device type, model number, serial number, manufacturer name, battery life, etc. Multiple descriptive attributes may make up a device identifier. For example, if the private device's manufacturer is Google, the name of the device is Pixel XL, the model number is 2, and the serial number is 12345, the device identifier may be &#x201c;Google Pixel XL 2, 12345.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The media guidance application may then determine a connection strength between the private device and the public device (e.g., in order to ensure the quality of the connection). The connection strength may be a quantitative or qualitative value that represents the quality of the connection between two or more devices. The connection strength may be described using data transfer rates (e.g., download/upload speeds) or signal power. For example, if the connection strength is a quantitative value, the media guidance application may transmit a test message from the private device to the public device and measure, at the public device, the download transfer rate (e.g., megabytes per second). The media guidance application may then send a test message from the public device to the private device, and may measure, at the private device, the download transfer rate. It should be noted that the transfer rates at the public device and the private device are with respect to each other only. For example, the private device may have a general download transfer rate when connected to a different device, and the general download transfer rate may be different from the transfer rate with the public device. In response to determining the respective download transfer rates at each respective device, the media guidance application may determine the average download transfer rate between the respective devices. The average download transfer rate (e.g., 5 Mbps) may represent the connection strength. A similar procedure may be used by the media guidance application to determine the average upload transfer rate, which may also be used to represent the connection strength. In some embodiments, the media guidance application may determine the connection strength by determining that average transfer rate by averaging the average download transfer rate and the average upload transfer rate. In some embodiments, the connection strength may be represented by the lowest transfer rate between the respective devices. For example, if the upload transfer rates of the private device and the public device are 2 Mbps and 3 Mbps, respectively, and the download transfer rates are 10 Mbps and 15 Mbps, respectively, the connection strength may be represented as 2 Mbps.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">When the connection strength is represented qualitatively, the media guidance application may determine the quantitative value of the signal strength/transfer rate and refer to data structure that converts the quantitative value to a qualitative value. For example, the data in the data structure may be predetermined by the media guidance application. Furthermore, each quantitative range may represent a qualitative value. In this example, there may be five qualitative classifications of the connection strength: poor, below average, average, above average, and strong. In terms of transfer rates, the respective transfer rate ranges for each classification may be 0-0.5 Mbps, 0.5-1 Mbps, 1 Mbps-3 Mbps, 3 Mbps-5 Mbps, and 5+ Mbps. In terms of signal power, the respective signal power ranges may be &#x2212;113-&#x2212;100 dBm, &#x2212;100-&#x2212;80 dBm, etc.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The media guidance application may then determine the predetermined proximity, based on the device identifier and the connection strength (e.g., to ensure that a connection is maintained between the respective devices). For example, the media guidance application may retrieve, using the device identifier, additional information about the private device. The additional information may include technical details about the private device such as compatible connection types (e.g., Bluetooth, cellular, Wi-Fi, etc.) and processing capabilities (e.g., from a processer chip specification). Using this information, alongside the connection strength, the media guidance application may determine a maximum distance that the private device can be from the public device without dropping the connection strength or causing the private device to exhaust processing.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some embodiments, the media guidance application may receive, at the public device, a received signal strength indicator (RSSI) from the private device. The media guidance application may set the RSSI value as the connection strength. An RSSI represents the power of a received signal. The media guidance application may then approximate a distance between the public device and the private device. For example, the media guidance application may determine that the RSSI of the original transmitted signal is 0 and the RSSI received at the private device is &#x2212;20. The media guidance application may determine, using a lookup table that returns distance as a function of RSSI, the distance between the private device and the public device.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The user authorization information may comprise a user profile. Accordingly, the media guidance application may also determine an application usage history based on the user profile. For example, the application usage history may list all of the applications the user has accessed in a period of time. Alongside listing the application name, the application usage history may track the amount of time the user spent accessing an application, and the number of times the user has accessed the application. The media guidance application may then determine an anticipated processing ratio between the private device and the public device, based on the application usage history and the device identifier. The purpose of determining an anticipated processing ratio between the respective devices is to balance the processing requirements between the public device and the private device. For example, the private and public devices may be capable of load-sharing processing. Suppose that multiple private devices are connected to the public device. In order to ensure that a user's command is executed at the public device, the public device may reserve a certain amount of processing power for the user and assign additional processing to the private device.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some embodiments, determining the anticipated processing ratio between the private device and the public device further comprises the media guidance application determining a first processing limit of the private device based on the device identifier and a second processing limit of the public device. For example, the device identifier of the private device may be &#x201c;Google Pixel XL 2.&#x201d; The media guidance application may retrieve additional information about the private device using the Internet. Specifically, the media guidance application may determine that the private device is a smartphone with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processing chip and 4 gigabytes of RAM. Based on the additional information retrieved using the device identifier, the media guidance application may set the first processing limit to 4 GB RAM at 2.35 GHz. In this example, the technical capabilities of the public device are 8 GB RAM at 2.5 GHz (e.g., which may be set as the second processing limit). The media guidance application may determine an average processing requirement associated with at least one application in the application usage history. For example, the media guidance application may select the private interface application as the at least one application in the application usage history and retrieve metadata associated with the private interface application. The metadata may list the average processing requirement of the private interface application. For example, the average processing requirement of the Netflix&#x2122; mobile application may be 512 MB RAM at 1.8 GHz. In some embodiments, the media guidance application may determine the likelihood of the user accessing an application listed in the application usage history. For example, the media guidance application may use a probability model as a function of frequency of usage, total amount of times accessed, and the time length of each access, in order to determine the likelihood of the user accessing an application. The media guidance application may then select the application with the highest likelihood and determine its average processing requirement. In some embodiments, the media guidance application may determine the average processing requirement by averaging the processing requirements of all applications listed in the application usage history. In some embodiments, the media guidance application may identify the application with the highest processing requirement and set the respective processing requirement as the average processing requirement.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Furthermore, the media guidance application may identify power consumption information of the private device based on the device identifier. For example, the additional information retrieved by the media guidance application based on the device identifier, may include the maximum battery capacity of the private device. For example, the battery capacity of the private device may be 3,520 mAh. In this example, the device identifier lists the battery life of the private device as 80% battery remaining. The media guidance application may determine that the power consumption information indicates a remaining battery of 80% of 3,520 mAh (i.e., 2816 mAh). In addition, the power consumption information may indicate the amount of time the remaining battery can be used when the private device is functioning at a specific processing scheme. For example, the power consumption information may indicate the private device's battery will remain charged (e.g., above 0%) for 0.5 hours when utilizing 3 GB RAM and 1.5 GHz of processing.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The media guidance application may thus determine a first anticipated processing load for the private device, based on the power consumption information and the first processing limit (e.g., to balance the processing requirements for executing a command). Additionally, the media guidance application may determine a second anticipated processing load for the public device, wherein a sum of the first anticipated processing load and the second anticipated processing load is greater than or equal to the average processing requirement. For example, the private interface application is the Netflix&#x2122; mobile application and the user will send commands based on the Netflix&#x2122; mobile application (e.g., mirroring the application, downloading a public interface application associated with the private interface application, etc.). The average processing requirement for the private interface application and/or the public interface application of Netflix&#x2122; may have an average processing requirement of 512 MB RAM at 1.8 GHz. The media guidance application may allocate 256 MB RAM and 1.8 GHz of the second processing limit for the public device. Similarly, the media guidance application may allocate 256 MB RAM and 1.8 GHz of the first processing limit for the private device. This may ensure that anticipated commands from the user are executed. It should be noted that the sum of the respective anticipated processing loads equals the average processing requirement. In some embodiments, the media guidance application may allocate the entire average processing requirement as the second anticipated processing load. This minimizes the processing that must be performed at the private device and reduces the amount of communication that must be carried out between the public device and the private device. In conditions where the average processing requirement is less than the second processing limit, the media guidance application may treat the public device as a thick client for heavy processing duties and may treat the private device as a thin client for sending basic communications (e.g., exchanging commands and processing status information).</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments, the media guidance application may determine that a second private device is connected with the public device (e.g., in order to allow multiple private devices to share a public device). Accordingly, the second processing limit of the public device may be lower than the maximum processing capabilities of the public device because the media guidance application may previously have allocated a third anticipated processing load for the public device. Therefore, the media guidance application may determine the second anticipated processing load based on the remaining processing capabilities of the public device and allocate the rest to the first private device as the first anticipated processing load.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The media guidance application may then determine the anticipated processing ratio between the private device and the public device, based on the first anticipated processing load and the second anticipated processing load. For example, the media guidance application may determine a percentage of the average processing requirement that was allocated to the public device and a percentage that was allocated to the private device. In the previous example, both devices were allocated an equal anticipated processing load (e.g., 50% each). The anticipated processing ratio of the private device to the public device is therefore 50:50 (i.e., 1:1). In another example, the percentage for the public device is 70% and the percentage for the private device is 30%. The anticipated processing ratio would thus be 30:70 (i.e., 3:7). In some embodiments, the anticipated processing ratio may be of the public device to the private device (e.g., 70:30).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In terms of determining the predetermined proximity, the media guidance application may then determine a radial displacement between the private device and the public device, wherein when the private device is a distance, less than or equal to the radial displacement, from the public device, (i) the connection strength does not decrease by more than a degradation threshold and (ii) the anticipated processing ratio does not increase by more than a processing limit threshold. For example, the distance, between the private device and the public device at which the connection strength (e.g., &#x201c;good&#x201d;) is determined, may be three meters. The media guidance application may determine a radial displacement representing the farthest the private device can be from the public device without reducing the connection strength by a degradation threshold. The degradation threshold may be an amount (e.g., percentage, fraction, value) of the connection strength that represents a significant change in the quality of a connection. For example, the media guidance application may determine a radius of 6 meters. The radius may indicate that the private device can be up to 6 meters away from the public device, without reducing the connection strength (e.g., to &#x201c;above average&#x201d;). Furthermore, the media guidance application may determine that as the private device moves farther away from the public device, the public device and/or the private device may expend more processing in communicating with one another. For example, the user may have issued a command to the public device to retrieve a video game and generate for display. As the private device moves farther away from the public device, or behind obstacles, the media guidance application may attempt to reduce the processing load of the public device and allocate more processing on the private device (e.g., to ensure that the user has immediate access to the video game or to reduce the latency between the user issuing a command and the command's execution at the public device). The change in processing loads may thus change the processing ratio. For example, the processing ratio between the private device and the public device may be 50:50. However, due to the increase in distance between the private device and public device (e.g., beyond the radial displacement), the connection strength may decrease and the processing ratio may become 70:30 (e.g., increase processing at the private device to make up for the degradation in the connection strength). The processing limit threshold may be a maximum change in processing loads before the connection between the public device and the private device may become unstable. The processing limit may be the difference between the first processing limit and the processing load of the private device. For example, if an increase in the processing load of the private device is equal to the processing limit of the private device, the media guidance application may determine that the connection is unstable and may end the session. Similarly, if the increase in the processing load of the public device is equal to the processing limit of the public device, the media guidance application may determine that the connection is unstable and may end the session.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Thus, the media guidance application may determine the predetermined proximity based on the radial displacement. For example, if the radial displacement is 6 meters from the public device, the media guidance application may determine a buffer distance beyond the radial displacement in which the connection strength between the private device and the public device reduces beyond a connection strength threshold (e.g., 50% degradation from the originally determined connection strength). The predetermined proximity may represent a sum of the radial displacement, and the buffer distance. In some embodiments, the media guidance application may generate for display the connection strength, the radial displacement, and/or the predetermined proximity on the public device and/or private device, for the user. Similarly, the media guidance application may also generate for display the connection parameters of the connection on the public device and/or private device.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some embodiments, wherein the connection parameters comprise a predetermined proximity to the public device within which the private device must remain in order for the authorization key to remain valid, the media guidance application may verify that the private device is within the predetermined proximity to the public device. For example, the media guidance application may request RSSI values (e.g., imbed an RSSI value to the authorization key) from the private device and convert the RSSI values to distances based on the lookup table previously discussed. The media guidance application may then determine whether the converted distance (e.g., 3 meters) is greater than the predetermined proximity (e.g., 5 meters). In response to validating the authorization key (e.g., determining a match as previously discussed) and verifying that the private device is within the predetermined proximity to the public device, the media guidance application may execute, at the public device, the command. In some embodiments, the media guidance application may invalidate, at the public device, the authorization key, by determining that the private device is outside the predetermined proximity to the public device. For example, if the distance between the private device and the public device is determined to be 7 meters and the predetermined proximity is 5 meters, the media guidance application may no longer accept the authorization key. Instead, the media guidance application may mark the authorization key as invalid to prevent further communication using the authorization key. In response to invalidating the authorization key, the media guidance application may also end the session between the public device and the private device.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments, the user authorization information is a universally unique identifier (UUID) or globally unique identifier (GUID) generated by the private interface application in response to verifying a login name and password entered into the private interface application, and wherein the user authorization information is valid for a predetermined time after verifying the login name and password. For example, the user authorization may be an identifier that represents the user's login name and password. Accordingly, the actual values of the login name and password are not exposed to the public device. Instead, the media guidance application assigns a UUID or a GUID associated with the user in response to verifying the user's login name/username and password. For example, the predetermined time may be one hour. Thus, the UUID and GUID may become invalid after one hour. The media guidance application may then re-verify the user's login name and password.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some embodiments, the public device may be configured to automatically remove the user authorization information from memory on the public device upon deactivation (e.g., ending the session) of the public interface application on the public device. Additionally, the private interface application may be configured to retain the user authorization information in memory on the private device upon deactivation of the private interface application on the private device. For example, the media guidance application may remove the user authorization information from the public device to prevent other users from accessing the user's content. As mentioned previously, the user authorization information may be in the form of a UUID or a GUID. Accordingly, the media guidance application may store the user authorization information on the public device. If the predetermined time in which the UUID/GUID is valid is five days, the media guidance application may seamlessly connect the public device and the private device without the need for verifying the user's login name and password for the content provider within the five days.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">It should be noted that the systems, methods, apparatuses, and/or aspects described above may be applied to, or used in accordance with, other systems, methods, apparatuses, and/or aspects described in this disclosure.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The above and other objects and advantages of the disclosure will be apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like reference characters refer to like parts throughout, and in which:</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an illustrative example of a scenario for connecting a private device to a public device, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a block diagram for connecting a public device to a private device in order to receive and execute a user command, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows an illustrative example of multiple private devices connecting to a public device, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows an illustrative example of a private device connecting to multiple public devices, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows an illustrative example of multiple private devices connecting to multiple public devices, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows an illustrative example of a private device connecting to multiple public devices without displays, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a block diagram of an illustrative user equipment device in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a block diagram of an illustrative media system in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a flowchart of an illustrative process for connecting a public device to a private device in order to receive and execute a user command, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a flowchart of a detailed illustrative process for connecting a public device to a private device in order to receive and execute a user command, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a flowchart of an illustrative process for determining the predetermined proximity, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a flowchart of a detailed illustrative process for determining the predetermined proximity, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a flowchart of an illustrative process for determining an anticipated processing ratio, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure; and</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is a flowchart of an illustrative process for invalidating the authorization key, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Systems and methods are described herein for connecting public devices to private devices in order to receive and execute user commands. For example, a user may wish to connect his/her smartphone to a public display in a mall. A media guidance application, installed on the user's smartphone or on an external server, may communicate with the public display, requesting to connect the public display with the user's smartphone. In response to receiving the request to connect and authenticating the user's credentials (e.g., to retrieve information/content if necessary), the public display may generate an authorization key that enables communication between the user's smartphone and the public display and may transmit the authorization key to the user's smartphone. Specifically, the authorization key may consist of connection parameters (e.g., information about minimum data transfer rates, time limits, predetermined proximity requirements, etc.) to ensure a secure, stable, and easy-to-initiate connection. The user's smartphone may accordingly be able to send commands (e.g., generate for display content, browse the Internet, communicate with an external device, etc.) in conjunction with the authorization key, to the public display. The media guidance application may moderate the connection between the respective devices by validating the authorization key when a command is received at the public device. In response to determining that the authorization key is valid, the public device may execute the command (e.g., display a requested media asset).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an illustrative example of a scenario for connecting a private device to a public device, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure. Scenario <b>100</b> depicts user <b>102</b> with a private device <b>104</b> (e.g., a smartwatch, smartphone, tablet, etc.) in a mall. It should be noted that the private device may be wearable as well. User <b>102</b> may have initiated a communication between private device <b>104</b> and public device <b>106</b> (e.g., a display). Accordingly, public device <b>106</b> has generated for display a message stating &#x201c;communication received from device <b>104</b>.&#x201d; Public device <b>106</b> may then initiate a session with private device <b>104</b>, allowing user <b>102</b> to access content via public device <b>106</b> and/or private device <b>104</b>. Furthermore, public device <b>106</b> may determine a proximity <b>108</b> within which private device <b>104</b> must remain in order to maintain the session. As a result, if private device <b>104</b> is removed from within proximity <b>108</b>, public device <b>106</b> may end the session and not accept commands from private device <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a block diagram for connecting a public device to a private device in order to receive and execute a user command, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure. A media guidance application may receive a communication from private device <b>202</b>, implementing a private interface application, indicating that a user wishes to use public device <b>204</b>. Private device <b>202</b> may be any electronic device that the user has access to and/or owns, and that is capable of communicating with other devices. Public device <b>204</b> may be any electronic device that is available for access by several users and is capable of communicating with other devices. Examples of private and public devices include, but are not limited to, displays, smartphones, smartwatches, smart speakers, computers, biometric devices, video game consoles, etc. The communication received from private device <b>202</b> may be in the form of a communication protocol data unit (e.g., a packet, a frame, a cell, etc.) in which the destination of the data unit is the communication address of public device <b>204</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In some embodiments, the communication from private device <b>202</b> is transmitted to public device <b>204</b> in response to receiving, at private device <b>202</b>, a broadcast message inviting private device <b>202</b> to access public device <b>204</b>. In some embodiments, the broadcast message inviting private device <b>202</b> to access public device <b>204</b> is transmitted by public device <b>204</b>, in response to determining that private device <b>202</b> is within a predetermined displacement from public device <b>204</b>. For example, public device <b>204</b> may broadcast discovery messages in order to detect devices. In response, public device <b>204</b> may receive acknowledgment responses with received signal strength indicator (RSSI) values from the devices that received the discovery message. The media guidance application may determine, using a lookup table which returns distance as a function of RSSI, the distance between public device <b>204</b> and the acknowledging device. In response to determining that the distance is within a predetermined displacement from public device <b>204</b>, the media guidance application of public device <b>204</b> may transmit the message inviting the acknowledging device (e.g., the user's private device) to access public device <b>204</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">For example, private device <b>202</b> may be the user's smartphone, on which the media guidance application is installed. The private interface application (e.g., the YouTube mobile app, the Spotify app, etc.) may be either stored or running (e.g., in the foreground/background) on private device <b>202</b>. The user may specifically wish to transmit, from private device <b>202</b> to public device <b>204</b>, a command that is associated with the private interface application. In some embodiments, the media guidance application may display information about all public devices available for access in the vicinity of private device <b>202</b>. For example, the media guidance application may provide a map/list of public devices nearby and may allow the user to select public device <b>204</b> in order to send a request to connect. It should be noted that the media guidance application may be installed on a remote server, instead of the user's device. Accordingly, the remote server may communicate with private device <b>202</b> in order to provide the list/map of accessible public devices in the user's vicinity. Furthermore, the media guidance application may be integrated with the private interface application. Thus, the user may be able to view the map/list from the private interface application directly. For example, public device <b>204</b> may be a large touchscreen display located in a mall. The public display may receive the user's request to connect from the user's smartphone. The communication between private device <b>202</b> and public device <b>204</b> may be implemented over various communication infrastructures including, but not limited to, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular networks, wired connections (e.g., Ethernet), etc. Various servers, routers, switches, hubs, etc., may serve as intermediate devices configured to pass data between public device <b>204</b> and private device <b>202</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In some embodiments, public device <b>204</b> and private device <b>202</b> may not be compatible. For example, public device <b>204</b> may be a public display with an iOS&#x2122;-based operating system and private device <b>202</b> may be a smartphone with a Windows-based operating system. In some cases, the two respective devices may be unable to communicate due to their differences in programming. As a result, the media guidance application may determine that private device <b>202</b> is of a first operating system type and public device <b>204</b> is of a second operating system type. The media guidance application may determine that the first operating system type is incompatible with the second operating system type. In response to receiving a first message (e.g., command, request, data packet) that is encoded using the first operating system type by the private interface application and is to be sent to public device <b>204</b>, the media guidance application may translate the content of the first message and generate a second message encoded using the second operating system type that includes the content of the first message. The media guidance application may then record the first message in a log and may transmit the second message to public device <b>204</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The media guidance application may request, from private device <b>202</b>, both user authorization information and an identifier for the private interface application. In response to the user making a selection of public device <b>204</b>, the media guidance application may create a temporary connection between private device <b>202</b> and public device <b>204</b>. The temporary connection may allow private device <b>202</b> and public device <b>204</b> to communicate without providing access to the functionality of either device (e.g., the ability to access and display the content). Accordingly, private device <b>202</b> may receive from either public device <b>204</b> or a remote server with the media guidance application, a request for user authorization information and an identifier of the private interface application. The user authorization information may comprise data required to verify the user's identity with the content provider. For example, the user authorization information may list the subscriptions the user possesses and the respective login keys (e.g., username, password, security questions, PIN codes, etc.) to access the subscriptions. The identifier of the private interface application may be any descriptive attribute of the private interface application including, but not limited to, a name, a logo, a developer name, software details (e.g., build number, version, compatible operating system), a screenshot of the user interface, etc. It should be noted that the identifier may comprise a combination of descriptive attributes. For example, an identifier may include the name of a content provider (e.g., Netflix&#x2122;) associated with the private interface application, the version of the private interface application (e.g., version 5.6), and the compatible operating systems (e.g., iOS&#x2122;, Android&#x2122;). Thus, in this example, the identifier private device <b>202</b> may provide to public device <b>204</b> is &#x201c;Netflix&#x2122;, Android&#x2122; application version 5.6.&#x201d; As depicted by transfer <b>206</b>, private device <b>202</b> may transmit, to public device <b>204</b>, the user authorization information (e.g., represented by user icon) and the identifier of the private interface application (e.g., represented by an application icon labelled &#x201c;Pr&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The media guidance application may then generate, at public device <b>204</b>, authorization key <b>208</b> that is unique to private device <b>202</b> based on (i) the user authorization information, (ii) the identifier and (iii) connection parameters, wherein authorization key <b>208</b> is required to cause public device <b>204</b> to execute commands received from private device <b>202</b> during a session. Continuing from the previous example, the identifier for the private interface application is &#x201c;Netflix&#x2122;, Android&#x2122; application version 5.6.&#x201d; The user authorization information may thus comprise a username and password to the user's Netflix&#x2122; account. The connection parameters represent conditions that must be met in order to maintain the connection between public device <b>204</b> and private device <b>202</b>. For example, the connection parameters may comprise a predetermined proximity to public device <b>204</b>, within which private device <b>202</b> must remain in order for authorization key <b>208</b> to remain valid. The connection parameters may comprise restrictions on certain commands that the user may request. For example, the user may request that public device <b>204</b> perform a task that demands heavy processing as it requires high-end graphics (e.g., the command may be to generate for display a video game). In this example, public device <b>204</b> may not be able to execute the command because the processing needed for the command exceeds public device <b>204</b>'s technical capabilities. In the absence of connection parameters, public device <b>204</b> may get damaged while trying to execute the command (e.g., may cause corrupted files and/or overheating at the motherboard). Accordingly, the media guidance application may take public device <b>204</b>'s technical capabilities into consideration and limit the user to commands that public device <b>204</b> can implement. This information is thus included in the connection parameters. Similarly, the connection parameters may include information such as the connection type (e.g., Wi-fi, cellular data, etc.) established between private device <b>202</b> and public device, the location of the respective devices, time limits for accessing public device <b>204</b> (e.g., allow the connection between public device <b>204</b> and private device <b>202</b> for one hour only), etc. Authorization key <b>208</b> may be encrypted by symmetric and/or public/private encryption method. This provides security and prevents other devices from sending commands on behalf of private device <b>202</b>. An example of an authorization key may be &#x201c;AUTH:username-password_ID:identifierPARA:parameters.&#x201d; Therefore, if the username of a user is &#x201c;user123,&#x201d; the password is &#x201c;pass123,&#x201d; the identifier is &#x201c;Netflix&#x2122;, Android&#x2122; application version 5.6,&#x201d; and the connection parameters include a predetermined proximity, private device <b>202</b> serial number, public device serial number, connection type, minimum data transfer rate, and time limit (e.g., 5m-private123-public321-bluetooth-100 kbps-60 min), authorization key <b>208</b> in its entirety may be &#x201c;AUTH:user123-pass123_ID:Netflix&#x2122;[Android&#x2122;, v5.6]_PARA:5m-private123-public321-bluetooth-100 kbps-60 min.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In some embodiments, the user may not need to provide user authorization information because the user may be interested in accessing a publicly accessible application on public device <b>204</b>. For example the user possesses a cellphone that does not have smartphone features. The user may wish to read the news, look up the weather, or browse the Internet. Accordingly, the user may not be able to perform those tasks on private device <b>202</b> and also does not need authorization information to pull up the user's profile (e.g., Netflix&#x2122; account with preferences). Thus, when the media guidance application requests user authorization information, the user may not provide user authorization information via private device <b>202</b>. In response, the media guidance application may not include user authorization information in authorization key <b>208</b> (e.g., leave the text after &#x201c;AUTH&#x201d; empty).</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">As depicted as transfer <b>210</b>, the media guidance application may then transmit, to private device <b>202</b>, authorization key <b>208</b> and in response to transmitting authorization key <b>208</b>, the media guidance application may initiate a session, at public device <b>204</b>, with private device <b>202</b>. The session may be a formal connection between public device <b>204</b> and private device <b>202</b> in which commands can be exchanged between the respective devices. The formal connection may be established over various communication infrastructures including, but not limited to, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular networks, wired connections (e.g., Ethernet), etc. It should be noted that authorization key <b>208</b> is required to execute commands, at public device <b>204</b>, received from private device <b>202</b> during the session.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">As depicted as transfer <b>212</b>, the media guidance application may then receive, at public device <b>204</b>, a first communication from the private interface application. The media guidance application may parse, at public device <b>204</b>, the first communication to identify authorization key <b>208</b> and a command (e.g., represented as a pointing hand) to execute on public device <b>204</b>. The command is a task that the user assigns to public device <b>204</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Furthermore, the command may be associated specifically with the private interface application. For example, if the private interface application is a video streaming application such as the Netflix&#x2122; mobile app, the user may initiate a first communication with public device <b>204</b> by sending a command that requests that public device <b>204</b> download a public interface application (e.g., a corresponding Netflix&#x2122; application) that is compatible with the private interface application. The command may also be to change a setting of public device <b>204</b> (e.g., increase volume, decrease brightness, etc.). The commands may be transmitted as text from private device <b>202</b> to public device <b>204</b>, verbally from the user to public device <b>204</b>, via gestures or any visual indication of a command from the user/private device to public device <b>204</b>, or biometric changes (e.g., changes in heart rate, tightening of muscles, etc.). It should be noted that not all public devices may have displays (e.g., smart speakers, augmented reality devices, hologram generators, etc.). For those particular public devices, an appropriate user interface that is compatible with public device <b>204</b> and allows user interaction via the private interface application may be used. Based on the examples listed above, these substitute user interfaces may be an audio user interface (e.g., where a menu is read aloud to the user), augmented reality user interface (e.g., allows the user to see an augmented reality screen via private device <b>202</b>), or a holographic projection user interface (e.g., where the menu is projected).</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The media guidance application may then validate, at public device <b>204</b>, authorization key <b>208</b>. Validating authorization key <b>208</b> may involve two steps: (1) determining whether authorization key <b>208</b> received from private device <b>202</b> matches authorization key <b>208</b> transmitted by public device <b>204</b> to private device <b>202</b> and (2) determining whether the connection parameters are satisfied. For example, the media guidance application may store a copy of authorization key <b>208</b> for a threshold time (e.g., three minutes) when transmitting authorization key <b>208</b> to private device <b>202</b>. Thus, private device <b>202</b> must send a command within the threshold time before the media guidance application erases authorization key <b>208</b> from the memory of public device <b>204</b>. In response to receiving a command (e.g., as a first communication), the media guidance application may decrypt authorization key <b>208</b> at public device <b>204</b> and determine whether the received authorization key matches authorization key <b>208</b> in the memory of public device <b>204</b>. If the respective authorization keys match, the media guidance application may determine whether the connection parameters of authorization key <b>208</b> are satisfied (e.g., whether the connection type is the same, the data transfer rate is locked to a threshold speed, private device <b>202</b> is within the predetermined proximity (e.g., verification <b>214</b>), the time elapsed within the time limit, etc.). If the received authorization key matches and each connection parameter is satisfied, the media guidance application may validate authorization key <b>208</b>. In response to validating authorization key <b>208</b>, the media guidance application may execute, at public device <b>204</b>, the command. For example, the command may be to generate for display, on public device <b>204</b>, a media asset selected on the private interface application (e.g., a movie selected on the Netflix&#x2122; mobile application).</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In some embodiments, authorization key <b>208</b> may be different for each communication exchanged between public device <b>204</b> and private device <b>202</b>. For example, authorization key <b>208</b> may additionally comprise a timestamp in order to allow the media guidance application to determine the order at which communications were received and also to distinguish each private device that may be sending communications to public device <b>204</b> (e.g., when multiple private devices are connected to public device <b>204</b>). In response to the initiation of a session between public device <b>204</b> and private device <b>202</b>, the media guidance application of private device <b>202</b> may begin sending commands from the private interface application to public device <b>204</b>. Authorization key <b>208</b> previously sent by public device <b>204</b> may accompany the command from private device <b>202</b>. In response to receiving the command and authorization key <b>208</b>, the media guidance application may parse authorization key <b>208</b> to determine whether it matches authorization key <b>208</b> generated at public device <b>204</b>. In response to determining a match, the media guidance application of public device <b>204</b> may execute the command sent by the private interface application. In response to determining that authorization key <b>208</b> does not match, the media guidance application of public device <b>204</b> may end the session. Furthermore, the media guidance application of public device <b>204</b> may generate a new authorization key and transmit the new authorization key to private device <b>202</b>, in response to receiving a command from the private interface application that is accompanied by an authorization key that matches the authorization previously transmitted by public device <b>204</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In some embodiments, the connection parameters may comprise a predetermined proximity to public device <b>204</b> within which private device <b>202</b> must remain in order for authorization key <b>208</b> to remain valid. The predetermined proximity may be a physical distance/displacement that represents the furthest point private device <b>202</b> can be from public device <b>204</b> in a particular direction. For simplicity, the predetermined proximity may be interpreted as a connection &#x201c;sphere&#x201d; of a certain radius (e.g., five meters). Accordingly, private device <b>202</b> may be up to five meters from public device <b>204</b> in any direction in order for the private interface application to communicate with the public interface application. Due to the presence of obstacles (e.g., walls, objects, etc.), the predetermined proximity may not be the same in all directions. For example, the predetermined proximity perpendicular to the display of public device <b>204</b> and parallel to the floor may be five meters. However, the predetermined proximity perpendicular to the floor and the display of public device <b>204</b> (e.g., pointing upwards) may be three meters due to the presence of a ceiling (e.g., the ceiling may significantly reduce the signal strength). Public device <b>204</b> may further generate for display/audio the predetermined proximity for the user on public device <b>204</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The media guidance application may generate, at public device <b>204</b>, authorization key <b>208</b> by retrieving a device identifier of private device <b>202</b>. The device identifier may be a descriptive attribute of private device <b>202</b> such as at least one of the device name, device type, model number, serial number, manufacturer name, battery life, etc. Multiple descriptive attributes may make up a device identifier. For example, if private device <b>202</b>'s manufacturer is Google, the name of the device is Pixel XL, the model number is 2, and the serial number is 12345, the device identifier may be &#x201c;Google Pixel XL 2, 12345.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The media guidance application may then determine a connection strength between private device <b>202</b> and public device <b>204</b>. The connection strength may be a quantitative or qualitative value that represents the quality of the connection between two or more devices. The connection strength may be described using data transfer rates (e.g., download/upload speeds) or signal power. For example, if the connection strength is a quantitative value, the media guidance application may transmit a test message from private device <b>202</b> to public device <b>204</b> and measure, at public device <b>204</b>, the download transfer rate (e.g., megabytes per second). The media guidance application may then send a test message from public device <b>204</b> to private device <b>202</b>, and may measure, at private device <b>202</b>, the download transfer rate. It should be noted that the transfer rates at public device <b>204</b> and private device <b>202</b> are with respect to each other only. For example, private device <b>202</b> may have a general download transfer rate when connected to a different device, and the general download transfer rate may be different from the transfer rate with public device <b>204</b>. In response to determining the respective download transfer rates at each respective device, the media guidance application may determine the average download transfer rate between the respective devices. The average download transfer rate (e.g., 5 Mbps) may represent the connection strength. A similar procedure may be used by the media guidance application to determine the average upload transfer rate, which may also be used to represent the connection strength. In some embodiments, the media guidance application may determine the connection strength by determining that average transfer rate by averaging the average download transfer rate and the average upload transfer rate. In some embodiments, the connection strength may be represented by the lowest transfer rate between the respective devices. For example, if the upload transfer rates of private device <b>202</b> and public device <b>204</b> are 2 Mbps and 3 Mbps, respectively, and the download transfer rates are 10 Mbps and 15 Mbps, respectively, the connection strength may be represented as 2 Mbps.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">When the connection strength is represented qualitatively, the media guidance application may determine the quantitative value of the signal strength/transfer rate and refer to data structure that converts the quantitative value to a qualitative value. For example, the data in the data structure may be predetermined by the media guidance application. Furthermore, each quantitative range may represent a qualitative value. In this example, there are five qualitative classifications of the connection strength: poor, below average, average, above average and strong. In terms of transfer rates, the respective transfer rate ranges for each classification may be 0-0.5 Mbps, 0.5-1 Mbps, 1 Mbps-3 Mbps, 3 Mbps-5 Mbps, and 5+ Mbps. In terms of signal power, the respective signal power ranges may be &#x2212;113-&#x2212;100 dBm, &#x2212;100-&#x2212;80 dBm, etc.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The media guidance application may then determine the predetermined proximity, based on the device identifier and the connection strength. For example, the media guidance application may retrieve, using the device identifier, additional information about private device <b>202</b>. The additional information may include technical details about private device <b>202</b> such as compatible connection types (e.g., Bluetooth, cellular, Wi-Fi, etc.) and processing capabilities (e.g., from a processer chip specification). Using this information, alongside the connection strength, the media guidance application may determine a maximum distance that private device <b>202</b> can be from public device <b>204</b> without dropping the connection strength or causing private device <b>202</b> to exhaust processing.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In some embodiments, the media guidance application may receive, at public device <b>204</b>, a received signal strength indicator (RSSI) from private device <b>202</b>. The media guidance application may set the RSSI value as the connection strength. An RSSI represents the power of a received signal. The media guidance application may then approximate a distance between public device <b>204</b> and private device <b>202</b>. For example, the media guidance application may determine that the RSSI of the original transmitted signal is 0 and the RSSI received at private device <b>202</b> is &#x2212;20. The media guidance application may determine, using a lookup table that returns distance as a function of RSSI, the distance between private device <b>202</b> and public device <b>204</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The user authorization information may comprise a user profile. Accordingly, the media guidance application may also determine an application usage history based on the user profile. For example, the application usage history may list all of the applications the user has accessed in a period of time. Alongside listing the application name, the application usage history may track the amount of time the user spent accessing an application, and the number of times the user has accessed the application. The media guidance application may then determine an anticipated processing ratio between private device <b>202</b> and public device <b>204</b>, based on the application usage history and the device identifier. The purpose of determining an anticipated processing ratio between the respective devices is to balance the processing requirements between public device <b>204</b> and private device <b>202</b>. For example, multiple private devices may be connected to public device <b>204</b>. In order to ensure that a user's command is executed at public device <b>204</b>, public device <b>204</b> may reserve a certain amount of processing power for the user and assign additional processing to private device <b>202</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In some embodiments, determining the anticipated processing ratio between private device <b>202</b> and public device <b>204</b> further comprises the media guidance application determining a first processing limit of private device <b>202</b> based on the device identifier and a second processing limit of public device <b>204</b>. For example, the device identifier of private device <b>202</b> may be &#x201c;Google Pixel XL 2.&#x201d; The media guidance application may retrieve additional information about private device <b>202</b> using the Internet. Specifically, the media guidance application may determine that private device <b>202</b> is a smartphone with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processing chip and 4 gigabytes of RAM. Based on the additional information retrieved using the device identifier, the media guidance application may set the first processing limit to 4 GB RAM at 2.35 GHz. For example, the technical capabilities of public device <b>204</b> may be 8 GB RAM at 2.5 GHz (e.g., which may be set as the second processing limit). The media guidance application may determine an average processing requirement associated with at least one application in the application usage history. For example, the media guidance application may select the private interface application as the at least one application in the application usage history and retrieve metadata associated with the private interface application. The metadata may list the average processing requirement of the private interface application. For example, the average processing requirement of the Netflix&#x2122; mobile application may be 512 MB RAM at 1.8 GHz. In some embodiments, the media guidance application may determine the likelihood of the user accessing an application listed in the application usage history. For example, the media guidance application may use a probability model as a function of frequency of usage, total amount of times accessed, and the time length of each access, in order to determine the likelihood of the user accessing an application. The media guidance application may then select the application with the highest likelihood and determine its average processing requirement. In some embodiments, the media guidance application may determine the average processing requirement by averaging the processing requirements of all applications listed in the application usage history. In some embodiments, the media guidance application may identify the application with the highest processing requirement and set the respective processing requirement as the average processing requirement.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Furthermore, the media guidance application may identify power consumption information of private device <b>202</b> based on the device identifier. For example, the additional information retrieved by the media guidance application based on the device identifier, may include the maximum battery capacity of private device <b>202</b>. For example, the battery capacity of private device <b>202</b> may be 3,520 mAh. In this example, the device identifier lists the battery life of private device <b>202</b> as 80% battery remaining. The media guidance application may determine that the power consumption information indicates a remaining battery of 80% of 3,520 mAh (i.e., 2816 mAh). In addition, the power consumption information may indicate the amount of time the remaining battery can be used when private device <b>202</b> is functioning at a specific processing scheme. For example, the power consumption information may indicate private device <b>202</b>'s battery will remain charged (e.g., above 0%) for 0.5 hours when utilizing 3 GB RAM and 1.5 GHz of processing.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The media guidance application may thus determine a first anticipated processing load for private device <b>202</b>, based on the power consumption information and the first processing limit. Additionally, the media guidance application may determine a second anticipated processing load for public device <b>204</b>, wherein a sum of the first anticipated processing load and the second anticipated processing load is greater than or equal to the average processing requirement. For example, the private interface application may be the Netflix&#x2122; mobile application and the user may send commands based on the Netflix&#x2122; mobile application (e.g., mirroring the application, downloading a public interface application associated with the private interface application, etc.). The average processing requirement for the private interface application and/or the public interface application of Netflix&#x2122; may have an average processing requirement of 512 MB RAM at 1.8 GHz. The media guidance application may allocate 256 MB RAM and 1.8 GHz of the second processing limit for public device <b>204</b>. Similarly, the media guidance application may allocate 256 MB RAM and 1.8 GHz of the first processing limit for private device <b>202</b>. This may ensure that anticipated commands from the user are executed. It should be noted that the sum of the respective anticipated processing loads equals the average processing requirement. In some embodiments, the media guidance application may allocate the entire average processing requirement as the second anticipated processing load. This minimizes the processing that must be performed at private device <b>202</b> and reduces the amount of communication that must be carried out between public device <b>204</b> and private device <b>202</b>. In conditions where the average processing requirement is less than the second processing limit, the media guidance application may treat public device <b>204</b> as a thick client for heavy processing duties and may treat private device <b>202</b> as a thin client for sending basic communications (e.g., exchanging commands and processing status information).</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In some embodiments, the media guidance application may determine that a second private device is connected with public device <b>204</b>. Accordingly, the second processing limit of public device <b>204</b> may be lower than the maximum processing capabilities of public device <b>204</b> because the media guidance application may previously have allocated a third anticipated processing load for public device <b>204</b>. Therefore, the media guidance application may determine the second anticipated processing load based on the remaining processing capabilities of public device <b>204</b> and allocate the rest to the first private device as the first anticipated processing load.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The media guidance application may then determine the anticipated processing ratio between private device <b>202</b> and public device <b>204</b>, based on the first anticipated processing load and the second anticipated processing load. For example, the media guidance application may determine a percentage of the average processing requirement that was allocated to public device <b>204</b> and a percentage that was allocated to private device <b>202</b>. In the previous example, both devices were allocated an equal anticipated processing load (e.g., 50% each). The anticipated processing ratio of private device <b>202</b> to public device <b>204</b> is therefore 50:50 (i.e., 1:1). Suppose the percentage for public device <b>204</b> was 70% and the percentage for private device <b>202</b> was 30%. The anticipated processing ratio would thus be 30:70 (i.e., 3:7). In some embodiments, the anticipated processing ratio may be of public device <b>204</b> to private device <b>202</b> (e.g., 70:30).</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In terms of determining the predetermined proximity, the media guidance application may then determine a radial displacement between private device <b>202</b> and public device <b>204</b>, wherein when private device <b>202</b> is a distance, less than or equal to the radial displacement, from public device <b>204</b>, (i) the connection strength does not decrease by more than a degradation threshold and (ii) the anticipated processing ratio does not increase by more than a processing limit threshold. For example, the distance, between private device <b>202</b> and public device <b>204</b> at which the connection strength (e.g., &#x201c;good&#x201d;) is determined, may be three meters. The media guidance application may determine a radial displacement representing the farthest private device <b>202</b> can be from public device <b>204</b> without reducing the connection strength by a degradation threshold. The degradation threshold may be an amount (e.g., percentage, fraction, value) of the connection strength that represents a significant change in the quality of a connection. For example, the media guidance application may determine a radius of 6 meters. The radius may indicate that private device <b>202</b> can be up to 6 meters away from public device <b>204</b>, without reducing the connection strength (e.g., to &#x201c;above average&#x201d;). Furthermore, the media guidance application may determine that as private device <b>202</b> moves farther away from public device <b>204</b>, public device <b>204</b> and/or private device <b>202</b> may expend more processing in communicating with one another. For example, the user may have issued a command to public device <b>204</b> to retrieve a video game and generate for display. As private device <b>202</b> moves farther away from public device <b>204</b>, or behind obstacles, the media guidance application may attempt to reduce the processing load of public device <b>204</b> and allocate more processing on private device <b>202</b> (e.g., to ensure that the user has immediate access to the video game or to reduce the latency between the user issuing a command and the command's execution at public device <b>204</b>). The change in processing loads may thus change the processing ratio. For example, the processing ratio between private device <b>202</b> and public device <b>204</b> may be 50:50. However, due to the increase in distance between private device <b>202</b> and public device (e.g., beyond the radial displacement), the connection strength may decrease and the processing ratio may become 70:30 (e.g., increase processing at private device <b>202</b> to make up for the degradation in the connection strength). The processing limit threshold may be a maximum change in processing loads before the connection between public device <b>204</b> and private device <b>202</b> may become unstable. The processing limit may be the difference between the first processing limit and the processing load of private device <b>202</b>. For example, if an increase in the processing load of private device <b>202</b> is equal to the processing limit of private device <b>202</b>, the media guidance application may determine that the connection is unstable and may end the session. Similarly, if the increase in the processing load of public device <b>204</b> is equal to the processing limit of public device <b>204</b>, the media guidance application may determine that the connection is unstable and may end the session.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Thus, the media guidance application may determine the predetermined proximity based on the radial displacement. For example, if the radial displacement is 6 meters from public device <b>204</b>, the media guidance application may determine a buffer distance beyond the radial displacement in which the connection strength between private device <b>202</b> and public device <b>204</b> reduces beyond a connection strength threshold (e.g., 50% degradation from the originally determined connection strength). The predetermined proximity may represent a sum of the radial displacement, and the buffer distance. In some embodiments, the media guidance application may generate for display the connection strength, the radial displacement, and/or the predetermined proximity on public device <b>204</b> and/or private device, for the user. Similarly, the media guidance application may also generate for display the connection parameters of the connection on public device <b>204</b> and/or private device.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In some embodiments, wherein the connection parameters comprise a predetermined proximity to public device <b>204</b> within which private device <b>202</b> must remain in order for authorization key <b>208</b> to remain valid, the media guidance application may verify that private device <b>202</b> is within the predetermined proximity to public device <b>204</b>. This process is depicted as verification <b>214</b> (e.g., represented as a measuring stick). For example, the media guidance application may request RSSI values (e.g., imbed an RSSI value to authorization key <b>208</b>) from private device <b>202</b> and convert the RSSI values to distances based on the lookup table previously discussed. The media guidance application may then determine whether the converted distance (e.g., 3 meters) is greater than the predetermined proximity (e.g., 5 meters). In response to validating authorization key <b>208</b> (e.g., determining a match as previously discussed) and verifying that private device <b>202</b> is within the predetermined proximity to public device <b>204</b>, the media guidance application may execute, at public device <b>204</b>, the command. In some embodiments, the media guidance application may invalidate, at public device <b>204</b>, authorization key <b>208</b>, by determining that private device <b>202</b> is outside the predetermined proximity to public device <b>204</b>. For example, if the distance between private device <b>202</b> and public device <b>204</b> is determined to be 7 meters and the predetermined proximity is 5 meters, the media guidance application may no longer accept authorization key <b>208</b>. Instead, the media guidance application may mark authorization key <b>208</b> as invalid to prevent further communication using authorization key <b>208</b>. In response to invalidating authorization key <b>208</b>, the media guidance application may also end the session between public device <b>204</b> and private device <b>202</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In some embodiments, the user authorization information is a universally unique identifier (UUID) or globally unique identifier (GUID) generated by the private interface application in response to verifying a login name and password entered into the private interface application, and wherein the user authorization information is valid for a predetermined time after verifying the login name and password. For example, the user authorization may be an identifier that represents the user's login name and password. Accordingly, the actual values of the login name and password are not exposed to public device <b>204</b>. Instead, the media guidance application assigns a UUID or a GUID associated with the user in response to verifying the user's login name/username and password. For example, the predetermined time may be one hour. Thus, the UUID and GUID may become invalid after one hour. The media guidance application may then re-verify the user's login name and password.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In some embodiments, public device <b>204</b> may be configured to automatically remove the user authorization information from memory on public device <b>204</b> upon deactivation (e.g., ending the session) of the public interface application on public device <b>204</b>. Additionally, the private interface application may be configured to retain the user authorization information in memory on private device <b>202</b> upon deactivation of the private interface application on private device <b>202</b>. For example, the media guidance application may remove the user authorization information from public device <b>204</b> to prevent other users from accessing the user's content. As mentioned previously, the user authorization information may be in the form of a UUID or a GUID. Accordingly, the media guidance application may store the user authorization information on public device <b>204</b>. If the predetermined time in which the UUID/GUID is valid is five days, the media guidance application may seamlessly connect public device <b>204</b> and private device <b>202</b> without the need for verifying the user's login name and password for the content provider within the five days.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows illustrative example <b>300</b> of multiple private devices connecting to a public device, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure. Private device <b>304</b>, private device <b>306</b>, and private device <b>308</b> may individually and independently send respective communications requesting to connect to public device <b>302</b>. In response, the media guidance application may implement one of the aspects mentioned above for each private device.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Suppose that private device <b>304</b> is running a private interface application &#x201c;A,&#x201d; private device <b>306</b> is running a private interface application &#x201c;B,&#x201d; and private device <b>308</b> is running a private interface application &#x201c;C.&#x201d; The devices may generate communications path <b>310</b>, communications path <b>312</b>, communications path <b>314</b> with public device <b>302</b>, respectively. Each communications path represents a session between the private device and the public device. Thus, public device <b>302</b> may exchange communication data units (e.g., packets, frames cells, etc.) on the respective paths depending on the connection type with the private device (e.g., Internet, cellular, Bluetooth, etc.). As an example, each path may be used for transfer <b>206</b>, <b>210</b>, and <b>212</b>. Similarly, each communications path may be used independently for verification <b>214</b>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Suppose that public device <b>302</b> is a display. The users of the private devices may wish to send commands to generate, for display, public interface applications corresponding to the private interface application running on their respective private devices. The public interface application may allow a user to access content that is available to the public (e.g., movies, shows, video games, etc.). In an example, if the private interface application is the Netflix&#x2122; mobile application, the public interface application may be another version of the Netflix&#x2122; application that is built specifically for displays. In response to initiating a connection session with multiple private devices, the media guidance application on public device <b>302</b> may allocate various portions of the display to a respective public interface application associated with a private interface application of each private device. In some embodiments, the allocation may be symmetrical (e.g., display gets split in three equivalent portions of equal resolution when three private devices are connected to the public device). In some embodiments, the allocation of resolution and screen size of each private interface application (e.g., depicted as application <b>316</b> &#x201c;A,&#x201d; application <b>318</b> &#x201c;B,&#x201d; and application <b>320</b> &#x201c;C&#x201d;) may be based on the importance/type of the content displayed. For example, if application <b>320</b> is simply a music player and the content is an audio file, the media guidance application may determine that application <b>320</b> may allocate a smaller screen size and/or resolution for application <b>320</b>. In another example, if application <b>318</b> is displaying breaking news or content tagged with importance by a content provider/authority (e.g., an emergency evacuation message tagged as &#x201c;important&#x201d; by a government), and the other applications on public device <b>302</b> are displaying content not tagged as important, the media guidance application may increase the resolution and/or screen size of application <b>318</b> and decrease the resolution and/or screen size of application <b>316</b> and application <b>320</b>, accordingly. In some embodiments, private interface application &#x201c;C&#x201d; on private device <b>308</b> may mirror the graphical user interface of application <b>320</b>. In some embodiments, private interface application &#x201c;C&#x201d; on private device <b>308</b> may control the graphical user interface of application <b>320</b>.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In some embodiments, multiple users may be accessing videos on a single public device. In order to prevent the audio from all videos being accessed from being mixed, the audio of each respective application may be outputted on the associated private device. The public device may split a video media asset, received from the content provider, into a visual and audio media asset, respectively. The public device may forward the audio media asset to the private device. The public device may also identify an audio I/O device associated with the user, such as headphones or speakers, and forward the audio media asset to the audio I/O device.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Suppose that public device <b>302</b> is a smart speaker. Due to the absence of a display, the commands received from each of the private devices may be queued and executed in the order in which they were received. In some embodiments, the importance of a command is determined by the media guidance application. Accordingly, a command with a higher importance is executed first and a command with a lower importance is executed subsequently. In some embodiments, the commands are executed simultaneously. For example, a first command from a first private device (e.g., private device <b>304</b>) may be a verbal input asking the public device to turn on the lights. A second command from a second private device (e.g., private device <b>306</b>) may be a textual input asking the public device to lower the thermostat temperature.

Computer readable media includes any media capable of storing data. The computer readable media may be transitory, including, but not limited to, propagating electrical or electromagnetic signals, or may be non-transitory including, but not limited to, volatile and non-volatile computer memory or storage devices such as a hard disk, floppy disk, USB drive, DVD, CD, media cards, register memory, processor caches, Random Access Memory (&#x201c;RAM&#x201d;), etc.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">With the advent of the Internet, mobile computing, and high-speed wireless networks, users are accessing media on user equipment devices on which they traditionally did not. As referred to herein, the phrase &#x201c;user equipment device,&#x201d; &#x201c;user equipment,&#x201d; &#x201c;user device,&#x201d; &#x201c;electronic device,&#x201d; &#x201c;electronic equipment,&#x201d; &#x201c;media equipment device,&#x201d; or &#x201c;media device&#x201d; should be understood to mean any device for accessing the content described above, such as a television, a Smart TV, a set-top box, an integrated receiver decoder (IRD) for handling satellite television, a digital storage device, a digital media receiver (DMR), a digital media adapter (DMA), a streaming media device, a DVD player, a DVD recorder, a connected DVD, a local media server, a BLU-RAY player, a BLU-RAY recorder, a personal computer (PC), a laptop computer, a tablet computer, a WebTV box, a personal computer television (PC/TV), a PC media server, a PC media center, a hand-held computer, a stationary telephone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a mobile telephone, a portable video player, a portable music player, a portable gaming machine, a smart phone, or any other television equipment, computing equipment, or wireless device, and/or combination of the same. In some embodiments, the user equipment device may have a front facing screen and a rear facing screen, multiple front screens, or multiple angled screens. In some embodiments, the user equipment device may have a front facing camera and/or a rear facing camera. On these user equipment devices, users may be able to navigate among and locate the same content available through a television. Consequently, media guidance may be available on these devices, as well. The guidance provided may be for content available only through a television, for content available only through one or more of other types of user equipment devices, or for content available both through a television and one or more of the other types of user equipment devices. The media guidance applications may be provided as on-line applications (i.e., provided on a web-site), or as stand-alone applications or clients on user equipment devices. Various devices and platforms that may implement media guidance applications are described in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">One of the functions of the media guidance application is to provide media guidance data to users. As referred to herein, the phrase &#x201c;media guidance data&#x201d; or &#x201c;guidance data&#x201d; should be understood to mean any data related to content or data used in operating the guidance application. For example, the guidance data may include program information, guidance application settings, user preferences, user profile information, media listings, media-related information (e.g., broadcast times, broadcast channels, titles, descriptions, ratings information (e.g., parental control ratings, critic's ratings, etc.), genre or category information, actor information, logo data for broadcasters' or providers' logos, etc.), media format (e.g., standard definition, high definition, 3D, etc.), on-demand information, blogs, websites, and any other type of guidance data that is helpful for a user to navigate among and locate desired content selections.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">The media guidance application may be personalized based on a user's preferences. A personalized media guidance application allows a user to customize displays and features to create a personalized &#x201c;experience&#x201d; with the media guidance application. This personalized experience may be created by allowing a user to input these customizations and/or by the media guidance application monitoring user activity to determine various user preferences. Users may access their personalized guidance application by logging in or otherwise identifying themselves to the guidance application. Customization of the media guidance application may be made in accordance with a user profile. The customizations may include varying presentation schemes (e.g., color scheme of displays, font size of text, etc.), aspects of content listings displayed (e.g., only HDTV or only 3D programming, user-specified broadcast channels based on favorite channel selections, re-ordering the display of channels, recommended content, etc.), desired recording features (e.g., recording or series recordings for particular users, recording quality, etc.), parental control settings, customized presentation of Internet content (e.g., presentation of social media content, e-mail, electronically delivered articles, etc.) and other desired customizations.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">The media guidance application may allow a user to provide user profile information or may automatically compile user profile information. The media guidance application may, for example, monitor the content the user accesses and/or other interactions the user may have with the guidance application. Additionally, the media guidance application may obtain all or part of other user profiles that are related to a particular user (e.g., from other web sites on the Internet the user accesses, such as www.Tivo.com, from other media guidance applications the user accesses, from other interactive applications the user accesses, from another user equipment device of the user, etc.), and/or obtain information about the user from other sources that the media guidance application may access. As a result, a user can be provided with a unified guidance application experience across the user's different user equipment devices. Additional personalized media guidance application features are described in greater detail in Ellis et al., U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2005/0251827, filed Jul. 11, 2005, Boyer et al., U.S. Pat.

Control circuitry <b>704</b> may be used to send and receive commands, requests, and other suitable data using I/O path <b>702</b>. I/O path <b>702</b> may connect control circuitry <b>704</b> (and specifically processing circuitry <b>706</b>) to one or more communications paths (described below). I/O functions may be provided by one or more of these communications paths, but are shown as a single path in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> to avoid overcomplicating the drawing.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Control circuitry <b>704</b> may be based on any suitable processing circuitry such as processing circuitry <b>706</b>. As referred to herein, processing circuitry should be understood to mean circuitry based on one or more microprocessors, microcontrollers, digital signal processors, programmable logic devices, field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), etc., and may include a multi-core processor (e.g., dual-core, quad-core, hexa-core, or any suitable number of cores) or supercomputer. In some embodiments, processing circuitry may be distributed across multiple separate processors or processing units, for example, multiple of the same type of processing units (e.g., two Intel Core i7 processors) or multiple different processors (e.g., an Intel Core i5 processor and an Intel Core i7 processor). In some embodiments, control circuitry <b>704</b> executes instructions for a media guidance application stored in memory (i.e., storage <b>708</b>). Specifically, control circuitry <b>704</b> may be instructed by the media guidance application to perform the functions discussed above and below. For example, the media guidance application may provide instructions to control circuitry <b>704</b> to generate the media guidance displays. In some implementations, any action performed by control circuitry <b>704</b> may be based on instructions received from the media guidance application.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">In client-server based embodiments, control circuitry <b>704</b> may include communications circuitry suitable for communicating with a guidance application server or other networks or servers. The instructions for carrying out the above-mentioned functionality may be stored on the guidance application server. Communications circuitry may include a cable modem, an integrated services digital network (ISDN) modem, a digital subscriber line (DSL) modem, a telephone modem, Ethernet card, or a wireless modem for communications with other equipment, or any other suitable communications circuitry.

In addition, communications circuitry may include circuitry that enables peer-to-peer communication of user equipment devices, or communication of user equipment devices in locations remote from each other (described in more detail below).</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">Memory may be an electronic storage device provided as storage <b>708</b> that is part of control circuitry <b>704</b>. As referred to herein, the phrase &#x201c;electronic storage device&#x201d; or &#x201c;storage device&#x201d; should be understood to mean any device for storing electronic data, computer software, or firmware, such as random-access memory, read-only memory, hard drives, optical drives, digital video disc (DVD) recorders, compact disc (CD) recorders, BLU-RAY disc (BD) recorders, BLU-RAY 3D disc recorders, digital video recorders (DVR, sometimes called a personal video recorder, or PVR), solid state devices, quantum storage devices, gaming consoles, gaming media, or any other suitable fixed or removable storage devices, and/or any combination of the same. Storage <b>708</b> may be used to store various types of content described herein as well as media guidance data described above. Nonvolatile memory may also be used (e.g., to launch a boot-up routine and other instructions). Cloud-based storage, described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, may be used to supplement storage <b>708</b> or instead of storage <b>708</b>.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">Control circuitry <b>704</b> may include video generating circuitry and tuning circuitry, such as one or more analog tuners, one or more MPEG-2 decoders or other digital decoding circuitry, high-definition tuners, or any other suitable tuning or video circuits or combinations of such circuits. Encoding circuitry (e.g., for converting over-the-air, analog, or digital signals to MPEG signals for storage) may also be provided. Control circuitry <b>704</b> may also include scaler circuitry for upconverting and downconverting content into the preferred output format of the user equipment <b>700</b>. Circuitry <b>704</b> may also include digital-to-analog converter circuitry and analog-to-digital converter circuitry for converting between digital and analog signals. The tuning and encoding circuitry may be used by the user equipment device to receive and to display, to play, or to record content. The tuning and encoding circuitry may also be used to receive guidance data. The circuitry described herein, including for example, the tuning, video generating, encoding, decoding, encrypting, decrypting, scaler, and analog/digital circuitry, may be implemented using software running on one or more general purpose or specialized processors. Multiple tuners may be provided to handle simultaneous tuning functions (e.g., watch and record functions, picture-in-picture (PIP) functions, multiple-tuner recording, etc.). If storage <b>708</b> is provided as a separate device from user equipment <b>700</b>, the tuning and encoding circuitry (including multiple tuners) may be associated with storage <b>708</b>.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">A user may send instructions to control circuitry <b>704</b> using user input interface <b>710</b>. User input interface <b>710</b> may be any suitable user interface, such as a remote control, mouse, trackball, keypad, keyboard, touch screen, touchpad, stylus input, joystick, voice recognition interface, or other user input interfaces. Display <b>712</b> may be provided as a stand-alone device or integrated with other elements of user equipment device <b>700</b>. For example, display <b>712</b> may be a touchscreen or touch-sensitive display. In such circumstances, user input interface <b>710</b> may be integrated with or combined with display <b>712</b>. Display <b>712</b> may be one or more of a monitor, a television, a liquid crystal display (LCD) for a mobile device, amorphous silicon display, low temperature poly silicon display, electronic ink display, electrophoretic display, active matrix display, electro-wetting display, electrofluidic display, cathode ray tube display, light-emitting diode display, electroluminescent display, plasma display panel, high-performance addressing display, thin-film transistor display, organic light-emitting diode display, surface-conduction electron-emitter display (SED), laser television, carbon nanotubes, quantum dot display, interferometric modulator display, or any other suitable equipment for displaying visual images. In some embodiments, display <b>712</b> may be HDTV-capable. In some embodiments, display <b>712</b> may be a 3D display, and the interactive media guidance application and any suitable content may be displayed in 3D. A video card or graphics card may generate the output to the display <b>712</b>. The video card may offer various functions such as accelerated rendering of 3D scenes and 2D graphics, MPEG-2/MPEG-4 decoding, TV output, or the ability to connect multiple monitors. The video card may be any processing circuitry described above in relation to control circuitry <b>704</b>. The video card may be integrated with the control circuitry <b>704</b>. Speakers <b>714</b> may be provided as integrated with other elements of user equipment device <b>700</b> or may be stand-alone units. The audio component of videos and other content displayed on display <b>712</b> may be played through speakers <b>714</b>. In some embodiments, the audio may be distributed to a receiver (not shown), which processes and outputs the audio via speakers <b>714</b>.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">The guidance application may be implemented using any suitable architecture. For example, it may be a stand-alone application wholly-implemented on user equipment device <b>700</b>. In such an approach, instructions of the application are stored locally (e.g., in storage <b>708</b>), and data for use by the application is downloaded on a periodic basis (e.g., from an out-of-band feed, from an Internet resource, or using another suitable approach). Control circuitry <b>704</b> may retrieve instructions of the application from storage <b>708</b> and process the instructions to generate any of the displays discussed herein. Based on the processed instructions, control circuitry <b>704</b> may determine what action to perform when input is received from input interface <b>710</b>. For example, movement of a cursor on a display up/down may be indicated by the processed instructions when input interface <b>710</b> indicates that an up/down button was selected.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">In some embodiments, the media guidance application is a client-server based application. Data for use by a thick or thin client implemented on user equipment device <b>700</b> is retrieved on-demand by issuing requests to a server remote to the user equipment device <b>700</b>. In one example of a client-server based guidance application, control circuitry <b>704</b> runs a web browser that interprets web pages provided by a remote server. For example, the remote server may store the instructions for the application in a storage device. The remote server may process the stored instructions using circuitry (e.g., control circuitry <b>704</b>) and generate the displays discussed above and below. The client device may receive the displays generated by the remote server and may display the content of the displays locally on equipment device <b>700</b>. This way, the processing of the instructions is performed remotely by the server while the resulting displays are provided locally on equipment device <b>700</b>. Equipment device <b>700</b> may receive inputs from the user via input interface <b>710</b> and transmit those inputs to the remote server for processing and generating the corresponding displays. For example, equipment device <b>700</b> may transmit a communication to the remote server indicating that an up/down button was selected via input interface <b>710</b>. The remote server may process instructions in accordance with that input and generate a display of the application corresponding to the input (e.g., a display that moves a cursor up/down). The generated display is then transmitted to equipment device <b>700</b> for presentation to the user.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">In some embodiments, the media guidance application is downloaded and interpreted or otherwise run by an interpreter or virtual machine (run by control circuitry <b>704</b>). In some embodiments, the guidance application may be encoded in the ETV Binary Interchange Format (EBIF), received by control circuitry <b>704</b> as part of a suitable feed, and interpreted by a user agent running on control circuitry <b>704</b>. For example, the guidance application may be an EBIF application. In some embodiments, the guidance application may be defined by a series of JAVA-based files that are received and run by a local virtual machine or other suitable middleware executed by control circuitry <b>704</b>. In some of such embodiments (e.g., those employing MPEG-2 or other digital media encoding schemes), the guidance application may be, for example, encoded and transmitted in an MPEG-2 object carousel with the MPEG audio and video packets of a program.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">User equipment device <b>700</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> can be implemented in system <b>800</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> as user television equipment <b>802</b>, user computer equipment <b>804</b>, wireless user communications device <b>806</b>, or any other type of user equipment suitable for accessing content, such as a non-portable gaming machine. For simplicity, these devices may be referred to herein collectively as user equipment or user equipment devices, and may be substantially similar to user equipment devices described above. User equipment devices, on which a media guidance application may be implemented, may function as a standalone device or may be part of a network of devices. Various network configurations of devices may be implemented and are discussed in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">A user equipment device utilizing at least some of the system features described above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> may not be classified solely as user television equipment <b>802</b>, user computer equipment <b>804</b>, or a wireless user communications device <b>806</b>. For example, user television equipment <b>802</b> may, like some user computer equipment <b>804</b>, be Internet-enabled allowing for access to Internet content, while user computer equipment <b>804</b> may, like some television equipment <b>802</b>, include a tuner allowing for access to television programming. The media guidance application may have the same layout on various different types of user equipment or may be tailored to the display capabilities of the user equipment. For example, on user computer equipment <b>804</b>, the guidance application may be provided as a web site accessed by a web browser. In another example, the guidance application may be scaled down for wireless user communications devices <b>806</b>.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">In system <b>800</b>, there is typically more than one of each type of user equipment device but only one of each is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> to avoid overcomplicating the drawing. In addition, each user may utilize more than one type of user equipment device and also more than one of each type of user equipment device.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">In some embodiments, a user equipment device (e.g., user television equipment <b>802</b>, user computer equipment <b>804</b>, wireless user communications device <b>806</b>) may be referred to as a &#x201c;second screen device.&#x201d; For example, a second screen device may supplement content presented on a first user equipment device. The content presented on the second screen device may be any suitable content that supplements the content presented on the first device. In some embodiments, the second screen device provides an interface for adjusting settings and display preferences of the first device. In some embodiments, the second screen device is configured for interacting with other second screen devices or for interacting with a social network. The second screen device can be located in the same room as the first device, a different room from the first device but in the same house or building, or in a different building from the first device.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">The user may also set various settings to maintain consistent media guidance application settings across in-home devices and remote devices. Settings include those described herein, as well as channel and program favorites, programming preferences that the guidance application utilizes to make programming recommendations, display preferences, and other desirable guidance settings. For example, if a user sets a channel as a favorite on, for example, the web site www.Tivo.com on their personal computer at their office, the same channel would appear as a favorite on the user's in-home devices (e.g., user television equipment and user computer equipment) as well as the user's mobile devices, if desired. Therefore, changes made on one user equipment device can change the guidance experience on another user equipment device, regardless of whether they are the same or a different type of user equipment device. In addition, the changes made may be based on settings input by a user, as well as user activity monitored by the guidance application.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">The user equipment devices may be coupled to communications network <b>814</b>. Namely, user television equipment <b>802</b>, user computer equipment <b>804</b>, and wireless user communications device <b>806</b> are coupled to communications network <b>814</b> via communications paths <b>808</b>, <b>810</b>, and <b>812</b>, respectively. Communications network <b>814</b> may be one or more networks including the Internet, a mobile phone network, mobile voice or data network (e.g., a 4G or LTE network), cable network, public switched telephone network, or other types of communications network or combinations of communications networks. Paths <b>808</b>, <b>810</b>, and <b>812</b> may separately or together include one or more communications paths, such as, a satellite path, a fiber-optic path, a cable path, a path that supports Internet communications (e.g., IPTV), free-space connections (e.g., for broadcast or other wireless signals), or any other suitable wired or wireless communications path or combination of such paths. Path <b>812</b> is drawn with dotted lines to indicate that in the exemplary embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> it is a wireless path and paths <b>808</b> and <b>810</b> are drawn as solid lines to indicate they are wired paths (although these paths may be wireless paths, if desired).

Media guidance data may be provided to the user equipment devices using any suitable approach. In some embodiments, the guidance application may be a stand-alone interactive television program guide that receives program guide data via a data feed (e.g., a continuous feed or trickle feed). Program schedule data and other guidance data may be provided to the user equipment on a television channel sideband, using an in-band digital signal, using an out-of-band digital signal, or by any other suitable data transmission technique.

For example, a user equipment device may pull media guidance data from a server, or a server may push media guidance data to a user equipment device. In some embodiments, a guidance application client residing on the user's equipment may initiate sessions with source <b>818</b> to obtain guidance data when needed, e.g., when the guidance data is out of date or when the user equipment device receives a request from the user to receive data. Media guidance may be provided to the user equipment with any suitable frequency (e.g., continuously, daily, a user-specified period of time, a system-specified period of time, in response to a request from user equipment, etc.). Media guidance data source <b>818</b> may provide user equipment devices <b>802</b>, <b>804</b>, and <b>806</b> the media guidance application itself or software updates for the media guidance application.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">In some embodiments, the media guidance data may include viewer data. For example, the viewer data may include current and/or historical user activity information (e.g., what content the user typically watches, what times of day the user watches content, whether the user interacts with a social network, at what times the user interacts with a social network to post information, what types of content the user typically watches (e.g., pay TV or free TV), mood, brain activity information, etc.). The media guidance data may also include subscription data. For example, the subscription data may identify to which sources or services a given user subscribes and/or to which sources or services the given user has previously subscribed but later terminated access (e.g., whether the user subscribes to premium channels, whether the user has added a premium level of services, whether the user has increased Internet speed). In some embodiments, the viewer data and/or the subscription data may identify patterns of a given user for a period of more than one year. The media guidance data may include a model (e.g., a survivor model) used for generating a score that indicates a likelihood a given user will terminate access to a service/source. For example, the media guidance application may process the viewer data with the subscription data using the model to generate a value or score that indicates a likelihood of whether the given user will terminate access to a particular service or source. In particular, a higher score may indicate a higher level of confidence that the user will terminate access to a particular service or source. Based on the score, the media guidance application may generate promotions that entice the user to keep the particular service or source indicated by the score as one to which the user will likely terminate access.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">Media guidance applications may be, for example, stand-alone applications implemented on user equipment devices. For example, the media guidance application may be implemented as software or a set of executable instructions which may be stored in storage <b>708</b>, and executed by control circuitry <b>704</b> of a user equipment device <b>700</b>. In some embodiments, media guidance applications may be client-server applications where only a client application resides on the user equipment device, and server application resides on a remote server. For example, media guidance applications may be implemented partially as a client application on control circuitry <b>704</b> of user equipment device <b>700</b> and partially on a remote server as a server application (e.g., media guidance data source <b>818</b>) running on control circuitry of the remote server. When executed by control circuitry of the remote server (such as media guidance data source <b>818</b>), the media guidance application may instruct the control circuitry to generate the guidance application displays and transmit the generated displays to the user equipment devices. The server application may instruct the control circuitry of the media guidance data source <b>818</b> to transmit data for storage on the user equipment. The client application may instruct control circuitry of the receiving user equipment to generate the guidance application displays.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">Content and/or media guidance data delivered to user equipment devices <b>802</b>, <b>804</b>, and <b>806</b> may be over-the-top (OTT) content. OTT content delivery allows Internet-enabled user devices, including any user equipment device described above, to receive content that is transferred over the Internet, including any content described above, in addition to content received over cable or satellite connections. OTT content is delivered via an Internet connection provided by an Internet service provider (ISP), but a third party distributes the content. The ISP may not be responsible for the viewing abilities, copyrights, or redistribution of the content, and may only transfer IP packets provided by the OTT content provider. Examples of OTT content providers include YOUTUBE, NETFLIX&#x2122;, and HULU, which provide audio and video via IP packets. Youtube is a trademark owned by Google Inc., Netflix&#x2122; is a trademark owned by Netflix&#x2122; Inc., and Hulu is a trademark owned by Hulu, LLC. OTT content providers may additionally or alternatively provide media guidance data described above. In addition to content and/or media guidance data, providers of OTT content can distribute media guidance applications (e.g., web-based applications or cloud-based applications), or the content can be displayed by media guidance applications stored on the user equipment device.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">Media guidance system <b>800</b> is intended to illustrate a number of approaches, or network configurations, by which user equipment devices and sources of content and guidance data may communicate with each other for the purpose of accessing content and providing media guidance. The embodiments described herein may be applied in any one or a subset of these approaches, or in a system employing other approaches for delivering content and providing media guidance. The following four approaches provide specific illustrations of the generalized example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">In one approach, user equipment devices may communicate with each other within a home network. User equipment devices can communicate with each other directly via short-range point-to-point communication schemes described above, via indirect paths through a hub or other similar device provided on a home network, or via communications network <b>814</b>. Each of the multiple individuals in a single home may operate different user equipment devices on the home network. As a result, it may be desirable for various media guidance information or settings to be communicated between the different user equipment devices. For example, it may be desirable for users to maintain consistent media guidance application settings on different user equipment devices within a home network, as described in greater detail in Ellis et al., U.S. Patent Publication No. 2005/0251827, filed Jul. 11, 2005. Different types of user equipment devices in a home network may also communicate with each other to transmit content. For example, a user may transmit content from user computer equipment to a portable video player or portable music player.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">In a second approach, users may have multiple types of user equipment by which they access content and obtain media guidance. For example, some users may have home networks that are accessed by in-home and mobile devices. Users may control in-home devices via a media guidance application implemented on a remote device. For example, users may access an online media guidance application on a website via a personal computer at their office, or a mobile device such as a PDA or web-enabled mobile telephone. The user may set various settings (e.g., recordings, reminders, or other settings) on the online guidance application to control the user's in-home equipment. The online guide may control the user's equipment directly, or by communicating with a media guidance application on the user's in-home equipment. Various systems and methods for user equipment devices communicating, where the user equipment devices are in locations remote from each other, is discussed in, for example, Ellis et al., U.S. Pat. No. 8,046,801, issued Oct. 25, 2011, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">In a third approach, users of user equipment devices inside and outside a home can use their media guidance application to communicate directly with content source <b>816</b> to access content. Specifically, within a home, users of user television equipment <b>802</b> and user computer equipment <b>804</b> may access the media guidance application to navigate among and locate desirable content. Users may also access the media guidance application outside of the home using wireless user communications devices <b>806</b> to navigate among and locate desirable content.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">In a fourth approach, user equipment devices may operate in a cloud computing environment to access cloud services. In a cloud computing environment, various types of computing services for content sharing, storage or distribution (e.g., video sharing sites or social networking sites) are provided by a collection of network-accessible computing and storage resources, referred to as &#x201c;the cloud.&#x201d; For example, the cloud can include a collection of server computing devices, which may be located centrally or at distributed locations, that provide cloud-based services to various types of users and devices connected via a network such as the Internet via communications network <b>814</b>. These cloud resources may include one or more content sources <b>816</b> and one or more media guidance data sources <b>818</b>. In addition or in the alternative, the remote computing sites may include other user equipment devices, such as user television equipment <b>802</b>, user computer equipment <b>804</b>, and wireless user communications device <b>806</b>. For example, the other user equipment devices may provide access to a stored copy of a video or a streamed video. In such embodiments, user equipment devices may operate in a peer-to-peer manner without communicating with a central server.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">The cloud provides access to services, such as content storage, content sharing, or social networking services, among other examples, as well as access to any content described above, for user equipment devices. Services can be provided in the cloud through cloud computing service providers, or through other providers of online services. For example, the cloud-based services can include a content storage service, a content sharing site, a social networking site, or other services via which user-sourced content is distributed for viewing by others on connected devices. These cloud-based services may allow a user equipment device to store content to the cloud and to receive content from the cloud rather than storing content locally and accessing locally-stored content.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">A user may use various content capture devices, such as camcorders, digital cameras with video mode, audio recorders, mobile phones, and handheld computing devices, to record content. The user can upload content to a content storage service on the cloud either directly, for example, from user computer equipment <b>804</b> or wireless user communications device <b>806</b> having content capture feature. Alternatively, the user can first transfer the content to a user equipment device, such as user computer equipment <b>804</b>. The user equipment device storing the content uploads the content to the cloud using a data transmission service on communications network <b>814</b>. In some embodiments, the user equipment device itself is a cloud resource, and other user equipment devices can access the content directly from the user equipment device on which the user stored the content.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">Cloud resources may be accessed by a user equipment device using, for example, a web browser, a media guidance application, a desktop application, a mobile application, and/or any combination of access applications of the same. The user equipment device may be a cloud client that relies on cloud computing for application delivery, or the user equipment device may have some functionality without access to cloud resources. For example, some applications running on the user equipment device may be cloud applications, i.e., applications delivered as a service over the Internet, while other applications may be stored and run on the user equipment device. In some embodiments, a user device may receive content from multiple cloud resources simultaneously. For example, a user device can stream audio from one cloud resource while downloading content from a second cloud resource. Or a user device can download content from multiple cloud resources for more efficient downloading. In some embodiments, user equipment devices can use cloud resources for processing operations such as the processing operations performed by processing circuitry described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">As referred herein, the term &#x201c;in response to&#x201d; refers to initiated as a result of.

The communication may be sent from the private device (e.g., user television equipment <b>802</b>, user computer equipment <b>804</b>, or wireless user communications device <b>806</b>) via I/O Path <b>702</b> (e.g., communications path <b>808</b>, <b>810</b>, <b>812</b>, respectively). Communications network <b>814</b> may be Internet-based, cellular network-based, Bluetooth-based, etc., and may send the communication to the public device (e.g., user television equipment <b>802</b>, user computer equipment <b>804</b>, or wireless user communications device <b>806</b>). For example, the private device may be a wireless user communications device <b>806</b> and the public device may be user television equipment <b>802</b>. Thus, the communication may be sent from communications path <b>812</b>, over communications network <b>814</b>, to communications path <b>808</b>, in order to arrive at user television equipment <b>802</b>.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">At <b>904</b>, control circuitry <b>704</b> requests both user authorization information and an identifier for the private interface application. The user authorization information may be retrieved from storage <b>708</b> of the private device. In some embodiments, the user authorization information may be retrieved from storage <b>708</b> of an external server/device. For example, the private device may request a remote user equipment device (e.g., a computer at the user's home) for the user authorization information. At <b>906</b>, control circuitry <b>704</b> generates an authorization key unique to the private device based on (i) the user authorization information, (ii) the identifier and (iii) connection parameters. The generated authorization key may be stored in storage <b>708</b> of the public device. At <b>908</b>, control circuitry <b>704</b> transmits the authorization key to the private interface application to initiate a session between the public device and the private device. Referring back to the example at <b>902</b>, control circuitry <b>704</b> of the user television equipment (e.g., the public device) may transmit, to wireless user communications device <b>806</b> (e.g., the private device), the authorization key over communications network <b>814</b>, via communications path <b>808</b> and communications path <b>812</b>.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">At <b>910</b>, control circuitry <b>704</b> parses a first communication received from the private interface application, to identify the authorization key and a command to execute on the public device.

For example, the public device may be user television equipment <b>802</b>, user computer equipment <b>804</b>, or wireless user communications device <b>806</b>. Accordingly, the public device may anticipate communications from the communications network <b>814</b> through communications paths <b>808</b>, <b>810</b> and <b>812</b>, respectively.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">At <b>1004</b>, control circuitry <b>704</b> determines whether a communication from a private device indicating that a user wishes to use the public device was received. Suppose that the public device is user television equipment <b>802</b> and the private device is user computer equipment <b>804</b>. A private device may send a communication indicating that the user wishes to connect to the public device, from communications path <b>810</b>, over communications network <b>814</b>, to communications path <b>808</b>, in order to reach the public device.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">At <b>1006</b>, in response to determining that a communication was received, control circuitry <b>704</b> requests, from the private device, both user authorization information and an identifier for the private interface application. The user authorization information and the identifier may be retrieved by control circuitry <b>704</b> from storage <b>708</b>. In response to determining that a communication was not received, the process returns to <b>1002</b>. For example, control circuitry <b>704</b> may continue to monitor for communications at the public device.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">At <b>1008</b>, control circuitry <b>704</b> determines whether the private device can be identified using the identifier. For example, control circuitry <b>704</b> may refer to a content provider database that is in storage <b>708</b> of the public device. The content provider database may list content providers and their associated identifiers (e.g., name, logo, user interface screenshots of associated applications), and may derive its information from the media guidance data source <b>818</b>. Accordingly, control circuitry <b>704</b> may perform a lookup of the identifier in the content provider database. At <b>1010</b>, in response to determining that the private interface application cannot be determined, control circuitry <b>704</b> requests, from the private device, an additional identifier for the private interface application. The additional identifier will ideally be different from the first identifier provided by the private device and the process returns to <b>1008</b>.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">At <b>1012</b>, in response to identifying the private interface application from the identifier, control circuitry <b>704</b> generates, at the public device, an authorization key unique to the private device based on: (i) the user authorization information (ii) the identifier and (iii) connection parameters. The generated authorization key may be stored in storage <b>708</b> of the public device. At <b>1014</b>, control circuitry <b>704</b> transmits (e.g., over communications network <b>814</b>), to the private device, the authorization key, wherein the authorization key is required to cause the public device to execute commands received from the private device during a session.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">At <b>1016</b>, in response to transmitting the authorization key, control circuitry <b>704</b> initiates the session, at the public device, with the private device. The session represents a time period in which the private device is authorized to transmit commands to the public device and access content using the public device. For example, before the session is created, control circuitry <b>704</b> of the private device may not be able to access media content source <b>816</b> via the public device; in addition, if a command is included in the transmitted data packets, the public device may ignore the command in the absence of a session.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">At <b>1018</b>, control circuitry <b>704</b> receives (e.g., via I/O Path <b>702</b>), at the public device, a first communication from the private interface application. At <b>1020</b>, control circuitry <b>704</b> parses, at the public device, the first communication to identify the authorization key and a command to execute on the public device. For example, the communication may be sent as data packets. The payload of the data packet may include information about the authorization key and the command. The payload may include a header (e.g., different from the header of a packet) that indicates whether the payload contains the authorization key or the command. Thus, in the parsing process, control circuitry <b>704</b> may refer to the payload header to identify the authorization key and the command.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">At <b>1024</b>, control circuitry <b>704</b> validates, at the public device, the authorization key. At <b>1026</b>, in response to validating the authorization key, control circuitry <b>704</b> executes, at the public device, the command. For example, control circuitry <b>704</b> may determine that the received authorization key from the first communication matches the transmitted authorization key from <b>1014</b>. In the event that the respective authorization keys do not match, control circuitry <b>704</b> may end the session. In response to determining that the authorization key is validated, control circuitry <b>704</b> may determine whether the command is executable at the public device. For example, if the public device is a smart speaker and the command is to generate an image for display, control circuitry <b>704</b> may determine that the command is not executable. Specifically, control circuitry <b>704</b> may retrieve an executable command database from storage <b>708</b>. The executable command database may include a plurality of commands that control circuitry <b>704</b> can execute. Thus, control circuitry <b>704</b> may determine whether the user's command from the first communication corresponds to a command in the executable command database. For example, the user's command may be a verbal statement such as &#x201c;play the movie &#x2018;The Prestige&#x2019; on Netflix&#x2122;.&#x201d; Thus, control circuitry <b>704</b> may refer to the executable command database to determine if the function &#x201c;play the movie&#x201d; is included in the database. In response to determining that the function &#x201c;play the [type of video]&#x201d; is present in the executable command database, control circuitry <b>704</b> may determine that the term &#x201c;Netflix&#x2122;&#x201d; refers to a public interface application. Accordingly, control circuitry <b>704</b> may retrieve the public interface application from the content provider Netflix&#x2122; (e.g., media content source <b>816</b>). Next, control circuitry <b>704</b> may determine whether the media asset &#x201c;The Prestige&#x201d; is provided by Netflix&#x2122;. If control circuitry <b>704</b> determines that the media asset is accessible (e.g., provided by Netflix&#x2122;), control circuitry <b>704</b> may determine whether the user is authorized to access Netflix&#x2122; (e.g., based on the user authorization information). In response to determining that all parts of the command are executable, control circuitry <b>704</b> may execute the command. In response to determining that at least one of portion of the command cannot be executed, control circuitry <b>704</b> of the public device may generate an error message (e.g., via display <b>712</b> and/or speakers <b>714</b>).</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">It is contemplated that the steps or descriptions of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> may be used with any other embodiment of this disclosure.

Control circuitry <b>704</b> may retrieve the user profile from storage <b>708</b> or media guidance data source <b>818</b> (e.g., if the latter tracks the user's application usage). At <b>1208</b>, control circuitry <b>704</b> determines an anticipated processing ratio between the private device and the public device, based on the application usage history and the device identifier. At <b>1210</b>, control circuitry <b>704</b> determines a radial displacement between the private device and the public device, wherein when the private device is a distance, less than or equal to the radial displacement, from the public device, (i) the connection strength does not decrease by more than a degradation threshold and (ii) the anticipated processing ratio does not increase by more than a processing limit threshold.
