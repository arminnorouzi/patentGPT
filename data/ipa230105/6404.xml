The invention relates to a brush for grounding a driving axle, for example, of a motor-driven vehicle and, in particular, to the grounding brush for reducing electro-magnetic noise to a car radio in a vehicle.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The driving systems for motor vehicles have been changing from engine-driven systems to electric motor-driven systems. In particular, electric vehicles without an engine have globally been developed and accepted in the market for reducing greenhouse gases. The acceleration and deceleration of the vehicles are performed by controlling the rotation number of the electric motor by an inverter, and an onboard computer controls the inverter according to various input information.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The inverter interrupts a current to change the voltage and frequency applied to the motor. As a result, high-frequency energy is caused, leaks to the outside through the driving axle or the like of the electric vehicle, and generates electro-magnetic noise. The electro-magnetic noise affects badly controlling devices of the electric vehicle, onboard electronic devices, audio equipment such as a car radio, and, in particular, makes the sound of the car radio noisy. The same problem occurs in hybrid cars running by both an engine and an electric motor.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Related pieces of prior art will be introduced. Patent Document 1 (JP2016-525329) proposes a carbonaceous grounding brush containing silver by 1 to 8%. The grounding brush according to Patent Document 1 has, however, too high resistance for grounding an inverter of an electric vehicle.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Patent Document 2 (JP2007-60861) proposes a brush including 70 mass % silver for rotating electrical equipment. This brush is in slide contact with a commutator, polishes an oxide film on the commutator by the silver particle, and reduces the generation of commutator spark. As a result, the noise from the rotating electrical equipment is reduced. Patent Document 2, however, does not disclose to ground an inverter. Further, the mechanism for reducing noise is to reduce the commutator spark, not to ground a shaft.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">PRIOR ART DOCUMENTS</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Document</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0006">Patent Document 1: JP2016-525329</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0007">Patent Document 2: JP2007-60861</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0008">The object of the invention is to provide a grounding brush that has strength and service life compatible with usual brushes for rotating electric equipment and is capable of discharging efficiently the electro-magnetic noise from a driving axle of a vehicle driven by an electric motor.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0009">The object of the invention is, for example, to reduce efficiently the noise to car radio in the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0010">The noise to be reduced by the invention includes the above high-frequency energy noise from the driving axle to the outside, electrical signals flowing an electric cable, and electro-magnetic radiation from a housing of electronic equipment. Namely, in this specification, noise is electro-magnetic radiation radiated unintentionally from the electronic equipment of an electric vehicle or a hybrid vehicle.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Means for Solving the Problems</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0011">A metal graphite grounding brush according to the invention comprises a brush main body having silver as one of the main components of the brush main body, configured to be made in slide contact with an axle and to ground the axle,</p><p id="p-0012" num="0012">a mass composition in the brush main body between silver and carbonaceous components including graphite and a volatile component is silver more than 30 mass % and not more than 90 mass % and the carbonaceous components less than 70 mass % and not less than 10 mass %, and</p><p id="p-0013" num="0013">the content of the volatile component in the brush main body is not less than 2.0 mass % and not more than 15 mass %, where the total mass content of silver and the carbonaceous component is 100 mass %.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0014">In this specification, the basic composition of the brush is indicated by the mass ratio between silver and carbonaceous components, and the organic volatile component is included in the carbonaceous components. The brush can include other metal components such as copper than silver and other inorganic materials such as a solid lubricant and an abrasive material. The concentrations of these third components are indicated as the total of silver and carbonaceous components being 100 mass % and are, for example, up to 5 mass % and, preferably up to 2 mass %.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0015">Preferably, the resistivity of the brush main body is not more than 1000 micro-ohm-cm, and, in particular, not more than 100 micro-ohm-cm. Brushes having a resistivity in these ranges reduce efficiently electro-magnetic noise.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0016">Preferably, the volatile component is an incompletely carbonized material of a binder resin in the brush main body and, particularly preferably, is the incompletely carbonized material of thermosetting binder resin. Under selected baking conditions of the brush, the binder resin decomposes incompletely without being fully carbonized and remains in the brush. This volatile component improves the brush strength, decreases the worn amount of the brush, and extends the service life of the brush.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0017">Preferably, a lead wire of the brush is embedded into a pore portion in the brush with an embedding material that comprises a silver powder or a metal powder with a surface silver coating both without a binder resin. When the lead wire is embedded with the embedding material comprising a silver powder or a metal powder with a surface silver coating, the electric conductivity between the brush and the lead wire is improved in comparison to brushes in which the lead wire is embedded when the brush is press-molded. The embedding material that comprises a silver powder or a metal powder with a surface silver coating fits well the brush main body comprising silver and carbonaceous components. The embedding material without a binder resin further improves the electric conductivity between the lead wire and the brush.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0018">The silver-carbonaceous brush according to the invention is configured to be made in slide contact with the peripheral surface of a driving axle of an electric motor propulsion vehicle and grounds the driving axle to a chassis of the vehicle. This reduces electro-magnetic noise in the vehicle and, in particular, the noise to a car radio in the vehicle. Electric motor propulsion vehicles are those running by secondary batteries or fuel cells or vehicles with secondary batteries running by both engines and electric motors. The driving axle is the shaft transmitting the motor power to the driving wheels of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0019">A method according to the invention produces a metal graphite grounding brush that comprises a brush main body having silver as one of the main components of it and is configured to be made in slide contact with an axle and to ground the axle. The method according to the invention comprises:</p><p id="p-0020" num="0020">a step for mixing and kneading a silver powder, a graphite powder, and a synthetic resin binder, in order to prepare a brush material; and</p><p id="p-0021" num="0021">a step for press-molding the brush material into a press-molded piece of the brush main body. The mass composition in the brush main body between silver and carbonaceous components comprising graphite and a volatile component derived from the synthetic resin binder is silver more than 30 mass % and not more than 90 mass % and the carbonaceous component less than 70 mass % and not less than 10 mass %, and the content of the volatile component in the brush main body is not less than 2.0 mass % and not more than 15 mass %, where the total mass content of silver and the carbonaceous component is 100 mass %. The volatile component decreases by baking, and the compositions in the produced brushes are more important than those in the raw materials.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0022">The invention can be considered as a new shaft structure. The shaft structure comprises the shaft, a metal graphite grounding brush that has silver as one of the main components, is in slide contact with the peripheral surface of the shaft and grounds the shaft, and a spring keeping the grounding brush in contact with the peripheral surface of the shaft. The mass composition in the brush main body between silver and carbonaceous components including graphite and a volatile component is silver more than 30 mass % and not more than 90 mass % and the carbonaceous component less than 70 mass % and not less than 10 mass %. The content of the volatile component in the brush main body is not less than 2.0 mass % and not more than 15 mass %, the total mass content of silver and the carbonaceous component being 100 mass %. The spring pressure applied to the brush is not more than 1.6 Kg/cm<sup>2 </sup>and, for example, not less than 0.1 Kg/cm<sup>2 </sup>and not more than 1.6 Kg/cm<sup>2</sup>, and, preferably, not less than 0.3 Kg/cm<sup>2 </sup>and not more than 1.6 Kg/cm<sup>2</sup>. The shaft is preferably the driving axle of a motor-driven vehicle.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0023">The descriptions about the brush itself apply to the method for producing the brush and the shaft structure.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Advantageous Effects of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0024" num="0024">When the silver content in the brush is increased, the resistivity of the brush decreases. However, for eliminating noise from the axle, the total resistance that includes the resistance within the brush and the contact resistance between the brush and the axle is more important. In the present specification, the term &#x201c;contact resistance&#x201d; means the total resistance of the resistance within the brush and the contact resistance between the brush and the axle. According to the inventors' experiments, when the silver content exceeds 90% where the total mass of silver and carbonaceous components is defined as 100 mass %, the contact resistance at relatively low temperatures became unstable and sometimes abnormally high (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0025">The next observation was that when the silver content was less than 30 mass %, the resistivity of the brush became very high and exceeded 1000 micro-ohm-cm. Based upon these observations, the silver content is made more than 30 mass % and not more than 90 mass %, the carbonaceous component content is made less than 70 mass % and not less than 10 mass %, where the total of silver and carbonaceous components is made 100 mass %. Preferably, the silver content is made not less than 50 mass % and not more than 75 mass %, and the carbonaceous component content is made not more than 50 mass % and not less than 25 mass %, where the total of silver and carbonaceous components is made 100 mass %. In these ranges, the contact resistance of the brush becomes small and the resistivity of the brush is not more than 100 micro-ohm-cm. As a result, the electro-magnetic noise from the axle can be made very small.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0026">Brush raw materials include usually an organic component such as a binder resin. When the brush is baked at a relatively low temperature, the organic component such as the binder is thermally decomposed partially but not fully carbonized and remains a volatile incompletely carbonized material. The volatile component content in the brush affects the worn amount of the brush. When the volatile content is not less than 2.0 mass %, the strength of the brush increases, and the worn amount decreases, where the total of silver and carbonaceous components is made 100 mass %. When the volatile content is more than 15 mass %, chipping and swelling of the brush frequently occur due to the large volume of gas generated during the baking. Therefore, the volatile content is not less than 2.0 mass % and not more than 15 mass %, where the total of silver and carbonaceous components is made 100 mass %.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0027">The above volatile component is preferably an incompletely carbonized material derived from a binder resin, is more preferably an incompletely carbonized material derived from a thermosetting resin binder, and is an incompletely carbonized phenol resin in the embodiment. Other thermosetting resins, such as furan resin, xylene resin, and thermosetting polyimide resin, can be used. In addition, thermoplastic resins, such as PPS (poly-phenylene-sulfide), PEEK (poly-ether-ether-ketone), PTFE (poly-tetra-fluoro-ethylene), POM (poly-oxi-methylene), and PI (polyimide), can be used.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0028">The silver-carbonaceous grounding brush according to the invention is configured to be in slide contact with the peripheral surface of a driving axle of a motor-driven vehicle and to ground the axle to the chassis of the vehicle. Thus, the electro-magnetic noise to control equipment, electronic equipment, audio equipment in the vehicle is reduced, and, in particular, the noise to a car radio in a vehicle is reduced.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0009" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0029" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a view indicating a brush in use according to an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective view of the brush according to the embodiment.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a side view of the brush according to the embodiment.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a view indicating the measurement method of the contact resistance according to the embodiment.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a characteristic view indicating the contact resistances of brushes according to both the embodiments and a comparative example, at a rotation speed of 500 rpm.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a characteristic view indicating the contact resistances of brushes according to both the embodiments and the comparative example, at a rotation speed of 5000 rpm.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a characteristic view indicating the contact resistances of copper-containing brushes according to embodiments at a rotation speed of 500 rpm.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0010" level="1">FEATURES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0036" num="0036">The best embodiment for carrying out the invention will be described.

On the contrary, in the embodiment 6 and the comparative example 2, both having at least 2 mass % of volatile component, the worn amounts were within the allowable range. From these data, the lower limit of the volatile component is set to 2 mass %. When further increasing the volatile component concentration, swelling and chipping during the baking were observed. A brush with 19.5 mass % of volatile component (the comparative example 4) was out of an allowable range, and a brush with 12.6 mass % of volatile component (the comparative example 1) was within the allowable range. Therefore, the upper limit of the volatile component is set to 15 mass %.
