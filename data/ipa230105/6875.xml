In this regard, the first packet format comprises a first header field carried by a first orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) symbol while the second packet format comprises both the first header field carried by the first OFDM symbol and a second header field carried by a second OFDM symbol which follows the first OFDM symbol. The second header field is a repetition of the first header field.

More specifically, exemplary methods, systems, means, protocols and computer-readable storage media, are directed toward header repetition in a communications environment.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventional multi-user communications system use frame-based (or packet-based) transmission to communication between two or more users over a shared channel based on Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)&#x2014;(OFDM is also sometimes referred to as multicarrier modulation.) A packet is usually formed by a preamble, header, and payload, and transmitted using time-sharing or contention-based media access methods. An example of such a system includes IEEE 802.11 (Wireless LAN), IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX), and ITU G.9960 (G.hn). These systems use OFDM transmission, which is also sometimes referred to as Discrete Multi-Tone (DMT) which divides the transmission frequency band into multiple subcarriers (also referred to as tones or sub-channels), with each sub-carrier individually modulating a bit or a collection of bits.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The header contains important control information for the receiver to decode the payload properly, and also provides information about the packet length for virtual carrier sensing. Hence, it is essential to decode the header reliably. In G.9960, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, and should be familiar to those skilled in the art, the header containing PHY<sub>H </sub>bits (header information block) is carried over one or two OFDM symbols (D=1 or 2), and within each symbol, multiple header information blocks are repeated over the entire frequency band. (See Editor for G.9960, &#x201c;ITU-T Recommendation G.9960: Next generation wire-line based home networking transceivers&#x2014;Foundation,&#x201d; ITU-T SG15/04, January 2009) The default value of D is 1, but expanding it to 2 in some cases is under discussion. See, for example, &#x201c;G.hn: PHY-Frame Header Extension,&#x201d; ITU Temporary Document ITU-T SG-15/Q4 09CC-046, August 2009, and ITU Temporary Document ITU-T SG15/Q4 09XC-100 entitled &#x201c;G.hn: Using Two Symbols for the Header of PHY Frame on Coax,&#x201d; July, 2009, filed in the priority application and incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The possibility of carrying more than PHY<sub>H </sub>bits in the header (H=1 or 2) is also under discussion as disclosed in the &#x201c;G.hn: PHY-Frame Header Extension&#x201d; article and in &#x201c;G.hn: Extended PHY Frame Header, ITU-T 5G15/04 09XC-119, July 2009, filed in the priority application and incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">One exemplary technique discussed herein is allowing different values of D in a single domain where nodes are operating in different portions of frequency bands. For the power-line medium, G.9960 has defined two overlapped baseband bandplans, 50 MHz-PB and 100 MHz-PB. The possibility of having narrower bandplans such as 25 MHz-PB and 12.5 MHz-PB are under discussion in order to support, for example, SmartGrid applications.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In this exemplary scenario, the level of frequency diversity is different depending on the bandplan, hence providing different header decodability if D is fixed to 1. If D is fixed to 2, then it increases reliability for the narrowband devices, but may also unnecessarily increase overhead for the wide-band devices.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">An exemplary aspect is therefore directed to techniques to accommodate different repetitions schemes (D=1, . . . , D<sub>MAX </sub>and H=1, . . . , H<sub>MAX</sub>) in a single domain, and still allow devices to communicate with one another. D<sub>MAX </sub>and H<sub>MAX </sub>can be 2 or larger than 2.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, various header repetition schemes are illustrated where D, H=1 or 2. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the second instance of a block with the same label is a copy of the prior block. The modulation of the copied block may not be exactly the same as the original version. For example, the label &#x201c;Header Ext&#x201d; emphasizes the fact that it may contain different header information than the &#x201c;Header.&#x201d; The payload after the header may be omitted in some cases (e.g., ACK, RTS/CTS, etc.).</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The repetition scheme expands similarly with larger values of D<sub>MAX </sub>and H<sub>MAX</sub>. An exemplary aspect focuses on dealing with different values of D, with different values of H capable of being supported in a straightforward way as discussed in the paper G.hn: PHY-Frame Header Extension.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">On exemplary aspect is directed toward receiver detection of D with variable repetition. More specifically, in accordance with this exemplary embodiment, the transmitter selects (or determines), the at least one D value. The selection may be at its own discretion, or may be based on information communicated between one or more receivers, or based on instruction(s) from one or more other receivers and/or a domain master. Selection may depend on the number of available sub-carriers (or the bandwidth) of the bandplan the transmitter operates on and/or the receiver(s) operates on. In accordance with this exemplary embodiment, a receiving node in the domain should be able to decode packets sent by the transmitter without knowing D a priori (i.e. prior to decoding the packet header).</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Another exemplary aspect is for a transmitter to carry, insert or otherwise communicate the value of D in the header so that all nodes know how many OFDM symbols are carrying header information. The receiver(s) starts processing the header by decoding one OFDM header symbol. If the receiver decodes it successfully, then the receiver knows how many more OFDM symbols (D&#x2212;1) are carrying header information for a given frame. If the receiver fails to obtain the header information from the OFDM header symbol (i.e., the header decoding fails), then the receiver can try to decode two OFDM header symbols, and so on. The decoding of each additional OFDM header symbol provides additional diversity thereby increasing the likelihood of decoding the header information correctly.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Another exemplary aspect is directed to a fixed repetition scheme per domain. More specifically, a domain master can select (or determine) one or more fixed D values for at least one node in the domain. For example, the domain master may select one fixed value for all nodes in a domain. Selection may depend on the number of available sub-carriers (or the bandwidth) of the bandplans that the domain members operate on. The domain master may change the value of D dynamically. A node in the domain first needs to determine the D that the domain master has set (or selected/determined).</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">On exemplary aspect is for the domain master to carry, insert or otherwise communicate the selected value of D in the header of the MAP frame while also using this D value for the transmission of the MAP header as described above. In this case, a node will be able to determine the value of D using the methods described above. After this value is determined by a node, the node can use this value until it is changed or updated by, for example, a domain master, another transceiver, etc.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Another exemplary aspect is for the domain master to carry, insert or otherwise communicate the selected value of D in the MAP while using a fixed D for the header of the MAP frame (e.g., pre-defined per medium or D<sub>MAX</sub>). The D value in the MAP will be used for non-MAP frames/packets. In this case, a node in the domain may not need multiple levels of header decode process as described in above. Also in this exemplary method, the MAP may be sent with a different D value than the D value used for other (non-MAP) frames/packets.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Another exemplary aspect is directed toward a fixed repetition scheme per TXOP.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">More specifically, in addition, or alternatively, the domain master may select (or determine) a D value per TXOP. This selection may be at its own discretion, or based on information communicated between one or more transceivers or receivers, or based on instruction from one or more transceivers or receivers.
