However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that, in the various embodiments of the present disclosure, numerous technical details are set forth in order to provide the reader with a better understanding of the present disclosure. However, the technical solutions claimed in the present disclosure may be implemented without these technical details and various changes and modifications based on the following embodiments.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, a solar cell includes a first region <b>101</b> and a second region <b>102</b>. In other words, the first region <b>101</b> corresponds to a first portion of the solar cell, and the second region <b>102</b> corresponds to a second portion of the solar cell. In some embodiments, the solar cell includes a substrate <b>10</b>, a tunneling layer <b>11</b>, a first emitter <b>12</b>, a second emitter <b>13</b>, a first electrode <b>15</b> and a second electrode <b>16</b>. The substrate <b>10</b> has a first surface <b>10</b><i>a </i>and a second surface <b>10</b><i>b</i>. The tunneling layer <b>11</b> covers the second surface <b>10</b><i>b</i>. The first emitter <b>12</b> is disposed on the tunneling layer <b>11</b> of the first region <b>101</b>. The second emitter <b>13</b> is disposed on the tunneling layer <b>11</b> of the second region <b>102</b> and on the first emitter <b>12</b>. The first emitter <b>12</b> and the second emitter <b>13</b> have different conductivity types. The first electrode <b>15</b> is disposed in the first region <b>101</b>, and is configured to electrically connect with the first emitter <b>12</b> by penetrating through the second emitter <b>13</b>. Herein, the first electrode <b>15</b> penetrates through the second emitter <b>13</b> means that the first electrode <b>15</b> may be in contact with the second emitter <b>13</b>. The second electrode <b>16</b> is disposed in the second region <b>102</b> and is configured to electrically connect with the second emitter <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some embodiments, a material of the substrate <b>10</b> is a silicon material, which may include one or more of monocrystalline silicon, polycrystalline silicon, amorphous silicon and microcrystalline silicon. In other embodiments, the material of the substrate may also be a carbon simple substance, an organic material or a multinary compound. The multicomponent compound may include, but is not limited to, perovskite, gallium arsenide, cadmium telluride, copper indium selenium, etc.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments, the first surface <b>10</b><i>a </i>is designated as a light receiving surface, the second surface <b>10</b><i>b </i>is a rear surface opposite to the light receiving surface. The first surface <b>10</b><i>a </i>may be set as a pyramid textured surface to reduce the reflection of light on the first surface <b>10</b><i>a</i>, thus increasing an absorption and utilization rate of the light and improving the conversion efficiency of the solar cell. The solar cell may further include a first passivation layer <b>14</b> covering surfaces of the first emitter <b>12</b> and the second emitter <b>13</b> facing away from the substrate <b>10</b>. A material of the first passivation layer <b>14</b> may include one or more of silicon nitride, silicon oxynitride, silicon carbonitride oxide, titanium oxide, hafnium oxide, aluminum oxide and the like. Accordingly, the solar cell may further include a second passivation layer <b>17</b> covering the first surface <b>10</b><i>a</i>. A material of the second passivation layer <b>17</b> may be silicon nitride, or silicon oxide, etc.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, the substrate <b>10</b> includes an N-type doping element (such as phosphorus, arsenic, etc.) and the substrate <b>10</b> is N-type substrate; the first emitter <b>12</b> includes a P-type doping element; the second emitter <b>13</b> includes an N-type doping element. The first emitter <b>12</b> and the substrate <b>10</b> form a PN junction. The first electrode <b>15</b> connected with the first emitter <b>12</b> serves as a positive electrode of the solar cell, and the second electrode <b>16</b> connected with the second emitter <b>13</b> serves as a negative electrode of the solar cell. In other embodiments, the first emitter <b>12</b> includes an N-type doping element, the second emitter <b>13</b> includes a P-type doping element; the second emitter <b>13</b> and the substrate <b>10</b> form a PN junction.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">It should be noted that although the first emitter <b>12</b> and the second emitter <b>13</b> are in direct contact in the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, it does not mean that the positive electrode and the negative electrode of the solar cell are short-circuited. This is because the first emitter <b>12</b> and the second emitter <b>13</b> contain different types of doped ions, and the same typed carriers in the first emitter <b>12</b> and the second emitter <b>13</b> have greatly different transmission efficiencies. That is, under the condition of a same transmission path length, a transmission path resistance of the same typed carriers in different emitters is greatly different, which makes the carriers in the first emitter <b>12</b> always tend to flow out through the first electrode <b>15</b>. Besides, since the second emitter <b>13</b> generally has a relatively thin thickness and a relatively small cross-sectional area in a direction perpendicular to the second surface <b>10</b><i>b</i>, a resistance that the carriers in the second emitter <b>13</b> needs to be resisted for a transverse transmission is much greater than a resistance that needs to be resisted for a direct convergence toward the second electrode <b>16</b>. Therefore, carriers flowing through the tunneling layer <b>11</b> to the second emitter <b>13</b> always tend to converge toward the second electrode <b>16</b>. That is to say, even if the first emitter <b>12</b> and the second emitter <b>13</b> with different conductivity types are in contact with each other, due to a restriction of the transmission path resistance, the solar cell has obviously discrete positive electrode and negative electrode, and the positive electrode and negative electrode of the solar cell may not have obvious short-circuit problem. The present structure overcomes the prejudice of the existing technologies.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some embodiments, a sidewall surface of the first emitter <b>12</b> is in contact with a sidewall surface of the second emitter <b>13</b>. Further, in the direction perpendicular to the second surface <b>10</b><i>b</i>, the second emitter <b>13</b> has a thickness of 30 nm to 200 nm, such as 40 nm, 70 nm, 90 nm, 120 nm, 150 nm, 160 nm or the like. If the thickness of the second emitter <b>13</b> is less than the above threshold, the field passivation effect of the second emitter <b>13</b> of the second region <b>102</b> may be relatively weak, and the second region <b>102</b> may have a relatively serious carrier recombination problem. If the thickness of the second emitter <b>13</b> is greater than the above threshold, then the resistance of the carriers in the second emitter <b>13</b> for the transverse transmission is relatively small, and the carriers in the second emitter <b>13</b> of the second region <b>102</b> is more likely to undergo the transverse transmission to move into the first electrode <b>15</b>, which is not conducive to suppressing the short circuit problem between the first emitter <b>12</b> and the second emitter <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Further, by configuring the first electrode <b>15</b> away from the second region <b>102</b>, a path resistance of the carriers in the second emitter <b>13</b> of the second region <b>102</b> to the first electrode <b>15</b> may be increased, and thus a short-circuit current between the first electrode <b>15</b> and the second electrode <b>16</b> may be suppressed. Similarly, by configuring the second electrode <b>16</b> to extend into the second emitter <b>13</b>, a path resistance of the carriers in the second region <b>102</b> to the second electrode <b>16</b> may be decreased, and the carriers may be promoted to converge toward the second electrode <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments, the substrate <b>10</b> has a substantially flat second surface <b>10</b><i>b</i>. In some embodiments, the flat second surface <b>10</b><i>b </i>can be formed by a polishing process. A surface of the first emitter <b>12</b> facing the substrate <b>10</b> is flush with a surface of the second emitter <b>13</b> of the second region <b>102</b> facing the substrate <b>10</b>. The second emitter <b>13</b> covers the sidewall surface of the first emitter <b>12</b>. A specific process for forming the above structure includes: providing the substrate <b>10</b> with the second surface <b>10</b><i>b </i>and the tunneling layer <b>11</b> with a uniform film thickness; sequentially performing a maskless deposition process and a patterned etching process to form the patterned first emitter <b>12</b>; and performing a second maskless deposition process to form the second emitter <b>13</b>. That is to say, the above structure may be formed by performing the patterned etching process once. Compared with a traditional process of performing patterned etching processes twice, which respectively configures the positions of the first emitter <b>12</b> and the second emitter <b>13</b>, it is beneficial to reducing the accuracy alignment requirements and the number of masks required, thus improving the electrical performance of the solar cell and reducing the preparation cost of the solar cell.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some embodiments, compared with a textured surface, configuring the flat second surface <b>10</b><i>b </i>is also beneficial to preventing a sunlight incident on the first surface <b>10</b><i>a </i>from being transmitted out of the second surface <b>10</b><i>b</i>, thereby reducing the light transmission loss of the solar cell and improving the light absorption efficiency of the solar cell.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some embodiments, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the substrate <b>20</b> of the second region <b>202</b> is convex relative to the substrate <b>20</b> of the first region <b>201</b>, e.g., at the second surface <b>20</b><i>b </i>of the substrate <b>20</b>. Herein, the substrate <b>20</b> of the second region <b>202</b> refers to a first portion of the substrate <b>20</b> corresponding to the second region, and the substrate <b>20</b> of the first region <b>201</b> refers to a second portion of the substrate <b>20</b> corresponding to the first region. The first emitter <b>22</b> has a third surface (not labeled) facing away from the tunneling layer <b>21</b>. The second emitter <b>23</b> has a fourth surface (not labeled) in contact with the tunneling layer <b>21</b>. The third surface is flush with or lower than the fourth surface, e.g., in a direction away from the second surface <b>20</b><i>b </i>of the substrate <b>20</b>. The specific process for forming the above structure includes: patterning and etching the substrate <b>20</b> to form a relatively concave-convex second surface <b>20</b><i>b</i>; covering the second surface <b>20</b><i>b </i>with a tunnel layer <b>21</b> having a uniform film thickness; sequentially performing a deposition process and a planarization process to form the first emitter <b>22</b> disposed at the first region <b>201</b>, where the third surface of the first emitter <b>22</b> is lower than or flush with a surface of the tunneling layer <b>21</b> of the second region away from the substrate; performing a maskless deposition process to form the second emitter <b>23</b>. That is to say, the above structure may be formed by performing the patterned etching process once, and the second emitter <b>23</b> in the structure has a flat surface facing away from the substrate <b>20</b>, which is beneficial to reducing the complexity of subsequent coating of conductive paste and ensuring that the first electrode <b>25</b> and the second electrode <b>26</b> have good alignment accuracy.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Herein, when the third surface is lower than the fourth surface, a vertical distance between the third surface and the fourth surface in a direction perpendicular to the second surface <b>20</b><i>b </i>may be set to 0.1 &#x3bc;m to 5 &#x3bc;m, such as 1 &#x3bc;m, 2 &#x3bc;m or 3 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some embodiments, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the tunneling layer <b>31</b> includes a first dielectric layer <b>311</b> and a second dielectric layer <b>312</b>. The first dielectric layer <b>311</b> is disposed between the first emitter <b>32</b> and the substrate <b>30</b>, that is, the first dielectric layer <b>311</b> is only disposed in the first region <b>301</b>.

Herein, the second surface <b>30</b><i>b </i>of the substrate <b>30</b> of the second region <b>302</b> refers to the surface of the second portion of the substrate <b>30</b> corresponding to the second portion <b>302</b>. The third surface is a surface of the first emitter <b>32</b> facing away from the first dielectric layer <b>311</b>. The second emitter <b>33</b> is disposed on the second dielectric layer <b>312</b>. The first electrode <b>35</b> is in electrical contact with the first emitter <b>32</b> by penetrating through the first passivation layer <b>34</b>, the second emitter <b>33</b> and the second dielectric layer <b>312</b> sequentially.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Similarly, the above structure may be formed by performing the patterned etching process once, which is used to sequentially etch a first emitter film and a first dielectric film stacked to form the first emitter <b>32</b> and the first dielectric layer <b>311</b>. In addition, the second dielectric layer <b>312</b> and the second emitter <b>33</b> may be formed by a maskless deposition process. The design of the above structure may provide the second dielectric layer <b>312</b> which isolates the first emitter <b>32</b> from the second emitter <b>33</b> without increasing the patterned etching process, so as to inhibit the possible carrier recombination and interpenetration of doped ions between the first emitter <b>32</b> and the second emitter <b>33</b>, and ensure the solar cell to have a relatively high photoelectric conversion efficiency.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some embodiments, a material of the second dielectric layer <b>312</b> is different from a material of the first dielectric layer <b>311</b>. For example, a dielectric constant of the material of the second dielectric layer <b>312</b> is smaller than a dielectric constant of the material of the first dielectric layer <b>311</b>, so that the first dielectric layer <b>311</b> has a better tunneling effect and the second dielectric layer <b>312</b> has a better isolation effect. In other embodiments, a film thickness of the first dielectric layer <b>311</b> is different from a film thickness of the second dielectric layer <b>312</b>.

In a second case, the first dielectric layer <b>311</b> is composed of a single material, while the second dielectric layer <b>312</b> includes a plurality of sub-film layers, and different sub-film layers have different materials. For example, the second dielectric layer <b>312</b> includes a first sub-film layer (not shown) and a second sub-film layer (not shown). The first sub-film layer covers the second surface <b>30</b><i>b </i>and the surface of the first emitter <b>32</b>, while the second sub-film layer covers a surface of the first sub-film. In this way, a material of the first sub-film layer may be selected to make the first sub-film layer have a good passivation effect, reduce a surface defect and carrier recombination on the second surface <b>30</b><i>b </i>of the substrate <b>30</b>, and a material of the second sub-film layer may be selected so that there is a good electrical isolation effect between the first emitter <b>32</b> and the second emitter <b>33</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Herein, the material of the first dielectric layer <b>311</b> includes at least one of oxygen silicide, nitrogen silicide and carbon silicide.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some embodiments, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the second emitter <b>43</b> includes a first doped portion <b>431</b> and a second doped portion <b>432</b>.

A doping concentration of the first doped portion <b>431</b> is greater than or equal to a doping concentration of the second doped portion <b>432</b>. Doping concentrations of different regions of the second doped portion <b>432</b> decreases in a direction of the first doped portion <b>431</b> towards the first electrode <b>45</b>. Compared with providing an intrinsic polysilicon between the second emitter <b>43</b> and the first electrode <b>45</b> for isolation, providing the second doped portion <b>432</b> with a concentration gradient is beneficial to reducing a concentration difference between different interfaces, weakening a diffusive force of doped ions in the second emitter <b>43</b>, preventing the intrinsic polysilicon from being uniformly doped due to a strong diffusive force, and ensuring that a contact surface between the first electrode <b>45</b> and the second doped portion <b>432</b> has a relatively large contact resistance, thereby suppressing a short-circuit current between the first electrode <b>45</b> and the second emitter <b>43</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In a case that a doping concentration of a surface layer of the second doped portion <b>432</b> facing the first doped portion <b>431</b> may be regarded as equal to the doping concentration of the first doped portion <b>431</b>, it can be understood that the smaller the concentration gradient of the second doped portion <b>432</b>, the smaller diffusive force of doped ions in the first doped portion <b>431</b> due to the concentration difference, and the better the barrier effect of the second doped portion <b>432</b>.
