Field of the Disclosure</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates generally to image forming devices and more particularly to a replaceable unit for an electrophotographic image forming device having a movable electrical connector.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">During the electrophotographic printing process, an electrically charged rotating photoconductive drum is selectively exposed to a laser beam. The areas of the photoconductive drum exposed to the laser beam are discharged creating an electrostatic latent image of a page to be printed on the photoconductive drum. Toner particles are then electrostatically picked up by the latent image on the photoconductive drum creating a toned image on the drum. The toned image is transferred to the print media (e.g., paper) either directly by the photoconductive drum or indirectly by an intermediate transfer member. The toner is then fused to the media using heat and pressure to complete the print.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The image forming device's toner supply is typically stored in one or more replaceable units that have a shorter lifespan than the image forming device. It is desired to communicate various operating parameters and usage information of the replaceable unit(s) to the image forming device for proper operation. For example, it may be desired to communicate such information as replaceable unit serial number, replaceable unit type, toner color, toner capacity, amount of toner remaining, license information, etc. The replaceable unit(s) typically include processing circuitry configured to communicate with and respond to commands from a controller in the image forming device. The replaceable unit(s) also include memory associated with the processing circuitry that stores program instructions and information related to the replaceable unit. The processing circuitry and associated memory are typically mounted on a circuit board that is attached to the replaceable unit. The replaceable unit also includes one or more electrical contacts that mate with corresponding electrical contacts in the image forming device upon installation of the replaceable unit in the image forming device in order to facilitate communication between the processing circuitry of the replaceable unit and the controller of the image forming device. It is important to accurately position the electrical contacts of the replaceable unit relative to the corresponding electrical contacts of the image forming device in order to ensure a reliable connection between the processing circuitry of the replaceable unit and the controller of the image forming device when the replaceable unit is installed in the image forming device. Accordingly, positioning features that provide precise alignment of the electrical contacts of the replaceable unit with corresponding electrical contacts of the image forming device are desired.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A replaceable unit for an electrophotographic image forming device according to one example embodiment includes a housing having a top, a bottom, a front and a rear positioned between a first side and a second side of the housing.

However, in other embodiments, the location of the pivot axis of the electrical connector of the toner cartridge moves relative to the housing of the toner cartridge as the electrical connector of the toner cartridge pivots between the retracted position and the operative position.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Further, the embodiment illustrated includes a rigid electrical connector <b>130</b> including electrical contacts <b>132</b> positioned on a rigid printed circuit board <b>138</b>. However, in other embodiments, the electrical contacts of the electrical connector of the toner cartridge are flexible relative to the housing of the toner cartridge permitting the electrical contacts to flex between the retracted position and the operative position. For example, the electrical contacts of the electrical connector of the toner cartridge may be formed on a flexible printed circuit board or the electrical contacts may be electrically connected to a printed circuit board mounted elsewhere on the housing of the toner cartridge and positioned on or connected to a flexible substrate other than the printed circuit board.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Further, while the embodiment illustrated includes an electrical connector <b>130</b> of toner cartridge <b>100</b> that pivots between the retracted position and the operative position, it will be appreciated that the electrical connector of the toner cartridge may move in other manners relative to the housing of the toner cartridge between the retracted position and the operative position, such as, for example, translating between the retracted position and the operative position. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> shows a toner cartridge <b>1100</b> having an electrical connector <b>1130</b> positioned on a side <b>1109</b> of a housing <b>1102</b>. Electrical connector <b>1130</b> translates outward sideways (away from side <b>1109</b>) as electrical connector <b>1130</b> travels from the retracted position to the operative position and inward sideways (toward side <b>1109</b>) as electrical connector <b>1130</b> travels from the operative position to the retracted position. In the embodiment illustrated, electrical connector <b>1130</b> translates parallel to a side-to-side dimension <b>1118</b> of housing <b>1102</b>. In other embodiments, electrical connector <b>1130</b> translates at an angle to side-to-side dimension <b>1118</b> of housing <b>1102</b>, e.g., upward, downward, rearward and/or frontward. In the example embodiment illustrated, the movement of electrical connector <b>1130</b> between the retracted position and the operative position is controlled by engagement between a post <b>1170</b> extending from electrical connector <b>1130</b> and an elongated slot <b>1172</b> on housing <b>1102</b>. However, this configuration may be reversed or other configurations may be used as desired. In the example embodiment illustrated, electrical connector <b>1130</b> includes an actuation member <b>1142</b> having a cam surface <b>1144</b> that contacts a corresponding actuation member on the imaging unit during the installation of toner cartridge <b>1100</b> onto the imaging unit to move electrical connector <b>130</b> from the retracted position to the operative position.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">It will also be appreciated that imaging unit <b>200</b> may include one or more actuation or cam features modified relative to cam surface <b>256</b> of the example embodiment illustrated as desired in order to actuate the electrical connector of the toner cartridge from the retracted position to the operative position during installation of the toner cartridge onto the imaging unit. Alternatively, the electrical connector of the toner cartridge may be actuated by other means, such as, for example, by a linkage actuated by the opening and closing of the access door of the image forming device or by a user-actuated mechanism.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">While the example embodiment illustrated includes a magnetic sensor <b>150</b> positioned on an electrical connector <b>130</b> that moves between a retracted position and an operative position, in other embodiments including a magnetic sensor, either or both of magnetic sensor <b>150</b> and electrical contact(s) <b>132</b> may be fixedly positioned on housing <b>102</b> of toner cartridge <b>100</b> as desired.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">While the example embodiment illustrated includes toner cartridge <b>100</b> having a movable electrical connector <b>130</b> and imaging unit <b>200</b> having an actuation member that moves electrical connector <b>130</b> from its retracted position to its operative position during installation of toner cartridge <b>100</b> onto imaging unit <b>200</b>, this configuration may be reversed as desired such that the imaging unit includes a movable electrical connector and the toner cartridge includes an actuation member that moves the electrical connector from a retracted position to an operative position during mating of the toner cartridge with the imaging unit.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Although the example embodiment discussed above includes a pair of replaceable units in the form of a toner cartridge <b>100</b> that includes the main toner supply for the image forming device and the developer unit and an imaging unit <b>200</b> that includes the photoconductor unit for each toner color, it will be appreciated that the replaceable unit(s) of the image forming device may employ any suitable configuration as desired. For example, in one embodiment, the main toner supply for the image forming device is provided in a first replaceable unit and the developer unit and photoconductor unit are provided in a second replaceable unit. In another embodiment, the main toner supply for the image forming device, the developer unit and the photoconductor unit are provided in a single replaceable unit. Other configurations may be used as desired.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Further, it will be appreciated that the architecture and shape of toner cartridge <b>100</b> and imaging unit <b>200</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>6</b></figref> is merely intended to serve as an example. Those skilled in the art understand that toner cartridges, and other toner containers, may take many different shapes and configurations.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The foregoing description illustrates various aspects of the present disclosure.
