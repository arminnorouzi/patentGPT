id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">Apparatus and methods of artificial intelligent based provision of digital content where and when the digital content is needed based upon where a user is located and a purpose for accessing the content as well as credentials of a user seeking to access the digital content. Persistent digital content is linked to location coordinates. More specifically, the present invention links a physical onsite location with digital content to enable a user interface with augmented reality that combines aspects of the physical area with location specific digital content. In addition, access to digital content may be limited to users in defined access areas.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="190.75mm"

More specifically, the present invention links an interactive interface providing digital content to a physical area and a purpose for accessing the physical area. An augmented reality combines aspects of the physical area with location specific digital content. Digital content remains persistent with a location over a period of time.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The twenty first century has rapidly generated enormous amounts of digital data. Some estimates indicate that on average, each person generates 1.7 MB of data every second. Currently it is estimated that mankind has generated and stored more than 44 zetabytes (sextillion bytes or 10<sup>21 </sup>(1,000,000,000,000,000,000.000) bytes) of digital information, and it is estimated that the amount of digital data generated and stored by 2025 will exceed 200 zetabytes.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A problem arises pertaining to which information is most useful to a user who is located in a particular location, at a particular time, and for a particular purpose. Human beings are simply not capable of organizing and accessing the increasingly larger amounts of data available in a timeframe meaningful to accomplish a particular purpose.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">This problem is particularly acute as it relates to buildings and real estate properties in general. Information related to properties is stored in multiple different environments, with most users unaware of where or how to access the information. The problem is further exasperated by each data storage environment requiring different skill sets and credentials to access. Most people involved in building construction and maintenance may be highly skilled in their particular field, but will not be skilled in using the complex digital tools, such as building information modeling (&#x201c;BIM&#x201d;) or smart building infrastructure, or even sort through the tremendous amount of portable document format (&#x201c;pdf&#x201d;) information typically associated with a building or other structure on a property.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The need to automatically have information segregated and presented to users is growing as workers tasked with constructing and maintaining buildings exit the workforce or move to other areas or buildings. The knowledge that workers have accumulated about a particular property moves with those workers or is lost to retirement. However, currently, it is difficult, if not impossible, to automatically receive information pertinent to a designated area of a building based upon existing systems and processes. It is especially difficult to receive information related to a subject area when a user does not know what to ask for, or what type of information may be available to the user.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In addition to making information available where and when it is needed there is also a need to limit access to information to only those people who are entitled to access it. In essence, as the world grows in an amount of information available, systems for accessing to the information need to become more robust.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, the present invention includes methods and apparatus for using a controller to provide the right information, and the right time, to the right person, at the right location, for the right reason. A controller transceives digital content descriptive of physical attributes of a building or other structure (which may be referred to herein collectively as a building), actions taken by an Agent that are associated with the building, and data provided by electronic sensors quantifying conditions present in the building.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention is based upon a premise that if you cannot find it, you may as well not have it, and includes methods and apparatus for providing digital content in an Agent interface based upon the Agent's purpose for accessing a physical location at a particular time. The present invention uses artificial intelligence (AI) to perform the task of selecting and presenting pertinent information in an Agent interface based upon a geospatial designation and a need associated with accessing the information. The pertinent information will be selected from a larger body of information preferably stored on a computer server, such as a cloud server, or on a smart device.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some respects, the present invention uses a controller running AI to accomplish a disciplined pursuit of providing less, more focused information, based upon a given set of circumstances. The circumstances will include a physical location and a designation of what is important at a point in time to a particular Agent. Similarly, the present invention provides increased security by only allowing specific information to be accessed by an Agent that is positioned at an area designated for receipt of the specific information.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">For example, AI may be deployed to ascertain that a plumber that is on a third floor of a building to repair a plumbing fixture only needs information related to the relevant plumbing fixture on the third floor, and not other building information, such as electrical, HVAC or architectural information, or even information relating to plumbing on a different floor in another area of the same floor of the building. Similarly, an HVAC technician may need to know an airflow quantified by an airflow sensor in a particular location, and whether the amount quantified is within a specified range (and what the specified range is), where a rooftop unit (&#x201c;RTU&#x201d;) associated with the airflow is, service records for the RTU, equipment type, and other data related to HVAC, but not data related to architectural features. The present invention ascertains a relevant physical area, such as for example where an Agent is located in relation to the sensor and presents digital content appropriate for a given set of circumstances and purpose to be served. In general, some embodiments of the present invention recognizes that in order for information to be valuable to a given set of circumstances, it must be tied to a goal and made available. Accordingly, a controller uses AI to apply a version of the Pareto principal and exclude a trivial majority of information available (e.g., 80% or more) and include the vital minority of information (e.g., 20% or less) that is helpful for accomplishing a goal.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another aspect, the present invention persistently associates information with geospatial area such that if a position within the area is specified, the information may be made available to one or more of an Agent: a vendor, an owner, data aggregator or other designated recipient of the information; based upon reference to the position within the area.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In still another aspect, a position of an Agent may be electronically tracked, and AI may determine information relevant to a physical area based upon the physical location of the Agent. An Agent interface may also indicate where a position of information, or physical item, is located in relation to the position of the Agent.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">A location of information may be associated with positioning coordinates and/or an offset from a known position. A location of an Agent may also be associated with positioning coordinates and/or an offset from a known point.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The Agent interface may include graphical representation of an area at least partially defined by a geospatial position contemplated by the Agent interface. In some embodiments, an area defined by a geospatial position contemplated by an Agent is based upon a current position occupied by the Agent and a direction of interest provided by the Agent. In other embodiments, a geospatial position contemplated by the Agent interface may be designated on a two dimensional representation of an area encompassing the geospatial position. Therefore, digital content that is linked to a physical area may be provided to an Agent based upon an identification of the Agent, where the Agent is, and which direction the Agent is oriented towards, or orienting a smart device towards.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In still further aspects, some embodiments of the present invention provide an interactive user interface with content derived from an immediate environment the Agent is located in and virtual content. For example, the present invention enables a user to direct a Smart Device, such as a smart phone, towards an area of interest to the user and a user interface is presented on the user's smart device (and/or a remote smart device) the interface includes an augmented reality environment that combines a rendition of the physical environment present to the user and location specific information in the form of digital content.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some examples, a transceiver may be co-located with a sensor and engage in wireless communication. Based upon the wireless communication, location coordinates indicating where the sensor is located. The sensor quantifies a condition at a specific location. When a user views the physical area containing the sensor with the Smart Device, the Smart Device displays a rendition of the area monitored by the sensor and with the conditions quantified by the sensor.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some aspects, the present invention enables point and query access to information or other content relative to a Smart Device. The Smart Device may be used to generate an interface indicating what people, equipment, vehicles, or other items are viewable to the Smart Device and place those items into the context of the environment surrounding the Smart Device.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In general, the present invention may also associate digital content with Tags associated with location coordinates. A Tag may include one or more of a Physical Tag, a Virtual Tag, and a Hybrid Tag (as described in the Glossary below). Tags provide persistent access to specified digital content based upon the Tag's association of the content with a set of location coordinates and/or an area of positional coordinates including the location coordinates. For example, a set of positional coordinates may be located near an architectural aspect of a structure, such as a point of intersection of two beams. A Tag may be associated with the set of positional coordinates. An Area of digital content interaction (e.g., retrieval of digital content and/or placement of digital content for subsequent retrieval) may include the set of positional coordinates and also include an area comprising additional sets of positional coordinates, surrounding the set of positional coordinates, adjacent to the set of positional coordinates, and/or proximate to the set of positional coordinates.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">This functionality is accomplished by establishing a target area and determining which tags are present within the target area. Tags may be virtual; in which case the virtual tags are associated with positional coordinates and viewable whenever a target area is designated to encompass the coordinates the virtual tag.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Alternatively, the tags may be physical, such as a small disk adhered to an item of equipment, vehicle, or a person's employee badge. Tracking of a position and content associated a physical tag may be updated in real time or on a periodic basis. Physical tags may be moved into a target area, or the target area may be moved to encompass the physical tag. The present invention will automatically generate an interface indicating which tags contained in the interface, what those tags are associated with and where a tag is in relation to the Smart Device. It will also access any information that has been stored and associated with the tag and present int on the Smart Device.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">By aligning real world and virtual world content, a real world site experience is enriched with content from a geospatially linked virtual world. The virtual world content is made available to an Agent based upon a position and a direction of a Radio Target Area (&#x201c;RTA&#x201d;) specified by a Smart Device supported by the Agent. A geospatial position and direction of interest that is contained within the RTA is generated using wireless communication with reference point transmitters. Wireless communication capabilities of the Reference Point Transmitters determine parameters associated with a Wireless Communication Area (&#x201c;WCA&#x201d;). The RTA is a subset of the WCA.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some embodiments, access to protected digital content requires the presence of an Agent in a defined geospatial area and corresponding location coordinates. The AIR interface incorporates interactive icons representative of the Virtual Tags at the locations specified by the location coordinates within the defined geospatial area. For example, an authorized geospatial area may include a physical structure; such as an office; a manufacturing facility; a warehouse or other storage facility; a military base; an airport; a construction worksite; an energy substation; a cellular tower site; a distribution center; a residential facility; an infrastructure, such as a bridge or tunnel; or other definable area.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Digital content linked to a physical area is provided to an Agent based upon an identification of the Agent, where the Agent is, and which direction the Agent is oriented towards. In some embodiments, the present invention provides an interactive user interface with content derived from an immediate environment the Agent is located in and virtual content. For example, the present invention enables a user to direct a Smart Device, such as a smart phone, towards an area of interest to the user and a user interface is presented on the user's smart device (and/or a remote smart device) the interface includes an augmented reality environment that combines a rendition of the physical environment present to the user and location specific information in the form of digital content.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">A Virtual Tag infrastructure (VTI) provides a cryptographic technique that enables secure access to digital content via one or both of: secure networks; and an insecure public networks, such as the Internet. Virtual Tag cryptography reliably verifies an authorized request for access to digital content by a user or other Agent. In various embodiments, location coordinates are used to verify an authorized request to access protected digital content. The location coordinates correspond with one or more of a location of a Virtual Tag; a location of a Physical Tag; a location of a smart device; and a location of another type of Node.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In another aspect, Virtual Tag cryptography may be based upon location coordinates of designated areas of access to the digital content. Still further aspects may rely upon location coordinates of a Virtual Tag, a Physical Tag a smart device and/or a Node at intervals over a defined period of time prior to a request to access the digital content.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The VII includes a system for the creation, storage, and distribution of digital content based upon presentation of authorizing credentials based, at least in part, upon location coordinates. The location coordinates may relate to a first security factor based upon one or both of a location of a Virtual Tag; and a Physical Tag; and a second factor based upon a location or sequence of locations of an Agent seeking to access the digital content to retrieve, modify, or deposit digital content.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, authorizing credentials may include an improved version of a PKI infrastructure, wherein the PKI public certificate is a value based upon location coordinates of at least one of a: Virtual Tag, Physical Tag, Smart Device, or other Node. The public certificate may be used to verify that a particular Virtual Tag is accessible to an entity requesting access. The VII creates digital certificates that map Virtual Tags to locations, and maps authorized access areas to users requesting access (or who may request access). In this manner, the public key includes positional coordinates, or may be derived from positional coordinates. For example, derivation may be accomplished via an algorithmic processing of location coordinate values. Location coordinate values may be those determined at a time interval during a request to access the digital content, and/or during a time interval prior to a request to access digital content.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">A VTI may include one or more of: a VII certificate authority that stores, issues and processes digital certificates based upon location coordinates and time interval values; a central directory providing a secure location in which location values associated with Virtual Tags digital content are stored and indexed; and a Virtual Tag management system managing positional coordinates and associated digital content.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The present invention a multifactor authentication for protecting access to digital content that includes a mathematical scheme for verifying the authenticity of a request for access to the digital content and authenticity of a provider of digital content. Essentially, a valid digital signature or login credentials based upon location coordinate values, personal knowledge and possession of a known hardware device provides the VII with extremely strong evidence to determine that an access request was submitted by a known sender, resulting in a location/user based authentication, and confidence in the integrity of the digital content.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some embodiments, the present invention enables point, touch, and query; and point, touch, and deposit; access to information or other digital content proximate to a Smart Device. The Smart Device may be used to generate an interface indicating what people, equipment, vehicles, or other items are viewable to the Smart Device and place those items into the context of the environment surrounding the Smart Device.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The details of one or more examples of the invention are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below.

Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The present invention relates to the use of artificial intelligence to provide digital content to an Agent based a geospatial location linked to the digital content and a purpose for the Agent to have access to the digital content. In addition, the present invention provides for both an onsite Agent and a remote Agent to geospatially locate digital content for subsequent use in AI processes and provision to Agents.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In some embodiments, an onsite Agent may collocate digital content with the onsite Agent geospatial position and/or provide an offset from the User's geospatial position. AI processes access a larger body of data and determine which digital content is appropriate for a particular circumstances associated with a specific Agent accessing the digital content at a particular time and the geospatial position of the onsite Agent. In some embodiments, an Agent (either onsite or remote) may override an AI selection process and cause specific digital content to be made available to an Agent.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">According to the present invention, positions of one or more known points are designated as respective geospatial locations in a physical world environment. A user interface (sometimes referred to as a &#x201c;UI&#x201d;) may indicate where known points are located. Location coordinates relative to the known points may be used to geolocate digital content via Virtual Tags that are used to direct the Agent to the digital content. Other methods of geolocating Virtual Tags may also be used, such as, by way of non-limiting example: colocation of the Virtual Tag with a transceiver; image tagging; cloud point tagging; inertial movement dimensions from a known point; and magnetic field direction and distance.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">A User Interface for an onsite User may be based upon an Agent's geospatial position in the physical world and purpose for being in the geospatial position. Digital content is placed in a real world context and presented to an Agent interface based upon the Agent's position and in some embodiments, position combined with an indicated direction of interest.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Some embodiments include methods and apparatus for determining virtual world digital content linked to positional coordinates; and displaying real-world energy levels integrated with and aligned with the virtual-world digital content. Such embodiments enable digital content to be persistently accessible via identification of a geospatial a location even if visual aspects of the location change.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In some examples, a Reference Node may be located at a known position. The Reference Node may receive and/or transmit signals in a radio frequency band of the electromagnetic spectrum. An Agent Smart Device may communicate with the Reference Node and determine a location of the Smart Device based upon the Smart Device communication with the Reference Node.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In a simple form, a Node may broadcast a radio frequency wireless communication. Nodes may also be capable of receiving a radio frequency on a same radio frequency and/or a different radio frequency as a received radio frequency. Frequencies utilized for wireless communication may include those within the electromagnetic spectrum radio frequencies used in one or more of: UWB, and Bluetooth modalities (including BLE), as well as IR, visible and UV light as examples of transmission modalities.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In the following sections, detailed descriptions of examples and methods of the invention will be given. The description of both preferred and alternative examples though thorough are exemplary only, and it is understood that, to those skilled in the art, variations, modifications, and alterations may be apparent. It is therefore to be understood that the examples do not limit the broadness of the aspects of the underlying invention as defined by the claims.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an interactive user interface <b>104</b> is illustrated with at least one Virtual Tag <b>105</b>. The Virtual Tag <b>105</b> is linked to a geospatial position <b>113</b>. The geospatial position may be integrated into a reference image <b>112</b>. Integration of the Virtual Tag <b>105</b> into a reference image <b>112</b> helps a user orient an onsite Agent <b>102</b> located at an onsite Agent position <b>103</b>, with a User Interface <b>104</b> containing an onsite user virtual position <b>103</b>A. In some embodiments, the reference image <b>102</b> may include, by way of non-limiting example, a two dimensional floorplan illustrating architectural aspects such as walls, doors, and fixtures and/or other features that may be recognizable by an Agent, or other aspects of a design plan or architectural drawing that may or may not be recognizable to an onsite Agent <b>102</b>. Other reference images may include an orthographic view, perspective view, or other view from an angle, such as a doll house view of a building or other structure or area of land, such as a job site, storage area, utility area, airport, government facility, or other defined space.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In this disclosure the Agent position <b>103</b> may be considered dynamic as the Agent moves about a physical site, but considered static at a given instance of time. The user interface <b>104</b> may illustrate the onsite Agent virtual position <b>103</b>A relative to the reference image <b>112</b> at an instance of time, and/or over a period of time.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Onsite Agent <b>102</b> movement may be tracked, for example, by acknowledging the Agent position <b>103</b> aligning with a known point <b>107</b>-<b>108</b> and using inertial movement sensors and processes to register movement away from the known point <b>107</b>-<b>108</b> in a direction and for a distance (direction/distance <b>106</b>). In some non-limiting embodiments, the inertial movement sensors and processes may be incorporated into a Smart Device <b>110</b> supported by the onsite Agent <b>102</b>. In another aspect, in some embodiments, a direction/distance <b>106</b> from a last known point <b>107</b> may be noted on a user interface <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">According to the present invention, multiple known points <b>107</b>-<b>108</b> will be located at a physical onsite area, such as building site. A controller may register that the Agent is aligned with a first known point <b>107</b> and onsite Agent movement away from the known point <b>107</b> may be determined as the onsite Agent <b>102</b> moves about the physical site. An Agent position may be described via generation of positional coordinates (as described herein) and Agent movement may include, for example a direction and distance moved, a change in positional coordinates, or other quantifier of relative position. In some embodiments, onsite Agent movement may be presented via a user interface direction/distance indicator <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">As onsite Agent <b>102</b> relocates away from the first known point <b>107</b>, Onsite Agent movement during relocation may be determined via physical conditions quantified by sensors and/or other electronic devices incorporated into a Smart Device <b>110</b> supported by the onsite Agent <b>102</b>. Electronic devices in the Smart Device <b>102</b> that are involved in motion detection may be broadly referred to as an Inertial movement unit (&#x201c;IMU&#x201d;) and operative with software executed by the Smart Device <b>110</b> (and/or on a remote server) to track physical movement of the onsite Agent <b>102</b>. Onsite Agent <b>102</b> movement may be calculated based upon values of variables quantified by the IMU in the Smart Device <b>110</b> as the onsite Agent relocates, until the onsite Agent <b>102</b> aligns with a second known point <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">The user interface <b>104</b> may include an indicator of an onsite Agent position <b>103</b> presented as an onsite agent virtual position <b>103</b>A, The onsite agent virtual position <b>103</b>A may be viewable by one or both of a remote user <b>101</b> accessing a remote computing device (e.g., workstation; tablet: smart phone; or other controller) and an onsite agent <b>102</b> accessing a Smart Device <b>110</b>, or other person or automation accessing the user interface <b>104</b> via a controller.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">A Virtual Tag <b>105</b> may be located at a geospatial position <b>113</b> on the User Interface <b>104</b> that correlates with a physical world location. The User Interface <b>104</b> may also include graphical artifacts <b>114</b> descriptive of, or otherwise indicative of, items that are present in the onsite physical world and may be recognizable to the onsite Agent <b>102</b>. Items that are present in the physical world may be limited to those items within a designated area including the geospatial position. The designated area may be designated for example, via a radius surrounding the geospatial position <b>113</b> (or other curvilinear shape or polygon size that includes the geospatial position <b>113</b>). Items may include, by way of non-limiting example, one or more of: equipment items, architectural aspects, and fixtures. An onsite agent virtual position <b>103</b>A and the Virtual Tag <b>105</b> geospatial position <b>113</b> may also be included in the user interface <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Movement of the onsite Agent <b>102</b> may be displayed in the UI <b>104</b> and synchronized to the graphical artifacts <b>114</b> and VT <b>105</b> geospatial position <b>113</b> based upon a distance and direction <b>106</b> travelled by the onsite Agent <b>102</b> from a known point <b>107</b>-<b>108</b> and a scale of graphical artifacts <b>114</b> included in the UI <b>104</b>. For example, if a UI <b>104</b> includes reference image <b>112</b> that includes a floorplan based upon an architectural design or CAD drawing or the like, the floorplan may be associated with a known scale, however, in the event that the scale is not known, AI may be used to recognize the graphical artifacts <b>114</b> and assign a standard measurement to the graphical artifact <b>114</b>. For example, a doorway may be recognized by AI and assigned a width of three feet (or other industry standard measurement), other graphical artifacts <b>114</b> may be associated with other standard measurements. Travel measured by an IMU in a Smart Device <b>110</b> may be quantified as onsite Agent <b>102</b> movement and onsite agent virtual position <b>103</b>A may be changed in the UI <b>104</b> based upon the onsite Agent <b>102</b> movement. The onsite agent virtual position <b>103</b>A may be changed according to a calculated scale associated with the reference image <b>112</b> and thereby allow the onsite agent virtual position <b>103</b>A to be accurately positioned amongst the graphical artifacts <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">For example, in some embodiments, as an onsite Agent <b>102</b> enters into an area associated with a known point <b>107</b>-<b>108</b>, the onsite Agent virtual position <b>103</b>A may be adjusted in the UI <b>104</b> to align with graphical artifacts <b>114</b> that represent physical items in the physical world proximate to the onsite Agent <b>102</b> (such as, for example, those within visible and/or audible range of onsite Agent). As the onsite Agent <b>102</b> relocates, the IMU may register values for variables quantified by electronic devices in the Smart Device <b>110</b> that indicate movement of the Agent <b>102</b> in a direction and for a distance calculated by the IMU. The onsite agent virtual position <b>103</b>A in the UI <b>104</b> may be modified to correlate with the direction and magnitude of movement of the Agent <b>102</b> from the last known point <b>107</b>-<b>108</b> the onsite Agent <b>102</b> aligned with. The direction/distance <b>106</b> travelled by the Agent <b>102</b> may be scaled according to one or both of: a specified scale: and a controller determined scale based upon a size of features in the reference image <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">As discussed further herein, some embodiments may include calculation of an Agent onsite position <b>103</b> based upon wireless communications, such as UWB, WiFi, Bluetooth, sonic; and/or ultrasonic communications. Wireless communications may be referenced alone or in combination with IMU measurements. In some embodiments, wireless communications may increase the accuracy of position determination by calculating a distance from a wireless transceiver. IMU measurements may indicate a direction and the distance from the transceiver may indicate a distance. In some embodiments, AI processes may adjust an onsite Agent <b>102</b> to avoid placing the onsite Agent virtual position <b>103</b>A in a location occupied by an item in the reference image <b>112</b>. For example, a distance calculated by a wireless communication and a direction generated by an IMU may provide multiple possible onsite Agent virtual position <b>103</b>A in the UI <b>104</b>. AI may be used to remove any virtual positions occupied by an item in the reference image, such as a column or piece of machinery.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">In another aspect, the UI <b>104</b> allows one or both of, the remote User <b>101</b> and the onsite Agent <b>102</b>, to place a VT <b>105</b> at a designated geospatial position <b>113</b> that is the same as the onsite agent virtual position <b>103</b>A, or offset to the onsite agent virtual position <b>103</b>A. The VT <b>105</b> appears at a location on the reference image <b>112</b> specified by the onsite Agent <b>102</b>. For example, an offset may include a direction and distance from the onsite Agent position <b>103</b>. The location on the reference image <b>112</b> correlates with an onsite geospatial position <b>113</b> in the physical world. In some embodiments, AI may present a selection of distances from an onsite Agent <b>102</b> in a given direction. For example, if an IMU unit is used to determine a direction that a Smart Device <b>110</b> is pointing, then AI may provide a selection of likely distances from the onsite Agent virtual position based upon a distance to an artifact, equipment item, wall, doorway, window, or other aspect identified by the AI as an item that may be desirable to the Agent <b>102</b> to place a Virtual Tag <b>105</b> on.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In another aspect, one or both of, the remote User <b>101</b> and the onsite Agent <b>102</b>, may activate an interactive user device <b>115</b> to create a Virtual Tag <b>105</b> with a geospatial location at the location of the onsite Agent <b>102</b>. In other embodiments the Virtual Tag may be offset from the geospatial position <b>112</b> of the onsite Agent <b>102</b> by a specified distance in a specified direction.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">In this manner, an onsite Agent <b>102</b> or the remote User <b>101</b> may view the UI <b>104</b> to ascertain the onsite Agent's <b>102</b> position relative to the physical world around the onsite Agent <b>102</b> as depicted by the graphical artifacts <b>114</b>. The UI <b>104</b> may include a geospatial position <b>113</b> of a VT <b>105</b> at a relative distance and direction to a current position <b>103</b><i>a </i>of the onsite Agent <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">As the onsite Agent <b>102</b> traverses through a known point <b>107</b>-<b>108</b> in the physical world, the current virtual position <b>103</b>A of the onsite Agent <b>102</b> may be synchronized with the geospatial position of the known point <b>107</b>-<b>108</b>. IMU/or wireless position tracking may be restarted from the most recent known point <b>107</b>-<b>108</b> that the onsite Agent <b>102</b> aligned with and the onsite Agent virtual position <b>103</b>A may be updated, as needed, to accurately represent the Agent position <b>103</b> following the restart of the IMU from the most recent known point <b>107</b>-<b>108</b>. Accordingly, in general, the Onsite user position <b>102</b> will equate to the most recent known point <b>107</b>-<b>108</b> traversed and an aggregate of distances and directions traveled following the onsite Agent <b>102</b> traversing a last known point <b>107</b>-<b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">The present invention may track an onsite Agent <b>102</b> traversing a known point <b>107</b>-<b>108</b> using one or more of: a BLE area, NFC, ANT, Hash barcode, triangulation, distance, and direction (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> distance based upon TDOA or TOA of a wireless communication, and direction of travel is IMU).</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Traversing a known point may include, by way of nonlimiting example, a determination that the Smart Device <b>110</b> is located within an area including the known point (known point area <b>107</b>A) may be accomplished via communication with a reference point transceiver <b>107</b>B (such as, for example, an iBeacon&#x2122; or other BLE transceiver. UWB transceiver, WiFi transceiver, or other wireless modality transceiver). The wireless communication may be used to determine that the Smart Device <b>110</b> is within an ascertainable distance to the iBeacon or other reference point transceiver <b>1078</b>, such as for example within 0.3 to 2.0 meters (and preferably within about 1.0 meter). Some preferred embodiments include using an iBeacon or other reference point transceiver <b>107</b>B to register when an onsite Agent <b>102</b> passes through a doorway, point in a hallway, such as passing an item of equipment or other ascertainable position that may be registered as a known point <b>107</b>-<b>108</b>. In such embodiments, an iBeacon or other reference point transceiver <b>107</b>B may be placed, for example, above a doorway or in a in a sill. As the onsite agent <b>102</b> passes through the doorway, the onsite agent will be within a meter of the iBeacon or other reference point transceiver <b>107</b>B. The IMU may synchronize with the first known point <b>107</b> and begin tracking movement of the onsite Agent <b>102</b> supporting the Smart Device <b>110</b>. When the onsite agent <b>102</b> carries the smart device <b>110</b> to the second known point <b>108</b> a second reference point transceiver <b>108</b>B may indicate that the onsite agent <b>102</b> is passing through a second area including a second known point <b>108</b>A.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">According to the present invention. AI may be used to enhance an onsite Agent's <b>102</b> and/or a remote User's <b>101</b> interaction with a physical area occupied by an onsite Agent <b>102</b>. One enhancement of an onsite Agent's <b>102</b> and/or a remote User's <b>101</b> interaction may include one or both of an onsite Agent <b>102</b> and an offsite User <b>101</b> to make Directional Query. The Directional Query may include, by way of non-limiting example, position of a Smart Device <b>110</b> and a query that includes a direction from the Smart Device <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, the direction from the Smart Device <b>110</b> may be based upon one or more of: a value of a directional variable generated by a Smart Device supported by an onsite Agent <b>102</b>, and wireless communications entered into by a transceiver integrated into the Smart Device <b>110</b> or collocated with the Smart Device <b>110</b>. A controller may use AI or other automated process to reference an onsite Agent position <b>102</b> and a direction indicated by a Smart Device <b>110</b> supported by the Agent <b>102</b> and generate a response to the Directional Query.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">For example, a Directional Query may include an item of equipment located in a direction indicated by pointing a Smart Device <b>110</b> in a direction and touching the Smart Device <b>110</b> screen to activate a user interactive interface. A response may include answers to the query based upon AI ascertaining that an item of equipment is within a certain distance from the Smart Device <b>110</b>, such as a vector value, or within a defined proximity to the Smart Device <b>110</b>, such as, in a same room and/or defined area as the Smart Device <b>110</b>, or within a defined zone or region as the Smart Device <b>110</b>. A zone or region may be defined according to position coordinates and/or a distance and direction from the Smart Device <b>110</b>. Various embodiments may include each of the preceding query parameters being generated from the onsite Agent <b>102</b> and/or the Smart Device <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">As used herein, AI processes will include automated processors and controllers that are able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence, such as, visual perception, decision making, pattern recognition and the like. The AI may be trained to use one or both of unstructured and structured queries, and be capable of processing unstructured data into useful information.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">In another aspect, in some embodiments, AI may be used to determine a room or other area, zone, or region in which the Smart Device is located. An area, zone, and/or region (discussed further herein), may be any subsection of a building or other structure that is logical for a set of circumstances. Examples of areas, zone, and regions may include, for example, one or more of: a hallway; a stairwell; a wing of a building; a floor of a building; a portion of a complex or campus; a portion of a manufacturing and/or processing plant; a neighborhood, a government delineation of land; or other defined geospatial area, AI processes may be used to identify Virtual Tags <b>105</b>, or other information</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">With the enormity of data available in current times, a need arises to differentiate between useful information and extraneous information for a given set of circumstances involving a particular location and particular Agent. The present invention implements the theory that less is often better when it comes to an amount of data to provide in a given set of circumstances. Accordingly, the present invention provides for AI to determine which data to present to one or both of: an onsite Agent <b>102</b> and an offsite user <b>101</b> based upon one or more of: a position a Virtual Tag; a position of an onsite Agent <b>102</b>; a direction the Agent <b>102</b> indicates: a direction of travel of the Agent <b>102</b> within a building; credentials associated with the Agent <b>102</b>; a purpose for the Agent <b>102</b> to be in the building; a security clearance for the Agent; results of a security challenge to the Agent <b>102</b>; a length of time that the Agent <b>102</b> is within the building; concurrent conditions and/or circumstances during the time the Agent <b>102</b> is within the building: a query submitted by one or both of the Agent <b>102</b> and the offsite user <b>101</b>; IoT sensor readings; an objective associated with the building, such as production or inhabitation; and AI perceived observations, such as results of an unstructured query and/or trend observed by machine processes.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">In still another aspect, in some embodiments, AI may be used to ascertain travel of an onsite Agent <b>102</b> and keep the onsite Agent <b>102</b> within portions of a floorplan included in the reference image <b>112</b> that an onsite Agent <b>102</b> would be able to traverse under normal circumstances. For example, AI may ascertain where walls, equipment, fixtures, or other architectural aspects or obstacles to onsite Agent <b>102</b> travel are located and understand that the onsite Agent <b>102</b> will not walk through a wall or other obstacle and keep the onsite Agent at a prescribed distance from the wall or other obstacle. A prescribed distance maybe preprogrammed into the AI (such as, for example, about 20 centimeters from a wall). Additional embodiments may include a distance being determined by AI based upon what is included in a surrounding area. For example, if an obstacle to walking (such as, for example, a water fountain in a hallway) is present, AI may keep the onsite Agent position <b>103</b> away from the water fountain, but perhaps closer to the water fountain than to a wall.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">While examples of the above AI variables are too numerous to delineate comprehensively. The present invention provides that conditions relating to: who, what, where, why, and how, may be applied to AI processes to best ascertain what information to provide one or both of an offsite User <b>101</b> and an onsite Agent <b>102</b>. Security may also be enhanced via four to five factor security protocols and/or creation of a virtual machine that is in existence only for a length of time optimal to perform a data transaction and then removed to prevent infiltration to the virtual machine.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">In some embodiments, a Virtual Tag <b>105</b> may include one or more of: routines, checklists, procedures, or other actions to be performed by an Agent <b>102</b> at a particular onsite agent position <b>103</b>. The onsite agent position <b>103</b> will correspond with a geospatial location in the physical world and may be illustrated in the user interface <b>104</b> as an onsite agent virtual position <b>103</b>A. A Virtual Tag <b>105</b> may also include one or more of alphanumeric data, documentation, image files, video files, biometric data, IoT sensor data, other electronic and/or analog device data, URLs, communication links, or other logical and/or digital content. In some embodiments, the Virtual Tag <b>105</b> contents may verify completion of an action at a particular geospatial location.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">In another aspect, in some embodiments, a Virtual Tag <b>105</b>A may include data generated by an onsite sensor, such as an IoT sensor <b>111</b>. The IoT sensor <b>111</b> may quantify a condition present on site. The user interface <b>104</b> may include a graphical representation of architectural aspects included in the reference image <b>112</b> and descriptive of a building or other structure. The user interface <b>104</b> may include a graphical representation of a location of an IoT sensor <b>111</b>, in some embodiments, an indication of one or more conditions present onsite that are quantified by the IoT sensor <b>111</b>. A Virtual Tag <b>105</b> may include information about the IoT sensor, such as type of sensor, when deployed, how deployed, parameters set in the IoT sensor <b>111</b>, who deployed the IoT sensor <b>111</b>, and data generated by the IoT sensor <b>111</b>. Data generated by the IoT sensor III may be real time (e.g., without artificial delay) and/or historical data.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">In sonic embodiments, executable programmable code may be executed by a controller and operative to ascertain whether a condition quantified by the IoT sensor <b>111</b> is within a normal operating range, and in the event that the condition quantified by the IoT sensor <b>111</b> is outside the normal operating range, an alert may be sent to one or both of the User <b>101</b> and the onsite Agent <b>102</b> and a Virtual Tag <b>105</b>A may be placed on the user interface <b>104</b> indicative of a location of the IoT sensor <b>111</b> reporting an out of normal condition, as well as the onsite Agent position <b>103</b> and a pathway that the onsite Agent <b>102</b> may travel in order to arrive in an area conducive to respond to the out of normal condition quantified.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, a Smart Device <b>110</b> is illustrated with a user interface <b>104</b> and a 3D perspective (sometimes referred to as a &#x201c;Dollhouse&#x201d;) view of a floorplan reference <b>122</b> (dollhouse view <b>122</b>).

User interactive devices <b>117</b>-<b>120</b>, may include areas of a touchscreen <b>121</b> on the smart device <b>110</b>. As illustrated, the user interactive areas enable an Agent <b>102</b> to touch the touchscreen <b>121</b> and access a virtual tag <b>117</b> and/or set a virtual tag <b>118</b>. Setting a virtual tag may include, determining a geospatial position <b>103</b> a Smart Device <b>110</b> and setting the Virtual Tag <b>105</b> at the same geospatial position <b>113</b> as the Smart Device <b>110</b> or at a geospatial position <b>113</b> that is offset from the position of the Smart Device <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">Additional functionality that may be implemented via activation of a user interactive device <b>117</b>-<b>120</b> includes user initiated position determination.

In this particular illustration, the term &#x201c;proximate to&#x201d; may infer by way of non-limiting example, that the Smart Device <b>205</b> is within visual and/or audio range of the Virtual Tag <b>201</b> by an Agent <b>202</b> supporting the Smart Device <b>205</b>, in other embodiments, &#x201c;proximate to&#x201d; may infer that the Virtual Tag is within wireless communication range of a transceiver operable by the Smart Device <b>205</b>.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">In some embodiments, access to the VT <b>201</b> may be restricted to a SD <b>205</b> located within an Authorized Transaction Area (ATA) <b>203</b>. AI processes may be used to determine whether the Smart Device <b>205</b> is located within ATA <b>203</b>. The ATA <b>203</b> may be almost any definable area feasible for a SD <b>205</b> to be located in, such as, by way of nonlimiting example: an area within a specified distance <b>206</b> of a VT <b>201</b>. The distance may be calculated based upon the methods described herein for determining a position of the Smart Device <b>205</b> in relation to a virtual tag geospatial position <b>213</b>, such as, for example, a distance based upon tracking inertial movement from a known position, relative timing of wireless communications, angle of transmission and receiving wireless transmissions, LiDAR, image recognition, or other modality for determining a Smart Device geospatial position <b>213</b>.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">In some embodiments, the distance calculation may also take into account a margin of accuracy for a technology modality used to determine a position, (including, for example, environmental interference with wireless communication): or other variable. Accordingly, if a secure transaction specifies that a SD <b>205</b> is 3.2 meters from a VT geospatial position <b>213</b>, and location determination modality has a margin of error of 0.8 meters, then a Smart Device position <b>207</b> determined to be within 4.0 meters of the VT geospatial position <b>213</b> may be allowed to access the Virtual Tag <b>201</b>.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">In some embodiments, an ATA <b>203</b> may be a defined area that is offsite from a site for the VT <b>201</b>, such as, for example, a remote ATA <b>203</b> may be in an office space area that is at a different geolocation than a Virtual Tag <b>205</b>. In such embodiments, an ATA <b>205</b> may be a secure location with physical security features, such as challenged entry points, security guards, and the like.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">Accordingly, one or more VTs <b>201</b> may be associated with an ATA <b>203</b> from which a Smart Device <b>205</b> is authorized to perform transactions involving the Virtual Tag <b>201</b>.

The Transceiver <b>204</b> may engage in logical transmission of sufficient data to calculate a Smart Device distance <b>208</b> indicative of how far the Smart Device is located from the VT <b>201</b> and/or the virtual tag transceiver <b>204</b>.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">In some embodiments, a directional aspect may be included to determine whether a SD <b>205</b> is within an ATA <b>203</b>, a virtual tag access distance <b>206</b> may not be enough to determine that the Smart Device at the location of transceiver <b>105</b> is located within a virtual tag <b>201</b> since a radio distance is often a radius. Therefore, the present invention provides for a Transceiver <b>204</b> to provide for directional transmissions.

Walls may also generate reflected sonic emanations.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0154">In some examples, as may be used in orienteering herein, an Agent-supported smart device may support receivers, transmitters or transceivers that interact with ultrasonic transceivers fixedly secured to a reference point position, such as via mechanical mounting within a room environment. An ultrasonic positioning system may have indoor positioning accuracy at centimeter, millimeter, and even sub-millimeter accuracy. Multiple ultrasonic Transceivers may transceive from an Agent-supported device to communicate with fixed reference point transceivers may transmit signals. Arrival of the sound transmissions may be accurately timed and converted to distances. In some embodiments, distance determinations may be improved with knowledge of temperatures in the environment containing the sound transceiving. For example, temperature may be measured at one or more of: an Agent-supported Smart Device, a Reference Point position, and an ambient environment.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0155">In some embodiments, synced timing apparatus is able to generate a location of a stationary Agent to within centimeter accuracy using sonic wave transmissions and reception and preferably within several millimeters of accuracy. In addition, in some embodiments sensors are able to detect frequency shifts within the sonic emanations which may add information about the relative rate of movement of the Agent, which may then in turn allow for correction to the timing signals.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0156">Further, in some embodiments, a combination of radio frequency emissions and ultrasonic emissions may be used. For example, a complement of radio frequency emissions/receptions and ultrasonic of radio frequency emissions and ultrasonic emissions may be reconciled to generate more accurate location determination. In another aspect, a radio frequency signal may be used to transmit syncing signals that establish a time that ultrasonic signals are transmitted. Since the electromagnetic transmissions may be orders of magnitude faster than sound transmissions, the electromagnetic transmissions relatively small time of travel from the Transceivers to the Agent may be negligible and therefore used as &#x201c;zero-time&#x201d; setpoints as received at the Agent-supported Transceiver. In such embodiments, a controller determining a location may use not only relative arrival times, but also a delta time between a radiofrequency transmission and ultrasonic transmission to determine a distance from a transmitting Transceiver. An array of such ultrasonic and/or radiofrequency transceivers provide increased accuracy in triangulating a location of the Agent.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0157">In still further examples, RF communications may not only transmit a syncing pulse, but also transmit digital data about various aspects of a defined area, such as the defined area's identification, its relative and/or absolute location in space and other refinements. In some examples, data related to improved distance calculation may also be transmitted by RF communication such as temperature of the environment, humidity and the like which may influence the speed of sound in the environment as a non-limiting example. In some examples, such a system may result in millimeter level accuracy of position determination.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0158">In some examples, the process may be iterated to refine the direction of each of the ultrasonic transmitters and maximize signal levels of the transmission which may provide additional information in the calculation of a position.

For example, a device with a controller and an accelerometer, such as mobile Smart Device, may include a user display that allows a direction to be indicated by movement of the device from a determined location acting as a base position towards a feature in the intended direction where the movement results in an extended position. In some implementations, the Smart Device may first determine a first position based upon triangulation with the reference points and a second position (extended position) also based upon triangulation with the reference points.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0160">As described above, facing a mobile device towards an area in a Structure and movement of the mobile device in a particular pattern may be used to ascertain a specific area in space to be interpreted by various methods. In some examples, the leading edge of a smart device, or the top portion of the user screen (in either portrait or landscape mode of display) may be the reference for the direction pointed in by the user. If the smart device is held at an angle relative to the ground, in some examples, the angle formed by the perpendicular to the top portion of the user screen may be projected upon the ground and that projection taken as the indication of direction.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0161">Some exemplary devices that may be used as a transceiving Node to engage in wireless communications useful to determine a Smart Device location may act as a Node and may include matrices (or arrays) of antennas that communicate wirelessly, such as via exemplary UWB, Sonic, Bluetooth, a or other Modality.

Each Node may include antenna arrays combined with a power source and circuitry to form complete self-contained devices. The Nodes or a controller may determine an RTT, time of arrival, AoA and/or AoD or other related angular determinations based upon values for variables involved in wireless communications. For example, a composite device may be formed when a Node with a configuration of antennas, such as the illustrated exemplary circular configuration of antennas, is attached to a Smart Device. The Node attached to the Smart Device may communicate information from and to the Smart Device including calculated results received from or about another Node, such as a Node fixed as a Reference Point Transceiver or a Node with dynamic locations, wherein the wireless communications are conducive to generation of data useful for determination of a position (e.g., timing data, angles of departure and/or arrival, amplitude, strength, phase change, etc.). A combination of angles from multiple fixed reference points to the antenna array can allow for a location of a user in space. However, with even a single wireless source able to communicate with the antenna array, it may be possible to determine a direction of interest or a device related field of view.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0163">An array of antennas positioned at a reference point may allow for the accurate receipt of orientation information from a transmitter.

In some embodiments therefore, multiple modalities of wireless input may be used to determine a position of a Smart Device and direction of interest.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0169">For example, a first wireless modality may be used to determine a structure in which a Smart Device is located. Accordingly, the first modality may include a cellular transmission or GPS signals. A second modality of wireless communication may be used to determine a position within the structure. Appropriate second modalities may therefore include, one or more of UWB, Bluetooth, sonic, ultrasonic, LiDAR, or infrared modalities (or other modalities discussed herein). A third modality, such as a magnetic force, a movement of a device, a relative position of two or more antennas may be used to determine a direction of interest.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0170">In some embodiments, the magnetic force detection device may be used to quantify a direction of interest to a user. Embodiments may include an electronic and/or magnetic sensor to indicate a direction of interest when a Smart Device and/or Smart Receptacle is aligned in a direction of interest. Alignment may include, for example, pointing a specified side of a Smart Device and/or Smart Receptacle, or pointing an arrow or other symbol displayed upon a user interface on the Smart Device towards a direction of interest.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0171">A magnetic force detection device (sometimes referred to as a magnetic sensor) may detect a magnetic field particular to a setting that a Smart Device is located. For example, in some embodiments, a particular structure or other setting may have a magnetic force that is primarily subject to the earth's magnetic field or may be primarily subject to electromagnetic forces from equipment, power lines, or some other magnetic influence or disturbance. An initial quantification of a magnetic influence at a first instance in time may be completed and may be compared to a subsequent quantification of magnetic influence at a later instance in time. In this manner an initial direction of interest indicated by a position, orientation, pitch, and yaw of a Node, such as a Smart Device may be compared to a subsequent position, orientation, pitch, and yaw of the Smart Device.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0172">In some embodiments, an initial position, pitch, and yaw of a Smart Device may be described as a relative angle to a presiding magnetic force. Examples of presiding magnetic forces include, magnetic influences of electrical charges. Earth's magnetic field, magnetized materials, permanent magnetic material, strong magnetic fields, ferromagnetism, ferrimagnetism, antiferromagnetism, paramagnetism, and diamagnetism, or electric fields that are generated at reference nodes at known positions which may be locally used to indicate a direction of interest.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0173">Smart devices may include electronic magnetic sensors as part of their device infrastructure. The magnetic sensors may typically include sensing elements deployed along three axis. In some examples, the magnetic sensors may be supplemented with electronic accelerometers, such as MEMS accelerometers.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0174">In some examples the magnetic sensor may include a Hall effect sensor that is operative to measure a sensed magnetic field perpendicular to the body of the sensor via operation of the Hall effect sensor. In some examples, a Hall effect sensor may be built into silicon to generate a relatively sensitive sensing capability for magnetic fields. In some Hall effect sensors, electrons and holes flowing in a region of the silicon may interact with the regional magnetic field and build up on the fringes of the conduction region, thus generating a measurable voltage potential. In other examples, anisotropic magnetoresistance sensors may sensitively detect the magnetic field at the device as a significant change in resistance of structure elements in the device.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0175">In still further examples, the magnetic sensor may include one or more giant magnetoresistance (GMR) sensors may detect the magnetic field. In some of these examples, the GMR sensors may detect a magnetic field with a current-perpendicular-to-plane (CPP) GMR configuration. In other examples, a current-in-plane (CIP) GM R sensor configuration may be used. The resulting three-axis magnetic sensors may perform a sensitive compass function to determine a direction of a specified portion of the Smart Device and/or an edge of the smart device relative to the local magnetic field environment.

For example, a device with a controller and an accelerometer, such as a mobile Smart Device, may include a user display that allows a direction to be indicated by movement of the device from a determined location acting as a base position towards a feature in the intended direction where the movement results in an extended position. In some implementations, the Smart Device may first determine a first position based upon triangulation with the reference points and a second position (extended position) also based upon triangulation with the reference points.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0177">As described above, facing a mobile device towards an area in a Structure may be used to ascertain a specific area in space to be interpreted by various methods to contain a Virtual Tag that may be accessed by an Agent.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0178">An Agent <b>550</b> may also operate a stereoscopic sensor system to orient a direction of interest. The stereoscopic sensor systems may obtain two different images from different viewpoints which may be used to create topographical shape profiles algorithmically. A controller may obtain the image and topographic data and algorithmically compare them to previously stored images and topographic data in the general environment of the user. The resulting comparison of the imagery and topography may determine an orientation in space of the Agent and in some examples determine a device field of view.

The position may be determined relative to a Base Node, such as Reference Point Transceiver <b>908</b>A. The Base Nod may operate as an origin in a coordinate system associated with Structure <b>906</b> and its surroundings. A position-determination process may be aided with reference to transmitter <b>907</b>, which in some embodiments, may be a Reference Point Transceiver. In this example, transmitter <b>907</b> is positioned proximate to the Structure <b>906</b>.</p><p id="p-0295" num="0311">A receiver on Smart Device <b>901</b> may be operative to receive a wireless logical communication from transmitter <b>907</b>. This communication may be in one of a variety of modalities, such as Bluetooth, ultra-wideband (UWB), radiofrequency, infrared, ultrasound, etc. Based upon the signal. Smart Device <b>901</b> may transmit a database query based upon a determined set of coordinates of transmitter <b>907</b>, a set of coordinates of the Smart Device <b>901</b>, the RTA <b>905</b>, or other position and direction relevant variable.</p><p id="p-0296" num="0312">If the database contains an entry comprising a set of coordinates (as a data structure) and the set of coordinates define a point within displayable distance to the set of coordinates of transmitter <b>907</b>, then the user interface <b>902</b> may display an interface that includes an interactive area <b>904</b> that manifests a Virtual Tag (such as an icon or other definable area) in context to a virtual structure <b>906</b>A representative of the physical structure <b>906</b>. In this way, a user of Smart Device <b>901</b> may be alerted to the presence of information associated with structure <b>906</b> in which the user may be interested.</p><p id="p-0297" num="0313">In some embodiments, inclusion of an interactive area <b>904</b> on the user interface <b>902</b> may be contingent upon an Agent operating the Smart Device <b>901</b> presenting appropriate credentials and/or permissions to access digital content made accessible via the interactive area. Still further appropriate credentials and/or permission may be required to ascertain that an interactive area exists. For example, an image displayed on a user interface may include imagery descriptive of item of equipment or a person. A user with proper credentials may be presented with a user interface that includes an interactive area <b>904</b> that manifests a Virtual Tag, such as an icon or outline of imagery descriptive of an item of equipment or a person; while a user who has not presented proper credentials may not be made aware of the existence of such an interactive area, nor the content included in the Virtual Tag associated with the interactive area <b>904</b>.</p><p id="p-0298" num="0314">In another aspect, in some embodiments, an interactive area <b>904</b> may only display if Smart Device <b>901</b> is in active communication with a specified Wi-Fi network, or if the Smart Device <b>901</b> his in communication with at least one of a specified Node or Nodes. Communication with a Node may include, for example, wireless communication via a wireless modality, such as, one or more of: UWB; Bluetooth, infrared, sonic, or other modality discussed In other embodiments, interactive area <b>904</b> may display on any user interface <b>902</b> (if the RTA <b>905</b> includes transmitter <b>907</b>), but further functionality may be based upon successfully responding to a security challenge. A security challenge may include, for example, a biometric measurement, inputting a password, correctly input an answer to a question, a gesture made with the Smart Device, a gesture made in communication with a sensor integrated within or with a Smart Device (such as, for example, motion of hand(s) in front of a camera, or motion of a hand wearing a Smart Ring or a wrist wearing a Smart Wristband).</p><p id="p-0299" num="0315">In some embodiments, the appearance of interactive area <b>904</b> may change based upon variables, such as, one or more of: the position of the Smart Device <b>901</b>; the identity of user or Agent: if the interactive area <b>904</b> is related to a query and/or query response; if the interactive area <b>904</b> is within an RTA <b>905</b> or based upon some other dynamic. For example, if the user has a certain UUID, and the database includes a message specifically intended for a user with that UUID, then the interactive area <b>904</b> or an icon may flash to indicate the presence of a message. This message may be displayed textually, visually, audibly, or by a hologram. Similarly, the database may record one or more instances in which the Smart Device <b>901</b> is accessed via a query from a Smart Device. Access via a query may be associated with a time stamp. If data related to structure <b>906</b> has changed since a previous time stamp, then interactive area <b>904</b> may be presented in a highlighting color (such as, for example be presented in red or other color) to indicate that a change has been detected. In addition, digital content may be appended to any content already in the database, such as additional alphanumeric annotation, an audio file, an image file, a video file, or a story file.</p><p id="p-0300" num="0316">In some embodiments, in response to activation of an interactive area <b>904</b> (such as a click, screen touch, voice command, gesture, etc.), additional functionality may be provided via the Smart Device <b>901</b> or other item of equipment. For example, selecting interactive area <b>904</b> may display digital content related to Structure <b>906</b>. Alternatively, activating the interactive user device associated with interactive area <b>904</b> may generate a control panel, which may allow the user to control aspects relating to sensors or other electronics within structure <b>906</b>. For example, upon confirmation that Smart Device <b>901</b> has the appropriate permissions, selecting interactive area <b>904</b> (or other activation of the interactive area <b>904</b>) may allow the user to turn off the lights within structure <b>906</b>. Still other embodiments allow for activation of an interactive area <b>904</b> to be a prerequisite to operation of equipment located within the RTA <b>905</b> or other defined area.</p><p id="p-0301" num="0317">An interactive area <b>904</b>, may be incorporated into a user interface in almost any manner conducive to a user activating the interactive area <b>904</b>. For example, a user interface that recreates a visual of a physical area, such as, by way of non-limiting example: an image (or video) based upon a CCD sensor array; a two dimensional representation of a physical area (such as a floorplan, site plan or architectural drawing); and a three dimensional representation (such as a CAD model, AVM; or Augmented Reality model) may include interactive areas that include areas of the image data, integration of one or more of: an icon, an outlined image area, a highlighted image area, an image area with a changed appearance (e.g. change in hue or color), integration or overlay of an image (e.g. a logo, emoticon, or other device).</p><p id="p-0302" num="0318">The Smart Device <b>901</b> may also display other functional buttons on its user interface <b>902</b>. In some examples, one such function may be to show displays of the sensor in the context of the universal RTA <b>905</b> surrounding the user.

A user interface <b>902</b>, AVM and/or two dimensional representation of a structure or geospatial area may be produced that allows the digital content to be accessed based upon the associated coordinates. The retrieval of the digital content is persistent in the sense that it may be retrieved, and new digital content may be added for so long as an underlying infrastructure enabling determination of coordinates used to access and/or place digital content within a coordinate framework exists.</p><p id="p-0304" num="0320">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>, nonlimiting and exemplary apparatus and methods for presenting a user interface including an interactive area <b>904</b> is illustrated.

In some embodiments, a similar illustration as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>G</figref> may be included as an inset <b>923</b> of the user interface <b>920</b>. In addition, in some embodiments, a user interface <b>920</b> may include a representation of the interactive area <b>904</b> may be formed by flattening the surface of the illustrated sphere <b>925</b> into a flat depiction with surface regions flattened into a segment <b>921</b>.

A user interactive area <b>920</b> (which may be an icon, highlighted area, outline, portion of an image, or other defined area) may be located within the user interface representing the interactive area <b>904</b> and structure <b>906</b>A. The interactive area may also be included in the real time display of a representation of data generated by an energy-receiving Sensor <b>922</b>.

The user interface <b>937</b> may be displayed, for example, when a user selects an interactive area associated with a Tag <b>931</b>-<b>932</b>.</p><p id="p-0306" num="0322">The Tag <b>931</b>-<b>932</b> may be located at a physical location within or outside of the RTA <b>932</b> (is illustrated).

Amongst the various information such as text, imagery, video content and the like that may be displayed an identification of the Tag <b>934</b>, associated textual information and data <b>935</b> as well as functional buttons <b>936</b> may be displayed on the user interface and may be used by the user to activate additional function including new display layers, content integration and control function such as in a non-limiting sense a control to revert to a previous menu display.</p><p id="p-0307" num="0323">In some examples, a Smart Device may function as a Tag. The Tag functionality may include providing location-related information as broadcasted digital content. In providing such broadcasted digital content, the Smart Device tab may employ numerous forms of security protocols for the protection of the information and authorization of its use which may include sign-in password protocols, sharing of encryption keys and the like. In similar methods, a central server may provide content related to a Tag and may manage security protocols and the like where a Smart Device acting as a Tag may merely share an identification phrase that a user could use with applications running or connecting with the central server could use to be authorized for additional content. Location may be determined by the various means as described herein including wireless communication with position Nodes by GPS, Cellular, Wi-Fi, Ultrawideband, Bluetooth and the like. If the Smart Device is operating in a mesh Node, the mesh could communicate within Nodes relative and absolute location information which the Smart Device may share as its role as a Tag. In addition to location, other sensor data at the Smart Device such as temperature, vibration, sensor imagery, LiDAR scan imagery, sound sensing.</p><p id="p-0308" num="0324">In addition to real-world data, the Smart Device Tag may also provide virtual content associated with itself and its connected environment. The Smart Device may provide content stored within its memory devices and may provide dynamically calculated results of processing on content stored in its memory devices. The virtual content may also correspond to a user interface of the Smart Device Tag that may be used to initiate or authorize function of the Smart Device including real-world activities such a communication via internet protocol, text, phone, or video.</p><p id="p-0309" num="0325">In some embodiments, an energy-receiving Sensor may receive energy associated with a LiDAR transmission and/or other functionality involved in LiDAR scanning which can be used to interrogate the local environment for physical shapes. In a Smart Device Tag function, the Smart Device may stream its video and scanning data directly or through a server model. Some Smart Devices may be configured to operate as a smart security monitoring systems and may provide the video, topographic, audio, and other sensor streams as Tag related content. There may be numerous manners that a Smart Device could function as a Tag in an environment.</p><p id="p-0310" num="0326">A Smart Device with either a single- or multiple-sensor system may also have a LiDAR scanning capability or other three-dimensional scanning capability. The Smart Device may utilize a number of systems to reline and improve its accuracy in determining the location that it is at. In an example, a Smart Device may utilize a GPS or cellular system to get an approximate location of the device. In a next step, a user may initiate the Smart Device to take a series of image and scanning data acquisitions of its environment. For example, the user may move the phone by hand to different directions while maintaining their feet in a fixed location. The phone may use one of the orientation methods as have been discussed to determine its orientation as it is moved to different vantage points. The Smart Device may either process those images and compare against a database in its memory, or it may communicate the data to a server to do the comparison. With an approximate location, the orientation information, and the streams of video and/or topographic information, a calculation may be performed to match the image/topographic information to a more exact positional location. In alternative examples, the device may use the image and/or topographic information to determine the orientation of the device itself.</p><p id="p-0311" num="0327">In some examples, the Smart Device may act as a receiver of one or multiple types of wireless energy input. For example, the acquisition of data based upon a visual light spectrum (approximately 380 to 700 nm wavelength) may be modelled as spatially-characterized electromagnetic energy. Electromagnetic energy in the visible band may enter a focusing lens and be focused up an array of devices. The devices may be CMOS-active pixel sensors, CMOS back-illuminated sensors, or CCDs, as non-limiting examples, to receive the energy and convert it into spatially-arrayed pixel data.</p><p id="p-0312" num="0328">In some examples, the Smart Device may have an energy-receiving Sensor incorporated or attached which may quantify energy levels for frequencies outside the visible spectrum. Any optics employed in such sensors may be different from the previously discussed CMOS and CCD Sensors since some of those energy receiving devices may have filters or lenses that absorb wavelengths outside of the visible spectrum. Sensors with infrared capabilities may have specialized optics and may use different materials for the CMOS and CCD elements&#x2014;such as indium gallium arsenide-based sensors for wavelengths in the regime of 0.7-2.5 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0313" num="0329">Alternatively, entirely different sensing elements, such as bolometers, which sense temperature differences of the incoming radiation, may be employed for longer wavelengths in the regime of 7-14 &#x3bc;m and may include filters that remove other wavelengths. A display of an infrared Sensor, which senses incoming energy in the infrared band, may be rendered on a typical visual display, but the colors of such displays may have no direct physical meaning. Instead, a color scheme may be instituted to represent different infrared wavelengths with different visible colors. Alternatively, the colors may be used to represent different intensities of infrared energy received across bands of infrared wavelengths.</p><p id="p-0314" num="0330">In some examples, a Smart Device may both project and receive energy. For example, a Smart Device may scan the topography of its surroundings by use of LiDAR. In LiDAR, a laser may be used to emit energy into the environment. The energy may be emitted as pulses or continuous trains, and the light source may be scanned across the environment. Light emitted from the Smart Device may proceed into the environment until it is absorbed or reflected. When it is reflected and subsequently received at the Sensor, the transit time can be converted to distance measurements of the environment. Many different wavelengths of light may be used to scan an environment, but numerous factors may favor certain choices such as invisibility to human/animal eyes, safety, absorption by the airspace surrounding the user and the like. Atmospheric gases may absorb significant amounts of infrared transmissions at certain frequencies; therefore, for LiDAR to be effective in the infrared spectral region, certain bands of emitted frequencies may be favored. A standard LiDAR system may operate at a band from 900-1100 nm infrared wavelength or at a band centered at approximately 1550 nm. As discussed previously, select optic components and materials may be useful for these wavelengths and the detectors may have improved function based on materials such as &#x201c;black&#x201d; silicon, germanium, indium phosphide, gallium arsenide, and indium gallium arsenide as exemplary detector materials.</p><p id="p-0315" num="0331">In an example, a laser light source may be rastered across a dimension of forward looking positions of a Smart Device, which may be represented by a conic section or Radio Target Area in front of the Smart Device. As the light is raster across the surface it can address, it may be pulsed on or off. As the light travels out along a collimated path, it may interact with a surface and a portion of the intensity may be reflected backwards.</p><p id="p-0316" num="0332">A resulting reflected ray may come back to the Smart Device and be received by a Sensor in the device. Since the emitted light source may be orders of magnitude more intense than the surroundings, reflected light may dominate a background intensity and the signal detected may be compared with the time of the leading edge of the laser pulse. The repeated acquisition of the timing signals in the various directions can be used to form a point cloud that represents the distance to reflective features from the Smart Device.</p><p id="p-0317" num="0333">As mentioned previously sound may be reflected off of surfaces and the transit time may be used to characterize a distance between a focused ultrasonic transducer and a reflective surface. In similar manners, points or lines of focused sound emissions may be pulsed at the environment and a sensor or array of sensors may detect the reflected signals and feed the result to a controller which may calculate point cloud representation or other or topographic line representations of the measured surface topography. In some examples, ultrasonic focused and scanned soundwaves in the frequency range of hundreds of megahertz may result in small, focused sources whose reflections may be detected by magnetic or piezoelectric sound transducers as non-limiting examples.</p><p id="p-0318" num="0334">A Smart Device may have numerous different types of energy-collection devices which may characterize data values with spatial relevance. As mentioned before, infrared imaging may be performed on some Smart Devices, and a user may desire to view a spatial representation of the infrared imaging that represents the data as it may appear if the user's eyes could perceive the energy. In some examples, data values for the wireless energy sensing of infrared energy may be assigned color values and displayed in an image format. For examples, low levels of infrared energy, which may relate to colder temperatures in the imaged regions, may be assigned blue color values, and high levels of infrared energy, which may relate to warmer temperatures, may be assigned red color values. Other color assignments to data values may be used. A legend for the conversion of the color values to the data values may be provided.</p><p id="p-0319" num="0335">In some examples, the data descriptive of spatially descriptive energy levels quantified by an energy-receiving Sensor data may be portrayed in a user interface. In some user interfaces, representations based upon spatially representative energy levels of different wavelengths may be aggregated or otherwise combined in one or more related user interfaces. Such a combination may allow a user to understand the regional nature of various quantified energy.</p><p id="p-0320" num="0336">In some examples, a user interface may allow for display of the positional location image points. In some examples, a location of a pixel element chosen by a user may be converted to a real-world location within the RTA which may be represented in Cartesian coordinates (X, Y, Z) or in other coordinate systems such as polar coordinate systems involving angles and distances as discussed previously. In some examples, topographic data obtained by scanning an area with an RTA may be used quantify topography within the RTA. A user interface based upon such quantified energy levels may include virtual presentations of the quantified energy levels from different perspectives and may allow for coordinate grids (Cartesian or other) to coordinate placement of facets of a user interface based upon combinations of energy level data, Tag locations and perspective relevance.</p><p id="p-0321" num="0337">In some examples, distinct structures within the RTA may be highlighted and assigned positional coordinates. In some examples, this may occur by image processing directly, in other examples a user interface may allow for a user to pick items/regions of interest in an RTA presentation.</p><p id="p-0322" num="0338">In other examples, real and virtual Tags may exist within the RTA. A physical Tag may include a position Node, another Smart Device, or any device with communication capability that can communicate with either a position Node or with the Smart Device of the user directly. Such physical Tags may be located in numerous manners. In some examples, the physical Tag may have a direct determination of its location either because it is stationary and has been programmed with its location or because it has the capability of determining its own position with the various methods as have been described herein. In other examples, a physical Tag may be able to communicate with Nodes such as Reference Point Transceivers and a location may be determined based upon an exchange of data, such as timing values, in the wireless communications. A Node may also be functional to determine, store and communicate a location of other Tags. The Smart Device of the user may gain access to the locations of Tags, either because they are publicly available or because the user has established rights digitally to obtain the information from some or all of these physical Tags.</p><p id="p-0323" num="0339">There may also be virtual Tags that are associated with positional coordinates. The distinction of these Tags over physical Tags is that there may be no physical presence to the virtual Tag. It may be a digital or virtual-world entity that has an association with a real-world positional coordinate. Except for this distinction, a virtual Tag and a real-world Tag may behave similarly with respect to their association with a physical coordinate.</p><p id="p-0324" num="0340">In these examples, an interactive user interface based upon energy levels and Tags located with an RTA may have icons associated with the placement of Tags. The user interface may include an icon positional designation and a graphic to indicate the presence of a Tag. It may be apparent that, in some cases, multiple Tags may lay along a single direction from a given Smart Device location and RTA, and thus multiple icons may be included within a user interface in close proximity. The user interface may indicate multiple Tag icons by color changes, blinking or other indicators. As an RTA is changed, Tags along a same perspective may resolve into different directions for Tags with different positional coordinates.</p><p id="p-0325" num="0341">The Tag icon may indicate to the user a digital functionality associated with a real-world or virtual Tag. For example, the icon may allow a user to choose the functionality of the icon by moving a cursor over the icon and making a keystroke or mouse click or for touch screens by pressing the display location of the Tag icon. The choosing of the Tag icon may activate user interface dialogs to allow the user to control subsequent functionality. In cases of superimposed Tag icons on a same pixel location in a user display, a first functionality may allow the user to choose one of the multiple Tag icons to interact with. In some examples, a Tag icon may be displayed with an associated ID/name and a user may select the icon with voice commands rather than physically selecting the icon as described previously. Displays of these Tags may follow similar protocols as have been discussed in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>C</figref>.</p><p id="p-0326" num="0342">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref>, a method for generating an augmented-reality Radio Target Area for a Smart Device is shown. At step <b>1001</b>, wireless energy of a first wavelength is received into a wireless receiver. In exemplary embodiments, this step may include receiving image data based on visible light into a sensor of the Smart Device. The wireless energy may be dispersed over a one-, two-, or three-dimensional space in a defined physical area, and may be received into a one-, two-, or three-dimensional array in the receiver. The wireless energy may take the form of electromagnetic radiation, such as light in the human-visible light spectrum (generally having a wavelength between 380 nm-740 nm), ultraviolet light (generally having a wavelength between 10.0 nm-400 nm), or infrared light (generally having a wavelength between 740 nm-2.00 mm) as examples. The set of wireless energy available to the wireless receiver is the Smart Device's Radio Target Area.</p><p id="p-0327" num="0343">The wireless receiver may be a Smart Device sensor, including a CMOS active pixel sensor, a CMOS back illuminated sensors, CCD, or a LIDAR apparatus, including a solid-state/MEMS-based LIDAR. The wireless receiver may comprise an array or other plurality of other wireless receivers. The wireless receiver may be operative to receive the wireless energy into an array of an appropriate dimension for subsequent display (possibly after processing) on the Smart Device. For example, where the wireless receiver is a Sensor, the Sensor may be operative to translate the wireless energy into a two-dimensional array.</p><p id="p-0328" num="0344">At step <b>1002</b>, a pattern of digital values is generated based upon receipt of wireless energy into the wireless receiver. This pattern of digital values may be based on one or more qualities of the received wireless energy, including its intensity, spatial dispersion, wavelength, or angle of arrival. The pattern may be placed into an appropriate array. For example, if the display of the Smart Device is a two-dimensional display, then the pattern of digital values may comprise a two-dimensional representation of the image data received. In some embodiments, the pattern of digital values may be based on an aggregated set of values from an array of receivers. For example, if the basis of the digital values is the intensity of the wireless energy received into the receiver, then the digital value assigned to a given entry in the array may be based on a weighted average of intensity of wireless energy received at a plurality of the receivers in the array. Optionally, at step <b>1003</b>, the wireless receiver may receive the wireless energy as an analog signal (for example, if the wireless receiver is a black-and-white sensor or an unfiltered CCD), and convert the analog signal to digital values through filtration or other analog-to-digital conversion. The set of digital values within the Radio Target Area is the Digital Radio Target Area.</p><p id="p-0329" num="0345">With the Smart Device wireless receiver's Radio Target Area determined, the Smart Device's position should be determined as well, along with the positions of any items of interest in a given space. Collectively, the Smart Device and the item of interest may comprise wireless Nodes. Accordingly, at step <b>1004</b>, coordinates representative of a wireless Node may be determined relative to a base Node. These coordinates may be determined in any appropriate coordinate system (such as Cartesian, polar, spherical polar, or cylindrical polar) and may be determined via RTLS or the orienteering-triangulation methods with various wavelengths or modalities, such as ultra-wideband, Bluetooth, etc. Additionally, the coordinates may be determined using an angle of arrival or angle of departure of a signal to or from the base Node, along with the distance from the base Node. By way of non-limiting example, this could produce a dataset that correlates the coordinates of three elements with the identities of those elements: {(0,0,0). BaseNode: (1,1,1), SmartDevice; (2,2,2), ItemOfinterest}. While this example may be used throughout the following discussion, it is understood to be non-limiting, as a given space may include a plurality of items of interest. Note that, in some embodiments, the Smart Device itself may become a dynamic database entry with a continuously (or periodically) updating set of coordinates. This may be useful in allowing a plurality of Smart Devices engaged with the system at the same time to interact with one another.</p><p id="p-0330" num="0346">At step <b>1005</b>, the position of the Base Node is determined relative to the defined physical area. In exemplary embodiments, this may include establishing the Base Node as an origin in the coordinate system and determining vectors from the Base Node to boundaries and items of interest (i.e., the distance from the Base Node and the direction from the Base Node to the boundaries and items of interest). In some examples, the Base Node may have an established reference relative to a global coordinate system established.</p><p id="p-0331" num="0347">At step <b>1006</b>, a Target Area is generated within a controller of the Smart Device. The Target Area may be the set of coordinates (relative to the Base Node) within the Radio Target Area of the wireless receiver. The Target Area may be limited by physical boundaries of the given space, such as walls, floors, ceilings, occlusions, etc. The Target Area may also be limited by distances that various types of signals may travel. For example, a sensor of audio signals may not be able to practically pickup signals over a background noise level that originate more than 1000 feet from a user position, purely as an example. In such a case, the Target Area for such signal types may be limited to that dimension.</p><p id="p-0332" num="0348">At step <b>1007</b>, respective positions of one or more wireless Nodes within the Target Area are determined. These positions may be determined relative to the physical Target Area or the Radio Target Area. The determination may be made with reference to the dataset discussed at step <b>1005</b>, or it may be made dynamically based upon one or more Base Nodes and/or the Radio Target Area. Moreover, the determination may additionally be based on receipt of a wireless signal into the Smart Device from the wireless Node. This signal may indicate a position using the orienteering methods described herein.</p><p id="p-0333" num="0349">At step <b>1008</b>, a user interface may be generated on the Smart Device based upon the pattern of digital values generated at step <b>1002</b>. The user interface may comprise a plurality of pixels, wherein each pixel comprises a visible color based upon the pattern of digital values generated at step <b>1002</b>. For example, if the digital values were based upon receipt of visible light into the wireless receiver (e.g., a sensor), then the display may reflect a reasonably accurate color photograph of the Radio Target Area of the wireless receiver. If the digital values were based upon an intensity of received light from, for example, LIDAR, then the display may reflect a scan of the Radio Target Area. In some embodiments, the pixel may include an intensity of energy received into the receiver. In this way, aspects of the Radio Target Area characterized by an intensity of energy may be emphasized. For example, this may produce a LIDAR relief of an area or a heatmap of an area.</p><p id="p-0334" num="0350">At step <b>1009</b>, an icon may be generated in the user interface. Preferably the icon will be placed at a position relative to data quantifying received energy levels. In some embodiments, the icon location in a user interface will be indicative of a position of a Tag (Virtual or Physical) and/or zone information. This position may be quantified via positional coordinates, such as Cartesian Coordinates, Polar Coordinates, Spherical Coordinates, direction, and distance from a known point <b>1401</b> and the like. The icon may be based upon an input from a user, stored data, quantified environmental conditions or other criteria related to an aspect of the Radio Target Area.</p><p id="p-0335" num="0351">For example, an icon may indicate information about an Item of Interest located at a given set of coordinates within the Radio Target Area or Digital Radio Target Area. In another embodiment, the user may indicate on the display a position in which the user wishes to place an icon and add information about an hem of Interest (thus creating a new entry in the database, which may be populated with the coordinates of the indicated position). Moreover, the icon may change colors based upon the pattern of digital values. The icon may be overlaid on top of the display. The icon may resemble the letter &#x201c;i&#x201d;, a question mark, a thumbnail, or any other suitable image from a library. In some embodiments, the icon may change depending on one or more attributes of its corresponding database entry. For example, if the icon located at (4,4,4) relates to a restaurant menu, then the icon may resemble the letter &#x201c;i&#x201d; or a thumbnail of a menu. On the other hand, if this database entry is modified so that the corresponding database entry is a message, then the icon may update to a picture of an envelope.</p><p id="p-0336" num="0352">In some embodiments, the icon-generation step may be based upon an inquiry to a database that uses the Digital Radio Target Area as an input. For example, upon generation of the Digital Radio Target Area, an associated set of coordinates in one or more dimensions may be generated. This may then be submitted to a database. An associated display may be as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>. In some embodiments, the icon-generation step may be based upon an inquiry to a database that uses the user's position coordinates as an input. In these embodiments, both the Digital Radio Target Area based on an RTA as well as the universal Radio Target Area may be included in an inquiry submitted to the database. An associated display may be as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref>. In some examples, the user may have an option to limit or filter the types of database entries that may be queried for, such as in a non-limiting sense, the existence of real-world Tags, virtual Tags, sensor data values and streams from a particular class of sensors and the like.</p><p id="p-0337" num="0353">Continuing with the example from step <b>1004</b>, the Digital Radio Target Area may comprise the set of coordinates: ([1.5,10], [1.5,10], [1,5,10]). In this example, the database may return information about the Item Of Interest, but not about the Base Node. The Digital Radio Target Area may update when the Smart Device position changes, or by user input, the Digital Radio Target Area may remain static after a certain instance in time.</p><p id="p-0338" num="0354">Continuing with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref>, at step <b>1010</b>, the icon may be positioned in the user interface at a given position based upon coordinates representative of the position of the wireless Node or Tag in the Target Area. This may comprise a selection of a multitude of pixels related to the position of the wireless Node or Tag and changing those pixels from the digital values determined at step <b>1002</b> (check ref #) to a second set of pixels to indicate the presence of an icon. In some embodiments, the icon may be dynamically updated based upon movement of the Smart Device (and, accordingly, the wireless receiver). In some embodiments, the icon may be permanently associated with a set of coordinates. In such embodiments, the icon may be generated whenever a Smart Device with appropriate permissions includes in its Radio Target Area the set of coordinates of Nodes or Tags associated with the icon.</p><p id="p-0339" num="0355">At step <b>1011</b>, user-interactive functionality may be associated with the pixels comprising the icon. This may allow the user to &#x201c;select&#x201d; the icon by means of an input device (e.g., mouse, touchpad, keyboard), touchscreen, digital input, etc. Upon selection, the icon may be operative to interact with the user in one or more ways, including: displaying a message intended for the user (by text, audio, video, hologram, etc.): requesting credentials from the user to verify permissions (e.g., a password), displaying information about an item associated with the icon, prompting the user to update information about an item associated with the icon, etc. The user-interactive functionality may display static information (e.g., dimensions of the item), display dynamic information (e.g., an alarm state or sensor information relating to the item; for example, if the item is a refrigerator, internal temperature may be displayed), or produce a control panel that allows the user to issue control commands (e.g., remotely operating an automated apparatus by resetting an alarm state, taking remedial action based upon a sensor state as described herein, etc.) or to issue menu control commands such as to invoke a different user interface or screen of a user interface.</p><p id="p-0340" num="0356">This may be useful in geospatial applications, or in procedurally generated activities. For example, a first user may generate a positional designation on a user interactive device, such as, for example an augmented-reality display to leave a narrative, icon or other input associated with the first use. Additionally, the same or another user may log positional coordinates and upload an image that could be displayed submitting a database query including those coordinates. Entry of the coordinates and essential credentials may provide access to the content associated with the positional coordinates.</p><p id="p-0341" num="0357">At step <b>1012</b>, the preceding steps may be integrated by generating a display comprising the user interface, the icon, and at least some of the associated user-interactive functionality. In embodiments, in which a plurality of Smart Devices are themselves part of the database, this may allow various users to send messages, images, etc. to each other.</p><p id="p-0342" num="0358">At step <b>10</b>B, detection of movement of the Smart device may cause a branch back to step <b>1005</b>. Based upon that movement of the Smart Device, a defined physical area from which wireless energy is received (i.e., the Radio Target Area based upon the Target Area) may be changed. The movement may be detected using input from wireless communications, magnetic field sensors, an accelerometer, feature-recognition software, or other similar apparatus and algorithms. In other examples, the position of the Smart Device may be dynamically obtained using any of the techniques of position determination, such as triangulation with reference nodes. Here, too, a change of position detected in this manner may cause a branch back to step <b>1005</b>. The Target Area may be based upon the position of the Base Node, the relative positions of the wireless Nodes, and the Smart Device.</p><p id="p-0343" num="0359">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, an exemplary database structure usable in conjunction with the present disclosure is shown. In this non-limiting example, the database has five sets of information: coordinates <b>1101</b> associated with an action, permissions <b>1102</b> associated with the action, the action type <b>1103</b>, attributes <b>1104</b> for the action, and notes <b>1105</b>. The example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> may suppose the following: the augmented-reality system is deployed in an enclosed space, definable by a coordinate system set relative to a Base Node having an origin point (0,0,0); the enclosed space spans, in that coordinate system, ([0, 10], [0, 10], [0, 10]) (using traditional set notation; in other words, each coordinate can take on any number between 0 and 10, inclusive); and the Radio Target Area is ([1, 10], [1, 10], [1, 10]).</p><p id="p-0344" num="0360">The bolded entries in the database shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> represent the database responses to the query given by the Radio Target Area of the Smart Device, i.e., all entries having a Coordinate value within the Radio Target Area. In some embodiments, the database may sort through all coordinates within the Radio Target Area and then return any entries for which the Smart Device has appropriate permissions. In other embodiments, the database may sort through all entries for which the Smart Device has appropriate permissions and then return any entries with coordinates within the Radio Target Area. The latter approach may be beneficial in circumstances in which there are numerous database entries with varying permissions: for example, if a database has 10,000,000 entries, but a given user might only have access to live of those entries, sorting by permissions first may be more beneficial.</p><p id="p-0345" num="0361">The ActionType variable may include any action for which interactivity with an icon may be desirable. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the ActionType variables shown are Information, Message, Action, and Directions. Each of these represents functionalities within the scope of this disclosure. For example, Information may relate to information that the Smart Device user may find helpful. Continuing with the shop example from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref> (check Fig Ref #), Information may include store hours, discounts, reviews, etc. Similarly, Message may be a message to the general public (e.g., an announcement), or a message tailored to a specific user. In the latter case, permissions may operate to ensure that only the specific user (or set of users) may access the Message.</p><p id="p-0346" num="0362">Action may relate to any action that a sensor, electronic device, or other apparatus connected to the database may take. For example, Action may include changing a temperature, measuring a temperature, turning off lights, activating an emergency sprinkler system, opening a door, etc. In some embodiments, prior to taking the Action, a password may be requested as part of the permission check.</p><p id="p-0347" num="0363">Directions may show a user how to navigate (using, in exemplary embodiments, orienteering methods) from the current position to a desired position. For example, upon scanning an entry on a map, virtual arrows may be generated to guide the user to a chosen store.</p><p id="p-0348" num="0364">The ActionAttributes may have attributes based on the ActionType. For example, if the ActionType is Information or Message, then the ActionAttributes may be a text string or a stored audiovisual file containing the message. Similarly, if the ActionType requires a sensor or other electronic device to take an Action, then the ActionAttributes may include a command or subroutine to affect such an Action. In the example shown here, the ActionType Directions comprises an ActionAttribute that includes a command to the Smart Device (i.e., show directions in the form of green arrows).</p><p id="p-0349" num="0365">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, an illustration of alternative methods for display of information relating to RTA is provided. At the beginning of the process, a system of components which may include a smart device with a user of the smart device may be established. Amongst the various components a Home Position may be established for all the components at step <b>1201</b>. The system may proceed by establishing and initiating transceiving of data and information at step <b>1202</b>.</p><p id="p-0350" num="0366">In some examples, the user may be prompted to choose a desired coordinate system for the display at step <b>1203</b>. In other examples, a user interface of the system may have a setpoint function which the user may invoke to gain access to user settable parameters which may include they type of coordinate system to use, such as for example Cartesian or spherical coordinates.</p><p id="p-0351" num="0367">In still further examples, the system may decide to default to a particular coordinate system depending on the nature of the type of data its positional reference devices may be obtaining or providing.</p><p id="p-0352" num="0368">At step <b>1204</b>, if the coordinate system was chosen as Cartesian coordinates, the system may utilize triangulation amongst multiple reference point transceivers. Alternatively, at step <b>1205</b> if the coordinate system was chosen as polar coordinates, the system may utilize positioning systems that utilize angles and distances involved in transceiving and location. In either event, at step <b>1206</b>, the position of a Sensor attached to the smart device of the user may be determined. In some examples, the system may have multiple and redundant location system. A combination of such position determinations may result in superior accuracy of an aggregated position result. Accordingly, at optional step <b>1207</b>, a wireless position determination may be performed with the smart device to establish a verification of the position of the Smart Device and the Sensor attached, Referring now to step <b>1208</b>, a direction that the sensor is facing in may be determined. Although there may be a number of different manners of determining orientation as have been described herein, in an example, the orientation may be determined based upon wireless transmission and/or wireless verification.</p><p id="p-0353" num="0369">Referring now to step <b>1209</b>, an energy-receiving Sensor included in the Smart Device or in logical communication with the Smart Device may be used to quantify energy levels perceivable at the position and in the direction of the Smart Device. The resulting quantification may depend on aspects of the Sensor device, but the resulting data will quantify a characteristic for the RTA.</p><p id="p-0354" num="0370">In some embodiments, an optional step <b>1210</b> may be performed by an element of the system such as the smart device or a server in communication with the Smart Device. The element of the system may compare one or more of position information, orientation information and the image data itself to calculate an estimate of whether the RTA angle has changed for the sensing element.</p><p id="p-0355" num="0371">In general, at step <b>1211</b>, the RTA of the Sensor device used to capture the image in step <b>1209</b> may be quantified. In an optional step <b>1212</b>, coordinates relating to the instant RTA of the image may be established. In some examples, this may relate to a range of three-dimensional coordinates that are addressed by the RTA of the Sensor element. In general, at step <b>1213</b>, the system may look up, or in some cases generate, location coordinates for Tags that are determined to be within the quantified RTA. In some database systems that the system may have access to, real-world or virtual-world tags may be tracked in a coordinate system with a certain origin.</p><p id="p-0356" num="0372">If the current origin established at step <b>1201</b> is offset from a particular database related origin, then one or both the coordinate system values may be converted to each other to align their respective origins. At step <b>1214</b> the Tags in an aligned coordinate system may have their positions compared to the current RTA and a selection for the set of Tags that are within the RTA may be made.</p><p id="p-0357" num="0373">In some alternative examples, a display of all Tags that are authorized for access to the user regardless of whether they are in the RTA may be made using associated aligned coordinates as discussed in reference to step <b>1213</b>.</p><p id="p-0358" num="0374">Referring now to step <b>1215</b>, in an example, the Smart Device of the user may be used to generate and display a user interface to the user based upon the captured image and the associated tag icons within the RTA. These associated Tag icons may have at least the functionality as has been discussed in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A and <b>10</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0359" num="0375">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, a Smart Device <b>1301</b> is illustrated within a wireless communication area (WCA) <b>1302</b>.

A resolution of laser scanning involved in generation of data based upon LIDAR techniques may influence a number of date points within a selected RTA, but in general, pattern recognition and determination of an orientation of a smart device based upon LIDAR data may be much more efficient, than, for example image data based pattern recognition. In addition, the LIDAR based patterns may be formed in a &#x201c;fingerprint&#x201d; of an RTA, wherein it would be very rare, if not impossible to replicate the LIDAR point patterns at two disparate locations.

In some or all of the steps may be performed and still be within the scope of the invention. By way of non-limiting example, an illustrative scenario of how an MMTS may be deployed includes:<ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0399">1) An MMTS may be included with a shipment of items being assembled in a warehouse to be delivered to a work site. The MMTS power will be turned on. A power on mechanism may include a wireless communication, such as, via Bluetooth, Zigby, UWB, magnetic interaction, cellular or another wireless modality, or a mechanical and/or electronic switch.</li>        <li id="ul0008-0002" num="0400">2) A MMT may include a primary communication modality, such as a modality enabling relatively more accurate location services than a secondary modality. Examples of a primary modality may include: UWB, Bluetooth, Zigby, ANT, ultrasonic and other relatively shorter range bandwidth, and communication protocols. A secondary modality may include GAS, cell tower triangulation, subGHz and other relatively longer range bandwidths and communication protocols.</li>        <li id="ul0008-0003" num="0401">3) Power management for an MMT may follow a life cycle of an item being tracked. For example, an item of equipment to be included in a structure being constructed (or upgraded or maintained) at a worksite may have an onboard power supply, such as a battery that is powered on as the item is included in a bill of material (sometimes referred to as a &#x201c;BOM&#x201d;). The battery will power wireless communication receivers, transceivers, and transmitters prior to installation of the items at the worksite. In some embodiments, the battery may also provide power to sensors used to quantify conditions encountered by the item of equipment during shipment and storage before installation at the worksite. Upon installation of the item of equipment, the MMT may be connected to a more permanent power source, such as inhouse AC or DC power, power over ethernet, or other hardwired power connection.</li>        <li id="ul0008-0004" num="0402">4) The MMT may seek to communicate via a primary communication modality and for so long as the primary modality is operational and functioning, a secondary (or tertiary) form of wireless communication may remain powered off. This is in part based upon the secondary modality will be redundant and may not provide as accurate location determination.</li>        <li id="ul0008-0005" num="0403">5) As a primary communication modality fails, such as when an item is shipped out of a warehouse and beyond the range of a warehouse based UWB wireless communication, a secondary communication modality, such as GPS, may be engaged, including the provision of power. A GPS receiver may be provided with power to receive GPS signals from multiple satellites. So long as GPS communications are received, the GPS receiver may be provided with power on a constant or periodic basis. However, if an obstruction, such as an interior of a warehouse location blocks GPS reception, power to the GPS receiver may be discontinued until an &#x201c;event&#x201d; causes the power to be restored. An event may include, for example, one or more of: an onboard accelerometer indicating movement of the MMTS: a cellular transceiver be involved in transceiving that indicated a change in position of the MMTS, such as a change in values for triangulation between cell towers and/or a transition of cell towers in communication, change in a time of travel from a cell tower or other change.</li>        <li id="ul0008-0006" num="0404">6) During storage, while en route, while located at a work site but not installed, and during an installed state, digital content may be associated with the MMTS and stored for tracking and historical purposes, as well as for AI analysis. In some embodiments, the digital content will additionally be associated with location coordinates of the MMTS at the time of association of the digital content or the generation of the digital content (such as, via a Virtual Tag and/or Hybrid Tag). In some embodiments, location coordinates and/or sensor data associated with other MMTSs within a specified distance of a primary MMTS (such as within wireless communication range, or within a distance indicative of an interior of a shipping box or other shipping container) may also be associated with the Primary MMTS and stored. In this manner, it may be determined whether a BOM is complete within a single shipping container or box or if other items are in additional boxes.</li>        <li id="ul0008-0007" num="0405">7) Upon occurrence of an event, such as arrival at a destination (e.g., within a geofence associated with a worksite) or a sensor reading that exceeds a threshold, a Virtual Tag and/or Hybrid Tag may be manually or automatically generated and associated with the MMTS thereby generating historical data of what an item associated with the MMTS has experienced. By way of non-limiting example, upon opening of a shipping box, a user may take a picture of the contents of the box and an environment in which the box was opened, and the pictures will become a part of a Virtual Tag that indicates that this box was opened at these RTLS coordinates, and this image captured the contents of the opened box. Sensor readings or other data, such as an audio message, a video or narrative may also be included in the Virtual Tau.</li>        <li id="ul0008-0008" num="0406">8) An icon may be generated for a Physical Tag, Virtual Tag and/or Hybrid Tag according to the teaching contained herein and related patent applications. In some embodiments, icons may indicate a communication modality referenced to determine the location coordinates associated with the icon. For example, an icon based upon coordinates generated by receipt of GPS communications may have a first visual appearance, and an icon based upon location coordinates generated via UWB communication may have a second visual appearance. In another aspect, selecting the icon may bring a use to an interface that lists one or more communication modalities involved in determining location coordinated associated with the icon. As such, a single communication modality or multiple communication modalities may be involved in generation of a set of location coordinates.</li>        <li id="ul0008-0009" num="0407">9) Power management may also reference the availability of a type of power source such that if the equipment is installed at the worksite and the MMTS is supplied with a hardwired power source, the MMTS may provide power to multiple communication modality modules and sensors and increase the frequency of communications and sensor readings.</li>        <li id="ul0008-0010" num="0408">10) Location coordinates of the MMTS may also be supplied to an A/R interface for generation of icons within the A/R interface.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0383" num="0409">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>A</figref> exemplary method steps may include the following.

At step <b>1727</b>, the system may query digital content included in area specified. The area specified may be within a given radius of the user's location.

The interactive areas <b>1801</b>-<b>1809</b> may be integrated into image data. Image data may be from a file, such as a two dimensional image of a site plan, floor design, or room layout, and/or energy levels received by a sensor in a smart device. For example, activation of an icon <b>1801</b> on a video conferencing screen may be integrated with image data of the video conferencing screen <b>1807</b> and allow a user to control functionality included in the video conferencing screen, such as, by way of example, powering on/off; connecting to a virtual meeting app: adjusting volume; adjust a display option: or other functionality.

Preferably determination of a location in three dimensional space is based upon wireless communication with transceivers <b>1901</b>-<b>1904</b> located at different locations. Triangulation may involve three or more reference pint transceivers <b>1901</b>-<b>1904</b>, however, as described herein, a single reference point transceiver <b>1901</b>-<b>1904</b> may be used in conjunction with an IMU or other position calculation apparatus to accurately calculate a position <b>1905</b>A of an Agent supported transceiver <b>1905</b>.</p><p id="p-0399" num="0425">Triangulation will involve communication between a three or more, it is possible to obtain improvements in operations by use of additional transceivers. For illustration purposes, four transceivers are included in the illustration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>. A first reference point transceiver <b>1901</b> is illustrated as a &#x201c;base position&#x201d; with exemplary cartesian position coordinates of 0, 0, 3000. In an example, the home position of 0, 0 may be a relative position along a floor of a structure and as the transceiver may be located upon a ceiling of a structure, the height of 3000 mm may represent a 3 meter elevation of the first transceiver <b>1901</b>. Other transceivers may also be located on a ceiling such as the second reference point transceiver <b>1902</b> at position 5000, 0, 3000. The third reference point transceiver <b>1903</b> may be located at position 5000, 15000, 3000 in an example. And a fourth reference point transceiver <b>1904</b> may be located at position 0, 15000, 3000. An Agent supported tag <b>1905</b> may be located at a first position location <b>1905</b>A.</p><p id="p-0400" num="0426">In some embodiments, the radio position tag <b>1905</b> may be associated with a particular Agent. The transceiver <b>1901</b>-<b>1904</b> are positioned in an area <b>2900</b> that may be authorized for access to specified digital content being protected. As illustrated, if an authorized area position <b>1900</b> is designated as being with a rectangular area formed by reference point transceiver <b>1901</b>-<b>1904</b>, then an Agent supported tag <b>1905</b> will be in a position authorized to have access to the specified digital content being protected; and a request from an Agent that is at a position that is not within the authorized area <b>1900</b> will be denied if the request is to access digital content being protected.</p><p id="p-0401" num="0427">There may be numerous techniques that the system of transceivers and a radio position tag may be used with to determine positions by triangulation. In some examples, a distance from a transceiver to the radio tag may be determined by the measurement of the strength of the signal which is related to the distance the signal has travelled. In other examples, timing signals may be used to determine the precise time it takes for a signal to transit the distance. In still further examples, the angles of arrival of signals from or to the transponder may be used in combination to determine a location, Thus, the first position location <b>1905</b> may be determined by making at least three determinations of distance or angles between a radio position tag at first position location <b>1905</b> and the four transceivers (<b>1901</b>-<b>1904</b>).</p><p id="p-0402" num="0428">In some embodiments, four of the determinations may be made and can be used to calculate a position. In various real world environments, there may be a number of factors that lead to difficulties in obtaining a position or angle measurement with precision. In a first example, the positioning system may be installed in an interior location with walls, equipment, occupants, and other elements formed of materials that may interact with the radio signals (or other position signals such as infrared, laser, and ultrasonic signals as non-limiting examples. Scattered signals from walls may cause multiple signal paths which may cause confused signal determination. Depending on the location of the first position within the space of interest, one or more of the signal paths from the transceivers to the first position tag may experience signal degradation from one of the causes.</p><p id="p-0403" num="0429">The positioning system may utilize all four of the signals to determine that one of the three signals could be omitted to improve the &#x201c;goodness&#x201d; of a position determination. Both the instantaneous signal path determination as well as the time progression of a signal path determination may factor into the rejection of a particular signal path measurement. Accuracy of position determination may be improved by sampling numerous times. In some examples, ultrawide band transmission protocols may be used to make position determination with relatively low energy consumption and good signal to noise aspects. Ultrawideband protocols may use extremely narrow (nanosecond) pulses which may allow for improved discrimination of multipath signal arrivals. Many different frequencies may be utilized for high degrees of sampling which can improve the accuracy.</p><p id="p-0404" num="0430">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, a second position location may include an agent with two tags located at locations <b>1906</b> and <b>1907</b>, The accuracy of determination of a second position may improve by the use of multiple tags at the different locations <b>1906</b> and <b>1907</b> whose aggregate position determination may be used to determine a second position location. As may be observed in the dashed lines and the complex dot dashed line there are individual signal paths from each of the four transceivers to the two tags. Here too the increased number of position signal paths allow for statistical improvement of an average location and also allow for the ability to statistically process signals to eliminate poor measurements or to average out poor measurements by acquiring collections of signals over time. In some examples, advantages may be obtained by establishing systems with larger numbers of transceivers.</p><p id="p-0405" num="0431">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>A</figref> an example <b>1900</b>A including an assembly of eight reference point transceivers <b>1901</b>A-<b>1907</b>A are operative to transceive in an area proximate to (within wireless communication distance to) a position tag <b>1910</b>A.

A base coordinate location may be defined as the base position of reference point transceiver <b>1901</b>A.

In the case of a WiFi transmission, a wireless signal may propagate outward as a wave, ideally according to an inverse square law. Ultimately, the crucial feature of the present invention relies on measuring relative distances at two points. In light of the speed of WiFi waves and real-time computations involved in orienteering, these computations need to be as computationally simple as possible. Thus, depending upon the specific application and means for taking the measurements, various coordinate systems may be desirable.

Sensor readings may be correlated with different types of wear, damage, failure, or proper operation of components included in a structure. The AVM may track location and may rank a likelihood of a component responsible for a particular vibration pattern detected by a sensor. The ranking may be based upon proximity, mediums available for communicating the vibration pattern (such as a beam traversing a significant portion of a structure, but which provides excellent mechanical communication for the vibration).</p><p id="p-0460" num="0486">Some embodiments also associate a sensor reading of vibration with a type of motion likely to cause such a reading. For example, some readings may include a linear component and a rotational component (such as operation of a washing machine during certain cycles). Patterns of normal and abnormal operation may be recorded and deciphered via programmable software on a controller.</p><p id="p-0461" num="0487">In another aspect, a pattern of sensor data that denotes spikes of linear data may be associated with a human being walking. Overtime, a controller may track sensor reading patterns and associate a particular pattern with the walk of a particular person.</p><p id="p-0462" num="0488">It is also within the scope of the invention to track and analyze a set of data associated with a primary signal and additional sets of data (secondary, tertiary etc.) tracking harmonics of the primary signal. The AVM may also track sets of data associated with simultaneous, and/or closely timed readings received from multiple sensors and associate an amplitude, sequence, delay, or other attribute of the data sets relative to each other to provide input as to a location of a source of the vibration. Additionally, vibration sensors may include axis within the sensor. For example, two axis and three axis sensors may have a direction of each axis included in the AVM and used in analysis of a vibration pattern.</p><p id="p-0463" num="0489">The present invention also provides simple and fast procedures for the provision of directions of a User or a sensor to a source of vibration based upon analysis of readings done or more sensors via the X. Y and Z location determination and directional ray or vector generation methods described herein.</p><p id="p-0464" num="0490">Disparate types of sensor may also provide disparate data types that are useful in combination to determine a source of sensor readings. For example, a vibration sensor reading indicating erratic motion may be combined with an increased temperature reading from a sensor proximate to an item of equipment. The combined sensor readings may assist in an analysis of a cause of the sensor readings.</p><p id="p-0465" num="0491">In still another aspect, one or more sensor readings may be correlated to a life expectancy of an item of equipment, such as for example a heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) unit. By way of non-limiting example, an ammeter sensor reading measuring an electrical draw of an HVAC unit may be quantified upon deployment of the unit. The initial readings may act as a baseline of a unit in excellent operational condition. A similar baseline reading may be taken via an accelerometer measuring a vibration generated by the HVAC unit. Still other sensor readings may include airflow, temperature, humidity, or other condition. Over time, a change in one or more senor reading values may indicate some wear and move the HVAC equipment item into a &#x201c;normal wear but operational&#x201d; status.</p><p id="p-0466" num="0492">Still further along a time continuum, one or more sensor readings may indicate a pending failure. For example, a current required to run the unit may be measured by the ammeter sensor and indicate an increased draw in electrical current. Likewise, airflow may decrease, and temperature may increase, and other sensors may provide additional evidence of a pending failure. Finally, a failed unit may generate a very high temperature reading and ammeter readings may increase to a level of sufficient electrical current draw to trip an electrical breaker, thereby indicating a failure.</p><p id="p-0467" num="0493">According to the present invention, any of the sensor readings (or all, or some subset of all sensor readings) may be referenced to generate an alert. Following the alert, remedial action may be taken.</p><p id="p-0468" num="0494">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b>A</figref>, a method for generating an augmented-reality Radio Target Area for a Smart Device is shown. At step <b>2401</b>, wireless energy of a first wavelength is received into a wireless receiver. In exemplary embodiments, this step may include receiving image data based on visible light into a sensor of the Smart Device. The wireless energy may be dispersed over a one-, two-, or three-dimensional space in a defined physical area, and may be received into a one-, two-, or three-dimensional array in the receiver. The wireless energy may take the form of electromagnetic radiation, such as light in the human-visible light spectrum (generally having a wavelength between 380 nm-740 nm), ultraviolet light (generally having a wavelength between 10.0 nm-400 nm), or infrared light (generally having a wavelength between 740 nm-2.00 mm) as examples. The set of wireless energy available to the wireless receiver is the Smart Device's Radio Target Area.</p><p id="p-0469" num="0495">The wireless receiver may be a Smart Device sensor, including a CMOS active pixel sensor, a CMOS back illuminated sensors, CCD, or a LIDAR apparatus, including a solid-state/MEMS-based LIDAR. The wireless receiver may comprise an array or other plurality of other wireless receivers. The wireless receiver may be operative to receive the wireless energy into an array of an appropriate dimension for subsequent display (possibly after processing) on the Smart Device. For example, where the wireless receiver is a Sensor, the Sensor may be operative to translate the wireless energy into a two-dimensional array.</p><p id="p-0470" num="0496">At step <b>2402</b>, a pattern of digital values is generated based upon receipt of wireless energy into the wireless receiver. This pattern of digital values may be based on one or more qualities of the received wireless energy, including its intensity, spatial dispersion, wavelength, or angle of arrival. The pattern may be placed into an appropriate array. For example, if the display of the Smart Device is a two-dimensional display, then the pattern of digital values may comprise a two-dimensional representation of the image data received. In some embodiments, the pattern of digital values may be based on an aggregated set of values from an array of receivers. For example, if the basis of the digital values is the intensity of the wireless energy received into the receiver, then the digital value assigned to a given entry in the array may be based on a weighted average of intensity of wireless energy received at a plurality of the receivers in the array. Optionally, at step <b>2403</b>, the wireless receiver may receive the wireless energy as an analog signal (for example, if the wireless receiver is a black-and-white sensor or an unfiltered CCD), and convert the analog signal to digital values through filtration or other analog-to-digital conversion. The set of digital values within the Radio Target Area is the Digital Radio Target Area.</p><p id="p-0471" num="0497">With the Smart Device wireless receiver's Radio Target Area determined, the Smart Device's position should be determined as well, along with the positions of any items of interest in a given space. Collectively, the Smart Device and the item of interest may comprise wireless Nodes. Accordingly, at step <b>2404</b>, coordinates representative of a wireless Node may be determined relative to a base Node. These coordinates may be determined in any appropriate coordinate system (such as Cartesian, polar, spherical polar, or cylindrical polar) and may be determined via RTLS or the orienteering-triangulation methods with various wavelengths or modalities, such as ultra-wideband, Bluetooth, etc. Additionally, the coordinates may be determined using an angle of arrival or angle of departure of a signal to or from the base Node, along with the distance from the base Node. By way of non-limiting example, this could produce a dataset that correlates the coordinates of three elements with the identities of those elements: {(0,0,0), BaseNode: (1,1,1), SmartDevice; (2,2,2), ItemOfInterest}. While this example may be used throughout the following discussion, it is understood to be non-limiting, as a given space may include a plurality of items of interest. Note that, in some embodiments, the Smart Device itself may become a dynamic database entry with a continuously (or periodically) updating set of coordinates. This may be useful in allowing a plurality of Smart Devices engaged with the system at the same time to interact with one another.</p><p id="p-0472" num="0498">At step <b>2405</b>, the position of the Base Node is determined relative to the defined physical area. In exemplary embodiments, this may include establishing the Base Node as an origin in the coordinate system and determining vectors from the Base Node to boundaries and items of interest (i.e., the distance from the Base Node and the direction from the Base Node to the boundaries and items of interest). In some examples, the Base Node may have an established reference relative to a global coordinate system established.</p><p id="p-0473" num="0499">At step <b>2406</b>, a Target Area is generated within a controller of the Smart Device. The Target Area may be the set of coordinates (relative to the Base Node) within the Radio Target Area of the wireless receiver. The Target Area may be limited by physical boundaries of the given space, such as walls, floors, ceilings, occlusions, etc. The Target Area may also be limited by distances that various types of signals may travel. For example, a sensor of audio signals may not be able to practically pickup signals over a background noise level that originate more than 1000 feet from a user position, purely as an example. In such a case, the Target Area for such signal types may be limited to that dimension.</p><p id="p-0474" num="0500">At step <b>2407</b>, respective positions of one or more wireless Nodes within the Target Area are determined. These positions may be determined relative to the physical Target Area or the Radio Target Area. The determination may be made with reference to the dataset discussed at step <b>2405</b>, or it may be made dynamically based upon one or more Base Nodes and/or the Radio Target Area. Moreover, the determination may additionally be based on receipt of a wireless signal into the Smart Device from the wireless Node. This signal may indicate a position using the orienteering methods described herein.</p><p id="p-0475" num="0501">At step <b>2408</b>, a user interface may be generated on the Smart Device based upon the pattern of digital values generated at step <b>2402</b>. The user interface may comprise a plurality of pixels, wherein each pixel comprises a visible color based upon the pattern of digital values generated at step <b>2402</b>. For example, if the digital values were based upon receipt of visible light into the wireless receiver (e.g., a sensor), then the display may reflect a reasonably accurate color photograph of the Radio Target Area of the wireless receiver. If the digital values were based upon an intensity of received light from, for example, LIDAR, then the display may reflect a scan of the Radio Target Area. In some embodiments, the pixel may include an intensity of energy received into the receiver. In this way, aspects of the Radio Target Area characterized by an intensity of energy may be emphasized. For example, this may produce a LIDAR relief of an area or a heatmap of an area.</p><p id="p-0476" num="0502">At step <b>2409</b>, an icon may be generated in the user interface. Preferably the icon will be placed at a position relative to data quantifying received energy levels. In some embodiments, the icon location in a user interface will be indicative of a position of a Tag (Virtual or Physical). This position may be quantified via positional coordinates, such as Cartesian Coordinates, Polar Coordinates, Spherical Coordinates, and the like. The icon may be based upon an input from a user, stored data, quantified environmental conditions or other criteria related to an aspect of the Radio Target Area.</p><p id="p-0477" num="0503">For example, an icon may indicate information about an item of Interest located at a given set of coordinates within the Radio Target Area or Digital Radio Target Area. In another embodiment, the user may indicate on the display a position in which the user wishes to place an icon and add information about an hem of Interest (thus creating a new entry in the database, which may be populated with the coordinates of the indicated position). Moreover, the icon may change colors based upon the pattern of digital values. The icon may be overlaid on top of the display. The icon may resemble the letter &#x201c;i&#x201d;, a question mark, a thumbnail, or any other suitable image from a library. In some embodiments, the icon may change depending on one or more attributes of its corresponding database entry. For example, if the icon located at (4,4,4) relates to a restaurant menu, then the icon may resemble the letter &#x201c;i&#x201d; or a thumbnail of a menu. On the other hand, if this database entry is modified so that the corresponding database entry is a message, then the icon may update to a picture of an envelope.</p><p id="p-0478" num="0504">In some embodiments, the icon-generation step may be based upon an inquiry to a database that uses the Digital Radio Target Area as an input. For example, upon generation of the Digital Radio Target Area, an associated set of coordinates in one or more dimensions may be generated. This may then be submitted to a database.</p><p id="p-0479" num="0505">In some embodiments, an icon-generation step may be based upon an inquiry to a database that uses the user's position coordinates as an input. In these embodiments, both the Digital Radio Target Area based on an RTA as well as the universal Radio Target Area may be included in an inquiry submitted to the database.</p><p id="p-0480" num="0506">In some examples, the user may have an option to limit or filter the types of database entries that may be queried for, such as in a non-limiting sense, the existence of real-world Tags, virtual Tags, sensor data values and streams from a particular class of sensors and the like.</p><p id="p-0481" num="0507">Continuing with the example from step <b>2404</b>, the Digital Radio Target Area may comprise the set of coordinates: ([1.5, 10], [1.5, 10], [1.5, 10]). In this example, the database may return information about the Item Of Interest, but not about the Base Node. The Digital Radio Target Area may update when the Smart Device position changes, or by user input, the Digital Radio Target Area may remain static after a certain instance in time.</p><p id="p-0482" num="0508">Continuing with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b>B</figref>, at step <b>2410</b>, the icon may be positioned in the user interface at a given position based upon coordinates representative of the position of the wireless Node or Tag in the Target Area. This may comprise a selection of a multitude of pixels related to the position of the wireless Node or Tag and changing those pixels from the digital values determined at step <b>2402</b> to a second set of pixels to indicate the presence of an icon. In some embodiments, the icon may be dynamically updated based upon movement of the Smart Device (and, accordingly, the wireless receiver), In some embodiments, the icon may be permanently associated with a set of coordinates. In such embodiments, the icon may be generated whenever a Smart Device with appropriate permissions includes in its Radio Target Area the set of coordinates of Nodes or Tags associated with the icon.</p><p id="p-0483" num="0509">At step <b>2411</b>, user-interactive functionality may be associated with the pixels comprising the icon. This may allow the user to &#x201c;select&#x201d; the icon by means of an input device (e.g., mouse, touchpad, keyboard), touchscreen, digital input, etc. Upon selection, the icon may be operative to interact with the user in one or more ways, including: displaying a message intended for the user (by text, audio, video, hologram, etc.); requesting credentials from the user to verify permissions (e.g., a password), displaying information about an item associated with the icon, prompting the user to update information about an item associated with the icon, etc. The user-interactive functionality may display static information (e.g., dimensions of the item), display dynamic information (e.g., an alarm state or sensor information relating to the item; for example, if the item is a refrigerator, internal temperature may be displayed), or produce a control panel that allows the user to issue control commands (e.g., remotely operating an automated apparatus by resetting an alarm state, taking remedial action based upon a sensor state as described herein, etc.) or to issue menu control commands such as to invoke a different user interface or screen of a user interface.</p><p id="p-0484" num="0510">This may be useful in geospatial applications, or in procedurally generated activities. For example, a first user may generate a positional designation on a user interactive device, such as, for example an augmented-reality display to leave a narrative, icon or other input associated with the first use. Additionally, the same or another user may log positional coordinates and upload an image that could be displayed submitting a database query including those coordinates. Entry of the coordinates and essential credentials may provide access to the content associated with the positional coordinates.</p><p id="p-0485" num="0511">At step <b>2412</b>, the preceding steps may be integrated by generating a display comprising the user interface, the icon, and at least some of the associated user-interactive functionality. In embodiments, in which a plurality of Smart Devices are themselves part of the database, this may allow various users to send messages, images, etc. to each other.</p><p id="p-0486" num="0512">At step <b>2413</b>, detection of movement of the Smart device may cause a branch back to step <b>2405</b>. Based upon that movement of the Smart Device, a defined physical area from which wireless energy is received (i.e., the Radio Target Area based upon the Target Area) may be changed. The movement may be detected using input from wireless communications, magnetic field sensors, an accelerometer, feature-recognition software, or other similar apparatus and algorithms. In other examples, the position of the Smart Device may be dynamically obtained using any of the techniques of position determination, such as triangulation with reference nodes. Here, too, a change of position detected in this manner may cause a branch back to step <b>2405</b>. The Target Area may be based upon the position of the Base Node, the relative positions of the wireless Nodes, and the Smart Device.</p><p id="p-0487" num="0513">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref>, an illustration of alternative methods for display of information relating to RTA is provided, At the beginning of the process, a system of components which may include a smart device with a user of the smart device may be established. Amongst the various components a Home Position may be established for all the components at step <b>2501</b>. The system may proceed by establishing and initiating transceiving of data and information at step <b>2502</b>.</p><p id="p-0488" num="0514">In some examples, the user may be prompted to choose a desired coordinate system for the display at step <b>2503</b>. In other examples, a user interface of the system may have a setpoint function which the user may invoke to gain access to user settable parameters which may include they type of coordinate system to use, such as for example Cartesian or spherical coordinates.</p><p id="p-0489" num="0515">In still further examples, the system may decide to default to a particular coordinate system depending on the nature of the type of data its positional reference devices may be obtaining or providing.</p><p id="p-0490" num="0516">At step <b>2504</b>, if the coordinate system was chosen as Cartesian coordinates, the system may utilize triangulation amongst multiple reference point transceivers. Alternatively, if the coordinate system was chosen as polar coordinates, at step <b>2505</b>, the system may be operative to execute software and reference positioning devices that utilize angles and distances involved in transceiving and location.</p><p id="p-0491" num="0517">In either case, at step <b>2506</b>, the position of a Sensor attached to the smart device of the user may be determined. In some examples, the system may have multiple and redundant location system. A combination of such position determinations may result in superior accuracy of an aggregated position result. Accordingly, at optional step <b>2507</b>, a wireless position determination may be performed with the smart device to establish a verification of the position of the Smart Device and the Sensor attached. Referring now to step <b>2508</b>, a direction that the sensor is facing in may be determined. Although there may be a number of different manners of determining orientation as have been described herein, in an example, the orientation may be determined based upon wireless transmission and/or wireless verification.</p><p id="p-0492" num="0518">Referring now to step <b>2509</b>, an energy-receiving Sensor included in the Smart Device or in logical communication with the Smart Device may be used to quantify energy levels perceivable at the position and in the direction of the Smart Device. The resulting quantification may depend on aspects of the Sensor device, but the resulting data will quantify a characteristic for the RTA.</p><p id="p-0493" num="0519">In some embodiments, an optional step <b>2510</b> may be performed by an element of the system such as the smart device or a server in communication with the Smart Device. The element of the system may compare one or more of position information, orientation information and the image data itself to calculate an estimate of whether the RTA angle has changed for the sensing element.</p><p id="p-0494" num="0520">In general, at step <b>2511</b>, the RTA of the Sensor device used to capture the image in step <b>1209</b> may be quantified. In an optional step <b>2512</b>, coordinates relating to the instant RTA of the image may be established. In some examples, this may relate to a range of three-dimensional coordinates that are addressed by the RTA of the Sensor element. In general, at step <b>2513</b>, the system may look up, or in some cases generate, location coordinates for Tags that are determined to be within the quantified RTA. In some database systems that the system may have access to, real-world or virtual-world tags may be tracked in a coordinate system with a certain origin.</p><p id="p-0495" num="0521">If the current origin established at step <b>2501</b> is offset from a particular database related origin, then one or both the coordinate system values may be converted to each other to align their respective origins. At step <b>2514</b>, the Tags in an aligned coordinate system may have their positions compared to the current RTA and a selection for the set of Tags that are within the RTA may be made.</p><p id="p-0496" num="0522">In some alternative examples, a display of all Tags that are authorized for access to the user regardless of whether they are in the RTA may be made using associated aligned coordinates as discussed in reference to step <b>2513</b>.</p><p id="p-0497" num="0523">Referring now to step <b>2515</b>, in an example, the Smart Device of the user may be used to generate and display a user interface to the user based upon the captured image and the associated tag icons within the RTA.

For example, a third factor may be based upon knowledge of a location of a Virtual Tag and/or Physical Tag storing the digital content; and a fourth factor may be based upon a physical location of a user or other Agent requesting access to the digital content. A potential fifth factor may include location coordinates of the user's smart device for a time period prior to the request for access to the protected digital content.

In various aspects of wireless communication, the Nodes may function to communicate a timing value via their electromagnetic or sonic transmissions or data other than timing signals, such as a digital value representing a condition quantified with an electronic sensor. Accordingly, wireless communications may provide data identifying information unique to the Node, data related to the synchronization of timing at different well located reference points and may also function as general data communication Nodes.</p><p id="p-0592" num="0618">A triangulation calculation and/or a distance and angle indicating a position of a Smart Device, or a Node may result from a system of multiple reference position Nodes communicating timing signals to or from the Smart Device or Node.

Triangulation or other mathematical techniques may also be employed in determining a location.</p><p id="p-0593" num="0619">A process is disclosed for determination of a position based upon wireless communication between a Node and/or Smart Device and with reference point transceivers. The process may be accomplished, for example via executable software interacting with the controller, such as, for example via running an app on the Smart Device or as a service on a server accessible via the Internet.</p><p id="p-0594" num="0620">In some embodiments, the location of a Node, may be determined via discernment of a physical artifact, such as, for example a visually discernable feature, shape, or printed aspect. A pattern on a surface may convey a reference point by a suitable shape such as a cross, Vernier or box structure as non-limiting examples. The printing may also include identification information, bar codes or lists of location coordinates directly. A Smart Device ascertaining a physical reference mark and a distance of the Smart Device to the mark may determine a relative location in space to a coordinate system of the marks. Reference points may be coded via identifiers, such as a UUID (Universally Unique Identifier), or other identification vehicle.</p><p id="p-0595" num="0621">Marks tied to a geospatial coordinate system may be utilized to determine a relative location. A number of methods may be executed to determine a distance from the Smart Device to a mark such as, for example, a sensed reflection of light beams (preferably laser beams), electromagnetic beams of wavelength outside of the visible band such as IR, UV, radio and the like, or sound-based emanations. It may be important that the means of determining the distance can be focused into a relatively small size. It may be important that the means of determining the distance is reflected by the physical mark. For example, a light-source apparatus used to determine a distance may benefit from a mirror surface upon the physical mark. In addition, a reflected signal may emerge significantly towards a user. It may be desirable that physical reference points are placed with high accuracy at specific reference locations, or it may be desirable to be able to measure with high accuracy specific reference locations after placement.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Glossary</heading><p id="p-0596" num="0622">&#x201c;Agent&#x201d; as used herein refers to a person or automation capable of supporting a Smart Device at a geospatial location relative to a Ground Plane.</p><p id="p-0597" num="0623">&#x201c;Area of digital content interaction&#x201d; as used herein refers to an area with multiple addition al sets of positional coordinates that may be used to access digital content with a first set of positional coordinates.</p><p id="p-0598" num="0624">&#x201c;Augmented Virtual Model&#x201d; (sometimes referred to herein as &#x201c;AVM&#x201d;): as used herein is a digital representation of a real property parcel including one or more three-dimensional representations of physical structures suitable for use and As Built data captured descriptive of the real property parcel.
