For example, the generated radiation pattern is stronger in some directions and weaker in other directions. Likewise, when receiving electromagnetic signals, the antenna has the same preferred direction. Signal quality (e.g., signal to noise ratio or SNR), whether in transmitting or receiving scenarios, can be improved by aligning the preferred direction of the antenna with a direction of the target or source of the signal. However, it is often impractical to physically reorient the antenna with respect to the target or source of the signal. Additionally, the exact location of the source/target may not be known. To overcome some of the above shortcomings of the antenna, a phased array antenna can be formed from a set of antenna elements to simulate a large directional antenna. An advantage of a phased array antenna is its ability to transmit and/or receive signals in a preferred direction (e.g., the antenna's beamforming ability) without physical repositioning or reorientating.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">It would be advantageous to configure phased array antennas having increased bandwidth while maintaining a high ratio of the main lobe power to the side lobe power. Likewise, it would be advantageous to configure phased array antennas and associated circuitry having reduced weight, reduced size, lower manufacturing cost, and/or lower power requirements. Accordingly, embodiments of the present disclosure are directed to these and other improvements in phase array antenna systems or portions thereof.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description.

The antenna aperture is the area through which power is received by or to the antenna elements <b>702</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">A phased array antenna synthesizes a specified electric field (phase and amplitude) across an aperture. Adding a phase shift to the signal received or transmitted by each antenna in an array of antennas allows the collective signal of these individual antennas to act as the signal of a single antenna.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In designing an antenna aperture for generating a single beam from a plurality of antenna elements, there are multiple considerations for efficiency in the system, including, but not limited to, total gain desired, beamwidth (e.g., how pointed the beam will be, a fan beam or a pencil beam, for example), and undesirable effects, such as side lobes.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Gain at broadside in a phased array is both a function of the individual element gain and the number of elements. The antenna aperture gain can be calculated by the following equation:</p><p id="p-0068" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>G</i><sub>A</sub>=4&#x3c0;(<i>A&#x3b7;/&#x3bb;</i><sup>2</sup>)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0069" num="0000">where A=aperture area; &#x3b7;=aperture efficiency; and &#x3bb;=wavelength.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0067">The number of elements required in an electronically-scanning phased array antenna can be estimated by the gain it must provide. Generally, more antenna elements yields more gain in a phased array antenna. For example, a 30 decibel (dB) gain array may include about 1000 antenna elements and a 20 dB gain array may include about 100 antenna elements. Uniform spacing between antenna elements (e.g., spacing or distance <b>910</b>) is typically more advantageous in terms of total gain than non-uniform spacing between antenna elements. However, gain is reduced when scanning at an angle proportional to the cosine of the angle. Therefore, when scanning at 60 degrees, the gain is reduced to &#xbd;.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0068">The total area of the antenna aperture affects beamwidth. Therefore, the larger the area of the antenna aperture, the narrower the beam produced from the antenna aperture.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0069">In an antenna aperture having an antenna lattice with a plurality of antenna elements, gaps between adjacent antenna elements can produce unwanted side lobes. Therefore, a threshold maximum spacing can be calculated between antenna elements to reduce unwanted side lobes. The individual antenna elements are spaced in the antenna aperture below the threshold maximum spacing to reduce side lobe leakage.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0070">In addition to unwanted side lobes, grating lobes can occur when steering too far with a phased array. The effect of grating lobes is also referred to as &#x201c;aliasing,&#x201d; resulting in the main beam reappearing on the wrong side. Therefore, antenna elements must also be spaced properly in order to avoid grating lobes. For uniformly spaced arrays with a constant spacing between elements, the maximum spacing can be half-wavelength to avoid grating lobes.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0071">The equation for maximum spacing is a function of wavelength of operation and maximum scan angle:</p><p id="p-0075" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>d</i><sub>max</sub>=&#x3bb;/(1+sin &#x3b8;)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0076" num="0000">where &#x3bb;=wavelength and &#x3b8;=scan angle.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0072">Thus for a 30 degree scan angle, d<sub>max </sub>is (&#x2154;)&#x3bb;, while for a 60 degree scan angle, d<sub>max </sub>is 0.54 &#x3bb;.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0073">Therefore, the desired antenna aperture requires a balancing of multiple trade-offs in the system. For example, the system has a power budget for a total number of antenna elements. Knowing the total number of antenna elements based on the power budget, the area of the antenna aperture should be maximized for optimal beamwidth, but the spacing between antenna elements should be minimized to reduce side lobes, grating lobes, and aliasing.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0074">The phased array antenna system including DBF chip <b>100</b> includes in total, a plurality of DBF chips similar to DBF chip <b>100</b>.
