Such an electrochemical cell module can have still higher durability.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Electrochemical Cell System</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">An electrochemical cell system according to an embodiment of the present disclosure includes the electrochemical cell module in the above embodiment, and a controller to control the electrochemical cell module. The controller may be a control integrated circuit (IC) incorporated in the electrochemical cell module to protect a battery from overcharge and over-discharge. The control IC may include a protection circuit as a program.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In response to the battery voltage exceeding a preset fully charged battery voltage, the protection circuit forcibly stops the flow of a charging current. In response to a battery voltage during discharge being less than a preset dischargeable voltage, the protection circuit forcibly stops discharging the current. Such sudden power shutdown due to the operation of the protection circuit can greatly affect facilities (power receivers) receiving power from the electrochemical cell module. To avoid such a situation, in response to the battery voltage decreasing to the dischargeable voltage, a user may receive warning information such as a message stating &#x201c;Low battery. Charge now.&#x201d; on a display, with a sound, or in any other manner. In response to the warning signal, the user stores data into, for example, a memory and then stops the facility.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The protection circuit implements a charging sequence including, for example, pre-charging, quick charging or constant-current charging, constant-voltage charging, and determining that the battery is fully charged in this order. In the pre-charging, a small amount of current flows in the battery first. In response to the battery reaching a constant voltage, charging with a constant current (constant-current charging) is performed. In this manner, constant-voltage constant-current (CVCC) control shifts the constant current to the constant voltage. In response to the battery voltage increasing substantially to a fully charged voltage, the protection circuit performs charging at a constant voltage. During the constant-voltage charging, the charging current naturally decreases as the internal voltage of the battery increases. In response to the current value decreasing to a constant current value, the protection circuit determines that the charging is complete and thus stops charging.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The present disclosure may be implemented in the following forms.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">An electrochemical cell according to one or more embodiments of the present disclosure includes a cell stack including a plurality of unit cells stacked on one another and each being a plate and including an electricity generator and a casing accommodating the electricity generator, and an outer case accommodating the cell stack.
