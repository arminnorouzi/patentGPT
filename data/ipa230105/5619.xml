Many people suffer from vision loss as a result of undiagnosed or untreated ophthalmic conditions.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In the United States alone, for example, an estimated 1.9 million people suffer from vision loss as a result of undiagnosed or untreated ophthalmic conditions. For the majority of these, an estimated 1.2 million people, the cause is cataract and vision may be recovered with the appropriate referral to an ophthalmic surgeon. However, for 700,000 Americans, this vision loss is due to undiagnosed or untreated age-related macular degeneration (AMD), glaucoma, or diabetic retinopathy, and vision loss will remain unrecoverable for the majority of these patients. The impact of poor eyesight is manifest in its potentiation of comorbidities, particularly in increasing the risk of disability in patients with cognitive impairment.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Improvements are needed.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The identification and referral of patients at-risk of vision loss from primary care practitioners (PCPs) to eye care professionals remains problematic. A 2010 study identified a number of barriers including a lack of access to ophthalmic screening within the setting of the PCP's office. Some regional efforts have been made to improve the efficiency of triage of patients at risk for glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy; however, existing initiatives triage patients on only a few demographic and co-morbidity parameters, whereas many systemic associations have been identified for AMD, cataract, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and OSD.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Artificial intelligence (AI) modeling techniques are becoming increasingly important in ophthalmology in particular and medicine in general. In ophthalmology, AI is employed to calculate intraocular lens (IOL) powers, predict glaucoma progression, recognize diabetic retinopathy, and classify ocular tumors. To our knowledge, AI has not yet been employed to triage primary care patients for ophthalmology referral. Herein, we report the development, validation, and testing of multiple predictive AI models for five sight-threatening ocular pathologies (i.e., AMD, cataract, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and OSD) that might be employed by PCPs to triage patients for referral to eyecare care professionals.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure relates to identification and referral of at-risk patients from primary care practitioners (PCPs) to eye care professionals.

The digital health tool comprises a user interface configured to receive patient data comprising non-ophthalmic data.

The method comprises selecting a model, using the model to analyze non-ophthalmic data to determine whether the patient likely has an ophthalmic pathology, and outputting that result to a user.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Although statistical techniques such as ANOVA can give insight into the relationships among a few clinical parameters, risk stratification and incorporation of multiple demographic, pharmacologic, and comorbidity attributes are well suited to AI modeling. AI is generally divided into two broad categories, though many more than these two exist. Machine learning (ML), including decision tree models, organize parameters (i.e., attributes or features) into strata to predict outcomes. ML is particularly useful for elucidating relationships among clinical parameters. Deep learning (DL) techniques consisting largely of neural networks, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and perceptrons often improve predictive performance over ML but do so at the cost of opacity and interpretability regarding how their predictions are made.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Multiple artificial intelligence (AI) strategies were built and compared to yield models that may be employed by PCPs to triage patients for referral to eyecare care professionals.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> shows a diagram of the method. Data based on one or more subjects may be collected, for example into a database <b>202</b>. This data may be examined to remove data which is unhelpful or sparse and to limit outliers at the pre-processing step <b>204</b>. Before identifying a particular model for training and testing, the pre-processed data may be divided into two groups: training data <b>206</b> and testing data <b>208</b> (also sometimes called the validation data). The first set of data, the training data <b>206</b>, may be used to train at least one, and possible several models <b>210</b>. After the models <b>210</b> have been trained using the training data <b>206</b>, they are then tested on the testing data <b>208</b>. They can output their analysis and the results may be compared at step <b>214</b> comparison of analyses. In another depicture, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref> shows how the training data <b>206</b> may be fed into the untrained models <b>216</b> to create the trained models <b>218</b>. The testing data <b>208</b> may be then fed into the trained models <b>218</b> to create the analyses <b>212</b> and the prediction or likelihood that the patient has an ophthalmic pathology.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref> shows an example of cross-validation, which may be a modified form of creating and adjusting the models. In this instance the pre-processed data <b>204</b> may be replicated, in this example it may be replicated five times <b>402</b>-<b>410</b>. In each instance of the data replication, the data may be further sub-divided or partitioned into a number of partitions. In this instance the partitions are labelled A, B, C, D, and E. For each replication of the data <b>402</b>, <b>404</b>, <b>406</b>, <b>408</b>, and <b>410</b>, the data may be further one partition <b>420</b> (shaded to distinguish) may be used as the training data <b>206</b> to train the untrained models <b>216</b> and create trained models <b>218</b>. The trained models <b>218</b> then use the remaining partitions to test the models. Thus each model may be trained at least once on each partition. This procedure helps to prevent over-fitting of the models to the data.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">A system of one or more computers can be configured to perform particular operations or actions by virtue of having software, firmware, hardware, or a combination of them installed on the system that in operation causes or cause the system to perform the actions. One or more computer programs can be configured to perform particular operations or actions by virtue of including instructions that, when executed by data processing apparatus, cause the apparatus to perform the actions. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref> illustrates a flow diagram of a computer-implemented method <b>2300</b> for identifying one or more patients at risk of having an undetected ophthalmic condition. The computer-implemented method includes receiving non-ophthalmic data, at <b>2302</b>. The non-ophthalmic data may be based on one or more subjects. As an example, the non-ophthalmic data may be historical patient data collected across a plurality of subjects. The non-ophthalmic data may be pre-processed to generate a culled dataset may include a subset of the non-ophthalmic data. At <b>2304</b>, the method may comprise training, based at least on a first portion of the culled dataset, a model. At <b>2306</b>, the method may comprise testing, based at least on a second portion of the culled dataset different from the first portion, the model. At <b>2308</b>, non-ophthalmic patient data may be received. The non-ophthalmic patient data may be based on a target patient. For example, the non-ophthalmic data used to train or test the model may be based on one or more subjects distinct from or excluding the target patient. As a further example, the model may be trained and tested on data not associated with the target patient. However other data may be used. At <b>2310</b>, the method may comprise analyzing, using the model, the non-ophthalmic patient data to determine the existence or non-existence of one or more ophthalmic conditions. At <b>2312</b>, the method may comprise outputting, based on the analyzing the non-ophthalmic patient data, an indication of the existence or non-existence of one or more ophthalmic conditions. Additional data may be used to update the model. For example, the model may be re-trained or re-tested on new data and the updated model may be used in the same or similar manner as described herein. Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding computer systems, apparatus, and computer programs recorded on one or more computer storage devices, each configured to perform the actions of the methods.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">AI techniques have in common the process of &#x201c;training,&#x201d; the adjustment of importance (i.e., weights) of attributes or intermediate values, based upon a set of data referred to as a training set. The model performance may be then assessed against another set of data called the test set. Similar model performance on training and test sets demonstrates model generalizability. The advent of large clinical databases has made possible the construction and training of both ML and neural network AI models. To this end, we employ a large commercial electronic health record (EHR) database that includes demographic, diagnostic, and therapeutic data to create and curate an ophthalmologically-focused dataset from which predictive models of multiple eye-diseases can be built. We chose to compare several different AI approaches to create models that might be employed by PCPs to triage patients for referral to an eyecare care professional. The models thus created use non-ophthalmic clinical and demographic data to assess relative risk scores for AMD, cataract, OSD, glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Abbreviations:</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">AI=artificial intelligence; AMD=age-related macular degeneration; AUC=area under the curve; BMI=body mass index; CNN=convolutional neural network; DL=Deep learning; EHR=electronic health record; EQUALITY=Eye Care Quality and Accessibility Improvement in the Community; GLM=Generalized Linear Model; ICD-10=International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision; IOL, intraocular lens; ML=machine learning; NLP=natural language processing; NPDR=nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy; OR=odds ratio; OSD=ocular surface disease; PCPs=primary care practitioners; PDR=proliferative diabetic retinopathy; ROC=receiver operating characteristic; RNN=recurrent neural network; eye care professional=ECP.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Methods</heading><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Data Source</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In one example, a case-controlled study used data from Optum's Pan-Therapeutic EHR database (Optum PanTher EHR). Optum PanTher EHR consists of data primarily from the United States and represents clinical information from more than 80 million patients including at least 7 million patients in each U.S. census region. Data from multiple EHR platforms including Cerner, Epic, GE, and McKesson are analyzed by Optum by means of natural language processing (NLP) to extract information about diagnoses, biometrics, laboratory results, procedures, and medications. Optum PanTher EHR draws upon a network of more than 140,000 providers at more than 700 hospitals and 7,000 clinics.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Outcome Measures</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In this example, the method sought to predict the diagnosis of five major eye pathologies: AMD, cataract, diabetic, OSD, glaucoma, and retinopathy. Classification of AMD was based on Optum PanTher EHR International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes and subdivided into non-exudative (H35.31%) and exudative (H35.32%) groups in which &#x201c;%&#x201d; represents a wildcard. Classification of cataract required a more restrictive definition than simply H25%. Since no ICD-10 code distinguishes visually significant cataract from those of lesser impact, we chose to use cataract surgery as a surrogate for visually significant cataract. For this study, cataract was defined by the cataract surgery CPT codes of 66982 or 66984 rather than by ICD-10. Classification of diabetic retinopathy was based on Optum PanTher EHR ICD-10 codes and subdivided into type 1 NPDR (H10.31%-H10.34%), type 1 PDR (H10.35%), type 2 NPDR (H11.31%-H11.34%), and type 2 PDR (H11.35%). Glaucoma was defined by the presence of one or more of three criteria: an ICD-10 code of H40.1% (open angle glaucoma), the prescription of glaucoma medication, or the presence of a CPT code indicating glaucoma surgery. This definition was developed to capture not only patients with a recorded diagnosis of glaucoma but also those patients being treated for glaucoma or high-risk ocular hypertension for whom the diagnosis of glaucoma was not recorded in the Optum EHR. Table 1 lists the inclusion criteria for glaucoma. Similar to cataract, OSD required narrower criteria than simply H04.1% and H02.88% since these codes do not distinguish OSD requiring treatment from more mild presentations. For this study, OSD was defined rather restrictively as patients receiving cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion 0.05%, cyclosporine ophthalmic solution 0.09%, or lifitegrast ophthalmic solution 5%.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="280pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Inclusion criteria for glaucoma consisted of prescription of</entry></row><row><entry>one or more of the listed medications or listed procedures.</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="280pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Beta Blockers</entry></row><row><entry>Levobunolol (Betagan, Akbeta)</entry></row><row><entry>Carteolol (Ocupress)</entry></row><row><entry>Metipranolol (Optipranolol)</entry></row><row><entry>Timolol (Timoptic, Betimal, Istalol)</entry></row><row><entry>Timolol Gel (Timoptic Xe)</entry></row><row><entry>Betaxolol (Betoptic, Betoptic S)</entry></row><row><entry>Alpha Agonists</entry></row><row><entry>Apraclonidine (Iopidine)</entry></row><row><entry>Brimonidine (Alphagan, Alphagan P)</entry></row><row><entry>Dipivefrin (Propine)</entry></row><row><entry>Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors</entry></row><row><entry>Dorzolamide (Trusopt)</entry></row><row><entry>Brinzolamide (Azopt)</entry></row><row><entry>Prostaglandin Analogs</entry></row><row><entry>Latanoprost (Xalatan)</entry></row><row><entry>Bimatoprost 0.01% (Lumigan)</entry></row><row><entry>Travoprost (Travatan Z)</entry></row><row><entry>Tafluprost (Zioptan)</entry></row><row><entry>Latanoprostene Bunod (Vyzulta)</entry></row><row><entry>Rho Khinase Inhibitors</entry></row><row><entry>Netarsudil (Rhopressa)</entry></row><row><entry>Combined Medications</entry></row><row><entry>Dorzolamide/Timolol (Cosopt And Cospot Pf)</entry></row><row><entry>Brimonidine/Timolol (Combigan)).</entry></row><row><entry>Brinzolamide/Brimonidine (Simbrinza)</entry></row><row><entry>Netarsudil/Latanoprost (Rocklatan)</entry></row><row><entry>Glaucoma Procedures</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="2"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="28pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="252pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>0191T</entry><entry>Insertion of anterior segment aqueous drainage device, without extraocular reservoir,</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>internal approach, into the trabecular meshwork;

Since some of these attributes, particularly some of the laboratory tests, may be only sparsely represented, the data may be pruned to remove attributes (i.e., &#x201c;features&#x201d; in ML) with more than 20% missing values. Missing values may be imputed with the median value for continuous variables (e.g., BMI), with a &#x2018;Missing&#x2019; group for categorical variables (e.g., smoke or alcohol usage), and with the most frequent value for binary variables (e.g., levels of lab test results). Winsorization of the data may be performed by replacing values less than the 0.1 percentile value with the 0.1 percentile value and replacing values greater than the 99.9 percentile value with the 99.9 percentile value, respectively. Further feature engineering may be performed to remove or combine highly correlated features such as &#x201c;Rheumatoid Arthritis / Collagen Vascular Disease&#x201d; and its highly correlated cognate &#x201c;Connective Tissue Disease&#x201d;. These feature engineering steps may be performed individually for each case-controlled dataset of each sub-pathology. In this example, the resultant datasets exhibited between 142 and 182 features after the above-described culling. The feature exclusion datasets for each of the nine sub-pathologies in this example were modeled employing each of five distinct modeling strategies to produce a total of 45 individual ML models.

This technique concerns itself with the probability that the dependent variable demonstrates occurrence or non-occurrence of an event; in this case, the recording of a particular diagnosis. It is therefore a classification algorithm.

Grid-search may be employed to optimize hyperparameters. For L1-regularized logistic regression, the regularization strength C may be tuned. In random forest algorithms, the space of the number of trees and the maximum depth of each tree combination may be searched. The hyper-parameter tuning for XGBoost may include the learning rate and the maximum depth of each tree. Machine learning modeling pipeline may be established, and information of missing values fit and learnt from the training data may be applied to the test dataset to avoid information leakage. J48 decision tree modeling, a Java-based implementation of the C4 tree, may be performed in the WEKA ML workbench (University of Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand).

populations totaled 1,486,078 patients, 50% of whom were controls. In addition to the enormous patient population, this example demonstrated 90 different AI models for five major pathologies and nine sub-pathologies in order to arrive at the most predictive model for each pathology.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0075">The goal of this effort is to create a digital health tool to identify patients at higher risk for the presence of ophthalmic pathology and to do this based solely on the sort of non-ophthalmic data to which a PCP would have access. This digital health tool does not propose to either make definitive ophthalmic diagnoses nor to predict development of future pathology. Rather, the digital health tool seeks to identify patients whose clinical and demographic context is associated with the presence of AMD, cataract, clinically significant diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, or OSD disease of a magnitude requiring pharmacological therapy.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0076">Performance in predicting the presence of pathology for this example ranged between 71% in the case of glaucoma to 87% in the case of type 1 proliferative diabetic retinopathy, with an average performance of 80% across all groups. Since the intent is to identify at-risk patients, these performance values may be used to determine disease odds ratios according to the method described by Hogue, Gaylor, and Schulz, for example, as described in Altman, Douglas G., <i>Practical Statistics for Medical Research. </i>Chapman &#x26; Hall (1991). Since the case control study populations for each pathology were evenly split between pathology and control, random selection of a patient would yield a 50% chance of pathology. If a model performs at 80% accuracy, it is, in essence, identifying a population for whom there is an 80% risk of pathology. The calculation of odds ratio (&#x3b8;) is:</p><p id="p-0074" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00002" num="00002"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mi>&#x3b8;</mi>  <mo>=</mo>  <mfrac>   <mrow>    <msub>     <mi>P</mi>     <mi>M</mi>    </msub>    <mo>/</mo>    <msub>     <mi>P</mi>     <mi>O</mi>    </msub>   </mrow>   <mrow>    <mrow>     <mo>(</mo>     <mrow>      <mn>1</mn>      <mo>-</mo>      <msub>       <mi>P</mi>       <mi>M</mi>      </msub>     </mrow>     <mo>)</mo>    </mrow>    <mo>/</mo>    <mrow>     <mo>(</mo>     <mrow>      <mn>1</mn>      <mo>-</mo>      <msub>       <mi>P</mi>       <mi>O</mi>      </msub>     </mrow>     <mo>)</mo>    </mrow>   </mrow>  </mfrac> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0075" num="0077">In which &#x3b8;=odds ratio, P<sub>M</sub>=fraction of model predicted population with pathology, P<sub>o</sub>=fraction of original population with pathology. Since the original study population (P<sub>o</sub>) was case-controlled with 50% pathology, both P<sub>o </sub>and (1&#x2212;P<sub>o</sub>)=0.5 and the formula simplifies to:</p><p id="p-0076" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00003" num="00003"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mi>&#x3b8;</mi>  <mo>=</mo>  <mfrac>   <msub>    <mi>P</mi>    <mi>M</mi>   </msub>   <mrow>    <mn>1</mn>    <mo>-</mo>    <msub>     <mi>P</mi>     <mi>M</mi>    </msub>   </mrow>  </mfrac> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0077" num="0078">Applying this to each of the models provides a clinically useful measure. The models in this example identify patients with elevated odds ratios of prevalence of pathology of between 2.44 in the case of glaucoma to 6.58 in the case of type 1 proliferative diabetic retinopathy with an average odds ratio of approximately 4 as shown in Table 3. Application of such a model in the clinical setting could allow a PCP to identify patients nearly four times more likely to have ophthalmic pathology. Such a tool would bring a substantial benefit in the triage and referral of at-risk patients to eye care professionals.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0079">Example Data and Outcome Engineering</p><p id="p-0079" num="0080">The data used to produce and test these models in this example were obtained from the Optum Pan-Therapeutic EHR database (Optum PanTher EHR), though other databases could be used. These data consist of diagnostic and procedure codes, biometric data such as BMI and vital signs, demographic information including socioeconomic and geographical information, laboratory results, and medications prescribed. This information does not include the physician notes that might provide rationale for the diagnoses recorded. Indeed, since only a limited number of diagnoses may be listed on a claim, it is possible that some extant diagnoses may have gone unrecorded. On the other hand, diagnoses like cataract and OSD may be over-represented since the ICD-10 taxonomy does not distinguish between clinically significant cataract and OSD from cases in which these pathologies were subclinical. Indeed, it would be of little clinical utility to build an AI model that detects subclinical cataracts.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0081">This example demonstrates the challenge of identifying clinically relevant diagnoses from large datasets. A 2018 study in JAMA Ophthalmology investigated the precision of ICD-10 codes for patients with uveitis and found that 13 of 27 uveitides were imprecisely defined and that multiple codes were employed to describe the same pathology. A 2020 study of ocular pathology in stroke patients noted fewer patients with glaucoma than anticipated and attributed this to the lack of ophthalmology clinic data. Patients may be on glaucoma medications without a concurrent ICD code recorded for glaucoma, suggesting that a diagnosis of glaucoma may have been recorded in the patient's medical record before incorporation into the dataset. Therefore to defining the glaucoma cohort in this example, was expanded to include those patients who met one or more of three criteria: an ICD-10 code of H40.1% (open angle glaucoma), the prescription of glaucoma medication, or the presence of a CPT code indicating glaucoma surgery (see Table 1). This definition was developed in order to both detect glaucoma patients without glaucoma ICD-10 codes and to exclude patients inappropriately labeled as glaucoma by ICD-10. This definition resulting in a substantial winnowing of the glaucoma cohort from 1,368,700 (50% of whom were controls) to 385,514 patients. Similar data pre-processing may be required of other databases to include all patients who might be at risk.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0082">A similar approach may be taken to the cataract and OSD study populations. Cataract and OSD are among the most frequently recorded diagnoses on claims. Cataract, in particular, is nearly ubiquitous in elderly patients and was the most common ophthalmic ICD-10 diagnosis of those examined in this example. Since only a subset of these require cataract surgery, the detection of cataract alone is not clinically useful. ICD-10 coding does not distinguish between cataracts requiring surgery and those that do not. However, CPT coding, in a sense does make this distinction. Therefore, we chose a CPT of 66984 (cataract extraction with intraocular lens) and 66982 (complex cataract extraction) as the criteria for clinically significant cataracts. This narrowing of inclusion criteria reduced the cataract study population from 2,087,836 (50% of whom were controls) to 395,140 patients in this example. OSD coding is even more problematic. A large number of ICD-10 codes are available and clinical significance is difficult to establish. The initial cohort of OSD patients and controls for this database totaled 1,182,912 patients. In order to model the clinical context associated with OSD, a a restrictive criterion was chosen: the prescription of topical cyclosporine or lifitegrast. This greatly reduced the OSD population to only 7,440 patients, but these represent patients with clinically meaningful disease. No outcome engineering measures were applied to the AMD groups or to the diabetic retinopathy groups, each of which was defined by its corresponding ICD-10 code.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0083">An Example of Clinical Attributes and Feature Engineering</p><p id="p-0083" num="0084">The initial dataset in this example included a large number of attributes or &#x201c;features&#x201d; (in the language of ML), totaling 380 individual parameters. In order to produce models that would not be burdensome for the clinician to employ, the number of attributes required by each model was reduced. This reduction and modification of model parameters is referred to as &#x201c;feature engineering&#x201d;. In order for a feature to be included in the final model, several criteria needed to be met. The feature must play a significant role in the model's outcome. It is self-evident that features that do not contribute substantially to a model may be discarded with little impact on model performance. In the case of the XGBoost models, parameter optimization was performed by grid search algorithm. The second feature inclusion criterion was non-correlation with other features. In some cases, such as between weight and BMI, the correlation is evident. However, the correlation between other clinical features only becomes clear on analysis. The issue of feature correlation highlights a difference between AI and traditional risk-analysis studies. When studied individually, certain attributes such as obesity and socioeconomic status may be identified as disease risk factors. However, when viewed collectively, the importance of one of these may be reduced if the two attributes are highly correlated. The third criterion for feature inclusion was high frequency in the dataset. Some of the laboratory values, particularly serum fibrinogen, were so sparse in this particular dataset that exclusion of the feature was preferable to the alternatives of sample reduction or interpolation. Two thresholds for feature sparsity were used in this example. Models were built upon datasets that excluded features with more than 20% missing values. Feature engineering substantially benefits from guidance by clinical domain experts and our feature and outcome engineering was clinically informed, particularly in the realm of the diagnostic criteria described above.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0085">Utilization Data and Generalizability</p><p id="p-0085" num="0086">The data in the example given above do not contain the richness of a complete medical record. It is therefore impossible to establish the criteria under which the clinicians made the diagnoses recorded, hence the outcome engineering maneuvers to establish stricter criteria, e.g., using CPT codes for cataract surgery to identify clinically significant cataract patients. At the same time, models built upon these sorts of data are more generalizable and available than models built upon more specific and perhaps more idiosyncratic data sources. These are precisely the sorts of data available to PCPs, making these models more easily deployable than models built upon a specific medical record system. Indeed, the availability of these data is illustrated by the example noted above which included more than 80 million patients from disparate healthcare systems.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0087">Hierarchical Relationships</p><p id="p-0087" num="0088">It should be noted that the clinical features identified as relevant by each of the pathology models should be viewed as correlative but not necessarily causative. It is better to think of the collection of clinical values as a patient's clinical milieu rather than as a collection of individual risk factors. While it is difficult to imagine that college education is itself a risk factor for pathology, its correlation and importance to a given model should not be discounted since it contributed to the model's predictiveness of the presence of pathology in the example described above.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0089">All of this is not to say that causation may not exist in the relation between some of these features and the pathologies modeled. Highly multi-dimensional clinical AI studies like the example above may identify previously unrecognized factors that directly influence pathogenesis. However, causative connection cannot be established by these sorts of study and would require a more traditional experimental approach. Although the J-48 decision tree models did not perform as well as the GLM or XGBoost strategies in the example case, they are informative in that they describe hierarchical relationships among clinical features. As an example, the J-48 model for glaucoma identifies race, systemic steroids, and anti-diabetic medication use as important clinical features. However, the model dictated the order in which these factors should be considered, assessing race only after it is established whether the patient takes anti-diabetic medications, and assessing systemic steroid use only after these first two attributes have been determined. Such a hierarchical relationship among clinical features may be enormously difficult to establish in traditional reduced-dimensional scientific queries. This gestalt approach to multi-dimensional clinical context is one of the strengths of this method.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0090">Prediction</p><p id="p-0090" num="0091">The purpose of these models is prediction. However, in order for the work to be properly applied, a clear understanding of &#x201c;prediction&#x201d; must first be established. These models predict the presence of extant pathology. They should be of value in the identification of populations in which these pathologies are substantially more prevalent than in the general population. The models should not be employed to make a diagnosis for an individual patient, but rather to identify patients at risk of having undetected AMD, cataract, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, or OSD. Further, these models are built upon clinical data in which an ophthalmic pathology is or is not present. That is to say, these models are not constructed to predict the development of future pathology. It may or may not be the case that a particular clinical context, as defined by the multi-dimensional features incorporated into the models, may predict the development of future disease. It would be inappropriate to employ these models as a pure diagnosis. These models predict the presence of ophthalmic pathology based upon non-ophthalmic data and may be best used for triage and referrals from non-ophthalmologists to eye care care professionals.
