Near-field communication is understood to mean communication at a frequency situated around 13.56 MHz, but the present invention is applicable to any communication at a frequency between 3 MHz and 30 MHz that also allows near-field communication.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Magnetic coupling-based charging devices for wirelessly charging portable electronic apparatuses, such as mobile telephones, laptop computers, touchscreen tablets, digital cameras, or even identity badges etc., are currently experiencing significant growth.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventionally, a magnetic coupling-based charging device includes at least one conductor coil, referred to as the &#x201c;primary antenna&#x201d;, which is connected to a charging module. During charging of a portable apparatus, the charging module forms a charging signal that makes it possible to channel an electric current, the strength of which varies over time, through the primary antenna. The primary antenna that is thus supplied forms a variable magnetic field.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The portable apparatus includes a reception module including a conductive coil, referred to as the &#x201c;secondary antenna&#x201d;. When the secondary antenna is placed within the variable magnetic field formed by the primary antenna, an electric current is induced in the secondary antenna. This electric current makes it possible to charge an electrical accumulator connected to the secondary antenna, thus supplying current to the portable apparatus.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The user places his portable electronic apparatus on a charging surface for supporting the portable apparatus and which also serves to support the portable apparatus during short-distance communication, so that the portable device is charged inductively, and so that it communicates before and during charging through near-field induction or NFC (&#x201c;near-field communication&#x201d;) with the vehicle's on-board electronic system.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">This short-distance wireless communication, generally of the order of a few millimeters, allows the vehicle, inter alia, to download a particular user profile contained in the portable apparatus and thus to adapt elements of the vehicle on the basis of this profile; for example, adjust the position of the driver's seat of the vehicle, program favorite radio stations, change the appearance of the dashboard, or even activate the &#x201c;E-call&#x201d; (emergency call) function, etc.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">As is known, these communication and charging devices comprise at least one radiofrequency antenna dedicated to inductive charging, called charging antenna, of the WPC type (&#x201c;Wireless Power Consortium&#x201d;, that is to say a wireless inductive charging antenna in accordance with the standards of this consortium), allowing inductive charging at low frequencies between 30 to 300 kHz, advantageously from 100 to 200 kHz and also at least one other antenna for communication at a frequency between 3 MHz and 30 MHz, advantageously 13.56 MHz, dedicated to this near-field communication.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">It may also be any other radiofrequency antenna allowing communication through short-distance coupling between the portable apparatus and the charging device that is connected to the vehicle's on-board electronic system.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">As is known, the primary WPC charging antenna is centered in the middle of the charging device in order to be aligned with respect to the secondary antenna of the portable apparatus, which is itself also generally located in the center of said equipment. The NFC antenna is generally arranged around the WPC antenna, all the way around the periphery of the charging device. Similarly, the NFC antenna of the portable apparatus is itself also located around the periphery of the back face of the portable apparatus and is therefore located facing the NFC antenna of the charging device when the portable apparatus is placed on the charging device, thereby allowing effective NFC communication.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, which shows an embodiment according to the closest prior art, a communication and charging device la according to the prior art comprises a main printed circuit board <b>2</b> for monitoring and controlling charging and/or communication and at least one electric power source for at least one primary charging antenna, not visible in this <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and for at least one communication antenna <b>3</b><i>a, </i>hereinafter referred to as NFC antenna <b>3</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to this closest prior art, said at least one NFC antenna <b>3</b><i>a </i>is etched on a second printed circuit board <b>2</b><i>a </i>located above said at least one emitter antenna of the inductive charging device while being in a plane parallel to the main printed circuit board. This moves the primary emitter antenna away from the secondary antenna, in the form of a receiver coil, present in the portable electrical apparatus placed on the second board <b>2</b><i>a, </i>and this is detrimental to the inductive charging.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Also shown are connection pins <b>4</b>, in the form of three pins arranged at the four corners respectively of the main printed circuit board <b>2</b> and of the second printed circuit board <b>2</b><i>a, </i>of substantially equivalent shape and size, while being rectangular.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In addition to this major drawback in the field of inductive charging, such a device for the inductive charging of a portable electronic apparatus and for near-field communication according to the prior art has several major drawbacks in the field of NFC communication.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">A first drawback is that the NFC antenna makes it possible to cover only the central area of the device by virtue of being limited to the area for inductive charging.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">A second drawback is that NFC communication is established mainly with portable electronic apparatuses whose NFC antenna is located in the center, generally around the secondary receiver antenna for charging.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">A third drawback is that NFC communication is not guaranteed during inductive charging, the NFC communication antenna being strongly coupled with said at least one inductive charging emitter antenna.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">A fourth drawback is great sensitivity to metallic portable electronic apparatuses, which generate a strong impedance mismatch for NFC communication.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">A fifth drawback is unstable communication with electronic apparatuses whose NFC antenna is located in a peripheral area of the apparatuses, for example around a camera at the longitudinal end part of such apparatuses.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">A sixth drawback is a limited communication area, with an area of coverage less than or equal to the size of the antenna printed on the second printed circuit board.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Lastly, a seventh drawback is that the presence of an antenna on the second printed circuit board decreases charging efficiency due to a greater distance resulting from the thickness of the second printed circuit board with layers of copper increasing the electrical resistivity in the inductive charging device.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In addition, one major drawback of inductive charging devices is the potential presence of foreign metal objects on the charging surface, which may heat up during charging of the portable electronic apparatus. These foreign metal objects, if they are not detected and if the charging is not stopped, may burn the user.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The problem on which an aspect of the present invention is based is, for a device for high-frequency near-field communication and for inductively charging a portable electronic apparatus, on the one hand, that of increasing the efficiency of the inductive charging and, on the other hand, that of guaranteeing uninterruptible near-field communication during the inductive charging and also making it possible, in one improvement, to reliably detect the presence of foreign metal objects on the charging surface.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Specifically, during near-field communication, magnetic coupling occurs between said at least one inductive charging emitter antenna and the communication antenna, which deteriorates the signal-to-noise ratio during communication at the electronic apparatus, an aspect of the present invention proposing to avoid this.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">To this end, an aspect of the present invention relates to a device for high-frequency near-field communication, for example of NFC type, and for the inductive charging of a portable electronic apparatus, the device comprising, firstly for charging, a charging surface for supporting the portable electronic apparatus and at least one charging emitter antenna arranged underneath the charging surface and emitting a magnetic field at a low frequency selected between 30 and 300 kHz, a layer of ferromagnetic material being arranged below said at least one charging antenna, and, secondly for communication, at least one near-field communication antenna emitting a magnetic field at a high frequency between 3 MHz and 30 MHz, the device comprising a printed circuit board for monitoring and controlling charging and/or communication and at least one electric power source for said at least one charging antenna and for said at least one communication antenna, noteworthy in that said at least one communication antenna is in the form of at least one communication coil arranged with respect to the layer of ferromagnetic material such that part of the field created by said at least one communication coil passes through the layer of ferromagnetic material having a permeability comprising a real part and an imaginary part, the material of the layer of ferromagnetic material being selected so as to have a real part greater than 10 with, at the selected high communication frequency, a ratio between the imaginary part and the real part between 0.05 and 1 and, at the selected low frequency, a ratio between the imaginary part and the real part between 0 and 0.5.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">These two ratios make it possible to have an imaginary part with sufficiently high permeability with respect to the real part to generate leaks at least partially on a surface of the layer of ferromagnetic material extending perpendicular to said surface, while at the same time maintaining, at the selected low frequency, an imaginary part with sufficiently low permeability with respect to the real part to allow inductive charging of the electronic apparatus.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The technical effect that is achieved is, for the inductive charging of a portable electronic apparatus, that of bringing the charging antennas closer to the charging surface, and therefore improving the efficiency of the near-field communication and of the charging. The thickness of the device is reduced due to the elimination of the second printed circuit board bearing the communication antenna, and there is no longer any need for connection elements between a main printed circuit board and a second board bearing a communication antenna.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the prior art, the winding of a communication antenna located flat on the second printed circuit board did not make it possible to achieve satisfactory coverage in the surroundings of the device. This winding is now eliminated, as are the interconnections between the printed circuit board and the second printed circuit board, and replaced with metal loops forming a coil.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">For near-field communication, coverage is extended with the possibility of establishing near-field communication during charging. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, in the specific case of a device according to an aspect of the invention with two communication antennas, the communication coverage is uniform throughout the surroundings of the device and no longer comprises any magnetic field peaks.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The prior art made provision to stop inductive wireless charging during high-frequency near-field communication, the NFC communication antenna being strongly coupled with said at least one inductive charging emitter antenna. An aspect of the present invention, by decoupling the charging antenna or antennas from the communication antenna or antennas, makes it possible to avoid such stoppage.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The excitation of the ferromagnetic material by at least one communication antenna according to an aspect of the present invention makes it possible to channel the magnetic field so as to provide coverage throughout the central area of the device and generates a magnetic field that is oriented vertically with respect to the layer of material by virtue of the leaks resulting from the permeability of the material.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Magnetic permeability characterizes the ability of a material to modify a magnetic field, that is to say to modify magnetic flux lines. A magnetic permeability is defined in the form of a complex number whose imaginary part illustrates the leakage capacity of the magnetic field of the material. The higher this imaginary part is at a given frequency, the greater the leaks will be, the field lines preferably following the trajectories passing through areas of strong magnetic permeability.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The selection of the imaginary part of the permeability of the material depends on the device, for example on the type of communication antennas that are used, and cannot be reduced to a value and to a range of values. Those skilled in the art have the necessary skills, with knowledge of the high communication frequency and low frequency values selected for communication and charging, respectively, to select a ferromagnetic material having an imaginary permeability that is relatively low at the low charging frequency, the layer essentially serving at this low frequency to channel the magnetic flux, and that is relatively high at the high communication frequency, so that magnetic field leaks are possible along the ferromagnetic material.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">This selection is based on a compromise between charging efficiency and near-field communication efficiency. The selection may be made using pre-established curves giving the imaginary permeability part as a function of an extended frequency field including low and high frequencies.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The near-field communication area is thus extended in particular for portable electrical apparatuses having a near-field communication antenna toward a longitudinal end. In addition, near-field communication becomes more stable during charging with some electronic devices, such as metallic mobile telephones.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">With regard to the charging of the portable electronic apparatus, the device according to an aspect of the invention has a reduced distance between the charging antenna or antennas and the portable electrical apparatus, thereby making it possible to reduce energy losses and to increase charging efficiency.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">For illustration, in a device according to the prior art, the distance between the portable apparatus and the charging antennas may be 7 mm, including 1.2 mm for the second printed circuit board which contains the communication antenna etched flat on this second board. The elimination of the second board made possible by the device according to an aspect of the present invention therefore reduces the distance between the charging antennas and the apparatus from 7 mm to 5.8 mm, and charging efficiency changes from 65% to 70%.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Preferably, but in a completely non-limiting manner, the communication coil locally surrounds the layer of ferromagnetic material.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Preferably, the communication coil has an axis of symmetry located in a plane parallel to the layer of ferromagnetic material.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Advantageously, said at least one communication antenna surrounds an end portion of the layer of ferromagnetic material.

Inserting an inverting logic gate into the setting in resonance control circuit makes it possible to have a single control circuit for the two communication antennas and simplifies the design of the device.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Advantageously, the control circuit is connected to each switch of the main circuit and either puts it into a first position closing the supply circuit of one of the coils while leaving the supply circuit of the other coil open, or puts it into a second position closing the supply circuit of one of the coils while putting the other coil into resonant mode, a third position corresponding to the two switches put into the open position.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The two communication antennas may be active simultaneously, inactive simultaneously, one active and the other in resonant mode, one active and the other inactive.

Communication coils L<b>1</b>, L<b>2</b> for first and second communication antennas <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0082">In one preferred embodiment of the device <b>1</b>, the antennas <b>31</b>, <b>32</b> are wound around the layer <b>7</b> and have an axis of symmetry located in a plane parallel to said layer <b>7</b> of ferromagnetic material, this being illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0083">However, the preferred embodiment of the device <b>1</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>7</b></figref> is in no way limiting.
