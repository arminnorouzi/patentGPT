These auxiliary components require packaging space elsewhere in the vehicle and the addition of an air compressor is often undesirable from an audible noise perspective.

These forces may create an uncomfortable user experience especially during high amplitudes at moderate frequencies. In an active seating system with one, two, or more degrees of freedom, the occupant may be isolated from these road perturbations as the active seating system senses roll, heave and yaw forces and actively counteracts motions resulting from these forces to improve the user experience (e.g., improve comfort, decrease motion sickness, etc.). In some embodiments of an active seating system, the actuation mechanism (e.g., a frame including one or more active suspension actuators) may need to statically support the mass of the occupant and the mass of the seat structure. This objective can often be achieved by commanding a bias force from the active seating system. Biasing an active seat at an appropriate nominal position reduces power consumption and improves efficiency relative to a seat where the same function is achieved by using the active suspension actuators.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> show two views of a dynamically adaptable bias sub-system <b>100</b> that is configured to sense, measure, and counteract the addition or subtraction of mass (e.g., from an occupant entering or exiting the seat) beyond the nominal mass (e.g., of a seat top). Applying a nominal bias force allows the occupant and seat structure to be located at an appropriate position for performing active seating (e.g., isolation, inducing motion) while simultaneously reducing or eliminating additional power demand that would be required if the active seating mechanism (e.g., active suspension actuators) were used to perform this function. In some embodiments, system performance and/or efficiency may be improved by incorporating this functionality. The dynamically adaptable bias sub-system <b>100</b> may be scalable and may be configured and tuned to operate in a specific range of masses depending on the particular application. Possible tunable parameters include lever arm ratios, ball screw pitch, diameter and/or length of torsion bars, amount of &#x201c;wind up&#x201d;, which all change the spring rate of the system. In some embodiments described herein, it is advantageous to keep the spring rate of the system as low as possible. Different mechanical systems (e.g., hydraulically actuated, magnetically actuated, etc.) may also be used. Each varying mechanical system has various tunable features to drive down system spring rate.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">During operation, in some embodiments, the active seating mechanism (including roll and heave actuators <b>110</b>) may continuously monitor and command a seat position and/or orientation such that the seat may be positioned for active isolation. Any change in position due to external inputs may be sensed and measured by means of electrical power consumption and/or a change in relative seating position. In some embodiments, by measuring the change in power or position, the active seating mechanism <b>100</b> may determine the change (e.g., increase or decrease) of mass on the system. The mass on the system may include a mass of the seat top, a mass of an occupant of the seat, a mass of an object placed on the seat, etc. This mass differential may be communicated to the dynamic load-balancing mechanism <b>106</b> and the dynamic load-balancing mechanism <b>106</b> may compensate for the mass change such that the active seating mechanism does not consume additional power in order to &#x201c;hold&#x201d; the occupant at a neutral position.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The system includes one or more torsion bars/rods <b>114</b> and one or more actuators configured to actuate these rods to increase or decrease the nominal bias force applied to the seat. Other embodiments, which may employ air springs, coil springs (in series or in parallel) are contemplated and the disclosure is not so limited. When commanded by the system, one or more electrical motors/actuators may be used to drive a mechanical gear train. This mechanical gear train may be used to provide a high mechanical advantage in order to &#x201c;wind-up&#x201d; one or more torsion rods (e.g., torsion rod <b>114</b>) within the system. In some embodiments, the mechanical gear train may include worm gears, a series of gears, levers, etc. Due to the high mechanical advantage, the system may be inherently non-backdriveable or effectively non-backdriveable, which may allow the motors of the roll and heave actuators <b>110</b> to remain unpowered once the desired motion is achieved without the need to supply continuous energy. The system monitors the force outputs of the roll and heave actuators <b>110</b>. A running average force output of zero means that the roll and heave actuators <b>110</b> are not activating to account for mass on the seat. When the running average force output is not zero, the force bias actuator may apply a preload to account for the mass of the seat (and any occupants/objects) to bring the running average force output back to zero. Changing the preload on the seat via the force bias mechanism can be done slowly (e.g., on the order of seconds or minutes).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>, the system utilizes a single force bias motor/actuator <b>106</b>.
