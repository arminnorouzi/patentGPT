In addition, as carbon energy is gradually depleted and interest in environmental pollution increases, secondary batteries are becoming popular globally as an alternative energy source. Therefore, the scope of utilization of secondary batteries is expected to be more diversified and expanded in the feature. Accordingly, many studies on secondary batteries that can respond to various needs are being conducted.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to prepare a secondary battery, first, a positive electrode and a negative electrode are formed by applying an electrode mixture containing an electrode active material to a surface of a current collector, then a separator is interposed therebetween to thereby make an electrode assembly, which is then mounted in a cylindrical or rectangular metal can or inside a pouch-type case of an aluminum laminate sheet, and a liquid electrolyte is injected or impregnated into the electrode assembly or a solid electrolyte to prepare a secondary battery.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Specifically, in the case of such a negative electrode, a passive film such as a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer is formed on the surface of the negative electrode during the initial charge. The passive film interrupts injection of the organic solvent into the negative electrode and suppresses decomposition reaction of the organic solvent by preventing the movement of electrons while acting as an ion tunnel by allowing the passing of only lithium ions, thereby stabilizing the structure of the negative electrode, improving the reversibility of the negative electrode, and allowing the negative electrode to be usable. However, since the reaction of the passive film formation is an irreversible reaction, there is a problem that the capacity of the battery is reduced by consuming lithium ions. Further, the charge/discharge efficiency of the battery is not completely 100%. Hence, as the cycle of the battery is repeated, consumption of lithium ions occurs, thereby reducing capacity and deteriorating the cycle lifespan.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">As such, a method for forming a passive film on the surface of a negative electrode, preventing the capacity reduction and improving cycle lifespan by pre-lithiating the negative electrode through inserting lithium into the negative electrode is currently developed.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Such a pre-lithiation method includes a physical method of allowing lithium metal to directly contact the surface of the negative electrode, and a method of connecting lithium metal with the negative electrode and electrochemically charging the negative electrode. At this time, in the case of an electrochemical charging scheme, charging is performed in a state that the lithium metal is made to be spaced apart from the negative electrode by a predetermined distance in the electrolyte solution. In this case, the composition of the SEI film is changed according to the distance between the lithium metal and the negative electrode, thereby deteriorating the performance of the battery. Therefore, there is a need for a technology for enhancing the efficiency and cycle characteristics of a battery through formation of an improved SEI film through adjustment of a distance between a lithium metal and a negative electrode at the time of pre-lithiation.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">An object of the present invention is to provide a negative electrode pre-lithiation apparatus and method for enhancing initial efficiency of a negative electrode and preventing degeneration of a battery by adjusting composition of an SEI film in pre-lithiating a negative electrode according to an electrochemical charging scheme.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Solution</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">An apparats for pre-lithiating a negative electrode according to the present invention includes: a pre-lithiation reactor sequentially divided into an impregnation section, a pre-lithiation section and an aging section, the pre-lithiating reactor accommodating a pre-lithiation solution through which a negative electrode structure is movable;

As such, it is seen that the capacity retention rate of the battery cell containing the negative electrode according to the examples 1 and 2 is better than that of the comparative examples 1 and 2. This is because a SEI film containing more inorganic components including Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3 </sub>was formed by adjusting the distance between the negative electrode structure and the lithium metal counter electrode to be equal to or greater than 7 mm. As such, it is possible to shown a high capacity retention rate as lithium intercalated in the electrode acts as a lithium reservoir by protecting the negative electrode from external CO<sub>2 </sub>environment.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0148">On the other hand, in the case of comparative examples 1 and 2, the distance between the negative electrode structure and the lithium metal counter electrode became small. As such, the ratio the inorganic components in the film was relatively small as a result of the pre-lithiation. As such, as the negative electrode reacts with external CO<sub>2</sub>, etc., lithium intercalated through pre-lithiation was additionally consumed. As such, as lithium, which played a role as a lithium reservoir in the negative electrode, relatively decreased, cycle characteristics were reduced.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0149">Further, when using a silicon-based active material (SiO) as the negative electrode active material, active materials are expanded at the time of charge/discharge, thereby destroying the SEI film, which causes additional lithium consumption. Hence, an electrode containing SiO needs a firmer SEI film. However, in the case of the comparative example 2, the ratio of Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3 </sub>contained in the SEI film was the smallest, and accordingly, the capacity retention rate was also low.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0150">Hence, according to the present invention, the content of the inorganic components in the SEI film can be increased by adjusting the distance between the negative electrode structure and the lithium metal counter electrode, through which the lifespan of the battery can be increased.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0151">The above description is merely illustrative of the technical idea of the present invention, and those skilled in the art to which the present invention pertains may make various modifications and variations without departing from the essential characteristics of the present invention.
