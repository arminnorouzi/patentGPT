id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to the field of fuel cells, in particular proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC). It can be implemented to optimise performances and to regenerate the reversible degradations of a PEMFC.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">STATE OF THE ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">A fuel cell is formed of a stack of electrochemical cells, each having an anode and a cathode electrically separated from one another by an electrolyte. In the case of a hydrogen fuel cell, the fuel (hydrogen) is brought into contact with the anode, and the combustion agent (oxygen) is brought into contact with the cathode. Oxidation and reduction reactions respectively occur at the anode and at the cathode, which produces electricity and water. The electrolyte can be presented in the form of a membrane ensuring the transport of protons coming from the oxidation reaction and consumed by the reduction reaction. This is the case of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The increase in performances and the service life of PEMFCs is considered as a major challenge for the large-scale deployment of this technology.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">During the operation of the PEMFC, a progressive decrease in performances is generally observed. This decrease in performance is typically due to so-called &#x201c;irreversible&#x201d; degradations on the one hand, and so-called &#x201c;reversible&#x201d; degradations on the other hand.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Irreversible degradations are linked to the physical alteration of the components of the cells, for example by corrosion of the catalyst, refinement of the membrane, loss of hydrophobicity of the gas diffusion layers. These types of degradations cannot be repaired or regenerated during the operation of the fuel cell.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Reversible degradations are linked to the interactions between the components of the cells and the reagents and/or the products, for example by intoxication of the catalysts, local drying or flooding of the cell. These types of degradations can be repaired or regenerated totally or partially during the operation of the fuel cell.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is in particular known that the formation of superficial Pt oxides on the surface of the cathode progressively decreases the quantity of accessible active sites for the reduction reaction of the oxygen. These &#x201c;Pt&#x2014;Ox&#x201d; oxides at the cathode can however be removed by lowering the potential of the cathode sufficiently low and for a sufficiently long time. This enables to again make the &#x201c;metal Pt&#x201d; active sites accessible.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The removal of the Pt&#x2014;Ox can be done by reducing the air supply so as to impose a temporary air shortage, during a regeneration phase of a cell or a group of cells in the stack. Such an undersupply of air induces a very-low-potential operation for a few seconds and enables to remove a large part of the reversible degradations.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">This temporary operation with air shortage however has certain disadvantages, in particular:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0010">a high operating heterogeneity within the cell or the group of cells, which could accelerate the irreversible degradation mechanisms;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0011">an exacerbation of the operating heterogeneities between the cells of the group;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0012">an imbalance between the cells of the group during the return to nominal conditions;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0013">a high drop in electrical power delivered by the fuel cell, possibly requiring an auxiliary supply;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0014">a decrease in yield with a high H<sub>2 </sub>consumption during the low potential operation.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0011" num="0015">Document DE 102020124141 A1 discloses a solution enabling to reduce the oxygen content of the air supplying the cells, by recirculation of oxygen-depleted air within the cells of the fuel cell.

The fluid supply and discharge, and recirculation lines, as well as the inlet, outlet and recirculation switches of the fluid circuit typically form a system for supplying and regenerating the fuel cell. This system enables an operation of the fuel cell in the production phase or in the regeneration phase.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0029">In the scope of development of the present invention, during an operation in the regeneration phase by air shortage such as taught by the prior art, it has been discovered that the high operating heterogeneity within the group of cells in particular comes from a low fluid flow rate within the group, which degrades the air distribution at the cells of the group. This leads to a localised reaction at the air inlet, with a very localised water and heat production which accelerates the irreversible degradation mechanisms. The low distribution of reagents, in particular of the combustion agent, negatively impacts the operation of the fuel cell, also during the return to the nominal production phase.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0030">On the contrary, in the present invention, during a regeneration phase, the system advantageously enables to deplete the supply fluid of reagents or of combustion agent, while maintaining a high fluid flow rate. Thus, by suitably switching the inlet, outlet and recirculation switches of the fluid circuit, a given group is advantageously supplied by a fluid partially coming from the outlet of at least one other group and partially from said given group, by recirculation between the inlet and the outlet of this given group. This fluid is typically intended to provide the reagent species with the electrodes of the cells, and to discharge the reaction products. In particular, the fluid brings the combustion agent to the cathode of each cell. When the fluid passes through a group of cells, the molar fraction of combustion agent in the fluid decreases. The supply of a group by a fluid having passed through at least one other group is therefore depleted of combustion agent. The recirculation of the fluid between the inlet and the outlet of a given group also depletes the fluid of combustion agent. A group partially supplied by the outlet of another group and partially by recirculation is therefore supplied by a depleted fluid, even highly depleted, of combustion agent. This enables this group to operate at a very low potential, for example at a regeneration voltage Ve&#x2264;0.3V, and consequently, to regenerate. Advantageously, only the molar fraction of the combustion agent is modified during the regeneration phase, and the flow rate remains sufficiently high to avoid a low distribution of the depleted fluid within the group. The maintaining of a sufficiently high flow rate can be done by a recirculation pump on the recirculation line.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0031">The system advantageously enables to supply both a given group by a fluid depleted of combustion agent, and the other group(s) by a fluid having a molar fraction of nominal combustion agent. This enables to regenerate the given group while ensuring a nominal electricity production via the other groups. It is not necessary to resort to an auxiliary supply during the regeneration phase.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0032">Advantageously, by suitably switching the inlet, outlet and recirculation switches of the fluid circuit, different fluid paths can be formed between the groups of cells. The fluid thus flows in the fluid circuit along these fluid paths. The fluid paths can be established in a versatile manner, as needed. As indicated above, during a regeneration phase of a given group, the fluid path is preferably chosen such that the fluid supplying said given group is depleted of combustion agent, by recirculation from said given group and by passage through at least one other group.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0033">The fluid path is preferably chosen such that said depleted fluid supplying the given group has, during the regeneration phase, a circulation direction through the inverted group with respect to the circulation direction normally adopted during a nominal production phase of the group. This inversion of the flow direction of the fluid in a given group can typically be done via the recirculation pump of the recirculation line. The inversion of the circulation direction of the fluid through the group in the regeneration phase enables to better distribute the fluid within the cells of the group. The regeneration of the cells of the group is thus more homogenous.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0034">The suitable switching of the inlet, outlet and recirculation switches of the fluid circuit can be done by a control/command system of the PEMFC. Such a system can be advantageously integrated with the PEMFC.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0035">The system according to the present invention enables a low-potential, homogenous and stabilised operation of the group during regeneration. Such an operation is typically based on a supply to the cathode of dioxygen-depleted air while maximising the air volume flow in the group during regeneration. This enables, in particular:<ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0009" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0009-0001" num="0036">a (re)hydration of the active layers and of the membrane in the cells of this group,</li>        <li id="ul0009-0002" num="0037">a reduction of the superficial Pt oxides and a desorption of the species possibly adsorbed at the catalyst(s) of the cathodes,</li>        <li id="ul0009-0003" num="0038">a high gas flow rate at the cathodes, ensuring a good fluid distribution within the cells and between the cells, and a good discharging of the liquid water,</li>        <li id="ul0009-0004" num="0039">a limiting of the H<sub>2 </sub>consumption and of the heat production during this low-potential regeneration phase.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0027" num="0040">Thus, the solution proposed comprises a regeneration system having considerably improved performances with respect to the known solutions.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0041">According to another aspect, a method for regenerating a fuel cell such as described above is provided. This method comprises:<ul id="ul0010" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0010-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0011" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0011-0001" num="0042">A supply of the fuel cell by the main supply conduit by a fluid having a nominal flow rate and a nominal molar fraction of combustion agent,</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0029" num="0043">during a regeneration phase of a given group:<ul id="ul0012" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0012-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0013" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0013-0001" num="0044">A switching of the inlet, outlet and recirculation switches of the fluid circuit so as to supply the given group from the recirculation line of said given group and from a fluid discharge line of at least one other group,</li>        <li id="ul0013-0002" num="0045">An application of a regeneration voltage Ve to the cells of said given group, Ve being less than or equal to 0.3V.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0030" num="0046">The method thus enables to regenerate the given group by depleting the molar fraction of combustion agent of the supply fluid and by maintaining a regeneration voltage Ve&#x2264;0.3V.

The regeneration is thus more effective and quicker.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0047">The supply flow rate of the given group during the regeneration phase is preferably substantially equal to the nominal flow rate.

This fluid flow rate can be greater than or equal to 80% of the nominal flow rate. The use of a recirculation pump to complementarily supply the group in the regeneration phase enables in particular a better fluid homogenisation between and within the cells of the group.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0067">The recirculation of the fluid in the group via the recirculation line also enables to decrease the molar fraction of combustion agent (oxygen) at the inlet of the group and, subsequently, to obtain a better distribution of the current density along the cells of the group. This thus enables to more easily lower the potential of the cells at a given current. This ultimately enables to consume less hydrogen and to limit the heat generation. This also enables to limit the water production in the cells. This further enables to avoid a local accumulation of liquid water in the cell. This thus enables to optimise the regeneration of performances of the cell/of the group in question.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0068">The recirculation of the fluid via the recirculation line advantageously enables to reinject the sufficiently humid fluid into the inlet of the group. The humidity gradients in the cells of the group are thus limited. This enables to avoid a drying of the cells during the regeneration.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0069">The recirculation pump is preferably sized to supply one single group or a few groups of cells only. It is thus possible to use a power pump and/or of reduced size.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0070">According to an example, the recirculation pump is configured to enable an inversion of a flow direction of the fluid in said given group. This enables to homogenise the distribution of combustion agent and/or of current density between and within the cells of the group.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0071">According to an example, the fuel cell further comprises a control/command system configured to command the inlet, outlet and recirculation switches of the fluid circuit so as to enable or block the flow of the fluid along a chosen fluid path. Regeneration cycles can thus be easily programmed, on each of the groups of the fuel cell alternatively and/or successively. The phases of nominally producing, regenerating a group, stopping the fuel cell are advantageously controlled by such a control/command system. The control/command system can typically consider the electrical and/or fluid production parameters of one or more groups, consumption of power produced, load losses within the fuel cell, to determine the fluid path(s) ad hoc according to the operating phase of the fuel cell. The electrical performances of the fuel cell can typically be used to evaluate the need to regenerate one or more groups of the fuel cell.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0072">According to an example, the fuel cell comprises at least three groups of electrochemical cells. One single group is in the regeneration phase when the two others are in the nominal production phase. Thus, the fuel cell can continue to produce the electrical energy thanks to the operation of the groups in the nominal production phase.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0073">According to an example, during the regeneration phase of a given group, the supply of the given group is done from the recirculation line of said given group and from the fluid discharge lines of at least two other groups of the fuel cell. These other groups contribute to the supply of depleted fluid of the group in question by the regeneration phase.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0074">According to an example, the regeneration phase is configured such that the molar fraction of combustion agent of the fluid circulating through the given group is less than or equal to 50% of the nominal molar fraction of combustion agent. Such a depletion of combustion agent enables to lower the operating voltage of the group in regeneration. A low voltage enables to effectively reduce the superficial Pt oxides. The active sites of the catalyst are thus reactivated. The reversible degradations are in large part, removed.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0075">According to an example, the fluid circulating through the given group has a flow rate greater than or equal to 50% of the nominal flow rate. This enables to maintain a sufficiently quick circulation of the fluid in the cells, such that all the combustion agent is not consumed at the outlet of the group in the regeneration phase. A difference in molar fraction of combustion agent between the inlet and the outlet of the group of less than 6%, for example of around 3%, can thus be advantageously obtained. Thus, the fluid loses typically 3 percentage points by passing through the group in the regeneration phase. Its molar fraction of combustion agent can thus go from 10% to 7% by passing through the group. According to another example, the molar fraction of combustion agent of the fluid passing through the group can thus go from 7% to 4%. A significant fluid flow rate also enables a good stirring of the fluid between and within the cells of the group. A more effective and more homogenous regeneration is thus obtained.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0076">According to an example, the regeneration phase is carried out for a duration t less than or equal to 10 s.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0077">According to an example, the regeneration phase is carried out alternatively on each group of electrochemical cells of the fuel cell.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0078">According to an example, the regeneration phase comprises an inversion of the flow direction of the fluid in said given group. This enables to improve the stirring between and within the cells of the group, and to homogenise the regeneration of the group.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0079">According to an example, the regeneration phase is carried out when the fuel cell does not need to operate in the nominal production phase, in particular when an electrical production requested at the fuel cell is less than a nominal electrical production of the fuel cell.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0080">According to an example, the fuel cell comprises at least three groups and the regeneration phase is carried out simultaneously on the given group and on at least one other group.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0081">According to an example, at least one group of the fuel cell is in the nominal production phase during the regeneration phase of at least one given group.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0082">Except if incompatible, it is understood that the regeneration method and the regeneration system of the fuel cell can comprise, mutatis mutandis, all of the optional characteristics above.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0083">Thus, technical characteristics described in detail for a given embodiment can be combined with the technical characteristics described in the context of other embodiments described as an example and in a non-limiting manner. In particular, elements described or illustrated in the figures for the fuel cell or for the method can be combined so as to form another embodiment which is not necessarily illustrated or described. Such an embodiment is, of course, not excluded from the invention. A fuel cell according to the present invention typically comprises more than two groups, and typically more than three groups of electrochemical cells. The limited number of groups illustrated in the accompanying drawings aims to facilitate the understanding of the regeneration principle according to the invention. A person skilled in the art will have no difficulty in implementing an embodiment comprising more than three groups of electrochemical cells.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0084">In the scope of the present invention, by &#x201c;fuel cell&#x201d;, this means a system comprising several groups of electrochemical cells. Each group is thus constituted of a series of interconnected electrochemical cells. The cells are presented typically in the form of a membrane-electrode assembly, commonly called MEA. The groups can form one single stack of cells. Alternatively, the groups can form stacks, separate from one another, as illustrated in the accompanying figures. When the groups form one single stack, each group preferably has a reagent supply conduit which itself is clean. The discharge conduit can be common to all of the groups. Moreover, the clamping plates maintaining the cells in such one single stack can typically electrically interconnect all the cells together. The cells are thus typically mounted in series. The same electrical current will thus be applied to all the groups of the stack, whatever the operating phase.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0085">The fuel cell typically has different operating phases, in particular, a nominal production phase, a regeneration phase, a stop phase.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0086">During a nominal production phase, the groups of the fuel cell are supplied in parallel by a supply fluid.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0087">During a regeneration phase of a given group, this given group is supplied in series from at least one other group.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0088">During a stop phase, the fuel cell is no longer supplier by the main supply conduit. The groups can continue to be supplied temporarily and degressively by recirculation.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0089">The groups of the fuel cell can be electrically interconnected in series. Alternatively, one or more groups can be connected independently of one another to a network through electrical converters enabling an individual controlling. The groups are not connected in parallel, as the voltage of the group in regeneration must be less than those of the groups in nominal production.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0090">In the scope of the present invention, an inlet or an outlet of a group typically each have a structural aspect and an operational aspect. Thus structurally, the inlet and the outlet correspond to the first and second passage orifices for the supply fluid. Operationally, the inlet and the outlet respectively mean the entry and the discharge of the supply fluid. Insofar as the circulation direction of the fluid can be inverted, the inlet and the outlet can be physically switched. Thus, the first passage orifice can form the inlet or the outlet, and conversely, the second passage orifice can form the outlet or the inlet.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0091">To facilitate the understanding regarding the fluid circulation in the cells of the fuel cell, only the terms inlet/outlet and their corresponding references on the accompanying drawings are preserved, respectively X<b>1</b> (X=1 . . . 3) for the inlet and X<b>2</b> (X=1 . . . 3) for the outlet, independently of the orifice materially in question.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0092">In the scope of the present invention, the recirculation line is configured to fluidically connect the inlet and the outlet of the group in question. This recirculation line extends between the inlet and the outlet of the group in question. Each recirculation line is specific to the group in question. It does not pass through a group other than the group in question. It can borrow sections from other lines, for example from the supply and/or discharge lines. Thus, sections of the recirculation line can be common with sections of other lines. Tapping points or junctions can be physically present along this recirculation line. Members can also be present along this recirculation line. These are regulation members such as the recirculation switch and the recirculation pump. These members do not include any other group of electrochemical cells. The recirculation line fluidically connects the inlet and the outlet of the only group to which it is attached. Thus, the inlet of a group is fluidically connected to the outlet of the same group, via the recirculation line.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0093">Other elements, for example, of liquid water collection volumes associated with phase separation devices, or possible thermal heaters/exchangers avoiding the formation of condensation points in the lines, or also anti-return devices, can also be present along the lines. For clarity, these elements are not necessarily illustrated in the accompanying figures.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0094">Several embodiments of the invention implementing successive steps of the regeneration method are described below. Unless explicitly mentioned otherwise, the adjective &#x201c;successive&#x201d; does not necessarily imply, even if this is generally preferred, that the steps immediately follow one another, intermediate steps could separate them.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0095">Moreover, the term &#x201c;step&#x201d; means the fulfilment of some of the method, and can mean a set of substeps.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0096">Moreover, the term &#x201c;step&#x201d; does not compulsorily mean that the actions conducted during a step are simultaneous or immediately successive. Certain actions of a first step can in particular be followed by actions linked to a different step, and other actions of the first step can be then resumed. Thus, the term &#x201c;step&#x201d; does not necessarily mean single and inseparable actions over time and in the sequence of phases of the method.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0097">In the present application, by &#x201c;stoichiometry&#x201d;, this means the ratio between the quantity of reagent at the inlet and the quantity consumed by the electrochemical reaction. If the molar fraction at the cell out can be evaluated by a simple mass balance, the evolution along the cells inside the group or the fuel cell is not generally known. Thus, a stoichiometry of 2 indicates that the quantity of reagent at the inlet (typically the combustion agent O<sub>2</sub>) is two times greater than the quantity of reagent at the outlet. A stoichiometry of 1.5 indicates that the quantity of reagent at the inlet (typically the combustion agent O<sub>2</sub>) is three times greater than the quantity of reagent at the outlet. A stoichiometry of 1 indicates that the reagent introduced in the cell is totally consumed by the electrochemical reaction.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0098">In the accompanying figures, a circulation direction of the fluid in the fluid circuit is indicated by an arrow. The passing or blocking switches (typically open or closed valves) are illustrated. The dotted line illustrates different molar fractions of combustion agent of the fluid circulating in the fluid line in question, i.e. the supply line or the discharge line or the recirculation line.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0099">In the following examples, the supply fluid of the fuel cell is air having a nominal molar fraction of oxygen of around 21%, and a nominal flow rate. The molar fractions of oxygen mean molar % of dry gas. To simplify, each group is considered identical and comprises an identical number of cells. The operating stoichiometry, current and voltage values are therefore identical between each group. It is however perfectly considerable to implement one or more differently-sized groups, without moving away from the general regeneration principle explained below.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0100">A first example of a fuel cell <b>100</b> comprising a regeneration system according to the invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>4</b></figref>. In this example, the fuel cell comprises two groups <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> connected via a fluid circuit. The fuel cell is sized, such that the overall stoichiometry is greater than 1. For such a fuel cell comprising two identical groups, the unitary stoichiometry value, for each of the groups, can therefore be typically greater than or equal to 2.0. In this case, the molar fraction of oxygen at the outlet of each of the groups, which depends on this unitary stoichiometry, is around 11.7%. To obtain a good performance of the fuel cell, an overall stoichiometry value of between 1.6 and 2.0 is preferably chosen. The fuel cell and the fluid circuit are subsequently consequently sized, typically by considering the load losses within the groups.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0101">The fluid circuit typically comprises a main supply conduit <b>40</b>, supply lines <b>14</b>, <b>24</b>, discharge lines <b>15</b>, <b>25</b>, recirculation lines <b>16</b>, <b>26</b> and a main discharge conduit <b>50</b>. This fluid circuit further comprises inlet switches <b>141</b>, <b>241</b>, outlet switches <b>51</b>, <b>52</b>, recirculation switches <b>161</b>, <b>261</b>. The discharge lines <b>15</b>, <b>25</b> preferably have no switch. The structure of this fuel cell does not vary in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>4</b></figref>. Only the blocking or passing state of the different switches, determining the circulation path of the fluid in the fluid circuit, varies. The assignation of the inlets and outlet also varies, according to the different operating phases of the fuel cell and of the circulation direction of the supply fluid.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0102"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an operation of this fuel cell during a nominal production phase. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an operation of this fuel cell during a regeneration phase of the group <b>1</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates an operation of this fuel cell during a regeneration phase of the group <b>2</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates an operation of this fuel cell during a stop phase.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0103">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, during a nominal production phase, all the groups <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> are supplied in parallel, simultaneously. Thus, the air entering into the fuel cell and having a nominal molar fraction of oxygen (typically 21%) is brought by the main supply conduit <b>40</b> and distributed to the inlet <b>11</b> of the group <b>1</b> and at the inlet <b>21</b> of the group <b>2</b>. The inlet switches <b>141</b>, <b>241</b> are passing or open. The air circulates in each supply line <b>14</b>, <b>24</b> to the respective inlets <b>11</b>, <b>21</b> of the groups <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>. After having passed through the groups <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>, the air exits through the respective outlets <b>12</b>, <b>22</b> and circulates in each discharge line <b>15</b>, <b>25</b> to the main discharge conduit <b>50</b>. The outlet switches <b>51</b>, <b>52</b> are open. The switch <b>52</b> is preferably a pressure regulator. This enables to control the air pressure within the fuel cell. The recirculation switches <b>161</b>, <b>261</b> are closed, such that the air does not circulate in the recirculation lines <b>16</b>, <b>26</b>. This operating phase corresponds to the nominal operation of the fuel cell in the absence of regeneration of performances.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0104">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref> during a regeneration phase, a group is supplied in series from at least one other group. Thus, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the group <b>1</b> is in the process of regeneration and the group <b>2</b> is in the process of nominal production. In this example, the air entering into the fuel cell and having a nominal molar fraction of oxygen (typically 21%) is brought through the main supply conduit <b>40</b> to the inlet <b>21</b> of the group <b>2</b> only. The inlet switch <b>141</b> of the group <b>1</b> is closed. The inlet switch <b>241</b> of the group <b>2</b> is open. The air circulates in the supply line <b>24</b> to the inlet <b>21</b>. After having passed through the group <b>2</b>, the air exits through the outlet <b>22</b> and circulates in the discharge line <b>25</b> to the inlet <b>11</b> of the group <b>1</b>. The outlet switch <b>51</b> is closed. The group <b>1</b> is thus supplied by oxygen-depleted air coming from the outlet <b>22</b> of the group <b>2</b>. This air has, for example, a molar fraction of O<sub>2 </sub>of around 11.7% at the outlet <b>22</b> of the group <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0105">To decrease even further the molar fraction of oxygen of the air supplying the group <b>1</b> in the regeneration phase, the air exiting from the group <b>1</b> through the outlet <b>12</b> is advantageously partially reinjected into the group <b>1</b> through the inlet <b>11</b> via the recirculation line <b>16</b>, preferably thanks to a recirculation pump <b>200</b>. The recirculation switch <b>161</b> is open, in this case, while the recirculation switch <b>261</b> is closed. Some of the air circulating in the recirculation line <b>16</b> is discharged via the main discharge conduit <b>50</b> and the pressure regulator <b>52</b>. In the example illustrated, the recirculation line <b>16</b> typically has a junction P<b>1</b> with the discharge lines <b>15</b>, <b>25</b>, and a junction P<b>2</b> with the main discharge conduit <b>50</b>. The recirculation line <b>16</b> comprises, in this case, the section <b>160</b> between the recirculation pump <b>200</b> and the junction P<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0106">The recirculation enables to decrease the molar fraction of oxygen of the air (excluding water vapour) supplying the group <b>1</b> typically by below 7%, even 5%. Such a reduced molar fraction of oxygen enables to decrease the operating voltage of the fuel cell, in a current regulation condition of the fuel cell. This advantageously enables to favour the quick reduction of superficial Pt&#x2014;Ox oxides. This operating voltage is preferably less than 0.3V, and more preferably less than or equal to 0.2V.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0107">The recirculation also enables to improve the homogeneity of the molar fraction of oxygen between the inlet <b>11</b> and the outlet <b>12</b> of the group <b>1</b>. The recirculation line <b>16</b> and the recirculation switch <b>161</b> are sized so as to reach a difference in molar fraction of less than 6%, and preferably of around 3%, between the inlet <b>11</b> and the outlet <b>12</b> of the group <b>1</b>. Thus, the difference of molar fraction xo<b>2</b>=xo<b>2</b>,<sub>inlet</sub>&#x2212;xo<b>2</b>,<sub>outlet </sub>between the molar fraction at the inlet xo<b>2</b>,<sub>inlet </sub>and the molar fraction xo<b>2</b>,<sub>outlet </sub>is less than or equal, in any case, to 6%.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0108">The molar fraction of oxygen entering into the group <b>1</b> can thus be controlled by fixing the current I in the subgroup <b>1</b>, the air flow rate and the recirculation rate (i.e. the ratio between the reinjected air part and the discharged air part).</p><p id="p-0091" num="0109">The recirculation also enables to reinject the sufficiently humid fluid into the inlet of the group. The humidity gradients in the cells of the group are thus limited. This enables to avoid a drying of the cells during the regeneration.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0110">Advantageously, a recirculation pump <b>200</b> is disposed on the recirculation line <b>16</b>. This enables to more effectively reinject the depleted air into the group <b>1</b> in the process of regeneration. This also enables to preserve a sufficiently high air flow rate, for example greater than around 50% of the nominal flow rate, even greater than 80% of the nominal flow rate at the inlet <b>11</b> of the group <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0111">The use of a recirculation pump <b>200</b> thus enables a better fluid homogenisation between and within the cells of the group <b>1</b>. This further enables to avoid a local accumulation of liquid water in the cells.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0112">The recirculation pump <b>200</b> is preferably sized to supply the only group(s) in question by the regeneration phase. It is thus possible to use a power pump and/or of reduced size. The recirculation pump <b>200</b> further preferably enables an inversion of the circulation direction of the air in the group <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0113">Advantageously, the circulation direction of the air in the group <b>1</b> is inverted during the regeneration phase, with respect to the usual circulation direction during the nominal production phase, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>. This enables a gaseous stirring inside the cells of the group <b>1</b> and a better homogenisation of the molar fraction of water and of oxygen inside the cells.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0114">The duration of the regeneration phase is typically of around one second to a few seconds. After regeneration of the group <b>1</b>, the group <b>2</b> can be regenerated itself.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0115">In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the group <b>2</b> is in the process of regeneration and the group <b>1</b> is in the process of nominal production. In this example, the air is brought through the main supply conduit <b>40</b> to the inlet <b>11</b> of the group <b>1</b> only. The inlet switch <b>241</b> of the group <b>2</b> is closed. The inlet switch <b>141</b> of the group <b>1</b> is open. The air circulates in the supply line <b>14</b> to the inlet <b>11</b>.

This stop phase by recirculation can be accompanied by a minimum voltage level and/or a minimum duration. The hydrogen supply to the anode of the cells can be maintained during this phase to avoid a local shortage of combustion agent and an accumulation of liquid water in the cells.
