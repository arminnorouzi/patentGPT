When rehabilitating or training the legs of the user, the second motor <b>331</b> of each of the leg assisting units <b>30</b> is controlled to drive the screw <b>332</b> of the second driving set <b>33</b> to rotate. As the screw <b>332</b> of the second driving set <b>33</b> rotates forward to allow the screw sleeve <b>333</b> of the second driving set <b>33</b> to move away from the second motor <b>331</b>, the screw sleeve <b>333</b> of the second driving set <b>33</b> drives the leg lifting bracket <b>32</b> to pivot on the connecting seat <b>31</b> and to pitch upward relative to the waist assisting unit <b>20</b>. On the other hand, as the screw <b>332</b> of the second driving set <b>33</b> rotates backward to allow the screw sleeve <b>333</b> of the second driving set <b>33</b> to move toward the second motor <b>331</b>, the screw sleeve <b>333</b> of the second driving set <b>33</b> drives the leg lifting bracket <b>32</b> to pitch downward.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">With further reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, and <b>9</b></figref>, when rehabilitating or training the waist of the user with the rehabilitation assisting apparatus of the present invention, the first motor <b>241</b> of the waist assisting unit <b>20</b> is controlled to drive the screw <b>242</b> of the first driving set <b>24</b> to rotate forward or backward. Accordingly, the screw sleeve <b>243</b> of the first driving set <b>24</b> is driven by the screw <b>242</b> of the first driving set <b>24</b> to move away from or toward the first motor <b>241</b>. The screw sleeve <b>243</b> of the first driving set <b>24</b> drives the upper rocking plate <b>22</b> to roll back and forth via the linkage module <b>23</b>. That is, the upper rocking plate <b>22</b> rolls relative to the mounting frame <b>11</b>. Since the user lies above the mounting frame <b>11</b> with the user's buttocks placing on the upper rocking plate <b>22</b>, the waist of the user can be rehabilitated or trained by rolling the upper rocking plate <b>22</b> back and forth.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">When the rehabilitation assisting apparatus of the present invention is in use, the user can activate only the waist assisting unit <b>20</b>, only the leg assisting units <b>30</b>, or activate both the waist assisting unit <b>20</b> and the leg assisting units <b>30</b> at the same time, so as to form different types of rehabilitation or training.
