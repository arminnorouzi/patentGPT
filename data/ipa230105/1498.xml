Traditional manufacturing aides use secondary equipment/processes to assist in the manufacturing process (i.e. the use of fixtures, ball tacking, additional machining of features, braze stop-off application, etc.). However, when many of these methods are employed secondary processing is required during assembly/manufacturing. These additional steps require more time and effort, and they can introduce unnecessary errors into their assemblies.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, there is still a need in the art for assembly methods and arrangements having improved adaptability. There also is a need in the art for such assemblies and components to be economically viable. The present disclosure addresses these needs.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A method of assembling two tubular members includes depositing a first material on a first member by an additive manufacturing process in a pattern intended to aid in an assembly of the first member and at least a second member and inserting the first member at least partially into the second member, with the first material a guide for insertion. The depositing the first material on the first member by an additive manufacturing process can be done by directed energy deposition.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The first member can include a second material, wherein the second material is different that the first material. Depositing the first material can include deforming a microstructure of an outer surface of the first member by the deposition of the first material on the outer surface of the first member. The deformation does not include melting the outer surface of the first member, the deformation of the outer surface of the first member is less than 0.020 inches deep. The first material can also be removed from the first member.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A braze material can also be deposited on the first member. The braze material can be guided by the first the material by capillary action.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The assembly can include a first member configured to be at least partially inserted into a second member, and an assembly aid additively deposited on an outer surface of the first member configured to allow beginning insertion of the first member into the second member or prevent further insertion past a desired penetration distance of the first member into the second member. A braze material can be placed on the outer surface of the first member. A portion of the braze material can be in contact with the assembly aid.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A second member including an orifice therein can be configured to at least partially receive the first member. The assembly aid is at least partially inserted into a secondary orifice of the second member configured to receive the assembly aid. The orifice and the assembly aid can provide an interference fit or act as a keyway. The assembly aid can include multiple strips elongated in along a primary axis of the first member, wherein the strips are circumferentially spaced about the outer surface of the first member. The multiple strips can includes a first row of strips and a second row of strips, wherein the second row of strips is offset from the first row of strips along the primary axis of the first member. The first row of bands can be offset circumferentially from the second row bands. The assembly aid can include an indicia denoting an insertion direction or an origin of the first member.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">These and other features of the systems and methods of the subject disclosure will become more readily apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the drawings.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The following descriptions should not be considered limiting in any way.

The assembly aid <b>106</b> is conceived to serve multiple purposes. The assembly aid <b>106</b> is configured to allow the insertion of the first member <b>102</b> into the orifice <b>105</b> of the second member <b>104</b> up to a certain point and to prevent further insertion of the first member <b>102</b> past a desired penetration distance (d) to the second member <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an alternate embodiment of the assembly <b>200</b>, herein the first member <b>202</b> which can be inserted into orifice <b>205</b> includes a braze material <b>210</b> in the shape of a ring, however other shapes, such as bands or dots are possible, on the outer surface <b>208</b> of the first member <b>202</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>a </i></figref>shows a cross-sectional view of the assembly <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The assembly aid <b>206</b> is shown backing the braze material <b>210</b>, while the first member <b>202</b> is partially fitted inside the second member <b>204</b> including a gap (w) between an outer surface of the first member <b>202</b> and an inner surface of the second member <b>204</b>. The assembly aid <b>206</b> can be added on in the shape of a ring, or dots by additive manufacturing in order to hold the braze material <b>210</b> in place during assembly to ensure the braze material <b>210</b> remains in contact with the surface of <b>204</b>. A boundary between the assembly aid <b>206</b> and the first member <b>202</b> includes a deformation of the outer surface of the first member <b>202</b>. The deformation is only as deep as 0.020 of an inch.
