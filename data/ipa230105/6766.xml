Technical Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a technique for traffic transmission in a communication system, and more particularly, to a technique for traffic transmission in a communication system, which can redundantly transmit a plurality of packets in combination when a large number of devices transmit the plurality of packets.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">For the processing of rapidly increasing wireless data after the commercialization of the 4th generation (4G) communication system (e.g., Long Term Evolution (LTE) communication system or LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) communication system), the 5th generation (5G) communication system (e.g., new radio (NR) communication system) that uses a frequency band (e.g., a frequency band of 6 GHz or above) higher than that of the 4G communication system as well as a frequency band of the 4G communication system (e.g., a frequency band of 6 GHz or below) is being considered. The NR communication system may support a frequency band of 6 GHz or higher as well as a frequency band of 6 GHz or less, and may support various communication services and scenarios compared to the LTE communication system. For example, usage scenarios of the NR communication system may include enhanced Mobile BroadBand (eMBB), Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication (URLLC), massive Machine Type Communication (mMTC), and the like.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The mMTC and URLLC, which are major service scenarios of the 5th generation mobile communication system, are essential technologies for building factory automation solutions such as ultra-precise motion control of production robots, monitoring and real-time control of production processes using multiple sensors, and detection and control through remote robots. The 5G NR communication system may use a two-step grant-free random access (GFRA) procedure instead of the existing four-step random access procedure for large-scale device access and low-latency transmission. According to the GFRA scheme, a large number of devices can transmit data packets each of which is concatenated with a preamble by preconfiguring radio resources for data transmission. In this case, the radio resources for data that a large number of devices can transmit may be limited. For this reason, the GFRA scheme may be limitedly applied to short-length packet transmission.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In such the 5G NR communication system, as the length of a packet increases, the number of random access attempts by each device may increase. Accordingly, a possibility of collision due to simultaneous access attempts of a large number of devices may further increase. Therefore, when a large number of devices transmit long-length packets, a random access method capable of increasing reliability and reducing latency may be required.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to solve the above-identified problems, exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure are directed to providing a method and an apparatus for traffic transmission in a communication system, which can redundantly transmit a plurality of packets in combination when a large number of devices transmit the plurality of packets.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to a first exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure for achieving the above-described objective, an operation method of a terminal may comprise: receiving, from a base station, an addition value K<sub>N</sub>, information on linear combination coefficient matrices for respective numbers of transport blocks, and configuration information on each linear combination coefficient matrix;

The 5G NR communication system may use a two-step grant-free random access (GFRA) procedure instead of the existing four-step random access procedure for large-scale device access and low-latency transmission. According to the GFRA scheme, a large number of devices can transmit data packets each of which is concatenated with a preamble by preconfiguring radio resources for data transmission. In this case, the radio resources for data that a large number of devices can transmit may be limited. For this reason, the GFRA scheme may be limitedly applied to short-length packet transmission.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a conceptual diagram illustrating a first exemplary embodiment of a data transmission method based on a grant-free random access scheme.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, in a grant-free random access scheme-based data transmission method, a terminal may concatenate a preamble to a packet (i.e., data) and transmit it repeatedly K times. As such, in the grant-free random access scheme-based data transmission method, the terminal may improve reliability by concatenating a preamble to a packet and transmitting it to a base station repeatedly K times. In this case, the reliability may be determined by an error probability of the data and a collision probability of the preamble. In order to reduce the probability of collision of preambles in a process where a large number of terminals simultaneously attempt to access the base station, each terminal may randomly select a preamble sequence for repeated transmissions.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Meanwhile, the terminal may transmit a packet having a length longer than a packet length transmittable in a data radio resource allocated for GFRA transmission. In this case, the terminal may divide the long-length packet into transmittable short-length packets and transmit them to the base station based on the GFRA scheme.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a conceptual diagram illustrating a second exemplary embodiment of a data transmission method based on a grant-free random access scheme.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, in a grant-free random access scheme-based data transmission method, a terminal may divide a long-length packet into M short-length packets.

Accordingly, the terminal may attempt K&#xd7;M random accesses to the base station.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In such the 5G NR communication system, as the length of a packet increases, the number of random access attempts by each device may increase.

The base station may set the addition value K<sub>N </sub>for the terminal through system information or a higher layer message in consideration of a network state, a link quality, and/or the like. In this case, the base station may set K<sub>N </sub>for the terminal to 0 if the link quality is good. When K<sub>N </sub>is set to 0, the terminal may attempt M GFRAs to the base station by using M network coding blocks, which has the same number as the M transport blocks. On the other hand, if the link quality is poor, the base station may set the addition value K<sub>N </sub>having a large value (e.g., 6 or more) for the terminal.

Such a procedure may be briefly described as follows. That is, the terminal may transmit messages (e.g., Msg1 to Msg-(M+K<sub>N</sub>)) each including a preamble and control information, which are generated based on the steps of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b> and <b>15</b></figref>, to the base station. Accordingly, the base station may receive the messages (e.g., Msg1 to Msg-(M+K<sub>N</sub>)) each including a preamble and control information, which are generated based on the steps of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b> and <b>15</b></figref>, from the terminal.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0173">Thereafter, the base station may separate the preamble, the control information, and the coded network coding block from each of the messages (e.g., Msg-1 to Msg-(M+K<sub>N</sub>)). Here, the control information may include a control index based on the control information table of Table 5.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0174">Meanwhile, the base station may restore the transport blocks by using the coded network coding blocks and the control index, the coding table per transport block set of Tables 2 to 4, the control information table of Table 5, and Equation 8. Then, the base station may perform FEC by separating FEC codes from the coded transport blocks. Accordingly, the base station may generate transport blocks from which the FEC codes are separated based on the coded transport blocks. Then, the base station may generate a source block by concatenating the transport blocks with each other.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0175">The exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure may be implemented as program instructions executable by a variety of computers and recorded on a computer readable medium.
