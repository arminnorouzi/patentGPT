invention relates to the field of medical treatment of age-related disease and the prevention or slowing of aging. The invention therefore relates to a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) precursor for use in the treatment and/or prevention of an age-related medical condition in a subject, wherein said NAD precursor is administered in combination with a calorie restriction diet (CRD) and/or a calorie restriction mimetic (CRM). The invention further relates to a pharmaceutical combination comprising a NAD precursor and a CRM.</p><heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Moderate reduction in dietary food intake (also referred to dietary restriction/DR or calorie restriction diet/CRD) is the best proven intervention to increase lifespan across species, including yeast (Wei et al., 2008), <i>Drosophila melanogaster </i>(Grandison et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2008), <i>Caenorhabditis elegans </i>(<i>C. elegans</i>) (Fontana et al., 2010) and some strains of laboratory mice (Mitchell et al., 2016). Mechanistically, it has been shown that reduction in nutrient availability in response to DR induces changes in various signaling pathways that can slow down the aging process and contribute to increases in longevity in model organisms (Collino et al., 2013). The most prominent pathways contributing to lifespan extension in response to DR include (i) the suppression of growth promoting pathways (Kapahi et al., 2004), (ii) the induction of metabolic fitness and mitochondrial function (Zid et al., 2009), and (iii) the activation of repair pathways (Vermeij et al., 2016).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The positive effects of DR on lifespan and/or health-parameters in various species have fueled discussions about the potential use of DR or DR mimicking drugs (such as metformin) to improve health in elderly humans (Barzilai et al., 2016). However, since most of the current knowledge comes from studies where these interventions have been started during early adulthood, little is known about the consequences of such approaches when applied late in life in older individuals. Of note, several key pathways (such as IGF and GH signaling) that are downregulated by DR and contribute to the health and lifespan extending effect of DR, are also downregulated during normal aging and contribute to the development of tissue atrophy (Carter et al., 2002). There is experimental evidence that DR-induced changes in signaling pathways that also occur during normal aging, can negatively impact on aging in model organisms (Benedetto and Gems, 2019; Wilhelm et al., 2017) and in genetic, progeroid mouse models of accelerated aging (Marino et al., 2010).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Together these data suggest that the beneficial effects of DR on health and lifespan extension may depend on the timing of the intervention and could have different outcomes when started in early adulthood vs. later in life. Only a few studies have started to look into this question. In the fruit fly, <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, it was found that DR decreases mortality rates within 2 days after beginning the intervention, independent of the age of the fly when the diet was initiated (Mair et al., 2003). In mice, DR has the potential to reduce cancer incidence and to elongate lifespan when started in middle aged, 12-month old mice (Volk et al., 1994). However, when DR was applied to middle aged mice it only prevented a small fraction (19%) of transcriptome changes that occur during aging of ad libitum fed mice (Lee et al., 2002), whereas when applied to young mice, DR appeared to have a higher potential in preventing age-related changes in gene expression; 29% were completely prevented and 34% partially (Lee et al., 1999). This interpretation is supported by a study showing that DR has a reduced potential to revert aging-associated changes in gene expression in white adipose tissue and to decrease mortality rates, when applied to old mice compared to young mice (Hahn et al., 2019).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It has been postulated that increases in mitochondrial function in response to decreases in nutrient availability by itself contribute to the activation of stress responses that can lead to increases in cellular and organism fitness and lifespan extension (Guarente, 2008). Different mechanisms have been implicated to mediate mitochondria-induced pro-longevity responses, including shifts in NAD+/NADH ratios, which can lead to induction of Sirtuin-signaling (Satoh et al., 2013) or the induction of ROS-dependent hormesis responses (Lee et al., 2010; Zarse et al., 2012). Compositions that affect the concentration of NAD, including for example NAD precursors such as nicotinamide riboside (NR), have been suggested for mitigation of the effects of aging and for improving cell and tissue health, for example of the liver (WO2019/175587A1, WO2017/184885A1, WO2018/170389A1). Furthermore, Dellinger et al. (&#x201c;<i>Repeat dose NRPT </i>(<i>nicotinamide riboside and pterostilbene</i>) <i>increases NAD+ levels in humans safely and sustainably: a randomized, double</i>-<i>blind, placebo</i>-<i>controlled study</i>&#x201d;, NPJ Aging and Mechanisms of Disease, vol. 3, no. 1, 24 Nov. 2017) describe that administration of NR in combination with pterostilbene (a SIRT1 activator) is well tolerated in elderly patients and it was speculated that this combination may have positive effects on blood pressure and liver health, which however, was only a hypothetical thought, not supported by any of the measurements in the publication.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">While experimental evidence supports the concept that mitochondrial responses are an integral part of the metabolic response to changes in nutrient availability (Ito et al., 2012; Snoeck, 2017), it is currently unclear how aging related loss of mitochondrial function may interfere with such responses. Of note, aging-associated mitochondrial dysfunction has been documented across various tissues (Akbari et al., 2019; Balaban et al., 2005; Green et al., 2011; Haas, 2019) and was also demonstrated to impair the functionality of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in aging mice (Ho et al., 2017).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Together, it is currently unclear whether DR has the same potential (which is seen in response to DR treatment started young animals) to improve metabolic fitness, health parameters, and cellular function, when applied late in life to aged animals or humans. Given the current discussion on the use of DR and DR-mimetics for the prevention of age-associated diseases in humans, functional studies on this question are of great importance.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In summary, it has been shown that continuous application/administration of DR and DR-mimetics to young and middle-aged individuals have a positive effect on age-associated functional decreases, such as decreasing cellular function and decreasing organ function, which are associated with age-related medical conditions. DR and DR-mimetics can slow down or prevent such functional decreases. However, recent results indicate that DR and DR-mimetics lose this activity in individuals and cells or such individuals that have passed a certain age, which may be referred to as old individuals. It is unclear, whether such old individuals and/or cells of such old individuals have lost the potential to respond to DR and DR-mimetics, or whether the potential to respond to DR and DR-mimetics can be reactivated in such cells.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In light of the prior art there remains a significant need to provide additional means for enabling treatment and/or prevention of age-related medical condition in a subject that have passed a certain age, such as in old individuals. In particular, there is a need to provide means for making the beneficial effect of DR and DR-mimetics available to old individuals.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In light of the prior art the technical problem underlying the present invention is to provide improved or alternative means for enabling the beneficial effects of DR and DR-mimetics on life span and age-related decreases in cell function and/or organ function, preferably in old or aging subjects.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">This problem is solved by the features of the independent claims. Preferred embodiments of the present invention are provided by the dependent claims.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The invention therefore relates to a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) precursor for use in the treatment and/or prevention of an age-related medical condition in a subject, wherein said NAD precursor is administered in combination with a calorie restriction diet (CRD) and/or a calorie restriction mimetic (CRM).</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention is based on the entirely surprising finding that aging-associated mitochondrial dysfunction abrogates the metabolic plasticity of cells and individuals to respond to changes in nutrient availability, which mediate the beneficial effects of CRD and CRM.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Herein, the terms &#x201c;reduction in dietary food intake&#x201d;, &#x201c;dietary restriction (DR)&#x201d; and &#x201c;calorie restriction diet (CRD)&#x201d; are used synonymously.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">As shown in the examples below, young cells and individuals can adapt to CRD-induced reduction in nutrient availability by activation of mitochondrial metabolism, metabolic stress responses, and/or mitophagy, resulting in improved cellular function, also in vivo. In contrast, old individuals and cells isolated from old individuals fail to enhance mitochondrial function or to activate stress response pathways in response to CRD. Consequently, older individuals typically do not profit form CRD, if CRD is initiated when the individuals have already reached an age considered &#x201c;old&#x201d; in the sense of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">However, it was surprisingly found that the improvement of mitochondrial function by administration of an NAD precursor to old cells and/or old individuals can restore metabolic plasticity in response to CRD, which makes the beneficial effects of CRD and/or CRM available when administration is started in old individuals.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Old individuals lose the potential to respond to CRM and/or CRD, i.e. by undergoing improvements in cellular functions that would lead to an enhancement of organ function and an extension of lifespan of individuals which are constantly exposed to CRM and/CRD from a young age onwards. In contrast to young individuals and their cells, old individuals and their cells have lost the potential to metabolically adapt to CRM and/or CRD, which can be reflected in a stabilization of body weight in response to reduced nutrient availability. This loss in metabolic plasticity in aging individuals is associated with age-related mitochondrial dysfunction. This results in defects in nutrient sensing and defect in the activation of cellular stress response pathways in old individuals and cells of old individuals. However, nutrient sensing and the activation of cellular stress response pathways have been shown to be among the major mechanisms mediating beneficial effects of CRM and/or CRD on disease prevention and lifespan extension.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Surprisingly, it was found that CRD/CRM has the capacity to significantly ameliorate some differences between cells from old and young individuals. However, age-related alterations of NAD dependent biological processes, in particular sirtuin-mediated signaling pathways and proteins indicative of mitochondrial (dys)function, remain unchanged in old cells under administration CRD/CRM. Important mitochondrial enzymes that need NAD or its derivate NADH include enzymes of the &#x201c;tricarboxylic acid cycle&#x201d; and the &#x201c;electron transport chain&#x201d;. The activation of these enzymes leads to a strong increase of oxygene consumption of the young cells, but a failure of the old cells to induce this activity, which can however, fully be rescued by NAD-supplementation. Due to this entirely unexpected finding, it was tested whether provision of an NAD precursor could enable the regulation of NAD dependent biological processes in response to CRD/CRM in cells from old individuals, which was indeed the case.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Accordingly, the combined administration of an NAD precursor and CRM and/or CRD enables the treatment and/or prevention of an age-related medical condition in a subject, also when the subject is an old subject.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In summary, the present invention provides means for treating or preventing the decline in cell function and organ maintenance, which occurs with age. It was known already that CRM and/or CRD can counteract this, for example by inhibiting the age-associated loss of stem cell function and prolonging the life span, and CRM and/or CRD is the best-known intervention today that can achieve an extension of health and life span in different species. However, it was found recently that CRM and/or CRD loses its efficacy when applied in old age. As such, when administration of CRM and/or CRD is initiated in old individuals it is most likely too late and CRM and/or CRD can only marginally affect mortality and the function of cells and in particular stem cells cannot be improved by CRM and/or CRD in old age (Hahn et al. 2019).</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The present invention provides a surprising solution for this problem, as a decrease in mitochondrial function was identified as the cause of the loss of efficacy of CRM and/or CRD in old age. Mitochondrial function is required for metabolic changes and stress responses that are activated by CRM and/or CRD and that lead to a strengthening of stem cell function in young/medium age in response to a reduced diet. However, due to the loss of mitochondrial function, these metabolic changes and stress responses cannot occur in old subjects, which would receive CRM and/or CRD.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In embodiments of the invention, the NAD precursor is nicotinamide riboside (NR). It has not been described until now in the art that administration of an NAD precursor, such as NR, can restore the ability of aged cells and in particular stem cells to activate stress signals in response to CRM and/or CRD by improving mitochondrial function. This completely unexpected finding is one aspect that led to the present invention.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">As shown herein, NAD precursors can restore the efficacy of CRM and/or CRD in old individuals and cells of such individuals, leading in particular to an improved stem cell function and overall health, and to an extended lifespan. The examples provided herein demonstrate that the claimed combination of CRM and/or CRD and an NAD precursor is particularly promising to improve stem cell function and health, also if administration/application is only started at a relatively old age.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In preferred embodiments of the invention, the CRM is a non-chemical CRM, such as preferably a fasting mimicking diet product, bariatric surgery or exercise. It is particularly preferred in the context of the invention to combine administration of an NAD precursor with a meal kit or a prepackaged meal providing an CRD or mimicking the effects of a CRD. In the context of the invention, such meal kits or prepackaged meals can be regarded as a CRD or a non-chemical CRM. It was entirely unexpected that a CRD or a non-chemical CRM can achieve a synergistic effect when administered/provided in combination with an NAD precursor. As shown herein, administration of an NAD precursor restores the ability of an older individual, such as a human subject that is over 40 years old to benefit and profit from a CRD or non-chemical CRM only when the intervention is combined with NAD precursor supplementation. Only this combined application is lifespan extending. The necessity of combining these two interventions (CRD/CRM plus NAD precursor application) to achieve health benefits in older individuals was completely unknown.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In embodiments of the invention, the CRM is a fasting mimicking diet product. The use of fasting mimicking diet products can be beneficial in the context of the present invention, since CRD may be difficult to maintain for long periods, in particular in humans from western countries, and therefore a CRM product is often associated with an improved compliance of the subject in comparison to a CRD.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Instead, by using a fasting mimicking diet product, such as a kit providing specific food and beverages, such as a (therapeutic) meal package for use in providing meals to a subject, it is more likely that the subject continuously maintains the treatment regime. Such packages for providing foods and beverages in a prepacked form in order to provide a fasting mimicking diet are known in the art, such as the products described in WO 2014/127000 and WO 2009/132320, their content, and that of their US counterparts, is incorporated by reference.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In further embodiments, the CRM is a chemical compound/drug, preferably selected from the group consisting of resveratrol, metformin, oxaloacetate, rimonabant, lipoic acid, 2-deoxy-D-glucose and rapamycin or other TOR (Target of Rapamycin)&#x2014;inhibitors. The use of compounds or drugs that function as CRM is advantageous in the context of the present invention, since the subject may not have to change its diet habit at all but instead can be treated with an NAD precursor and a CRM compound/drug in order to achieve the effect of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In preferred embodiments of the invention, the NAD-precursor is administered in combination with a CRD, a non-chemical CRM and/or a mitochondria stress-inducing CRM.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In preferred embodiments of the invention, the NAD-precursor is administered in combination with a CRD and/or a mitochondria stress-inducing CRM.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In preferred embodiments of the invention, the NAD-precursor is administered in combination a mitochondria stress-inducing CRM.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Preferably, the mitochondria stress-inducing CRM is a CRM that mainly acts through AMPK activation. Preferably, the mitochondria stress-inducing CRM is mediating mitochondria stress, for example inhibition of mitochondrial complexes, for example complex I, through AMPK, whereas the effect of such CRMs on Sirtuin signaling or induction of autophagy is rather indirect. Examples of mitochondria stress-inducing CRM include metformin, 2-deoxy-D-glucose, oxaloacetate and rimonabant. Preferred examples include metformin, 2-deoxy-D-glucose, oxaloacetate, wherein metformin is particularly preferred. Surprisingly, it could be shown that NAD precursor supplementation in combination with the subclass of mitochondria stress-inducing CRMs has strong synergistic effects on the induction of mitochondrial activity, which in turn leads to the induction of stress signals that improve health in aging. This is a surprising advantage of these specific CRMs, that can also be observed in response to CRD. It appears that activation of Sirtuin signaling or induction of autophagy by chemical compounds does not induce this synergistic effect.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">CRM and/or CRD activate metabolic activity and stress responses in cells isolated from young individuals, such as hematopoietic stem cells, leading to an improved hematopoiesis. However, this ability to respond to CRM/CRD is lost with age. However, it was unexpectedly found that impaired ability to respond to CRM/CRD in aged individuals is due to a loss in mitochondria function and that the reactivation of mitochondrial function by administration of an NAD precursor, is sufficient to restore the ability of cells of old individuals to respond to CRM and/or CRD.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In embodiments of the invention, the age-related medical condition is an aging-associated disease. In further embodiments, the age-related medical condition is an aging-associated dysfunction.

However, administration of an NAD precursor reactivates mitochondrial functions that decline with age and make old and middle-aged individuals susceptible to the benefits of CRM and/or CRD.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The invention further relates to a NAD precursor for use in combination with CRD and/or CRM as disclosed herein, wherein the CRD and/or CRM promote metabolic plasticity, mitochondrial metabolism and/or metabolic stress responses.

NAD is found in all living cells and is called a dinucleotide because it consists of two nucleotides joined through their phosphate groups. One nucleotide contains an adenine nucleobase and the other nicotinamide. NAD exists in two forms: an oxidized and reduced form, abbreviated as NAD+ and NADH respectively. In metabolism, NAD is involved in redox reactions, carrying electrons from one reaction to another. The cofactor is, therefore, found in two forms in cells: NAD+ is an oxidizing agent&#x2014;it accepts electrons from other molecules and becomes reduced. This reaction forms NADH, which can then be used as a reducing agent to donate electrons. These electron transfer reactions are the main function of NAD. However, it is also used in other cellular processes, most notably a substrate of enzymes that add or remove chemical groups from proteins, in posttranslational modifications. Because of the importance of these functions, the enzymes involved in NAD metabolism are targets for drug discovery. NAD+ is synthesized through two metabolic pathways. It is produced either in a de novo pathway from amino acids or in salvage pathways by recycling preformed components such as nicotinamide back to NAD+.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0057">As used herein, the term &#x201c;NAD precursor&#x201d; comprises, without limitation, nicotinic acid (NA), nicotinamide riboside (NR), nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) and nicotinamide (Nam), and derivatives thereof.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0058">Eukaryotes can synthesize NAD+de novo via the kynurenine pathway from tryptophan (Krehl, et al. Science (1945) 101:489-490; Schutz and Feigelson, J Biol. Chem. (1972) 247:5327-5332) and niacin supplementation prevents the pellagra that can occur in populations with a tryptophan-poor diet. It is well-established that nicotinic acid is phosphoribosylated to nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN), which is then adenylylated to form nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NaAD), which in turn is amidated to form NAD+(Preiss and Handler, J Biol. Chem. (1958) 233:488-492; Ibid., 493-50). Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (&#x201c;NAD+&#x201d;) is an enzyme co-factor that is essential for the function of several enzymes related to reduction-oxidation reactions and energy metabolism. (Katrina L. Bogan &#x26; Charles Brenner, Nicotinic Acid, Nicotinamide, ami Nicotinamide Riboside: A Molecular Evaluation of NAD+ Precursor Vitamins in Nutritions, 28 Annual Review of Nutrition 115 (2008)). NAD functions as an electron carrier in cell metabolism of amino acids, fatty acids, and carbohydrates. (Bogan &#x26; Brenner 2008). NAD<sup>+</sup> serves as an activator and substrate for sirtuins, a family of protein deacetylases that have been implicated in metabolic function and extended lifespan in lower organisms, (Laurent Mouchiroud et al., The NAD<sup>+</sup>/Sirtuin Pathway Modulates Longevity through Activation of Mitochondrial UPR and FOXO Signaling, 154 Cell 430 (2013)). The co-enzymatic activity of NAD<sup>+</sup>, together with the tight regulation of its biosynthesis and bioavailability, makes it an important metabolic monitoring system that is clearly involved in the aging process. Once converted intracellularly to NAD(P)<sup>+</sup>, vitamin B3 is used as a co-substrate in two types of intracellular modifications, which control numerous essential signaling events (adenosine diphosphate ribosylation and deacetylation), and is a cofactor for over 400 reduction-oxidation enzymes, thus controlling metabolism. This is demonstrated by a range of metabolic endpoints including the deacetylation of key regulatory proteins, increased mitochondrial activity, and oxygen consumption. Critically, the NAD(P)(H)-cofactor family can promote mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular impairment if present in sub-optimal intracellular concentrations. Vitamin B3 deficiency yields to evidenced compromised cellular activity through NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion, and the beneficial effect of additional NAD<sup>+</sup> bioavailability through nicotinic acid (&#x201c;NA&#x201d;), nicotinamide (&#x201c;Nam&#x201d;), and nicotinamide riboside (&#x201c;NR&#x201d;) supplementation is primarily observed in cells and tissues where metabolism and mitochondrial function had been compromised.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0059">The bulk of intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> is believed to be regenerated via the effective salvage of nicotinamide (&#x201c;Nam&#x201d;) while de novo NAD<sup>+</sup> is obtained from tryptophan. (Anthony Rongvaux et al., Reconstructing eukaryotic NAD metabolism, 25 BioEssays 683 (2003)). Crucially, these salvage and de novo pathways apparently depend on the functional forms of vitamins BI, B2, and B6 to generate NAD<sup>+</sup> via a phosphoriboside pyrophosphate intermediate. Nicotinamide riboside (&#x201c;NR&#x201d;) is the only form of vitamin B3 from which NAD<sup>+</sup> can be generated in a manner independent of vitamins BI, B2, and B6, and the salvage pathway using nicotinamide riboside (&#x201c;NR.&#x201d;) for the production of NAD is expressed in most eukaryotes. The main NAD+ precursors that feed the salvage pathways are Nam and NR. (Bogan &#x26; Brenner 2008). Studies have shown that NR is used in a conserved salvage pathway that leads to NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis through the formation of nicotinamide mononucleotide (&#x201c;NMN&#x201d;). Upon entry into the cell, NR is phosphorylated by the NR kinases (&#x201c;NRKs&#x201d;), generating NMN, which is then coverted to NAD+ by nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (&#x201c;NMN AT&#x201d;), (Bogan &#x26; Brenner 2008). Because NMN is the only metabolite that can be converted to NAD in mitochondria, nicotinamide (&#x201c;Nam&#x201d;) and nicotinamide riboside (&#x201c;NR&#x201d;) are the two candidate NAD+ precursors that can replenish NAD+ and thus improve mitochondrial fuel oxidation. A key difference is that nicotinamide riboside (&#x201c;NR&#x201d;) has a direct two-step pathway to NAD synthesis that bypasses the rate-limiting step of the salvage pathway, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (&#x201c;NAMPT&#x201d;).

Calorie restriction is typically adopted intentionally to reduce body weight. In embodiments, CRD relates to a diet that reduces the intake of energy from food and beverages via the diet by 10-50%, preferably 15-45, 20-40, 25-35 or about 30% compared to an ad libitum diet. In embodiments, the term refers to a diet that reduces the intake of energy from food and beverages via the diet by 10-50%, preferably 15-45, 20-40, 25-35 or about 30% compared to an average person of similar body type. In further embodiments, CRD relates to a diet that reduces the intake of energy from food and beverages via the diet by 10-50%, preferably 15-45, 20-40, 25-35 or about 30% compared to recommended dietary guidelines, such as those released by the US Department of Health and Human Services or the Guidelines of the ACC/AHA (&#x201c;2019 <i>ACC/AHA Guideline on the Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease&#x201d;. Circulation. </i>140 (11): e596-e646).</p><p id="p-0070" num="0068">In embodiments, a CRD only restricts certain aspects or components of a usual diet, wherein the amounts of calories are not necessarily reduced in such a CRD. Accordingly, CRD comprises dietary regimes that reduce or restrict the consumption of certain components of a standard diet. This includes a reduced provision of calories, but may also relate to a reduction of, for example, carbohydrates, in particular food sugar, proteins, specific amino-acids (such as metformin), or fat, which may be associated with a reduction of calories or not.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0069">CRD preferably refers to a reduction of the average daily caloric intake. CRD has been shown to prolong the lifespan of experimental animal models such as nematodes, flies, and mice and delays the progression of diverse age-related changes, dysfunctions and diseases. CR not only extends the lifespan of a wide range of animals, but also protects against many aging-related diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer and neurodegeneration in rodents. More importantly, studies with rhesus monkeys indicate that long-term CR also decreases aging-related mortality and diseases in non-human primates. Cellular pathways and mechanism that are affected by CRD include AMPK, mTOR, Sirtuins and ROS and systems involved in the redox balance of cells.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0070">As used herein, the term calorie restriction mimetic (CRM) relates to methods, products or compounds that reproduce the effect of CRD without limiting the amount of food. As used herein, the term calorie restriction mimetic (CRM) may also be termed dietary restriction mimetic. CRMs exhibit the systemic effects of CRD and may include not only drugs or chemical compounds but also methods such as bariatric surgery or exercise and products, such as fasting mimicking diet products. Accordingly, the term CRM comprises different categories of CRMs, in particular CRMs that are based on chemical compounds or drugs on the one hand, and non-chemical CRMs including fasting mimicking diet products in form of kits or prepacked meal packages and further measures such as bariatric surgery and exercise on the other hand. It is evident that fasting mimicking diet products may also be classified as a CRD, since such meal packages provide a specific diet.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0071">Furthermore, CRMs of the invention, and in particular CRMs based on chemical compounds or drugs, comprise downstream and upstream CRMs. Various CRM are known in the art and a skilled person is able to identify CRMs for use in the context of the present invention, as review by Shintani et al (Nutrients. 2018 December; 10(12): 1821).</p><p id="p-0074" num="0072">As used herein, the term calorie restriction mimetics (CRM), also known as energy restriction mimetics, can refer to a hypothetical class of dietary supplements or drug candidates that would, in principle, mimic the substantial anti-aging effects that calorie restriction diet (CRD) has on many laboratory animals and humans. CRD may be defined as a reduction in calorie intake of 20% (mild CR) to 50% (severe CR) without incurring malnutrition or a reduction in essential nutrients. An effective CRM can alter the key metabolic pathways involved in the effects of CRD itself, leading to preserved youthful health and longer lifespan without the need to reduce food intake. A number of genes and pathways have been shown to be involved the actions of CRD in model organisms and these represent attractive targets for drug discovery and for developing CRM. CRD and its metabolic effects and the affected pathways as well as potential CRM are known to the skilled person, as is evident from the review article by Nikolai et al (<i>Energy restriction and potential energy restriction mimetics</i>.

Such packages for providing foods and beverages, for example in a prepacked form, provide a fasting mimicking diet. In the context of the invention, it can be understood that such kits and meal packages are comprised by both the term CRD and the term CRM. The diet provided by such products may be a reduced diet or a diet that has similar effects as a reduced diet due to its specific composition. Fasting mimicking diet products are known and can be identified by the skilled person, for example as described in WO 2014/127000 A2 and WO 2009/132320 A2.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0074">In embodiments, a CRM of the invention is or comprises a chemical compound or a drug. A CRM of the invention can be selected from the group comprising resveratrol, metformin, oxaloacetate, rimonabant, lipoic acid, 2-deoxy-D-glucose and rapamycin. In embodiments, a CRM of the invention can be selected from the group consisting of resveratrol, metformin, oxaloacetate, rimonabant, lipoic acid, 2-deoxy-D-glucose and rapamycin.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0075">Downstream-type CRMs act on an intracellular signaling system and exert the same effect as CRD on downstream pathways, such as activation of the AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase), inhibition of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), activation of Sirtuins, and modifying the redox balance. Examples of downstream-type CRMs include, without limitation, Metformin (antidiabetic drug; AMPK activation), Rapamycin (immunosuppressant drug; mTOR inhibition), Resveratrol (food component; Sirtuin activation), Polyamines (food component; Epigenetic control) and Oxaloacetic acid (dietary supplement; Redox balance).</p><p id="p-0078" num="0076">In contrast, an upstream-type CRM uses a mechanism of action targeting the energy metabolism system and transmitting a signal in the upstream direction to mimic CR, such as, without limitation, Chitosan (dietary supplement; Glucose diminution), Acarbose (antidiabetic drug; Glycosidase inhibition), 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (anticancer drug; Glycolysis inhibition), D-Glucosamine (dietary supplement; Glycolysis adjustment), D-Allulose (food component; Glycolysis improvement), SGLT2 inhibitor (antidiabetic drug; Glucose excretion). Upstream-type CRMs could be classified as compounds with energy metabolism inhibition effects, particularly glucose metabolism modulation effects. It can be difficult to strictly classify all CRMs as belonging to either type.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0077">In embodiments, the CRM of the invention is or comprises metformin. Metformin is a drug for treating diabetes and is recommended as the first-line drug for type 2 diabetes in the guidelines of the American Diabetes Association and European Association for the Study of Diabetes. It currently is also being tested whether Metformin could also improve health in non-diabetic elderly people and the preliminary results indicate that metformin alone cannot trigger mitochondrial activation ion older organisms, which indicates that the therapy would not be effective in triggering health promoting stress response in the elderly. Instead, the combination of metformin with NAD-precursor supplementation has a very strong capacity to induce mitochondria activity in old individuals and thus has the potential to activate health benefits by inducing health-promoting stress responses. At least some of the effects of metformin are mediated by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Metformin transiently inhibits the mitochondrial respiratory chain (specifically, complex I), increases the intracellular AMP/ATP ratio, and activates AMPK. AMPK generally promotes catabolic reactions that produce ATP and suppresses anabolic reactions that consume ATP. Due to its ability to induce mitochondria stress, in particular through induction of AMPK signaling, metformin can be classified as a mitochondria stress-inducing CRM. In the liver, gluconeogenesis and fatty acid synthesis are suppressed, while &#x3b2;-oxidation is promoted. In the skeletal muscles and adipose tissue, AMPK promotes the translocation of glucose transporter type 4 to the cell membrane and stimulates sugar uptake. Although the mechanism is unknown, suppression of sugar absorption from the intestinal tract may contribute to the hypoglycemic effects of metformin. Administration of metformin to experimental animals results in different effects depending on the animal species. In the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, metformin slowed the accumulation of lipofuscin, extended the median lifespan, and prolonged a youthful locomotory ability in a dose-dependent manner. It was also shown in <i>C. elegans </i>that metformin may prolong the lifespan through a mitochondrial process and that the production of metformin-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced a signaling cascade that increased the overall lifespan. In <i>C. elegans</i>, both target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) inhibition and AMPK activation contributed to the lifespan-extending effect of metformin. Genetic screening of <i>C. elegans </i>revealed that metformin was inactivated by inactivation of TORC1, a mechanism conserved from invertebrates to humans. In <i>Drosophila</i>, administration of metformin caused activation of AMPK and reduced the weight of adipose tissue. In C57BL/6 mice and in <i>C. elegans </i>administration of metformin resulted in an increased survival rate.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0078">In embodiments, the CRM of the invention is or comprises rapamycin. Rapamycin (International Nonproprietary Name: sirolimus) is a macrolide compound produced by <i>Streptomyces hygroscopicus </i>and is the most widely used inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Rapamycin exerts substantial regulatory effects on important biological processes such as proliferation and inflammation. Due to its ability to inhibit immune responses, rapamycin has been used clinically to prevent transplant rejection and treat autoimmune diseases. Rapamycin inhibits interleukin-2 signaling and other cytokine-receptor-dependent signaling pathways by acting on mTOR and prevents the activation of T and B cells. Its mechanism of action, which is similar to that of tacrolimus, involves binding to the cytoplasmic protein FK-binding protein 12 (FKBP12). However, unlike the tacrolimus-FKBP12 complex which inhibits calcineurin (also known as protein phosphatase 2B), the rapamycin-FKBP12 complex inhibits the mTOR pathway by binding directly to mTOR complex 1.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0079">It was shown that that the mean lifespan of nematodes can be increased by treatment with rapamycin. The mTOR pathway, along with sirtuin family proteins and the insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling pathway, is an important pathway that regulates lifespan, which can be targeted by CRMs of the present invention. In a <i>Drosophila </i>sod1 (superoxide dismutase 1 gene) mutant, rapamycin extends the average lifespan by 6% in males and 26% in females maintained on standard feed. Similarly, rapamycin promotes survival in a <i>Drosophila </i>model of a mitochondrial disease. Furthermore, rapamycin prolongs the lifespan of mature mice by 28-38% compared to control animals. Mature mice are about 20-months old, corresponding to approximately 60 years of age in humans, suggesting that rapamycin can extend life expectancy in already aged humans. It was also shown that three months of rapamycin treatment in middle-aged mice increased the average lifespan by 60%, improving the health status of middle-aged and elderly mice. Low-dose rapamycin also extends the lifespan of mouse models with mitochondrial disorders. Additionally, it was shown that rapamycin treatment has a beneficial effect on the arterial function of old mice, and these improvements are associated with decreased expression of proteins involved in oxidative stress, and cell cycle control. It was also shown that rapamycin has beneficial effects on neoplastic diseases, delayed multiple aspects of mouse aging, and extended longevity.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0080">In embodiments, the CRM of the invention is or comprises resveratrol. Resveratrol is a natural polyphenolic phytoalexin mainly present in the skin of grapes and in red wine. This polyphenol has been most thoroughly studied as a compound that activates sirtuin 1 or its invertebrate homologs and is known to protect living organisms against ROS and was shown to exert its antioxidant effects by activating SIRT2 to deacetylate peroxiredoxin 1. Resveratrol has been reported to prolong the lifespan of several different species. For example, treating <i>C. elegans </i>with resveratrol prolongs its lifespan via a mechanism SIR-2.1 dependent mechanism. For example, resveratrol prolongs the lifespan of <i>C. elegans </i>in vivo under oxidative stress. Also, it was shown that at a concentration of 400 &#x3bc;M, resveratrol extended the lifespan of female <i>Drosophila </i>fed a high-fat diet by 10%-15%. Also, extension effects on the mean lifespan were observed when resveratrol was administered to obese mice induced by a high-fat diet. Resveratrol also preserved indices of vascular function in normal rats, although without extending the lifespan. Furthermore, in clinical studies, intake of resveratrol improved the memory capacity of elderly subjects and improved the blood lipid levels and glucose control in obese and adult diabetic subjects. Furthermore, it was observed that resveratrol improved vascular function, particularly in elderly people. Pterostilbene, a naturally occurring analog of resveratrol, has been suggested to function as a Sirtuin activator.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0081">In embodiments, the CRM of the invention is or comprises polyamines. It is known that polyamine production by gut bacteria promotes longevity in mice. A preferred polyamine is spermidine, which has been shown to prolong life of the lifespan of yeasts, worms, flies and mice, even in middle-aged mice. Polyamines such as spermidine enhance autophagy leading to reduction of oxidative stress in these models and mice. Polyamines and in particular spermidine are cardioprotective and neuroprotective and stimulate anticancer immune surveillance. In humans, consumption of polyamines in food is correlated with reduced cardiovascular- and cancer-related mortality.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0082">A further preferred CRM of the invention is oxaloacetic acid. Oxaloacetic acid is an intermediate of the Kreb's cycle and is related to Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) levels and redox balance in cells. In <i>C. elegans</i>, oxaloacetic acid prolongs the lifespan independently of sirtuin but this effect depends on AMPK. In humans, a decrease of blood glucose levels can be observed following administration of oxaloacetic acid. Due to its ability to induce mitochondria stress, in particular through induction of AMPK signaling, oxaloacetic acid can be classified as a mitochondria stress-inducing CRM.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0083">In embodiments, the CRM of the invention is or comprises 2-Deoxy-D-Glucose (2DG). 2DG is a glucose derivative in which the 2-hydroxyl group is replaced by a hydrogen atom. 2DG is not metabolized via glycolysis and was the first proposed dietary restriction mimetic. It is thought to delay age-related dysfunctions and extend the lifespan by suppressing glycolytic activity. 2DG has been suggested to prolong lifespan through &#x201c;mitochondrial hormesis&#x201d; or &#x201c;mitohormesis&#x201d;, which is a concept proposing that induction of mitochondrial metabolism may induce a positive response to increased formation of ROS and other related stressors, leading to a secondary (i.e., hermetic) increase in stress defense, resulting in reduced net stress levels. Reduction of glycolysis by 2DG induces the utilization of stored fat and mitochondrial respiration via AMPK. Due to its ability to induce mitochondria stress, in particular through induction of AMPK signaling, 2DG can be classified as a mitochondria stress-inducing CRM. 2DG has been used in many studies focused on the impact of reduced metabolic rates and showed great potential as a CRM. For example, in a study comparing the effects of 2DG and CR in rodents, 2DG administration showed the same effects on locomotory activity, heart rate, and blood pressure as CR administration. In summary, 2DG shows very similar effects as CR.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0084">Rimonabant (Acomplia) is another CRM of the present invention. It is an anti-obesity drug approved for use in the European Union. This is an endocannabinoid-1 receptor blocker. Endocannabinoids are <i>cannabis</i>-like chemicals that stimulate appetite and also regulate energy balance. Overstimulation of the endocannabinoid receptor in the hypothalamus promotes appetite and stimulates lipogenesis. It also blocks the beneficial actions of adiponectin. Rimonabant inhibits these and so it reduces appetite, balances energy, and increases adiponectin, which reduces intra-abdominal fat. It improves lipid profile, glucose tolerance, and waist measurement. Therefore, it has similar effects as CR. Consequently, rimonabant acts similarly to CRD and is an inducer of mitochondrial stress, and can therefore be categorized as a mitochondria stress-inducing CRM in the sense of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0085">In preferred embodiments, the present invention relates to the combined administration of a NAD-precursor together with CRM that act as mitochondria stress-inducing CRMs, such as metformin, metformin, 2-deoxy-D-glucose, oxaloacetate, rimonabant. Particularly preferred are mitochondria stress-inducing CRMs that mainly act through the activation of AMPK signaling, including in particular metformin, 2-deoxy-D-glucose, and oxaloacetate. Such mitochondria stress-inducing CRMs can be differentiated from CRMs that are acting mainly through activation of Sirtuin signaling and/or through induction of autophagy, such as pterostilbene, resveratrol and spermidine. In embodiments, the CRMs of the invention are CRMs that induce mitochondria stress and preferably act through AMPK signaling on mitochondria function, whereas preferably Sirtuin signaling and/or induction of autophagy are not affected or not strongly affected.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0086">Lipoic Acid (&#x3b1;-Lipoic Acid, Alpha Lipoic Acid, or ALA) is another CRM in the sense of the present invention. Further CRM of the present invention comprise, without limitation, acarbose, D-glucosamine, D-allulose, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, chitosan, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma inhibitors, agents that modulate sirtuins (called STAC-sirtuin-activating compounds), for example fisetin, Exanadin (exenatide), Adiponectin, Acipimox, Hydroxycitrate, Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, lodoacetate, Mannoheptulose (glycolytic inhibitor), modulators of neuropeptide Y (NPY), 4-Phenylbutyrate (PBA), and Gymnemoside (modulates glucose absorption).</p><p id="p-0089" num="0087">Metabolic Plasticity and Mitochondrial Metabolism</p><p id="p-0090" num="0088">In embodiments of the invention, CRD and/or CRM promote metabolic plasticity and/or metabolic stress responses by induction of mitochondrial metabolism. In further embodiments, NAD precursor enhances and/or restores the ability of cells of a middle-aged or old individual to respond to CRD and/or CRM. In embodiments, the NAD precursor restores mitochondrial functions of cells of old or middle-aged individuals, which have already been impaired or declined due to aging in comparison to its previous function. In embodiments, the NAD precursor enhances and/or restores a therapeutic response of a human subject, more preferably a subject over 40 years old, to CRD and/or CRM administration, by increasing mitochondrial function and the responsiveness of mitochondria to increase activity in response to CRD and/or CMD.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0089">As used herein, the term metabolic plasticity refers to the ability of subjects, organisms or cells to switch or adapting its metabolism in response to changes in nutrient availability, such as in response to CRD and/or CRM.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0090">In general, metabolism is the set of life-sustaining chemical reactions in organisms. The three main purposes of metabolism are the conversion of food to energy to run cellular processes; the conversion of food/fuel to building blocks for proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and some carbohydrates; and the elimination of nitrogenous wastes. These enzyme-catalyzed reactions allow organisms to grow and reproduce, maintain their structures, and respond to their environments. Metabolic reactions may be categorized as catabolic&#x2014;the breaking down of compounds (for example, the breaking down of glucose to pyruvate by cellular respiration); or anabolic&#x2014;the building up (synthesis) of compounds (such as proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids). Usually, catabolism releases energy, and anabolism consumes energy. The chemical reactions of metabolism are organized into metabolic pathways, in which one chemical is transformed through a series of steps into another chemical, each step being facilitated by a specific enzyme. Enzymes are crucial for metabolism because they allow organisms to drive desirable reactions that require energy that will not occur by themselves, by coupling them to spontaneous reactions that release energy. Enzymes act as catalysts&#x2014;they allow a reaction to proceed more rapidly&#x2014;and they also allow the regulation of the rate of a metabolic reaction, for example in response to changes in the cell's environment or to signals from other cells.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0091">Cellular respiration is a set of metabolic reactions and processes that take place in the cells of organisms to convert biochemical energy from nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and then release waste products. The reactions involved in respiration are catabolic reactions, which break large molecules into smaller ones, releasing energy in the process, as weak so-called &#x201c;high-energy&#x201d; bonds are replaced by stronger bonds in the products. Respiration is one of the key ways a cell releases chemical energy to fuel cellular activity. Cellular respiration is considered an exothermic redox reaction which releases heat. The overall reaction occurs in a series of biochemical steps, most of which are redox reactions themselves. Although cellular respiration is technically a combustion reaction, it clearly does not resemble one when it occurs in a living cell because of the slow release of energy from the series of reactions. Nutrients that are commonly used by animal and plant cells in respiration include sugar, amino acids and fatty acids, and the most common oxidizing agent (electron acceptor) is molecular oxygen (O2). The chemical energy stored in ATP (its third phosphate group is weakly bonded to the rest of the molecule and is cheaply broken allowing stronger bonds to form, thereby transferring energy for use by the cell) can then be used to drive processes requiring energy, including biosynthesis, locomotion or transportation of molecules across cell membranes.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0092">Aerobic respiration requires oxygen (O2) in order to create ATP. Although carbohydrates, fats, and proteins are consumed as reactants, it is the preferred method of pyruvate breakdown in glycolysis and requires that pyruvate enter the mitochondria in order to be fully oxidized by the Krebs cycle. The products of this process are carbon dioxide and water, but the energy transferred is used to break bonds in ADP as the third phosphate group is added to form ATP (adenosine triphosphate), by substrate-level phosphorylation, NADH and FADH2. The potential of NADH and FADH2 is converted to more ATP through an electron transport chain with oxygen as the &#x201c;terminal electron acceptor&#x201d;. Most of the ATP produced by aerobic cellular respiration is made by oxidative phosphorylation. This works by the energy released in the consumption of pyruvate being used to create a chemiosmotic potential by pumping protons across a membrane. This potential is then used to drive ATP synthase and produce ATP from ADP and a phosphate group.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0093">In the context of the present invention, metabolic plasticity in particular relates to the process of energy transformation and the ability to switch or adapting between different mechanism of energy transformation, in particular, the switching between oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis. Metabolic plasticity can be assessed by measuring responses of cells or organisms to for example changes in nutrient availability or exposure to other stimuli. For example, the body weight of a subject can be monitored in response to changed nutrient availability. Furthermore, the oxygen consumption and/or the extracellular acidification rate of cells can be assessed in order to determine the contribution of mitochondrial respiration/oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis to the metabolism of a cell. This can be done by using the so-called Seahorse-technology of Agilent or other techniques know to the skilled person for measuring oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis in cells and the rate or ratio of the respective pathways. Furthermore, metabolic plasticity can be determined by measuring certain molecules participating in specific metabolic processes, such as lactate or pyruvate, or activity or expression of enzymes participating in specific metabolic pathways or processes, such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) or pyruvate dehydrogenase A and B (PDHA1 and PDHB).</p><p id="p-0096" num="0094">In embodiments, the term metabolic plasticity refers to the ability of an individual to metabolically adapt to a to a change in diet, in particular to a change of its diet to CRD, in order to increase metabolic efficiency of cells, to stabilize body weight, and to improve the function of stem cells and differentiated cells in response to change availability of nutrients, in particular reduction in nutrient availability. This is a capacity that old individuals tend to lose, which results in a loss of body weight in response to reduction of nutrient availability. Accordingly, metabolic plasticity can be measured by monitoring body weight, mitochondrial respiration, and stem cell function after provision of a CRD.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0095">As used herein, the term &#x201c;mitochondria metabolism&#x201d; relates to the process of mitochondria respiration (oxidative phosphorylation). Mitochondria have a central role in energy metabolism. Part of the free energy derived from the oxidation of food is inside mitochondria transformed to ATP, which depends on oxygen. When oxygen is limited, glycolytic products are metabolized directly in the cytosol by the less efficient anaerobic respiration that is independent of mitochondria. The mitochondrial ATP production relies on the electron transport chain (ETC), composed of respiratory chain complexes I-IV, which transfer electrons in a stepwise fashion until they finally reduce oxygen to form water. The NADH and FADH2 formed in glycolysis, fatty-acid oxidation and the citric acid cycle are energy-rich molecules that donate electrons to the ETC. Electrons move toward compounds with more positive oxidative potentials and the incremental release of energy during the electron transfer is used to pump protons (H+) into the intramembrane space. Complexes I, III and IV function as H+ pumps that are driven by the free energy of coupled oxidation reactions. During the electron transfer, protons are always pumped from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space, resulting in a potential of &#x2dc;150-180 mV. Proton gradient generates a chemiosmotic potential, also known as the proton motive force, which drives the ADP phosphorylation via the ATP synthase (FoF1 ATPase&#x2014;complex V). Fo domain of ATPase couples a proton translocation across the inner mitochondrial membrane with the phosphorylation of ADP to ATP. The rate of mitochondrial respiration depends on the phosphorylation potential expressed as a [ATP]/[ADP] [Pi] ratio across the inner mitochondrial membrane that is regulated by the adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT). In the case of increased cellular energy demand when the phosphorylation potential is decreased and more ADP is available, a respiration rate is increased leading to an increased ATP synthesis. There is usually a tight coupling between the electron transport and the ATP synthesis and an inhibition of ATP synthase will therefore also inhibit the electron transport and cellular respiration. Under certain conditions, protons can re-enter into mitochondrial matrix without contributing to the ATP synthesis and the energy of proton electrochemical gradient will be released as heat. This process, known as proton leak or mitochondrial uncoupling, could be mediated by protonophores (such as FCCP) and uncoupling proteins (UCPs). As a consequence, uncoupling leads to a low ATP production concomitant with high levels of electron transfer and high cellular respiration.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0096">As used herein, an increase in mitochondrial metabolism and an increased mitochondrial function in particular refer to an increased rate of mitochondrial respiration/oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondrial metabolism is an indicator of mitochondrial function and can be analyzed for example by measuring the rate of oxidative phosphorylation, the mitochondrial membrane potential (MtMP), cellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), wherein an increased rate of oxidative phosphorylation, a high mitochondrial membrane potential (MtMP), and low levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are indicative of functional mitochondria and a high or intact mitochondrial metabolism. Also, NADH and NADPH levels can be determined as an indicator of mitochondrial function and metabolism, wherein high levels are indicative of good functionality.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0097">Further indicators of mitochondrial functionality and metabolism are expression levels of genes that are centrally involved in mitochondrial function and biogenesis, which include nuclear and mitochondrial genes, such as Nrf1, Tfam, Nd1, Cytb, Co1 and Atp6, among others known to the skilled person. In contrast, a (concomitant) upregulation of glycolytic enzymes can be indicative of a declining mitochondrial metabolism. Furthermore, high ATP levels are an indicator of intact mitochondrial function and mitochondrial metabolism. A declined of mitochondrial function can be observed by determining the parameters above and comparing them to a previously determined value or other reference values.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0098">Mitochondrial metabolism is the key function of mitochondria to generate ATP, which is needed for a variety of biological processes in cells. This process involves oxidation of Acetly-Coenzyme-A in tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The process converts NAD into NADH, which is then used during oxidative phosphorylation in the electron transport chain (ETC) pathway to synthesize ATP&#x2014;a molecule that stores energy chemically. Mitochondrial metabolism is the main function of mitochondria, which can be activated or reduced. This depends on the energy demand of cells/organism as well as on food availability. If mitochondrial function increases, it means that mitochondrial metabolism becomes more active and more efficient. This leads to an increase in ATP production and to a change in the ration of NAD to NADH, which will lead to induction of metabolic stress response pathways, such as the activation of sirtuins.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0099">In the context of the present invention, the term &#x201c;metabolic stress response&#x201d; relates to the reaction of a cell or organism in response to metabolic stress, such as nutrient deprivation.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0100">Nutrient deprivation is sensed by nutrient sensing pathways and leads to activation or modulation of certain signaling pathways, such as the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and integrated stress response (ISR) pathways. The mTOR signaling pathway controls major growth promoting signals and the pathway is suppressed in response to decreases in nutrient availability. Furthermore, gene regulation of metabolic stress response genes, such as Nrf1 and Hif1&#x3b1;, can be observed. Further metabolic stress response genes are known in the art and can be identified by a skilled person, for example the set of 52 metabolic stress response genes disclosed in the examples provided herein. Biological pathways involved in a metabolic stress response and corresponding genes include, without limitation, autophagy and mitophagy induction (Parkin, Sirt1), cell cycle control (p57), mitochondrial activity and biogenesis (Polg, Ucp2, ldh1, Cox4i1), chromatin remodeling and mtUPR (Sirt7), insulin/Igf signaling (Hmga2, Irs2), and NAD biosynthesis (Naprt, which catalyzes the first step in the biosynthesis of NAD from nicotinic acid), apoptosis, and unfolded protein responses.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0101">In general, metabolic stress is induced when there are changes in nutrient availability, either a lack of nutrients or an overload of the organism with nutrients. In both scenarios the cells and the organism have to adapt in order to either ensures a more efficient usage of nutrients (in case nutrients become limiting) or to store nutrients (in the scenario of a surplus in nutrient availability to ensure saving of nutrient for times of reduced nutrient availability). It has been recognized that the metabolic stress responses that occur in response to a lack of nutrient availability (such as CDR or CMD) increase cellular and organism fitness thereby counteracting aging-associated decreases in cell and organism function.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0102">Therapeutic Application of the Invention</p><p id="p-0105" num="0103">As used herein, the term &#x201c;subject&#x201d; means a human or non-human animal selected for treatment or therapy.

The effect may be prophylactic in view of completely or partially preventing a disease and/or a symptom, for example by reducing the risk of a subject having a particular disease or symptom, or may be therapeutic in view of partially or completely curing a disease and/or adverse effect of the disease. In the present invention, &#x201c;therapy&#x201d; includes arbitrary treatments of diseases or conditions in mammals, in particular, humans, for example, the following treatments (a) to (c): (a) Prevention of onset of a disease, condition or symptom in a patient; (b) Inhibition of a symptom of a condition, that is, prevention of progression of the symptom; (c) Amelioration of a symptom of a condition, that is, induction of regression of the disease or symptom.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0110">Age-Related Medical Conditions</p><p id="p-0113" num="0111">In particular, the treatment described herein relates to either treating or preventing age-related medical conditions, comprising slowing, reversing and/or inhibiting the ageing process, wherein in preferred embodiments mitochondrial function is enhance or reactivated or a decline of mitochondrial function is prevented, preferably by use of an NAD precursor, such as NR, which in turn reinstalls metabolic plasticity, specifically the responsiveness of mitochondrial metabolism and/or metabolic stress responses to be activated by CRD and/or CRM. CDR and CRM are prophylactic treatments in order to prevent or slow down age-related processes is intended to encompass prevention or reduction of risk of developing an age-related condition. However, it was recently recognized that these interventions fail during aging (Hahn et al. 2019). The here described invention solves this problem by identifying that the combination of the NAD-precursor (NR) along with co-application of CRD and/or CRM reactivates metabolic plasticity and the responsiveness of cells and tissues to enhance mitochondrial metabolism and cellular functionality.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0112">As used in the context of the present invention, the term age-related medical condition comprises aging-associated diseases, aging-associated dysfunctions, such as aging-associated organ dysfunctions, and conditions associated with a decline in mitochondrial function.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0113">Age-related medical conditions are changes in the health status of a subject that occur with age due to changes in organ and cell functions that depend on the age of the subject. During aging the incidence of acute and chronic conditions such as neurological disorders, diabetes, degenerative arthritis, and cancer rises within individuals, so that aging has been termed the substrate on which age-associated diseases grow. The invention therefore relates to prophylactic and symptomatic treatment of diseases associated with ageing.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0114">The molecular pathways underlying aging are only partially understood, as large individual heterogeneity of the biological aging process is observed. These inter-individual differences are proposed to derive from accumulation of stochastic damage that is counteracted by genetically encoded and environmentally regulated repair systems. Aging associated mitochondrial dysfunction by itself is thought to contribute to stem cell and tissue aging. The here described inventions identifies a new role for aging associated mitochondrial dysfunction in limiting the potential of CRD and/or CRM to enhance organism fitness and to delay aging by increasing mitochondrial activity and the induction of metabolic stress responses. The invention shows that application of an NAD-precursor in combination CRD and/or CRM has the potential to reinstall the induction of mitochondrial activity and metabolic stress responses in response to CRD and/or CRM. The present invention therefore provides means for the treatment and/or prevention and/or reduction in risk of ageing as such, in addition to age-related medical conditions.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0115">As used herein, an aging associated disease is a disease that is most often seen with increasing frequency with increasing age of the subject or patient. Essentially, aging-associated diseases are complications arising from aging or senescence. &#x201c;Aging-associated disease&#x201d; is used here to mean &#x201c;diseases of the elderly&#x201d;, so diseases incurring with higher frequency in older individuals. Non-exhaustive examples of aging-associated diseases are atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease, cancer, arthritis, cataracts, osteoporosis, type 2 diabetes, hypertension and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. The incidence of such aging associated diseases increases exponentially with age.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0116">The main risk factor of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) is age, which is why cardiovascular disease are considered aging associated disease of the present invention. CVD is a class of diseases that involve the heart or blood vessels. CVD includes coronary artery diseases such as angina and myocardial infarction (heart attack). Other CVDs include, without limitation, stroke, heart failure, hypertensive heart disease, rheumatic heart disease, cardiomyopathy, abnormal heart rhythms, congenital heart disease, valvular heart disease, carditis, aortic aneurysms, peripheral artery disease, thromboembolic disease, and venous thrombosis.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0117">Aging associated diseases of the heart include coronary artery disease, CHD, cardiomyopathy, valvular heart disease, pericardial disease, congenital heart disease (e.g., coarctation, atrial or ventricular septal defects), and heart failure. Diseases of the blood vessels may include arteriosclerosis, atherosclerosis, hypertension, stroke, vascular dementia, aneurysm, peripheral arterial disease, intermittent claudication, vasculitis, venous incompetence, venous thrombosis, varicose veins, and lymphedema.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0118">The term arteriosclerosis relates to an aging associated disease characterized by the pathological thickening, hardening and loss of elasticity of artery walls that can lead to stenosis and subsequent insufficient blood supply of downstream tissues resulting in ischemia. This process is often associated with calcification of the arterial wall. There are different types of arteriosclerosis that affect different anatomical locations and have different etiologies. Atherosclerosis is a specific type of arteriosclerosis, which is defined by the accumulation of white blood cells in the artery wall and formation of atheromatous plaques. Atherosclerosis is a chronic disease that can remain asymptomatic for extended periods until lumen stenosis of the affected artery occurs.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0119">Additionally, ruptures of atherosclerotic lesions can lead to thrombus formation and subsequent thromboembolism, which can lead to tissue necrosis/infarction in all parts of the body. Dramatic examples of such events are myocardial infarction and stroke, these after-effects of atherosclerosis represent the most common cause of death in industrialized countries and therefore improved treatment strategies are urgently needed. Arteriosclerosis according to the present invention refers to, but is not limited to, one or more of, atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis obliterans, and Monckeberg's arteriosclerosis.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0120">Aging associated diseases of the invention comprise in particular circulatory disorders, cardiovascular disease, artery or blood vessel conditions and/or ischemic obstructive or occlusive diseases or conditions refer to states of vascular tissue where blood flow is, or can become, impaired or altered from normal levels. Many pathological conditions can lead to vascular diseases that are associated with alterations in the normal vascular condition of the affected tissues and/or systems. Examples of vascular conditions or vascular diseases to which the methods of the invention apply are those in which the vasculature of the affected tissue or system is senescent or otherwise altered in some way such that blood flow to the tissue or system is reduced or in danger of being reduced or increased above normal levels. It refers to any disorder in any of the various parts of the cardiovascular system, which consists of the heart and all of the blood vessels found throughout the body.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0121">Neurodegenerative disease or neurodegeneration is a term for aging associated medical conditions in which the progressive loss of structure or function of neurons, including death of neurons, occurs. Many neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and Huntington's, occur as a result of neurodegenerative processes. Such diseases are commonly considered to be incurable, resulting in progressive degeneration and/or death of neuron cells. A number of similarities are present in the features of these diseases, linking these diseases on a sub-cellular level. Some of the parallels between different neurodegenerative disorders include atypical protein assembly as well as induced cell death. Dementia is a group of brain diseases causing a gradual decline of cognitive functions. Most of these diseases are chronic neurodegenerative diseases and are associated with neurobehavioral and/or neuropsychiatric symptoms that disable patients to independently perform activities of daily live. Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia with 25 million affected individuals worldwide in the year 2000. This number is expected to increase to 1 14 million cases in 2050, unless preventive or neuroprotective therapy approaches emerge. Dementia according to the present invention refers to, but is not limited to, one or more of, Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, post-stroke dementia, Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, Huntington's disease, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0122">Aging associated diseases comprise diabetes mellitus, which is a group of chronic metabolic diseases that are associated with high blood sugar levels over prolonged periods, which can lead to severe complications including cardiovascular diseases, stroke, kidney failure, foot ulcers and damaged eyes. The two main subtypes are type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Type 1 diabetes mellitus is characterized by the loss of insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. It accounts for about 10% of the diabetes cases in the US and Europe, mostly affects children and is often associated with autoimmune pathologies. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is characterized by insulin resistance. Diabetes mellitus represents a massive health issue with more than 350 million affected people in 2013 worldwide. Diabetes mellitus according to the present invention refers to, but is not limited to, one or more of, type 1 diabetes mellitus, type 2 diabetes mellitus, gestational diabetes, and latent autoimmune diabetes of adults. Autoimmune diseases are a group of diseases that are caused by an abnormal immune response of the body against specific molecules or cells that are normally present in the body and should therefore be tolerated by the immune system under physiological conditions. The pathological reaction of the body's immune system against its own components can lead to severe physical conditions. A large number of diseases have been identified as being caused by autoimmune reactions and many pathologies of unclear etiology are suspected to have autoimmune components and are therefore termed autoimmune-related diseases. Therefore, the development of effective and specific treatment strategies for this group of diseases is urgently needed.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0123">Metabolic syndrome is another example of an aging associated disease of the invention. Metabolic syndrome is a clustering of at least three of the five following medical conditions: central obesity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high serum triglycerides, and low serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Metabolic syndrome is associated with the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. The syndrome is thought to be caused by an underlying disorder of energy utilization and storage, including dysfunction of mitochondrial metabolism. The continuous provision of energy via dietary carbohydrate, lipid, and protein fuels, unmatched by physical activity/energy demand creates a backlog of the products of mitochondrial oxidation, a process associated with progressive mitochondrial dysfunction and insulin resistance.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0124">Further aging associated disease of the invention comprise disease of the liver and the kidney, such as liver failure, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), chronic kidney disease, acute kidney injury, kidney failure.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0125">Aging associated diseases also comprise neuropathy, often also referred to as peripheral neuropathy. Neuropathy is a disease affecting the peripheral nerves, meaning nerves beyond the brain and spinal cord. Damage to peripheral nerves may impair sensation, movement, gland or organ function depending on which nerves are affected; in other words, neuropathy affecting motor, sensory, or autonomic nerves result in different symptoms. More than one type of nerve may be affected simultaneously. Peripheral neuropathy may be acute (with sudden onset, rapid progress) or chronic (symptoms begin subtly and progress slowly), and may be reversible or permanent.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0126">Muscle atrophy is another aging associated disease of the invention. It is characterized by the loss of skeletal muscle mass that can be caused by immobility, aging, malnutrition, medications, or a wide range of injuries or diseases that impact the musculoskeletal or nervous system. Sarcopenia is the muscle atrophy associated with aging and can be slowed by exercise. Finally, diseases of the muscles such as muscular dystrophy or myopathies can cause atrophy, as well as damage to the nervous system such as in spinal cord injury or stroke. Muscle atrophy results from an imbalance between protein synthesis and protein degradation, although the mechanisms are incompletely understood and are variable depending on the cause. Muscle loss can be quantified with advanced imaging studies, but this is not frequently pursued.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0127">Sarcopenia is an aging associated disease of the invention characterized by the degenerative loss of skeletal muscle mass, quality, and strength associated with aging and immobility. The rate of muscle loss is dependent on exercise level, co-morbidities, nutrition and other factors. Sarcopenia can lead to reduction in functional status and cause disability. The muscle loss is related to changes in muscle synthesis signaling pathways. It is distinct from cachexia, in which muscle is degraded through cytokine-mediated degradation, although both conditions may co-exist. Sarcopenia is considered a component of the frailty syndrome. Changes in hormones, immobility, age-related muscle changes, nutrition and neurodegenerative changes have all been recognized as potential causative factors.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0128">The term &#x201c;cancer&#x201d; comprises a group of diseases that can affect any part of the body and is caused by abnormal cell growth and proliferation. These proliferating cells have the potential to invade the surrounding tissue and/or to spread to other parts of the body where they form metastasis. The incidence of cancer in increasing with age and cancer is therefore considered an aging associated disease of the present invention. Cancer according to the present invention refers to all types of cancer or neoplasm or malignant tumors found in mammals, including leukemias, sarcomas, melanomas and carcinomas. Examples of cancers are cancer of the breast, pancreas, colon, lung, non-small cell lung, ovary, and prostate.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0129">Leukemias include, but are not limited to acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, acute granulocytic leukemia, chronic granulocytic leukemia, acute promyelocytic leukemia, adult T-cell leukemia, aleukemic leukemia, a leukocythemic leukemia, basophylic leukemia, blast cell leukemia, bovine leukemia, chronic myelocytic leukemia, leukemia cutis, embryonal leukemia, eosinophilic leukemia, Gross' leukemia, hairy-cell leukemia, hemoblastic leukemia, hemocytoblastic leukemia, histiocytic leukemia, stem cell leukemia, acute monocytic leukemia, leukopenic leukemia, lymphatic leukemia, lymphoblastic leukemia, lymphocytic leukemia, lymphogenous leukemia, lymphoid leukemia, lymphosarcoma cell leukemia, mast cell leukemia, megakaryocyte leukemia, micromyeloblastic leukemia, monocytic leukemia, myeloblasts leukemia, myelocytic leukemia, myeloid granulocytic leukemia, myelomonocytic leukemia, Naegeli leukemia, plasma cell leukemia, plasmacytic leukemia, promyelocytic leukemia, Rieder cell leukemia, Schilling's leukemia, stem cell leukemia, subleukemic leukemia, and undifferentiated cell leukemia.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0130">Sarcomas include, but are not limited to a chondrosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, lymphosarcoma, melanosarcoma, myxosarcoma, osteosarcoma, Abernethy's sarcoma, adipose sarcoma, liposarcoma, alveolar soft part sarcoma, ameloblastic sarcoma, botryoid sarcoma, chloroma sarcoma, chorio carcinoma, embryonal sarcoma, Wilms' tumor sarcoma, endometrial sarcoma, stromal sarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, fascial sarcoma, fibroblastic sarcoma, giant cell sarcoma, granulocytic sarcoma, Hodgkin's sarcoma, idiopathic multiple pigmented hemorrhagic sarcoma, immunoblastic sarcoma of B cells, lymphoma, immunoblastic sarcoma of T-cells, Jensen's sarcoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, Kupffer cell sarcoma, angiosarcoma, leukosarcoma, malignant mesenchymoma sarcoma, parosteal sarcoma, reticulocytic sarcoma, Rous sarcoma, serocystic sarcoma, synovial sarcoma, and telangiectaltic sarcoma.

In one embodiment, the combination is suitable for combined administration. In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical combination as described herein is characterized in that the NAD precursor is in a pharmaceutical composition in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and the CRM is in a separate pharmaceutical composition in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The pharmaceutical combination of the present invention can therefore in some embodiments relate to the presence of two separate compositions or dosage forms in proximity to each other.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0137">The agents in combination are not required to be present in a single composition. In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical combination as described herein is characterized in that the NAD precursor and the CRM according to any one the embodiments of the invention are present in a kit, in spatial proximity but in separate containers and/or compositions. The production of a kit lies within the abilities of a skilled person. In one embodiment, separate compositions comprising two separate agents may be packaged and marketed together as a combination. In other embodiments, the offering of the two agents in combination, such as in a single catalogue, but in separate packaging is understood as a combination.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0138">In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical combination as described herein is characterized in that the NAD precursor and the CRM according to the embodiments of the invention are combined in a single pharmaceutical composition in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Combination preparations or compositions are known to a skilled person, who is capable of assessing compatible carrier materials and formulation forms suitable for both agents in the combination.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0139">It is a surprising advantage of the pharmaceutical composition that the NAD precursor and the CRM act synergistically to enable a strong benefit for the recipient, especially for an old subject. To determine or quantify the degree of synergy or antagonism obtained by any given combination, a number of models may be employed. Typically, synergy is considered an effect of a magnitude beyond the sum of two known effects. In some embodiments, the combination response is compared against the expected combination response, under the assumption of non-interaction calculated using a reference model (refer Tang J. et al.

Staggered administration is encompassed by the term combined administration, whereby one agent may be administered, followed by the later administration of a second agent, optionally followed by administration of the first agent, again, and so forth. Simultaneous administration of multiple agents is considered as one embodiment of combined administration. Simultaneous administration encompasses in some embodiments, for example the taking of multiple compositions comprising the multiple agents at the same time, e.g. orally by ingesting separate tablets simultaneously. A combination medicament, such as a single formulation comprising multiple agents disclosed herein may also be used in order to co-administer the various components in a single administration or dosage.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0141">A combined therapy or combined administration of one agent may precede or follow treatment with the other agent to be combined, by intervals ranging from minutes to weeks. In embodiments where the second agent and the first agent are administered separately, one would generally ensure that a significant period of time did not expire between the time of each delivery, such that the first and second agents would still be able to exert an advantageously combined synergistic effect on a treatment site. In such instances, it is contemplated that one would contact the subject with both modalities within about 12-24 h of each other and, more preferably, within about 6-12 h of each other, with a delay time of only about 12 h being most preferred. In some situations, it may be desirable to extend the time period for treatment significantly, however, where several days (2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7) to several weeks (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8) lapse between the respective administrations. In the meaning of the invention, any form of administration of the multiple agents described herein is encompassed by combined administration, such that a beneficial additional therapeutic effect, preferably a synergistic effect, is achieved through the combined administration of the two agents. The present invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising the compounds described herein.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0142">The invention also relates to pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds described herein, in addition to enantiomers and/or tautomers of the compounds described. The term &#x201c;pharmaceutical composition&#x201d; refers to a combination of the agent as described herein with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The phrase &#x201c;pharmaceutically-acceptable&#x201d; refers to molecular entities and compositions that do not produce a severe allergic or similar untoward reaction when administered to a human. As used herein, &#x201c;carrier&#x201d; or &#x201c;carrier substance&#x201d; includes any and all solvents, dispersion media, vehicles, coatings, diluents, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, buffers, carrier solutions, suspensions, colloids, and the like. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutical active substances is well known in the art. Supplementary active ingredients can also be incorporated into the compositions.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0143">The pharmaceutical composition containing the active ingredient may be in a form suitable for oral use, for example, as tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, or syrups or elixirs. Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions. Tablets contain the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. The tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0144">Dosage levels of the order of from about 0.01 mg to about 500 mg per kilogram of body weight per day are useful in the treatment of the indicated conditions. For example, an age-related medical condition may be effectively treated by the administration of from about 0.01 to 50 mg of the inventive molecule per kilogram of body weight per day (about 0.5 mg to about 5 g per patient per day). The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. For example, a formulation intended for the oral administration of humans may vary from about 5 to about 95% of the total composition. Dosage unit forms will generally contain between from about 1 mg to about 5000 mg of active ingredient. It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy. The dosage effective amount of compounds according to the invention will vary depending upon factors including the particular compound, toxicity, and inhibitory activity, the condition treated, and whether the compound is administered alone or with other therapies.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0145">As used herein, the term &#x201c;administering&#x201d; means providing a pharmaceutical agent or composition to a subject, and includes, but is not limited to, administering by a medical professional and self-administering. Administration of a substance, a compound or an agent to a subject can be carried out using one of a variety of methods known to those skilled in the art. For example, a compound or an agent can be administered, intravenously, arterially, intradermally, intramuscularly, intraperitoneally, subcutaneously, ocularly, sublingually, orally (by ingestion), intranasally (by inhalation), intraspinally, intracerebrally, and transdermally (by absorption, e.g., through a skin duct). A compound or agent can also appropriately be introduced by rechargeable or biodegradable polymeric devices or other devices, e.g., patches and pumps, or formulations, which provide for the extended, slow or controlled release of the compound or agent. Administering can also be performed, for example, once, a plurality of times, and/or over one or more extended periods.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0146">The instant disclosure also includes kits, packages and multi-container units containing the herein described pharmaceutical compositions, active ingredients, and/or means for administering the same for use in the prevention and treatment of diseases and other conditions in mammalian subjects.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0149" num="0147">The invention is further described by the following figures.

These are not intended to limit the scope of the invention, but represent preferred embodiments of aspects of the invention provided for greater illustration of the invention described herein.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0216">Here we analyzed whether the time of intervention (young adult vs. late in life) would change the outcomes of DR on metabolic plasticity, stress responses, and functional improvements in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) of laboratory mice (C57Bl/6J). The focus on the hematopoietic system had the advantage that pure population of phenotypically defined stem cells (HSCs) and early progenitor cells (HPCs) could be employed for metabolic as well a functional tests such as the assessment of the repopulation capacity of HSCs in transplantation experiments in vivo. Moreover, this approach minimized the influence of aging-related changes in cell composition (that occur in many tissues) on the results. Our work reveals experimental evidence that aging-associated mitochondrial dysfunction abrogates the metabolic plasticity of HSPCs to respond to changes in nutrient availability. HSPCs from young mice adapt to DR-induced reduction in nutrient availability by activation of mitochondrial metabolism, metabolic stress responses, and mitophagy, resulting in improved stem cell function in transplantation assays in vivo. In contrast, HSPCs from old mice fail to enhance mitochondrial function or to activate stress response pathways in response to DR. Consequently, HSCs from old DR-exposed mice do not show an enhancement in functionality compared to HSCs from ad libitum (AL) fed mice. Of note, the supplementation of the NAD precursor, NR (Mouchiroud et al., 2013), rescues mitochondrial function, metabolic plasticity, nutrient sensing, and the regulation of stress response pathways in HSPCs from old mice, whereas chemical mitotoxins induce aging-like loss of metabolic plasticity in HSPCs from young mice. These results show that mitochondrial function itself represents an essential factor for DR-mediated induction of metabolic and functional enhancements of HSPCs. These responses to nutrient availability are disrupted by aging-associated mitochondrial dysfunction but reinstalled by NR supplementation.</p><p id="p-0219" num="0217">Results of the Examples 1-8</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Example 1: Body Weight Stabilization and Improvements in HSC Function in Response to DR are Abrogated in Aged Versus Young Mice</heading><p id="p-0220" num="0218">To analyze whether the age at intervention would impact on the outcome of DR, young mice (3-5 months) and old mice (20-22 months) were switched to dietary restriction (DR: 30% reduction of the individual food consumed under ad libitum&#x2014;AL&#x2014;conditions) or kept under AL feeding (see materials and methods). All mice were kept in single cage housing (on AL diet starting 2 weeks before the diet assignment) to accurately monitor individual food intake. The experimental cohorts of mice were followed for 4 months using the same single mouse housing regiment. During the first 9 days after switching the diet to DR, mice from both age groups lost &#x2dc;10-20% of the body weight compared to the pre-intervention body weights (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>,B). Thereafter, young mice completely recovered pre-intervention body weight, whereas old mice continued to lose body weight up to 25% at 53 days after switching to DR (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>,B). Previous work from our group revealed that DR compared to AL diet has the potential to delay early aging of HSCs when the intervention is started in young, 3 months old mice and continued for 9 months. In this intervention period, DR strongly improved the repopulation capacity of HSCs (Tang et al., 2016). To determine the impact of intervention timing (old vs. young age) on the potential of DR to ameliorate the functional decline of HSCs during aging, young adult mice and old mice that were exposed to DR vs. a continuation of AL diet for 4 months followed by an analysis of the repopulation capacity of HSCs. Competitive transplantation of freshly isolated HSCs (Lin<sup>&#x2212;</sup>Sca1<sup>+</sup>c-Kit<sup>+</sup>(=LSK)Flt3<sup>&#x2212;</sup>CD34<sup>&#x2212;</sup>CD150<sup>+</sup>) from the dietary intervention cohorts into lethally irradiated young recipients showed that 4-month DR vs. AL diet was sufficient to induce a significant improvement in HSC function from young mice to repopulate peripheral blood (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>), total bone marrow (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>), and HSC pools in bone marrow (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>) of recipient mice.

Together, these results indicated that young mice exhibit a stabilization of body weights and improvements in HSC function in response to DR vs. AL diet; but these DR-mediated effects are abrogated in old mice.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Example 2: Aging Abrogates Metabolic Plasticity of HSPCs to Respond to Changes in Nutrient Availability In Vivo</heading><p id="p-0221" num="0219">The above results showed that young mice may have the capacity to metabolically adapt to DR within 2 weeks, in order to stabilize body weight in response to reductions in nutrient availability, while old mice lose this capacity (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>,B). We speculated that this capacity of metabolic plasticity to respond to changes in nutrient availability contributed to the enhancement in HSC function in DR-exposed young mice, which was abrogated in the old. Studies in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </i>and <i>D. melanogaster </i>indicated that increases in mitochondrial activity and respiration are important factors that contribute to enhance lifespan in response to DR (Lin et al., 2002; Zid et al., 2009).</p><p id="p-0222" num="0220">To directly analyze whether age-related changes in metabolic plasticity may influence the outcome of DR in mice, HSPCs were freshly isolated from young and old mice that were kept on AL diet or being switched to DR for 2 weeks. This time point was chosen since the body weight data indicated that young mice had adapted during this time window and managed to stabilize body weight despite the continuous exposure to DR (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>,B). Interestingly, respirometry revealed increases in basal and maximal respiratory activity of freshly isolated myeloid progenitor cell populations including common myeloid progenitors (CMPs: Lin<sup>&#x2212;</sup>c-Kit<sup>+</sup>Sca1<sup>&#x2212;</sup>CD34<sup>+</sup>Fc&#x3b3;R<sup>&#x2212;/low</sup>) and granulocyte macrophage progenitors (GMPs: Lin<sup>&#x2212;</sup>c-Kit*Sca1<sup>&#x2212;</sup>CD34<sup>+</sup>Fc&#x3b3;R<sup>+</sup>) of young mice in response to DR (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>).

Concomitantly, a reduction in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level was observed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>H</figref>). This suppression in LDH likely contributes to a reduced conversion of pyruvate to lactate, thereby promoting higher usage of pyruvate for mitochondrial oxidative metabolism&#x2014;a highly efficient pathway for ATP production. In line with this interpretation, we observed a significant increase in ATP levels in HSCs from DR-exposed, young mice compared to AL-fed control animals (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>). In contrast to these DR-induced metabolic changes of HSCs from young mice, HSCs from old mice exhibited pre-existing lower levels of lactate under AL-condition (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>F</figref>) and in response to DR exhibited an increase in lactate and LDH expression without any rise in ATP levels (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>F-I</figref>).</p><p id="p-0224" num="0222">Together, the above experiments indicated that HSPCs from young mice adapt to changes in nutrient availability, resulting in increases in mitochondrial respiration and ATP production.

To determine if aging-associated metabolic compromise could represent a possible cause for the loss of metabolic adaptation in old HSPCs, the mitochondrial metabolism was analyzed in HSPCs from young and old mice that were kept on AL diet. FACS analysis revealed a reduction in the mitochondrial membrane potential (MtMP) in HSCs of old mice compared to young mice (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>). This coincided with elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in HSCs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>).

Respirometry of 5-6 mice per group indicated that MPPs and MPs from old mice compared to young mice had higher oxygen consumption rates (OCR) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>,D).</p><p id="p-0226" num="0224">While DR-induced increases in OCR in combination with increases in ATP in HSPCs of young mice (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref>,I) indicated an activation of effective mitochondrial metabolism, the aging-associated increases in the OCR of HSPCs from AL fed mice in combination with the decrease in the MtMP and increases in ROS likely indicated an aberrant, non-effective metabolism of dysfunctional mitochondria in HSPCs from old mice. To substantiate this interpretation we analyzed ATP levels&#x2014;an indicator of effective mitochondrial metabolism (Bonora et al., 2012) by mass spectrometry in freshly isolated HSPCs from young vs. old mice. This analysis showed a decrease in ATP levels in several subpopulations of HSPCs from old vs. young mice supporting the conclusion that mitochondrial metabolism was inefficient in old vs. young HSPCs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>).</p><p id="p-0227" num="0225">Mitochondria also influence the cellular pools of NAD/NADP (Xiao et al., 2017). Mitochondria oxidative metabolism needs NADH as electron donor for oxidative phosphorylation, which in turn leads to production of NAD+, an essential co-substrate to several enzymes, including the Sirtuins, PARPs, and others (Xiao et al., 2017). In addition, mitochondrial ROS clearance consumes NADPH, which functions as an important redox scavenger (Xiao et al., 2017). The cellular levels of NADPH (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>) and NADH (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>) were significantly decreased in different subpopulations of HSPCs from old compared to young mice, while differences in NAD+(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>D</figref>) and NADP (data not shown) were not significant. In addition to the reduction in NADPH levels, enzymes that are crucial in redox homeostasis were significantly downregulated in MPPs during aging (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>E</figref>). Together, these results indicated that mitochondrial dysfunction in HSPCs of old vs. young mice results in reductions in ATP levels as well as in disturbances of NAD/NADP pools and redox homeostasis.</p><p id="p-0228" num="0226">As alterations in NAD/NADP pools can also lead to disturbed expression of nuclear/mitochondrial encoded genes (Cant&#xf3; et al., 2015), we analyzed the mRNA expression of several key factors for mitochondrial biogenesis and function (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>F-K</figref>), including nuclear (Nrf1, Tfam) and mitochondrial encoded genes (Nd1, Cytb, Co1, Atp6). All these genes were strongly downregulated in HSCs from aged compared to young mice, especially in the population of CD41<sup>+</sup>HSC<sup>&#x2212;</sup> a subpopulation of HSCs, which increases during aging and is characterized by a loss of function and myeloid skewed output (Yamamoto et al., 2018). One of the downregulated genes, Nd1 (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase chain 1), is essential for the binding of NADH to complex 1, which is required for NADH to act as an electron donor at the start of the electron transport chain (Walker, 2009). These data suggested that diminished levels of NADH and its binding partner at the mitochondrial respiratory complex I could contribute to defects in mitochondrial function in HSPCs from old mice.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Example 4: HSPCs from Old Mice Exhibit Enhanced, Cell-Intrinsic Dependency on Glycolysis and Abrogated Responses to Mitochondria Inhibition</heading><p id="p-0229" num="0227">The above data suggested that chronic mitochondrial dysfunction could contribute to the failure of metabolic plasticity that was observed in HSPCs from old mice in response to DR in vivo. To determine whether aged HSCs carry cell intrinsic alterations in mitochondrial metabolism, the proteome of highly purified HSCs (CD150<sup>+</sup>CD34<sup>&#x2212;</sup>LSK) from our recent publication (Chen et al., 2019) was analyzed for changes in proteins that regulate glycolysis or oxidative mitochondrial metabolism. This analysis revealed a significant upregulation of glycolytic enzymes in HSCs from old compared to young mice (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>) including hexokinase-1 and -2 (HK1 and HK2)&#x2014;catalyzing the initiation of glycolysis (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>).

Aging-associated up-regulation of key-activators of glycolysis (such as PKM) and concomitant reduction in enzymes involved in oxidative metabolism also occurred in the other 2 subpopulation of HSPCs, CMPs and GMPs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> A,B), which we also analyzed.</p><p id="p-0230" num="0228">To test the functional relevance of these aging-associated changes in the proteome of HSCs, freshly isolated HSCs were exposed to treatment with oligomycin (an inhibitor of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation) or to treatment with 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) in culture. 2-DG is an inhibitor of phosphoglucose isomerase and hexokinase, the first 2 enzymes initiating glycolysis (Ralser et al., 2008) In response to glycolysis inhibition, HSCs from old mice compared to HSCs from young mice were hypersensitive and exhibited a stronger reduction in cell numbers 5 days after initiation of the treatment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C</figref>). In contrast, in response to inhibition of mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, HSCs from old mice compared to HSCs from young mice were less responsive to reduce cell growth (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C</figref>). Similar results were obtained after inhibition of nutrient influx into mitochondria. In this experiment, freshly isolated HSCs were incubated with compounds that inhibit the influx of nutrients into mitochondria (BPTES for glutamine, Etomoxir for fatty acids, or UK5099 for pyruvate). When exposed to such inhibitors (alone or in combination), HSCs from young mice exhibited a strong reduction in cell numbers 5 days after induction of the inhibitor treatment, whereas the sensitivity of HSCs from old mice to respond with a reduction in cell growth was significantly reduced (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>D</figref>,E). Of note, there was no significant difference in growth of cultured, control-treated HSCs from old vs. young mice indicating that growth-associated differences in nutrient demand were not responsible for this phenotype. Together, these data indicated that HSPCs from old compared to young mice show an increased dependency on glycolysis, but a reduced dependency on mitochondrial metabolism. These data provided functional evidence that HSPCs from old mice exhibit mitochondrial dysfunction, which by itself may reduce the plasticity of old HSPCs to respond to inhibition of mitochondrial metabolism</p><p id="p-0231" num="0229">To experimentally test whether mitochondrial dysfunction would cause an abrogation of adaptive responses of HSCs to reduction in nutrient availability, young mice were exposed the mitochondrial uncoupler FCCP or vehicle (two injections: day-1 and day-4). One week after the first injection, the mice were analyzed and freshly isolated HSCs of FCCP-treated vs. DMSO-treated mice were exposed in culture to the 3 above described inhibitors of mitochondrial nutrient uptake&#x2014;a combination of BPTES, Etomoxir, and UK5099, referred to from here on as &#x201c;3I&#x201d;. Interestingly, 1-week of FCCP treatment resulted in a dose dependent increase in the number of phenotypic HSCs in bone marrow (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>F</figref>)&#x2014;a known feature of HSC aging. This finding also stood in line with a previous study showing that mitochondrial inhibition increases the self-renewal of cultured HSCs (Vannini et al., 2016). Inhibition of mitochondrial nutrient flow (3I-treatment) led to significant reduction in growth of HSCs from control treated mice, but HSCs from FCCP-treated mice exhibited a complete abrogation in responding to 3I-treatment by reduction in cell expansion (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>G</figref>).

Increases in mitochondrial metabolism have been shown to represent a key element of metabolic plasticity and functional enhancement induced by DR-mediated decreases in nutrient availability (reviewed in Guarente 2008). Our data revealed a failure of HSPCs from old compared to young mice to induce mitochondrial metabolism in response to DR (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>D-I</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>C</figref>,F) coinciding with a failure to stabilize body weight and to enhance HSC function as seen in young, DR-exposed mice (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-C</figref>). Together, these findings suggested that aging-associated mitochondrial dysfunction abrogates metabolic plasticity, which itself is required to enhance stem cells and organismal functions in response to DR.</p><p id="p-0233" num="0231">To further test this hypothesis, we analyzed the adaptability of mitochondrial metabolic pathways in freshly isolated HSPCs from young and old mice. First, we exposed freshly isolated HSCs to Oligomycin or to control treatment and we analyzed the RNA expression of Lactate dehydrogenase A (Ldha) and Pyruvate dehydrogenase A (Pdha) 3 hours after isolation and drug treatment. This experiment revealed a significant suppression of Ldha expression and a concomitant increase in Pdha expression in HSCs from young mice but HSCs from old mice were irresponsive (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>,B). Second, we measured the activity of LDH and PDH in freshly isolated HSCs that were exposed for 20 hours to Oligomycin. HSCs from young mice responded to the treatment with a reduction in LDH activity, while PDH activity was maintained, thus responding with a shift of nutrient towards mitochondrial metabolism (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>C</figref>,D). Again HSCs from old mice were irresponsive (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>C</figref>,D). A similar mode of gene regulation was also observed for Nrf1 and Hif1&#x3b1;&#x2014;two important metabolic stress response genes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>E</figref>,F). Third, we analyzed OCR in freshly isolated CMPs that were treated for 12 hours with inhibitors of mitochondrial nutrient flow (3I) compared to control treatment. As outlined above, CMPs were used for these respirometry experiments, which need higher cell numbers and thus cannot be conducted on HSCs. Cultured CMPs from young mice showed a higher OCR compared to CMP from old mice (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>G</figref>). This increase in OCR in young compared to old CMPs was different from freshly isolated MPs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref>) likely due to culture induced activation of OCR in young CMPs, which was impaired in old CMPs by pre-existing, chronic mitochondrial dysfunction. In response to 3I-treatment, CMPs from young mice reacted with a significant reduction in OCR, whereas CMPs from old mice remained unresponsive (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>G</figref>).</p><p id="p-0234" num="0232">Together, these results support a model indicating that mitochondrial dysfunction itself stalled HSPCs from old mice in metabolically compromised state, which resulted in a loss of metabolic plasticity to respond to changes in mitochondrial function/nutrient flow into mitochondria. Of note, this response was different from DR-induced responses as the latter were inducing increases in OCR in HSPCs from young mice (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>). It is conceivable that this difference is due to the experimental set up, where an overall reduction in nutrient availability by 30% in an in vivo organism leads to an increased efficiency in mitochondrial function and OCR, whereas the acute shut down of mitochondrial function in the culture system does not allow for the same kind of adaptive response. Despite these methodological differences, the immediate metabolic responses of young HSPCs after acute mitochondrial inhibition in culture and the abrogation of such a response in old HSPCs, support the concept that pre-existing mitochondria dysfunction (as seen in aging) by itself leads to abrogation of metabolic plasticity of HSPCs. To experimentally test this conclusion, CMPs from FCCP-treated vs. control treated young mice (see above) were exposed for 12 hours to 3I-treatment in culture and adaptive response in OCR were measured by Seahorse. In vivo pre-treatment with FCCP led to a dose dependent reduction in the OCR of freshly isolated CMPs indicating that the FCCP-treatment led to mitochondrial dysfunction. Of note, this coincided with a dose dependent loss in the responsiveness of CMPs from FCCP-treated mice to reduce OCRs in response to 3I-treatment in culture&#x2014;thus mimicking the aging phenotype (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>H</figref>).</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">Example 6: Aging Impairs Nutrient Sensing, Transcriptional Stress Responses, and the Induction of Clearance Pathways in HSPCs</heading><p id="p-0235" num="0233">Nutrient sensing pathways represent a prerequisite to activate stress response pathways that enhance cellular fitness in response to decreases in nutrient availability (Fontana et al., 2010). These responses are thought to increase metabolic fitness and to direct biomolecule and metabolic resources away from growth pathways toward an increased usage in repair and maintenance pathways (Geach, 2016). The mTOR signaling pathway controls major growth promoting signals and the pathway is suppressed in response to decreases in nutrient availability (Ochocki and Simon, 2013). FACS analysis revealed a suppression of phosphorylated (active) mTOR and phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 (p-S6&#x2014;a downstream target of mTOR) in HSCs of young mice that were exposed to 2-week DR treatment compared to AL-fed control mice (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>,C). HSCs from AL-fed, old mice exhibited lower levels of p-mTOR and p-S6 compared to young mice but in response to DR-treatment p-mTOR and p-S6 levels were not significantly downregulated (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>,D). A similar response pattern was also observed for p-AKT (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref>,B). NanoString analysis of the expression of a focused set of 52 mRNAs of metabolic stress response genes revealed an upregulation of 16 genes in HSCs of 2-week DR-exposed young mice compared to AL-fed control mice (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>E</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>C</figref>). These genes were involved in a broad variety of biological processes, such as autophagy and mitophagy induction (Parkin, Sirt1), cell cycle control (p57), mitochondrial activity and biogenesis (Polg, Ucp2, Idh1, Cox4i1), chromatin remodeling and mtUPR (Sirt7), insulin/lgf signaling (Hmga2, Irs2), and NAD biosynthesis (Naprt, which catalyzes the first step in the biosynthesis of NAD from nicotinic acid). Of note, HSCs from old mice showed a complete loss of responsiveness and none of the 52 tested stress response genes were regulated in response to 2-week DR-treatment compared to AL-fed, old mice. The 16 genes that responded to DR in young mice only showed slight, non-significant regulation in response to 2 weeks DR-treatment compared to AL-fed, old mice (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>F</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>D</figref>).</p><p id="p-0236" num="0234">The above data indicated that HSPCs from old mice compared to HSPCs from young mice exhibit defects in nutrient sensing and in the activation of stress response genes after short-term exposure (2 weeks) to DR. Nutrient sensing and induction of metabolic stress responses have been shown to lead to the activation of cellular and subcellular clearance mechanisms in response to DR that contribute to the beneficial effects of DR on disease prevention and lifespan extension. Examples include the induction of apoptosis (Dunn et al., 1997; Holt et al., 1998), autophagy/mitophagy (Hansen et al., 2008; Jia and Levine, 2007; Morselli et al., 2010), and unfolded protein responses (Mohrin et al., 2015). Interestingly, defects in clearance systems have been implicated to contribute to aging of HSCs (Ho et al., 2017; Mohrin et al., 2015). To test whether impairments in the induction of cellular or subcellular clearance mechanisms may contribute to the failure of HSPCs from old mice to adapt to DR to increase metabolic and cellular fitness, we followed the induction of autophagy/mitophagy and changes in HSPCs numbers in mice that were exposed to DR or AL control diet for 1-2 weeks.</p><p id="p-0237" num="0235">In young mice, 2-week DR exposure induced a significant decline in HSC and MPP numbers compared to AL fed animals; however, this response was abrogated in aged mice (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>G</figref>,H and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>E</figref>,F). These data suggested that the clearance of metabolically compromised HSCs contributes to increased metabolic fitness in response to DR and old mice appeared to be compromised in mounting such responses to DR. The aforementioned analysis on stress responses revealed an induction in the expression of subcellular clearance pathways in MPPs in response to DR in young mice, but not in old mice, including Parkin&#x2014;an important regulator of inducible mitophagy, Sirt1&#x2014;a regulator of general autophagy, Sirt7&#x2014;a regulator of chromatin remodeling and mtUPR (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>E</figref>,F). At the protein level, the expression of PINK1 (a marker and regulator of clearance of damaged mitochondria by mitophagy) was upregulated in cultures of freshly isolated, young MPPs in response to the inhibition of nutrient influx (3I-treatment) into mitochondria (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>91</b></figref>). MPPs from old mice failed to mediate such a response (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>91</b></figref>). Similar results were observed after exposure of freshly isolated MPPs to Oligomycin treatment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>G</figref>). In addition, immunofluorescence co-staining of marker proteins of autophagy (LC3) and of mitochondria (TOM20) revealed that MPPs from young DR mice upregulated LC3 as compared to young AL-fed mice, whereas old mice exhibited elevated levels of LC3 expression during AL but failed to further increase LC3 upon DR (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>J</figref>). Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that the number of MPPs that exhibited co-localization of LC3 and TOM20 was reduced in DR-exposed compared to AL-fed young mice but not in DR-exposed compared to AL-fed, old mice (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>H,<b>1</b></figref>). A likely explanation for these findings was that DR induced autophagy in MPPs from young mice, which led to clearance of damaged mitochondrial as indicated by a decreased LC3/TOM20 co-staining. In contrast, MPPs from old mice did not induce such DR-induced responses in mitochondrial clearance. Together, these data indicated that HSPCs from old mice exhibit a chronically increased level of dysfunctional autophagy, which could not be induced by DR.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="1">Example 7: Short-Term DR has the Capacity to Ameliorate 80% of the Differences in the Proteome of HSPCs from Young and Old Mice, but Age-Related Alterations of NAD Dependent Biological Processes Remain</heading><p id="p-0238" num="0236">To determine aging-related changes in the proteome of HSPCs and to test whether DR would have the capacity to revert such changes, a proteome analysis was conducted on freshly isolated GMPs and CMPs from young and old mice that were on continuous AL diet or exposed to DR for 2 weeks.

These results suggested that increases in mitochondrial respiration represent an integral hub required for the lifespan extension in response to DR. This assumption was supported by studies on <i>C. elegans </i>showing that the induction of skn1-dependent signals in neurons is required for mitochondrial activation in somatic tissues and for DR-mediated lifespanextension (Bishop and Guarente, 2007). Importantly, aging-related limitations in mitochondria activation and its mechanistic consequences on cellular and organismal fitness in response to changes in nutrient availability have not been delineated.</p><p id="p-0247" num="0245">The current study shows that the aging-associated failure to increase mitochondrial respiration represents a major cause for the loss of metabolic plasticity of aged HSPCs to adapt to changes in nutrient availability. The study reveals that the in vivo application of mitotoxins (FCCP) to young mice leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, which is sufficient to abrogate the metabolic responsiveness of HSPCs to adapt to changes in nutrient availability thus mimicking the aging phenotype. Furthermore, the supplementation of NAD precursors reinstalls mitochondrial activity with the subsequent responsiveness of aged HSCs to adapt (modify) proliferation rates, oxidative metabolism, and the expression of stress signaling pathways in response to changes in nutrient availability. These findings indicate that NAD dependent mitochondria dysfunction is a causative factor for the loss of metabolic and functional plasticity of HSPCs during aging. These results could have important implications for our understanding of stem cell and organism aging in general. Previous studies showed that transient inhibition of mitochondrial function in <i>C. elegans </i>only resulted in lifespan extension when applied during developmental stages but not when given to adult worms (Lin et al., 2002). It is conceivable that the decline in mitochondria function during the maturation and aging of <i>C. elegans </i>limits metabolic plasticity and the induction of lifespan extension. In agreement with this interpretation, DR-induced effects on reduction of mortality rates in mice are greatly impaired during aging, coinciding with a reduced capacity of white adipose fat tissue (WAT) to increase phospholipid-dependent mitochondrial biogenesis (Hahn et al., 2019)</p><p id="p-0248" num="0246">Supplementation of NAD Precursors Reinstalls Metabolic Plasticity and the Responsiveness of Old HSCs to Changes in Nutrient Availability.</p><p id="p-0249" num="0247">It has been proposed that the activation of mitochondrial metabolism leads to intra-mitochondrial and intracellular increases in NAD/NADP ratios, which in turn contribute to the activation of NAD-dependent stress responses that increase cellular fitness (Guarente, 2008). The current study shows that DR has the capacity to revert large proportions of aging-related alterations in the proteome of HSPCs. However, proteins involved in NAD dependent biological processes are not normalized but strongly dysregulated in old vs. young DR-exposed mice. These processes include a reduction in Sirtuin signaling and an increase in the expression of protein of complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, which are required for initiation of oxidative phosphorylation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>). The upregulation of mitochondrial complex I proteins in old HSPC (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>D</figref>) in combination with the failure to induce mitochondrial respiration in response to DR (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>) likely reflects an attempt to activate mitochondrial respiration, which, however, is not successful due to low levels of NADH, which is needed as an electron donor for electron transport chain. As a consequence, mitochondria respiration is not induced in response to DR despite the upregulation of complex I proteins. In turn, the generation of NAD+ and the activation of Sirtuin signaling (which requires NAD+ as a cofactor) are not boosted in response to DR.</p><p id="p-0250" num="0248">Previous studies revealed that impairments in Sirtuin signaling (Brown et al., 2013; Mohrin et al., 2015) and autophagy (Ho et al., 2017) contribute to the aging-associated decline in HSC function. The current study indicates that aging-associated mitochondrial dysfunction abrogates nutrient sensing and the regulation of stress response pathways in old HPSCs. However, these deficiencies can be reversed by NR supplementation, which improves mitochondrial function and the regulation of stress signaling pathways in activated HSCs from old mice in culture. Studies on the in vivo application of NR to young mice also revealed evidence that NR reduces mitochondrial activity in HSCs by enhancing autophagy mediated clearance of mitochondria (Vannini et al., 2019). It is possible that NR dependent improvements in autophagy-mediated clearance of dysfunctional mitochondria also contribute to the here described potential of NR to rescue mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and consequently the responsiveness of old HSPCs to adapt to changes in nutrient availability.</p><p id="p-0251" num="0249">Together, the current study provides experimental support that in old mice chronic mitochondrial dysfunction stalls HSPCs in a compromised metabolic state, leading to a loss of nutrient sensing and metabolic plasticity to respond to changes in nutrient availability. These defects limit the capacity of DR to induce mitochondrial metabolism, adaptive stress responses, and functional enhancement of HSPCs in old mice. It is conceivable that the aging-related failure in nutrient sensing and in induction of stress signaling pathways may also contribute to the functional decline of HSCs during aging, by for example abrogating circadian responses to changes in nutrient availability induced by pauses in nutrient uptake. The study identifies deficiencies in NADH as a key factor, which limits the induction of metabolic plasticity and adaptive responses in old HSCs. Importantly, the supplementation of NAD precursors reinstalls mitochondrial function, metabolic plasticity and adaptive responses of old HSCs to respond to reductions in mitochondrial nutrient flow. These findings imply that combining dietary interventions with the supplementation of NAD precursors have the potential to improve stem cell and organism function at old age.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="1">Example 9: NAD Precursor Supplementation in Combination with CRD Rescues Mitochondria Function, the Induction of Stress Response in Hematopoietic Stem and Progenitor Cells of Old Mice&#x2014;Results and Discussion</heading><p id="p-0252" num="0250">Based on our results, we reasoned that mitochondria enhancement could possibly re-install mitochondria plasticity to respond to changes in nutrient availability and, thereby, the capacity of DR (=CRD) to induce transcriptional responses and functional improvements of HSCs of old mice.

The current work provides a mechanistic understanding for the failure of DR at old age and identifies a dietary intervention that reinstalls it. The study shows that mitochondria activation is a key mechanism, which fails to respond to DR in old vs. young mice.

The cell lysate was then used for hybridization reaction as following: 2 &#x3bc;L of cell lysate was mixed with 5 &#x3bc;L of nCounter hybridization buffer (NanoString), 2 &#x3bc;L of Core Tagset, 2 &#x3bc;L of extension Tagset, 0.5 &#x3bc;L of 0.6 nm Probe A working pool, 0.5 &#x3bc;L of 0.6 nm probe A extension Pool, 0.5 &#x3bc;L of 3 nm Probe B working pool, and 0.5 &#x3bc;L of 3 nM Probe B extension pool (from IDT technologies). 2 &#x3bc;L of Nuclease-free water was added to each reaction to reach a final volume of 15 &#x3bc;L. The reaction mixture was prepared in Strip tubes (from NanoString technologies). Then it was incubated at 67&#xb0; C. using thermal cycler (Masterycler from Eppendorf) for 16 h. Afterward, the Nanostring chemistry was processed automatically using nCounter prep-station 5s (NanoString technologies) according to manufacturer protocol. Directly after the run, the nCounter Cartridge was loaded into nCounter digital analyzer 5s (NanoString technologies). For NanoString analysis on young and old mice exposed to DR or AL food, freshly FACS-Sorted MPPs (CD34<sup>+</sup>Flt3<sup>&#x2212;</sup> LSK) were used. For NR treatment, freshly FACS-Sorted MPPs (CD34<sup>+</sup>Flt3<sup>&#x2212;</sup> LSK) from young and old mice were pretreated with 1 mM NR or the 31 (6 &#x3bc;M each) or DMSO for 12 h. Cells from NR treatment and DMSO were divided into 2 halves and further treated with 3I (6 &#x3bc;M each) or DMSO as control. The cells were harvested for NanoString analysis as described above. Data analysis was done after background correction using nSolver advanced analysis software (v.4) and (R software v 3.3.2.). The following housekeeping genes were used for normalization: ActB, B2M, Gapdh, Gusb, Hprt, PGK1, Polr1b, Polr2a, Ppia, Rpl19, Sdha, and Tbp. Heatmaps and volcano plots was done using GraphPad prism software version 8.</p><p id="p-0289" num="0293">Proteomics of CMP and GMPs</p><p id="p-0290" num="0294">1&#xd7;10<sup>5 </sup>PBS&#x2014;washed cells (CMPs/GMPs) were FACS sorted directly into concentrated lysis buffer; the final composition was 1% SDS, 100 mM HEPES, 50 mM DTT, pH8.0). Samples were snap-frozen in dry ice before preparation for the proteomics data acquisition. After thawing on ice, samples were sonicated using a Bioruptor (60 sec ON/30 sec OFF, 10 cycles, high intensity at 20&#xb0; C.) (Diagenode, Beligum), then heated to 95&#xb0; C. for 10 min, before a repeat set of sonication cycles as before. Alklyation to block cysteines was carried out with iodoacetamide (15 mM final concentration, 30 min, dark, room temperature). Protein precipitation was carried out using 8&#xd7; sample volume of ice-cold acetone and samples were left at &#x2212;20&#xb0; C. overnight. The following day, samples were centrifuged (20800&#xd7; g, 30 min, 4&#xb0; C.), supernatant carefully removed, and protein pellets washed twice with ice cold 80% acetone/20% water (300 &#x3bc;L), 10 min centrifugation (as above)). After removal of the second wash, pellets were air-dried before resuspension in the digestion buffer (1M Guanadine HCl in 0.1M HEPES, pH 8; LysC (1:100 enzyme:protein ratio), then incubated for 4 h at 37&#xb0; C. The samples were diluted 1:1 with Milli-Q water (to reach 0.5 M GuaHCl) and incubated with trypsin (1:100 enzyme:protein) for 16 h at 37&#xb0; C. The digests were then acidified with 10% trifluoroacetic acid and then desalted with Waters Oasis&#xae; HLB pElution Plate 30 &#x3bc;m (Waters Corporation, Milford, Mass., USA) in the presence of a slow vacuum. In this process, the columns were conditioned with 3&#xd7;100 &#x3bc;L solvent B (80% acetonitrile; 0.05% formic acid) and equilibrated with 3&#xd7;100 &#x3bc;L solvent A (0.05% formic acid in Milli-Q water). The samples were loaded, washed 3 times with 100 &#x3bc;L solvent A, and then eluted into PCR tubes with 50 &#x3bc;L solvent B. The eluates were dried down with the speed vacuum centrifuge prior to resuspension in 10 &#x3bc;L MS Buffer (5% acetonitrile, 95% Milli-Q water, with 0.1% formic acid) containing 0.25 &#x3bc;L of iRT kit (Biognosys AG) for the MS analyses.</p><p id="p-0291" num="0295">LC-MS/MS (DDA for Library and DIA)</p><p id="p-0292" num="0296">Data were acquired on a QE-HFX MS (Thermo), connected to an M-Class NanoAcquity (Waters).</p><p id="p-0293" num="0297">The outlet of the analytical column was coupled directly to the mass spectrometer using the Proxeon nanospray source. Solvent A was water, 0.1% formic acid and solvent B was acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid. Approximately 1 &#x3bc;g of each of the samples (reconstituted at estimated 1 &#x3bc;g/&#x3bc;L and spiked with iRT kit peptides (Biognosys AG, Switzerland)) were injected for LC-MS with a constant flow of solvent A, at 5 &#x3bc;L/min, in trapping mode. The trapping time was 6 min. Peptides were eluted via the analytical column with a constant flow of 0.3 &#x3bc;L/min. During the elution step, the percentage of solvent B increased in a non-linear fashion from 0% to 40% in 120 min. Total runtime was 145 min, including clean-up and column re-equilibration. The peptides were introduced into the mass spectrometer via a Pico-Tip Emitter 360 &#x3bc;m OD&#xd7;20 &#x3bc;m ID; 10 &#x3bc;m tip (New Objective) and a spray voltage of 2.2 kV was applied. The capillary temperature was set at 300&#xb0; C. The ion funnel RF was set to 40%. DDA data were acquired on pools of each condition, with the following settings: Full scan MS spectra with mass range 350-1650 m/z were acquired in profile mode in the Orbitrap with resolution of 120000. MS1 fill time was 20 ms, AGC target 3e6. Top N was used (=15) and the intensity threshold was 4e4. Normalized Collision Energy (NCE) with HCD was set to 27% and a 1.6 Da window was used for quadrupole isolation. MS2 data were acquired in profile mode from 200-2000 m/z. MS2 fill time was 25 ms or an AGC target of 2e5. Only 2-5+ charge states were selected for MS/MS. Dynamic exclusion was 20 s, and the peptide match &#x201c;preferred&#x201d; option was selected. For the DIA data, LC conditions remained unchanged. Full scan MS spectra with mass range 350-1650 m/z were acquired in profile mode in the Orbitrap with resolution of 120000. The default charge state was set to 3+. The filling time was set at maximum of 60 ms with limitation of 3e6 ions. DIA scans were acquired with 34 mass window segments of differing widths across the MS1 mass range. HCD fragmentation (stepped normalized collision energy; 25.5, 27, 30%) was applied and MS/MS spectra were acquired with a resolution of 30000 with a fixed first mass of 200 m/z after accumulation of 3e6 ions or after filling time of 40 ms (whichever occurred first). Data were acquired in profile mode. For data acquisition and processing of the raw data Xcalibur 4.0 (Thermo Scientific) was used in parallel with Tune version 2.9.</p><p id="p-0294" num="0298">Data Analysis for DIA Data</p><p id="p-0295" num="0299">For library creation, the DDA and DIA data were searched using the Pulsar search engine within Spectronaut (Spectronaut (version 13.1.190621.4365); Biognosys AG, Zurich, Switzerland). Data were searched against a species specific (<i>Mus musculus</i>) Swissprot database (01/2016, 16756 entries) alongside the database of common contaminants. The data were searched with trypsin/P specificity and the following modifications: Carbamidomethyl (C) (Fixed) and Oxidation (M)/Acetyl (Protein N-term) (Variable). A maximum of 2 missed cleavages was allowed. The identifications satisfied an FDR of 1% on both peptide and protein level. All other settings were the defaults from Biognosys (Bruderer et al., 2017; Rosenberger et al., 2017; Storey, 2002).</p><p id="p-0296" num="0300">The resulting library contained 77363 precursors, corresponding to 4957 protein groups using Spectronaut protein inference. DIA data were then uploaded and searched against this spectral library in Spectronaut. Relative quantification was performed in the software for each pairwise comparison using the replicates from each condition. Quantification settings were modified from the defaults in the following way: Median and no Top N for the major and minor group quantities; data filtering on q-value percentile (0.5), no imputation, local cross-run normalization on q-value (sparse). The post-analysis settings were set to use the unpaired strategy. 7 samples were removed from the dataset due to poor quality recovery of material as seen in the MS chromatograms. The data (candidate table) and data reports were then exported as tables and further data analysis and visualization were performed with R-studio (version 1.0.153, employing R-version 3.6.1 (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing)) using in-house pipelines and scripts. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) on relevant pairwise comparisons was performed using Webgestalt ((Liao et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2005).</p><p id="p-0297" num="0301">Measurement of ATP, Lactate, and Pyruvate</p><p id="p-0298" num="0302">The FACS purified HSC pellet (1000-1500 cells) lysed by 20 &#x3bc;L 1% NP40 on ice for 10 min and centrifuged at 8000 g for 5 min. The cell lysate was transferred into new clean tubes. The cellular ATP in low number of HSCs was measured by the ATP determination Kit (Thermo, A22066). Briefly, the ATP reaction solution and standard samples were prepared following the instruction manual with the reagents provided in the kit. The cell lysate (10 &#x3bc;L per sample) and standards were mixed with 100 &#x3bc;L ATP reaction solution and then added into the black 96-well flat bottom plate (Thermo). The plate was gently shaken, and the intensity of luminescence was measured for each well by microplate reader (Tecan). The relative cellular ATP level of each sample was calculated by subtracting the intensity value of empty control and divided by the initial cell number of the individual sample. For lactate or pyruvate measurement, the reagent was prepared according to the instruction manual of the Lactate Assay Kit (Sigma, MAK064) or Pyruvate Assay Kit (Sigma, MAK071). The cell lysate (3-5 &#x3bc;L per sample) was mixed with 50 &#x3bc;L Master Reaction Mix and added into the black 96-well flat bottom plate (Thermo). The plate was shaken briefly and incubated at room temperature for 10-30 min before the measurement. The cellular level of lactate or pyruvate was determined by measuring fluorescence intensity (&#x3bb;<sub>ex</sub>=535 nm/&#x3bb;<sub>em</sub>=587 nm) on microplate reader (Tecan).</p><p id="p-0299" num="0303">Immunofluorescence Staining</p><p id="p-0300" num="0304">FACS purified cells were dropped on poly-Lysine pre-coated slides and seated at 4&#xb0; C. for 0.5-1 h to let the cells attached to the slides.

Slides were permeabilized in 0.3% Triton X-100/2% BSA/PBS for 30 mins at room temperature and blocked in 2% BSA/PBS for 30 mins at room temperature. The cells were then incubated with LC3 (Biorbyt, orb97657) and Tom20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-11415) antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS 3 times, the cells were then incubated with secondary antibodies: AF594 conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (Life Technologies, A21207) and AF647 conjugated donkey anti-mouse (Life Technologies, A31571) for 30 min at room temperature. After staining, the slides were washed by PBS for 3 times and mounted by mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, H-1000) containing 1 &#x3bc;g/mL DAPI. The cells were imaged on Zeiss Axio Imager Microscope (100&#xd7; objective), and the images were processed using ZEN Software (Zeiss). The fluorescence intensity per cell was measured by ImageJ on 19 cells per mouse to calculate the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of an individual mouse.</p><p id="p-0301" num="0305">LC-MS (Metabolites)</p><p id="p-0302" num="0306">Different populations of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (30000 cells per condition) were purified by FACS.

The samples were thawed at 4&#xb0; C. on the next day, and centrifuged at the highest speed for 20 min at 4&#xb0; C. The supernatant was transferred into new tubes and mixed with equal volume of acetonitrile and stored at &#x2212;80&#xb0; C. until analysis. Liquid Chromatography coupled to Mass Spectroscopy (LC-MS) analysis was conducted on a Q-Exactive&#x2014;Orbitrap mass spectrometer interfaced with a Dionex UltiMate 3000 LC system (Thermo). LC separation was conducted using a ZIC-cHILIC column (10&#xd7;2.1 mm, 3 &#x3bc;m, Merck, USA), using a gradient from buffer B (10 mM CH<sub>3</sub>COONH<sub>4 </sub>pH5.8, 90% acetonitrile) to buffer A (10 mM CH<sub>3</sub>COONH<sub>4 </sub>pH5.8, 10% acetonitrile). The column compartment was kept at 20&#xb0; C. during analysis. The maximum injection volume was 10 &#x3bc;L. The following parameters for the HESI ions source were used: Sheath gas flow rate&#x2014;48 units; Aux gas flow rate&#x2014;11 units; Sweep gas flow rate&#x2014;2 units; Spray voltage&#x2014;3.5 kV; Capillary temperature&#x2014;256&#xb0; C.; S-lens RF level&#x2014;90 units; Aux gas heater temperature&#x2014;413&#xb0; C. Mass spectra were recorded by tSIM at positive polarity and maximum resolution (140,000). Metabolites in the samples were quantified by peak integration in the XCalibur software using processing setup. A cell extract containing nucleotides with fully C13-saturate ribose was generated by growing 293 cells in presence of 6&#xd7;C13-labeled glucose. Samples were spiked with this cell extract, and concentrations of the endogenous metabolites were determined by comparing the peak area of the endogenous metabolite to the internal standard.

The numbers of biological replicates are stated in the figure legends. No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size. All data were tested for the normal distribution using the Shapiro-Wilk normality test (p&#x3c;0.05). For data that passed normality test, we used parametric tests. To compare the significance between 2 groups with single condition or treatment, we used a two-tailed, unpaired t-test with Welch's correction. To compare the statistical significance of differences between two treatments or conditions, two-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison tests were used. For data that are not normally distributed, the Mann-Whitney Test was used. The significance level was set at 0.05 (5%). Statistical tests and generation of graphs were done using GraphPad prism v.8.
