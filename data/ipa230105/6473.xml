In the wireless power transfer facility, all of the plurality of wireless power transfer devices may transmit power. In the wireless power transfer facility, some of the wireless power transfer devices may transmit power. The timing at which power transmission is started differs for each of the plurality of wireless power transfer devices. The timing at which power transmission is stopped also differs for each of the plurality of wireless power transfer devices. Then, the power consumed by the wireless power transfer facility may increase or decrease depending on the number of wireless power transfer devices that transmit power. As the number of wireless power transfer devices that transmit power increases, the power consumption increases.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">However, there is a limitation on the power that can be consumed by the wireless power transfer facility. The upper limit of the power that can be consumed by the wireless power transfer facility is determined, for example, by the capacity of a breaker. In addition, the upper limit of the power is also determined by the power capacity determined by the contract with the power company. Then, depending on the operating condition of the wireless power transfer device, the upper limit of the power that can be consumed may be exceeded. Therefore, the wireless power transfer facility needs to be managed so that the power consumption does not exceed the upper limit.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the present disclosure, a wireless power transfer facility that can be managed so that the power consumption does not exceed the upper limit with a simple configuration will be described.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">A wireless power transfer facility according to the present disclosure includes: a front-stage power conversion unit that converts AC front-stage input power received from an external power source into DC front-stage output power and has a plurality of output terminals for outputting the front-stage output power; a plurality of rear-stage power conversion units that are respectively connected to the output terminals of the front-stage power conversion unit and convert DC rear-stage input power including the DC front-stage output power received from the output terminals into AC rear-stage output power; a plurality of coils that are respectively connected to the plurality of rear-stage power conversion units and receive the rear-stage output power; and a controller that performs control so that the front-stage input power output to the front-stage power conversion unit does not exceed allowable power of the external power source.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The wireless power transfer facility includes a controller. The controller performs control so that the front-stage input power output to the front-stage power conversion unit does not exceed the allowable power of the external power source. As a result, in the wireless power transfer facility, the management of the power that does not exceed the upper limit can be realized by the control performed by the controller. Therefore, with a simple configuration, the wireless power transfer facility can be managed so that the power consumption does not exceed the upper limit.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The rear-stage input power of the wireless power transfer facility described above may be configured only by the front-stage output power. The front-stage power conversion unit may include: a rectifier unit that receives the front-stage input power and outputs DC intermediate power by rectifying the front-stage input power; and a transformer unit that receives the intermediate power and outputs the front-stage output power by transforming a voltage of the intermediate power. The controller may perform: an operation of instructing the transformer unit to output a first voltage as a voltage of the front-stage output power; an operation of obtaining information regarding the front-stage input power and comparing the information regarding the front-stage input power with a threshold value when the front-stage output power as the first voltage is output from the front-stage power conversion unit; and an operation of instructing the transformer unit to output a second voltage lower than the first voltage as a voltage of the front-stage output power when the information regarding the front-stage input power is not equal to or less than the threshold value. According to this configuration, by controlling the front-stage power conversion unit, it is possible to collectively suppress the power output to the plurality of rear-stage power conversion units. Therefore, it is possible to manage the power consumption with a simple configuration.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the wireless power transfer facility described above, the transformer unit may include a step-up unit that steps up the voltage of the intermediate power to a value corresponding to an instruction of the controller. According to this configuration, the configuration of the transformer unit can be simplified.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the wireless power transfer facility described above, the transformer unit may include: a step-up unit that steps up the voltage of the intermediate power to a predetermined voltage; and a step-down unit that steps down a voltage of power output from the step-up unit to a value corresponding to an instruction of the controller. According to this configuration, the circuit configuration of the step-up unit can be simplified.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the wireless power transfer facility described above, the number of step-down units provided in the transformer unit may be the same as the number of rear-stage power conversion units. The step-down unit may be arranged in series with the rear-stage power conversion unit. According to this configuration, it is possible to simplify the configuration of the wiring for connecting the front-stage power conversion unit to the rear-stage power conversion unit.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the wireless power transfer facility described above, the number of step-down units provided in the transformer unit may be one. The step-down unit may be connected in parallel with a wiring for connecting the step-up unit to the rear-stage power conversion unit. According to this configuration, since the transformer unit includes one step-down unit, the configuration of the transformer unit can be simplified.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the wireless power transfer facility described above, the rear-stage input power may be configured by the front-stage output power and auxiliary power. The wireless power transfer facility described above may further include an auxiliary power output unit that is connected to the rear-stage power conversion unit to output the auxiliary power to the rear-stage power conversion unit. The controller may control the auxiliary power output unit. According to this configuration, the insufficient power can be covered by the auxiliary power output from the auxiliary power output unit.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the wireless power transfer facility described above, the auxiliary power output unit may be at least one of the plurality of rear-stage power conversion units. The rear-stage power conversion unit serving as the auxiliary power output unit may receive AC coil output power from the coil and convert the coil output power into the DC auxiliary power. The controller may perform: an operation of obtaining information regarding the front-stage input power and comparing the information regarding the front-stage input power with a threshold value when the front-stage output power is output from the front-stage power conversion unit; and an operation of outputting the auxiliary power from the rear-stage power conversion unit serving as the auxiliary power output unit when the information regarding the front-stage input power is not equal to or less than the threshold value. According to this configuration, some rear-stage power conversion units can be used as auxiliary power output units. Therefore, it is not necessary to additionally provide a component as an auxiliary power output unit. As a result, the configuration of the wireless power transfer facility can be simplified.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the wireless power transfer facility described above, the auxiliary power output unit may be a battery. The controller may perform: an operation of obtaining information regarding the front-stage input power and comparing the information regarding the front-stage input power with a threshold value when the front-stage output power is output from the front-stage power conversion unit; an operation of charging the battery with the front-stage input power when the information regarding the front-stage input power is equal to or less than the threshold value; and an operation of discharging the auxiliary power from the battery when the information regarding the front-stage input power is not equal to or less than the threshold value. According to this configuration, auxiliary power can be output from the battery. In addition, surplus power can be stored in the battery.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Hereinafter, a wireless power transfer facility will be described in detail with reference to the drawings.
