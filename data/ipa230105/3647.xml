DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure generally relates to biomedical sample analytical systems and, more specifically, to high throughput systems for providing scalable, high speed, and high throughput molecule detection and analysis.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Biological sample analytical systems are used for various applications such as nucleic acid sequencing applications. Some of these applications may require high throughput and throughput scalability, thus necessitating an increased pixel array size for sensors (e.g., image sensors) used in such applications. In existing analytical systems, the traditional way to obtain a large pixel array size for an image sensor is to customize the design of the image sensor according to the throughput requirement. For example, for an application that requires a CMOS (complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor) image sensor to have a particular pixel array size, a designer would need to customize or completely re-design an existing image sensor having a smaller pixel array size. For a large pixel array size image sensor, the re-design of the image sensor may require not only incorporating more photodiodes in the image sensor, but also re-designing signal processing circuitry such as drivers and readout circuits that are necessary for processing electrical signals generated by the photodiodes.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Re-designing an image sensor for a specific application may involve challenging design tasks, extended time-to-market due to design-testing cycles needed for fabricating working semiconductor sensor chips, and consequently higher re-design costs. Moreover, the costs of re-design can quickly rise to an impractical or prohibitive level if there are many specific system throughput requirements necessitating different pixel array sizes for different applications. Further, the traditional approach of re-designing image sensors may be associated with poor system scalability. For example, if an image sensor manufacturer has different analytical products targeting dozens of different markets or applications, image sensors with different pixel array sizes may need to be designed separately. But the design of a smaller pixel array size image sensor may not be easily adapted or scaled to obtain a design of a larger pixel array size image sensor. Thus, the traditional way to scale a design of a smaller pixel array size image sensor to that of a larger pixel array size image sensor is often inflexible, inefficient, and costly. Therefore, it is desired to have a throughput-scalable sensing system that has a faster design turn-around time, high scalability, more design-efficiency, and more cost-efficiency.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The following presents a simplified summary of one or more examples in order to provide a basic understanding of the disclosure.

forth below in connection with the appended drawings is intended as a description of various configurations and is not intended to represent the only configurations in which the concepts described herein may be practiced. The detailed description includes specific details for the purpose of providing a thorough understanding of various concepts. However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that these concepts may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well-known structures and components are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring such concepts.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Exemplary sample throughput-scalable sensing systems will now be presented with reference to various elements of apparatus and methods. These apparatus and methods will be described in the following detailed description and illustrated in the accompanying drawing by various blocks, components, circuits, steps, processes, algorithms, etc (collectively referred to as &#x201c;elements&#x201d;). These elements may be implemented using mechanical components, optical components, electronic hardware, computer software, or any combination thereof whether such elements are implemented as hardware or software depends upon the particular application and design constraints imposed on the overall system. Further, the same or similar elements illustrated in the drawings are labeled with the same reference numbers. Different elements may be labeled with different reference numbers.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Although the following description uses terms &#x201c;first,&#x201d; &#x201c;second,&#x201d; etc to describe various elements, these elements should not be limited by the terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element from another. For example, a first semiconductor wafer could be termed a second semiconductor wafer and, similarly, a second semiconductor wafer could be termed a first semiconductor wafer, without departing from the scope of the various described examples. The first semiconductor wafer and the second semiconductor wafer can both be semiconductor wafers and, in some cases, can be separate and different semiconductor wafers.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The throughput of a traditional image sensing system is typically not scalable or easily scalable. Scaling the throughput of such a traditional system often requires complex and costly re-design, especially if there are multiple throughput requirements to be satisfied for different sensing systems or applications. Further, traditional wire bonding technologies for packaging such a sensing system may also impose obstacles or difficulties for scaling the throughput of the sensing system. For example, as described in more detail below, traditional wire bonding technologies may not be suitable for large scale image sensing system that has a large pixel array size and may further complicate the design of a system for disposing sample channels and/or optical systems across multiple image sensors.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In this disclosure, various embodiments of throughput-scalable sensing systems are provided. These systems implement wafer-level packaging of multiple sensors disposed on multiple semiconductor dies. The multiple semiconductor dies and a plurality of dicing streets are arranged such that the multiple wafer-level packaged semiconductor dies can be diced from a single semiconductor wafer as a group. Based on the throughput scaling requirement for the sensing system and based on a throughput capacity of each sensor, the number of sensors in the sensing system can be readily determined. As a result, the throughput capacity of the sensing system can easily be scaled based on the specific application-related throughput requirement for the sensing system. Such a throughput-scalable sensing system does not require complex and costly re-design of the sensor itself (e.g., redesign to add more photosensitive elements in a single semiconductor die). Such a throughput-scalable sensing system also does not require a complex re-design or re-configuration of devices or sub-systems associated with the sensors.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Furthermore, as described in more detail below, because multiple packaged semiconductor dies in a throughput-scale sensing system are diced from a semiconductor wafer as a group, surfaces of the dies can be approximately or substantially flat across multiple dies in a sensing system. This is because the surface of a semiconductor wafer is typically flat or substantially flat and because the multiple dies are diced from the wafer as a group. The approximately or substantially flat surfaces across multiple wafer-level packaged semiconductor dies enable easy disposing of an optical system and/or a sample channel across multiple dies. This significantly reduces designing effort and solves the problem or difficulty of disposing an optical system and/or a sample channel in a traditional wire-bonding based sensing system. As described in more detail below, the group dicing technology described in this disclosure can further be combined with through-silicon via (TSV) and redistribution layer (RDL) technologies to provide signal redistribution for reducing, avoiding, or replacing the need for wire bonding. The TSV packaged semiconductor dies can maintain substantially flat surfaces across multiple semiconductor dies for enabling easy sharing of a single optical waveguide and a single sample channel across multiple sensors of a throughput-scalable sensing system.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Moreover, using the various embodiments of throughput-scalable sensing systems described in this disclosure, many biological or chemical samples can be processed or analyzed in parallel or concurrently. This improves the analysis throughput and speed over conventional analytical systems, which typically processes samples sequentially due to the throughput capacity limitation. Further, the group dicing technology enables a sensing system to be easily scaled or stacked up to provide parallel signal and data processing in a large-scale sensing application. The through-silicon via (TSV) and redistribution layer (RDL) technologies further eliminate the need for traditional wire bonding techniques for signal routing; and further enable the implementation of a high throughput or a throughput-scalable sensing system. In some embodiments, the throughput-scalable sensing system can enable concurrent data processing in the order of, for example, millions, billions, or trillions of data units (e.g., data bits representing sensed photons). The various embodiments of the throughput-scalable sensing systems can be used in or with different applications for analyzing biological or chemical samples including, for example, nucleotide acid sequencing applications and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) applications.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating a top view and a cross-sectional view a traditional image sensor system <b>100</b>. System <b>100</b> includes an image sensor <b>102</b> mounted on a frame <b>110</b> of an image sensor package. The image sensor package can include, for example, a heat sink, pins, and epoxy plastic for providing protection to image sensor <b>102</b>. Image sensor <b>102</b> is packaged using a traditional wire bonding based method. For example, conventionally, a plurality of bonding pads <b>104</b> is disposed at the edges of image sensor <b>102</b>. Correspondingly, a plurality of bonding pads <b>108</b> is disposed at frame <b>110</b> of the image sensor package. A plurality of bonding wires <b>106</b> electrically couples pads <b>104</b> to corresponding pads <b>108</b>, thereby communicating electrical signals between image sensor <b>102</b> and an external device (not shown).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Traditional image sensing system <b>100</b> has many limitations. As described above, the throughput of such as system is typically not easily scalable. Scaling the throughput of such a system often requires re-designing of image sensor <b>102</b> to incorporate more photosensitive elements for satisfying the throughput requirement. Incorporating more photosensitive elements inevitably requires increasing the physical chip area of image sensor <b>102</b>, re-designing the signal processing circuitry, re-designing the numbers and positions of bonding pads <b>104</b> and <b>108</b>, and many design-testing cycles. The scaling of such a traditional image sensing system <b>100</b> thus requires significant redesign effort, extended time cycle to market, and increased cost. The scaling of such a traditional system becomes even more complex and costly if there are multiple throughput requirements to be satisfied for different sensing systems used for different applications.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Another limitation of traditional image sensing system <b>100</b> is specific to using system <b>100</b> for biological or chemical sample analysis applications. This limitation relates to the flatness of the surface of image sensing system <b>100</b>. In such applications, sample channels or sample containers are frequently disposed above image sensing system <b>100</b> such that the light emitted by the samples can travel directly downward to the image sensors without extra optical signal routing. As shown in the cross-sectional view of image sensing system <b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, bonding wires <b>106</b> are conventionally protected by epoxy material <b>112</b>. Thus, due to the using of bonding wires <b>106</b> and the epoxy <b>112</b>, the surface of image sensing system <b>100</b> may not be flat or substantially flat. Disposing a sample channel or container above such an uneven surface may require additional engineering efforts and may not be easily achieved. The task is further complicated if a sample channel or container is to be shared across multiple image sensors <b>102</b>. For example, additional epoxy material may need to be disposed to the surface of image sensors <b>102</b> to make the surface of system <b>100</b> flat. Or the sample channel/container may need to be redesign/reconfigured to fit into the uneven surfaces of one or more image sensors <b>102</b>. Both approaches impose challenging design tasks. For instance, additional epoxy material may interfere with the light emitted from the sample disposed above image sensor <b>102</b>, by absorbing, diffracting, and/or reflecting the emitted light. Thus, the additional epoxy material may render light detection impossible or impractical, or at least degrade the performance of image sensing system <b>100</b>. Redesigning the sample channel/container to fit into the uneven surfaces of sensors <b>102</b> may sometimes be impractical or at least increase the cost of system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Unlike traditional image sensor system <b>100</b>, various embodiments of throughput-scalable sensing systems are described in this disclosure. These throughput-scalable sensing systems are based on group dicing and based on wafer-level packaging of multiple sensors disposed on multiple semiconductor dies. The multiple semiconductor dies and a plurality of dicing streets are arranged such that the multiple semiconductor dies can be diced from a single semiconductor wafer as a group. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> illustrates an exemplary wafer map <b>200</b> of such a semiconductor wafer. A semiconductor wafer is a thin slice of semiconductor (e.g., Silicon) used for fabricating integrated circuits and/or other semiconductor devices such as sensors. Various types of sensors are described in this disclosure, including image sensors, chemically sensitive sensors, transmembrane pore based sensors, photon counting sensors, and quanta CMOS image sensors (QISs). These sensors are described in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">An image sensor is a sensor that detects photons, generate electrical signals (also referred to as photoelectrons) based on the detected photons, and transmit the electrical signals for further signal processing. In an image sensing system, photons can be generated as a result of fluorescence or chemiluminescence emissions from biological or chemical samples being analyzed. The photons are then collected and detected by photosensitive elements (e.g., pixels) included in an image sensor. Photosensitive elements can include, for example, photodiodes (e.g., silicon based photodiodes) for detecting photons and generating electrical signals based on detected photons. In some embodiments, photosensitive elements may also include amplifiers (e.g., avalanche amplification). The electrical signals generated by an image sensor can represent various photon information including the number of photons collected, the position of photons, and/or the intensity of photons. As described in more detail below, an image sensor described in this disclosure is not limited to a sensor that transmits electrical signals or information for generating an image. An image sensor used for analyzing biological or chemical samples (e.g., nucleotide acid sequencing applications, polymerase chain reaction applications) can include sensors that detect photons and transmit electrical signals for any type of signal processing with or without generating an image.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, wafer map <b>200</b> represents wafer-level packaged semiconductor dies and their arrangements on a single semiconductor wafer. In some embodiments, as described in more detail below, wafer-level packaging of the semiconductor dies can include one or more of forming through-silicon vias (TSV), depositing redistribution layers, depositing passivation layers, forming electrically-conductive spheres, and disposing solder mask layers. In this disclosure, wafer-level packaged semiconductor dies are sometimes also referred to as packaged semiconductor dies or TSV-packaged semiconductor dies. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, each individual block (e.g., block <b>202</b>) shown on wafer map <b>200</b> can represent a packaged semiconductor die of a semiconductor wafer. A semiconductor die is a unit or a single block of semiconductor material on which integrated circuits or other devices (e.g., sensors) are fabricated. For example, an image sensor having a plurality of photosensitive elements (e.g., pixels) can be fabricated on each semiconductor die represented by an individual block (e.g., block <b>202</b>) shown on wafer map <b>200</b>. Exemplary embodiments of such an image sensor is described in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some embodiments, each image sensor can be fabricated on an individual semiconductor die. An image sensor may have a pre-configured or a pre-determined throughput capacity represented by a pixel array size. For example, an image senor may have a pixel array size of 8 megapixels, 16 megapixels, 32 megapixels, etc. Typically, for a given semiconductor process (e.g., a 45 nm CMOS image sensor process), a larger pixel array size requires more photosensitive elements such as more photodiodes. As a result, an image sensor with higher throughput capacity may require a larger physical area of a semiconductor die. In some embodiments, rather than increasing the area of a single semiconductor die, a high throughput sensing system or throughput-scalable sensing system can also be obtained based on group dicing of multiple packaged semiconductor dies.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> illustrates an exemplary group dicing plan for dicing packaged semiconductor dies from a semiconductor wafer as groups. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, multiple packaged semiconductor dies can be diced as a group, instead of individually, from the semiconductor wafer represented by wafer map <b>200</b>. Dicing, sometimes also referred to as wafer dicing, is a process by which packaged semiconductor dies are separated from a semiconductor wafer or a wafer-level packaged semiconductor wafer. A dicing process may include scribing, breaking, mechanical sawing, and/or laser cutting. Dicing is typically performed at or near dicing streets between the packaged semiconductor dies. The dicing streets can be, for example, 80 micrometers (um) wide.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, an exemplary dicing group is represented by a block <b>210</b> illustrated on wafer map <b>200</b>. The exemplary dicing group represented by block <b>210</b> may include a plurality of individual packaged semiconductor dies (e.g., 8, 16, 32, 64, etc.). An image sensor with a particular throughput capacity may be fabricated on each packaged semiconductor die in the group. Therefore, block <b>210</b> on wafer map <b>200</b> can also represent a group of image sensors disposed on the corresponding packaged semiconductor dies <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> illustrates a throughput-scalable image sensing system obtained based on dicing multiple packaged semiconductor dies as a group from a semiconductor wafer or a wafer-level packaged semiconductor wafer. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, an image sensor is pre-fabricated or disposed on each packaged semiconductor die. For example, one image sensor can be fabricated or disposed on packaged semiconductor die <b>222</b>A. The image sensor disposed on packaged semiconductor die <b>222</b>A may include, for example, a plurality of photosensitive elements <b>224</b>, a plurality of electrically-conductive layers (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>), a plurality of electrically-conductive pads <b>226</b>, and a semiconductor (e.g., silicon) substrate <b>228</b>. The components and structure of exemplary image sensors are described in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, based on a group dicing plan, the packaged semiconductor dies of the semiconductor wafer can be diced in groups. The example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> shows that a group of six packaged semiconductor dies <b>222</b>A-F are separated from the semiconductor wafer by, for example, laser cutting along the dicing streets <b>230</b>A-D without separating the packaged semiconductor dies <b>222</b>A-F from one another. Dicing streets <b>230</b>A-D represent the perimeter of the group of dies <b>222</b>A-F. And therefore, in group dicing, the laser cutting is performed along the perimeter of the group of dies <b>222</b>A-F, but not between the dies. Each of packaged semiconductor dies <b>222</b>A-F can be pre-fabricated or disposed with an image sensor having a particular throughout capacity (e.g., pixel array size). The six image sensors pre-fabricated or disposed on packaged semiconductor dies <b>222</b>A-F can thus form an image sensing system <b>220</b> that has six-times throughput capacity than each individual image sensor. In general, if each image sensor in an image sensing system (e.g., system <b>220</b>) has a pixel array size of M megapixels and there are N number of image sensors in the image sensing system, the total pixel array size of the image sensing system is then M&#xd7;N. In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, if each image sensor disposed on semiconductor dies <b>220</b>A-F has a pixel array size of 64 megapixels, and a group of six packaged semiconductor dies <b>220</b>A-F form the image sensing system <b>220</b>, image sensing system <b>220</b> can be scaled to have a pixel array size of 384 megapixels.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> illustrates that image sensing system <b>220</b> include six image sensors disposed on six packaged semiconductor dies <b>220</b>A-F, it is appreciated that the number of image sensors in a particular image sensing system can be determined or preconfigured to any desired number satisfying a throughput scaling requirement. For example, if a particular image sensing system used for a nucleotide acid sequencing application requires a total pixel array size of 1000 megapixels (or 1 Gigapixels), and if each image sensor has a pixel array size of 64 megapixels, the number of image sensors required for such an image sensing system would be about 16 (e.g., 1000/64). Correspondingly, 16 packaged semiconductor dies can be diced from the semiconductor wafer as a group (i.e, without separating the 16 dies from one another). Accordingly, based on the throughput scaling requirement for the image sensing system and based on a throughput capacity of each image sensor, the number of image sensors in the image sensing system can be readily determined. As a result, the throughput capacity of the image sensing system can easily be scalable based on requirements of the specific applications (e.g., a DNA sequencing application, a PCR application) of the image sensing system. Such a throughput-scalable system does not require complex and costly re-design of the image sensor itself (e.g., redesign to add more photosensitive elements in a single semiconductor die).</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Further, a throughput-scalable image sensing system described in this disclosure also does not require a complex re-design or re-configuration of devices or sub-systems operating with the image sensors. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating a throughput-scalable sensing system <b>300</b>. Sensing system <b>300</b> includes a plurality of sensors <b>320</b>A-N. As described below in more detail, sensors <b>320</b>A-N can be image sensors, photon detection sensors, chemically sensitive sensors, transmembrane sensors, quanta CMOS image sensors (QISs) and/or other types of sensors used for performing biological or chemical analysis. In a similar manner as described above, sensors <b>320</b>A-N can be pre-fabricated or disposed on packaged semiconductor dies that are diced from a semiconductor wafer or wafer-level packaged semiconductor wafer as a group. In some embodiments, sensing system <b>300</b> can further include a fluidic reaction channel <b>302</b>, an optical system <b>304</b>, and a signal and data processing system <b>330</b>. In some embodiments, fluidic reaction channel <b>302</b>, sometimes also referred to as sample channel <b>302</b>, is configured to exchange liquid reagent for analyzing biological or chemical samples. For example, in a DNA sequencing analysis, sequencing samples can be disposed in sequencing reagents flowing through fluidic reaction channel <b>302</b>. In some embodiments, optical system <b>304</b> can be configured to perform various functions including providing an excitation light (e.g., a laser light), guiding or directing the excitation light to the samples under analysis, and/or guiding or directing light emitted from the samples to sensors <b>320</b>A-N (e.g., fluorescence or chemiluminescence light).

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, a plurality of sensors <b>320</b>A-N is pre-fabricated or disposed on a plurality of packaged semiconductor dies <b>422</b>.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, because packaged dies <b>422</b>A-N are diced from the semiconductor wafer or a packaged wafer as a group, the upper surfaces of packaged dies <b>422</b>A-N can be approximately or substantially flat across packaged dies <b>422</b>A-N. This is because the surface of a semiconductor wafer or a wafer-level packaged wafer is typically flat or substantially flat. The approximately or substantially flat surfaces across multiple packaged semiconductor dies <b>422</b> enable easy disposing of optical waveguide <b>404</b> and/or fluidic reaction channel <b>302</b> across multiple dies.

Optical waveguide <b>404</b> can include an approximately or substantially flat surface in contact with the upper surfaces of plurality of packaged semiconductor dies <b>422</b>A-N on which image sensors <b>320</b>A-N are arranged or disposed. In turn, fluidic reaction channel <b>302</b> can be disposed above optical waveguide <b>404</b>. Fluidic reaction channel <b>302</b> can include an approximately or substantially flat surface in contact with optical waveguide <b>404</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, in some embodiments, fluidic reaction channel <b>302</b> can include a fluid inlet <b>408</b> and fluid outlet <b>410</b>. Liquid reagent <b>414</b> can be directed to flow into channel <b>302</b> from fluid inlet <b>408</b> and flow out of channel <b>302</b> from fluid outlet <b>410</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some embodiments, optical waveguide <b>404</b> is configured to deliver an excitation light <b>406</b> along its longitudinal direction. For example, optical waveguide <b>404</b> may include one or more light-guiding layers (e.g., two cladding layers and an optical core layer) that direct excitation light <b>406</b> to illuminate biological or chemical samples <b>412</b> disposed inside fluidic reaction channel <b>302</b>. In some embodiments, fluidic reaction channel <b>302</b> can operate as a part of optical waveguide <b>404</b> (e.g., operating as the optical core layer of optical waveguide <b>404</b>). Thus, in some embodiments, fluidic reaction channel <b>302</b> and one or more light-guiding layers may be collectively referred to as optical waveguide <b>404</b>. Excitation light <b>406</b> can be generated by a light source, which can include a laser or a light-emitting diode (LED) based light source that generates and emits excitation light <b>406</b>. Excitation light <b>406</b> can be, for example, a green light (e.g., a light having wavelength in the range of about 520-560 nm) or any other desired light having a desired wavelength or wavelength range. The light source that generates excitation light <b>406</b> can be, for example, a diode laser or LED. Details of the optical waveguide <b>404</b>, fluidic reaction channel <b>302</b>, and excitation light <b>406</b> are further described in International Application No. PCT/CN2019/087455, entitled &#x201c;ANALYTICAL SYSTEM FOR MOLECULE DETECTION AND SENSING.&#x201d; filed on May 17, 2019, the content of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, because packaged semiconductor dies <b>422</b>A-N (on which image sensors <b>320</b>A-N are arranged) are diced as a group from a same wafer-level packaged semiconductor wafer, the surfaces of packaged semiconductor dies <b>422</b>A-N are approximately or substantially flat. The flatness of the surfaces across the packaged semiconductor dies diced from a same semiconductor wafer as a group enables easy sharing or disposing of a single optical waveguide (e.g., waveguide <b>404</b>) and a single fluidic reaction channel (e.g., channel <b>302</b>) across multiple sensors <b>320</b>A-N of a throughput-scalable sensing system. Such a sharing may not be practical or possible in traditional sensing systems. As described above, a traditional image sensor (e.g., image sensor <b>102</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) is packaged using a wire bonding based method. As a result, bonding wires and epoxy for protecting the bonding wires may render the surface of the image sensor uneven. The uneven surface makes it difficult, impractical, or impossible to share optical waveguide and fluidic reaction channel across multiple image sensors. The uneven surface of an image sensor may also negatively impact the performance of the fluidic reaction channel, because some portions of the channel may need to be curved/shaped due to the uneven surface of the image sensor. A curved fluidic reaction channel restricts or limits the fluid flow inside the channel. As described in more detail below, the group dicing technology described in this disclosure can further be combined with through-silicon via (TSV) and redistribution layer (RDL) technologies to provide signal redistribution for reducing, avoiding, or replacing the need for wire bonding. As described in more detail below, the TSV packaged semiconductor dies can maintain approximately or substantially flat surfaces across multiple semiconductor dies for enabling sharing or disposing of a single optical waveguide (e.g., waveguide <b>404</b>) and a single fluidic reaction channel (e.g., channel <b>302</b>) across multiple sensors <b>320</b>A-N of a throughput-scalable sensing system.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, in some embodiments, samples <b>412</b>A-N (e.g., clusters of biological or chemical samples) can be disposed at positions corresponding to sensors <b>320</b>A-N, respectively. For example, sample <b>412</b>A is disposed above sensor <b>320</b>A and is physically aligned with sensor <b>320</b>A; sample <b>412</b>B is disposed above sensor <b>320</b>B and is physically aligned with sensor <b>320</b>B; and so forth. The light emitted from samples <b>412</b>A-N disposed in fluidic reaction channel <b>302</b> can be detected by corresponding sensors <b>320</b>A-N. Because samples <b>412</b>A-N and corresponding sensors <b>320</b>A-N are aligned with each other, respectively, the light collection efficiency of sensors <b>320</b>A-N can be improved or maximized. Based on the group dicing technology described above, multiple sensors <b>320</b>A-N can form a throughput-scalable sensing system, effectively increasing the throughput capacity of the sensing system. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> illustrates that sensors <b>320</b>A-N are arranged as a one-dimensional array, it is appreciated that they can be arranged as a two-dimensional array of any size (e.g., 3&#xd7;3, 6&#xd7;6, 10&#xd7;10, etc.).</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In some embodiments, excitation light <b>406</b> may not be delivered using optical waveguide <b>404</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>. Instead, excitation light <b>406</b> can be guided to directly illuminate samples <b>412</b>A-N, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> is a cross-sectional view illustrating an exemplary fluidic reaction channel <b>302</b> with direct illumination across a plurality of sensors <b>320</b>A-N in a throughput-scalable image sensing system <b>400</b>B. System <b>400</b>B can be configured to be substantially the same as system <b>400</b>A except that system <b>400</b>B does not include an optical waveguide for directing excitation light <b>406</b>. For example, to illuminate samples <b>412</b>A-N in system <b>400</b>B without using an optical waveguide, excitation light <b>406</b> can be guided to provide illumination to samples <b>412</b>A-N from above fluidic reaction channel <b>302</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>. Excitation light <b>406</b> can be guided using, for example, focused lens, filters, and/or any other desired optical elements.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">With reference back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, based on the detection of light emitted from samples disposed in fluidic reaction channel <b>302</b>, multiple sensors <b>320</b>A-N can generate and transmit electrical signals to a signal and data processing system <b>330</b> for further signal and data processing. As a result, data generated for samples disposed in the fluidic reaction channel <b>302</b> can be processed in parallel in a large scale. Data generated for many samples can be processed concurrently, in substantially the same time, or in a short time period. The capability of concurrent or parallel processing of data improves the testing throughput and speed over conventional analytical systems. Further, as discussed above, the group dicing technology enables the image sensing system to be easily scaled or stacked up to provide parallel signal and data processing in a large-scale image sensing application (e.g., 100 meg-1 giga imaging application). For example, 20 image sensors can provide 20 times more image sensing area due to the increased number of photosensitive elements (e.g., pixels) included in the 20 image sensors. If each image sensor has 100 meg pixel array size, 20 image sensors would have 2000 meg or 2 giga pixels, thereby greatly improving the throughput capacity and analysis speed. Further, such a scaling of the sensing system does not require complex system re-design associated with traditional methods for providing a high-throughput sensing system. For example, in some embodiments, each sensor <b>320</b>A-N can have its own amplifier, filter, and/or associated shutter and readout circuitry, and can be electrically isolated from other sensors. Thus, the re-design effort for sensors <b>320</b>A-N and their associated signal processing circuitry can be significantly reduced or minimized.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">A throughput-scalable image sensing system obtained based on the group dicing technology described in this disclosure can be particularly useful for many applications involving photon counting. Such applications include, for example, analysis of biological or chemical samples using light emitted from the samples. For example, based on the photons collected and detected by multiple image sensors in a high-throughput image sensing system, multiple nucleotide acid sequencing processes can be concurrently performed. Further, for sample analysis applications such as nucleotide acid sequencing applications, an image sensing system (e.g., system <b>300</b>) is required to perform photon counting and generate an image based on the results of photon counting. The image thus generated may represent certain information (e.g., photon intensity) associated with the sample analysis. But such an image may not be required to be a continuous image or may be allowed to have gaps between different portions of the image. A sensing system obtained based on group dicing of multiple dies may generate image with gaps.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">With reference to back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, multiple image sensors are disposed on packaged semiconductor dies <b>222</b>A-F. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, photosensitive elements of the multiple image sensors are not physically continuous or connected with one another. For example, photosensitive elements <b>224</b> of the image sensor disposed on die <b>222</b>A are physically separated from photosensitive elements <b>234</b> of the image sensor disposed on die <b>222</b>B. Between the photosensitive elements of different image sensors, other device structures or components (e.g., pads <b>226</b>) and dicing streets (e.g., dicing street <b>235</b> between dies <b>222</b>A and <b>222</b>B) may exist. As a result, an image generated by multiple image sensors disposed on separate packaged semiconductor dies <b>222</b>A-F may not be continues or may have one or more image gaps between different portions of the image. Image gaps can be blank or dark areas between different portions of an image due to the lack of photon sensing between the photosensitive elements. Such image gaps may not be acceptable for certain imaging applications that require a continuous image to be provided. Such applications may include, for example, traditional photo-capturing applications (e.g., taking portrait photos, picturing a real-world object, etc.), surveillance camera applications, or security monitoring applications.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Further, for those applications in which image gaps are not acceptable or tolerable, if a raw image generated by multiple image sensors is not continues or has image gaps, significant image processing efforts may be required to remove or mitigate the image gaps. For example, post-capturing image processing may be applied to stitch portions of the images together to provide an acceptable image without image gaps. Thus, an image sensing system with multiple image sensors that have discretely-positioned photosensitive elements (e.g., elements that are not physically continuous or connected with one another) may not be easily designed or implemented for certain imaging applications. In contrast, such an imaging system may not have or may have minimum impact on performance of a biological or chemical sample analysis application such as a nucleotide acid sequencing application. For many biological or chemical sample analysis applications, the image sensors are used to count photons emitted from the samples and generate an image base on the photons. The image can be allowed to have image gaps, because the analysis results can be derived based on the information related to photon detections (e.g., the intensity of photons, position of photons, pattern of photons, etc.). The derivation of the analysis results does not require the image to be continuous or without image gaps. Therefore, a high-throughput image sensing system including multiple image sensors obtained based on group dicing technologies can be readily used for many biological or chemical sample analysis application or any other photon counting based applications, without requiring any mitigation effort to remove the image gaps caused by the discretely-positioned photosensitive elements.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">With reference back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, sensors <b>320</b>A-N can be different types of image sensors, such as back-side illumination based image sensors or front-side illumination based sensors. As described above, because image sensors necessarily detect photons, they are sometimes also referred to as, or used as, photon detection sensors, photon counting sensors, or photoelectron counting sensors. In addition, while the above description with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> use image sensors as examples, sensors <b>320</b>A-N can also be other type of sensors such as chemically sensitive sensors, transmembrane pores based sensors, photon detection sensors, photon counting sensors, and/or quanta CMOS image sensors (QIS). These types of sensors are each described in more detail below. Further, it is appreciated that blocks in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> are for illustration purposes and not for defining the boundary of devices. For example, one or more components, devices, or subsystems of signal and data processing system <b>330</b> may be integrated or combined with sensors <b>320</b>A-N, and vice versa.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> illustrates an embodiment of an image sensing system <b>500</b>A with a cross-sectional view of an embodiment of a TSV packaged BSI-based image sensor <b>520</b>A. Image sensor <b>520</b>A can be one embodiment of one or more of sensors <b>320</b>A-N as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, image sensor <b>520</b>A includes a semiconductor substrate <b>502</b>, on which integrated circuits or devices can be fabricated or disposed. Semiconductor substrate <b>502</b> can be, for example, a silicon-based substrate for enabling the integrated circuits or devices to be fabricated using complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) processes. Image sensor <b>520</b>A can further include a photon detection layer <b>504</b>, one or more conductive layers <b>506</b>, one or more dielectric layers <b>507</b>, and a filter <b>508</b>. In some embodiments, photon detection layer <b>504</b> includes a plurality of photosensitive elements <b>505</b>A-N (collectively as photosensitive elements <b>505</b>). Each photosensitive element <b>505</b> may also be referred to as a pixel. And the plurality of photosensitive elements <b>505</b> may form a pixel array. In some embodiments, photosensitive elements <b>505</b> can include, for example, photodiodes (e.g., silicon-based photodiodes) and amplifiers, for detecting photons and generating electrical signals (e.g., photoelectrons) based on detected photons. Similar to those described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>A</figref>, a fluidic reaction channel (e.g., channel <b>302</b>) and an optical system (e.g., system <b>304</b>) may be disposed above image sensor <b>520</b>A. To obtain fluorescence light, for example, the optical system can be an optical waveguide that delivers an excitation light to the samples disposed in the fluidic reaction channel. In some embodiments, the optical system does not include an optical waveguide. Instead, the optical system can include focus lens, optical filters, and/or any other desired optical elements for providing illumination from above fluidic reaction channel <b>302</b> (similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>). The light emitted as a result of analyzing the biological or chemical samples disposed in the fluidic reaction channel may be detected by the photosensitive elements <b>505</b> of photon detection layer <b>504</b>. Based on detected photons, the photosensitive elements <b>505</b> of the photon detection layer <b>504</b> generate electrical signals (photoelectrons). While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> illustrates one image sensor <b>520</b>A, it is appreciated that multiple image sensors can be included in image sensing system <b>500</b>A. The multiple image sensors can be configured similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A or <b>4</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, image sensor <b>520</b>A illustrates an embodiment of a back-side illumination (BSI) based image sensor structure. In a BSI-based image sensor, the photon detection layer <b>504</b> are disposed closer to the samples under analysis than to the conductive layers <b>506</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, fluidic reaction channel <b>302</b>, or a portion thereof, can be disposed above photon detection layer <b>504</b> (and above the filter <b>508</b>, optional passivation layer <b>510</b>, and/or optical system <b>304</b>). Therefore, the biological or chemical samples disposed inside fluidic reaction channel <b>302</b> are positioned further to conductive layers <b>506</b> than photon detection layer <b>504</b> in the vertical direction. Thus, in a BSI-based image sensor, the light emitted from the samples travels to photon detection layer <b>504</b> without having to traveling through multiple conductive layers <b>506</b>. As a result, the distance of light traveling in an BSI-based image sensor is shorter compared to that of an FSI-based image sensor. BSI-based image sensors can thus greatly reduce the signal loss and cross talk due the shorter distance that the light emitted from the samples has to travel. The shorter distance of light traveling in an BSI-based image sensor also eliminates or reduces the need for additional fluorescence or chemiluminescence light collection optics. Further, by eliminating the multiple conductive layers in the light path, a substantial or entire area of photosensitive elements <b>505</b> of photon detection layer <b>504</b> can have access or be sensitive to the light emitted from the samples. A BSI-based image sensor can thus reduce light absorption compared to an FSI-based image sensor. In some embodiments, the quantum efficiency of a BSI-based image sensor can be improved (e.g., by 80-90%) comparing to an FSI-based image sensor. Reducing signal loss and having higher quantum efficiency in turn improves image quality and resolution, and reduces the need for a highly-sensitive image sensor.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, the electrical signals, or photoelectrons, generated by photon detection layer <b>504</b> can be collected and conducted by the plurality of conductive layers <b>506</b>. Conductive layers <b>506</b> can include one or more layers of metal layers and vias interconnecting the metal layers. Conductive layers <b>506</b> are configured to electrically couple the photosensitive elements <b>505</b> to one or more electrically-conductive pads <b>514</b>. For example, conductive layers <b>506</b> can transmit the electrical signals generated by the photosensitive elements <b>505</b> of photon detection layer <b>504</b> to one or more electrically-conductive pads <b>514</b>. In some embodiments, the electrical signals generated by the photosensitive elements <b>505</b> may be further processed before they are transmitted to electrically-conductive pads <b>514</b>. For example, conductive layers <b>506</b> can be part of a signal amplification, readout, and/or conversion circuitry (not shown). These signal amplification, readout, and/or conversion circuitry are collectively referred to as the signal processing circuitry, which can be part of signal and data processing system <b>330</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. In some embodiments, the signal processing circuitry can include, for example, avalanche amplification circuitry, an in-pixel readout circuit, a correlated double sampling (CDS) circuit, a sense amplifier, and/or an analog-to-digital (ADC) conversion circuit. In some embodiments, one or more of the signal amplification, readout, and/or conversion circuitry are implemented for each photosensitive element <b>505</b> (e.g., each pixel) or shared across multiple photosensitive elements <b>505</b> (e.g., shared by each readout cluster) of photon detection layer <b>504</b>. For instance, each image sensor fabricated or disposed on a semiconductor die can have its own signal processing circuitry, which processes the electrical signals generated by the particular image sensor independently from other image sensors. This enables parallel or concurrent processing of electrical signals of multiple image sensors, thereby improving the overall throughput of the image sensing system.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In some embodiments, one or more of the signal amplification, readout, and/or conversion circuitry can be implemented in the same semiconductor die or wafer as the photosensitive elements <b>505</b>. In some embodiments, one or more of the signal amplification, readout, and/or conversion circuitry can be implemented in a different semiconductor die or wafer than that for the photosensitive elements <b>505</b>. For example, as described in more detail below, a first semiconductor wafer (also referred to as a detection wafer) can be configured to implemented photosensitive elements <b>505</b> (e.g., photodiodes) and a second semiconductor wafer (also referred to as an ASIC wafer) can be configured to implement a signal processing system including the readout circuitry. Electrical coupling between the two semiconductor wafers can use, for example, wafer-level packaging techniques such as wafer bonding and TSV techniques. As a result, the detection wafer can include many more photosensitive elements due to the extra wafer area made available by disposing signal processing circuitry in another wafer, thereby further improving throughput of the image sensing system.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, image sensor <b>520</b>A can further include a filter <b>508</b> and an optional passivation layer <b>510</b>. Filter <b>508</b> can be disposed between optical system <b>304</b> (e.g., an optical waveguide) and photon detection layer <b>504</b>. In some embodiments, filter <b>508</b> can be configured to remove a substantial portion of light having a first wavelength range. The first wavelength range is different from one or more wavelength ranges associated with the light emitted as a result of analyzing the biological or chemical samples disposed in fluidic reaction channel <b>302</b>. For example, filter <b>508</b> can include a coating deposited on photon detection layer <b>504</b> for removing a substantial portion of scattered or leakage light in the wavelength range of the excitation light (e.g., green light), while allowing a substantial portion of the light emitted from the samples to pass (e.g., yellow light and/or red light). Thus, filter <b>508</b> can improve the signal-to-noise ratio by allowing desired light signals to reach photon detection layer <b>504</b> while blocking undesired light signals (e.g., background noise and/or excitation light leakage). In some embodiments, filter <b>508</b> can be a different type of coating deposited on photon detection layer <b>504</b> such that a plurality of filter cells of the filter <b>508</b> is interleaved (e.g., forming a chessboard pattern separating different types of cells by a grid structure) to reduce crosstalk between adjacent photosensitive elements <b>505</b> (e.g., adjacent pixels) of the photon detection layer <b>504</b>. Crosstalk is often undesired because the light emitted from one sample can be affected by the light emitted from another sample, resulting in signal distortion for some photosensitive elements <b>505</b> (e.g., pixels) of an image sensor. Filter <b>508</b> can remove, for example, a substantial portion of all lights (e.g., absorb lights in all wavelength ranges or any desired wavelength ranges). Thus, by interleaving filter cells of filter <b>508</b>, crosstalk can be reduced or eliminated.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In some embodiments, image sensor <b>520</b>A can include a passivation layer <b>510</b>.

Such a system can be scaled to have high throughput (e.g., millions or billions of image pixels).

Wire bonding techniques may be associated with many disadvantages or drawbacks as described above, and in particular, may impose difficulties in a high throughput image sensing system that has large or high-density pixel arrays.

Through-hole vias <b>512</b> can form a channel or pipe that cuts through the a portion or entire thickness of semiconductor substrate <b>502</b> at or near the areas of pads <b>514</b>. Subsequently, a redistribution layer (RDL) <b>516</b> can be deposited for signal re-routing. An RDL is an extra conductive layer (e.g., metal layer) that renders input/output pads (e.g., pads <b>514</b>) of an integrated circuit or device available in other locations. In some embodiments as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, RDL <b>516</b> can include conductors at least partially enclosed by through-hole vias <b>512</b>.

RDL <b>516</b> electrically couples pads <b>514</b> to spheres <b>518</b>, thereby rerouting the electrical signals from pads <b>514</b> to spheres <b>518</b>. Spheres <b>518</b> can be disposed at a surface <b>526</b>. In some embodiments, surface <b>526</b> can be a processed substrate surface (e.g., a thinned surface) of another semiconductor die or wafer. For example, as described in more detail below, a carrier wafer can be bonded to the wafer on which the image sensors are disposed or fabricated. The substrate of the carrier wafer can be thinned. Substrate <b>501</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> illustrates such a thinned portion of the carrier wafer. And thus surface <b>526</b> is a thinned surface of substrate <b>501</b> of the carrier wafer. In some embodiments, no carrier wafer is used and therefore surface <b>526</b> can be, for example, a front surface of a semiconductor die (e.g., the surface at or near which conductive layers <b>506</b> for routing signals are disposed).</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, using through-hole vias <b>512</b> and RDL <b>516</b>, electrical signals can be re-routed from first surface <b>524</b> of the semiconductor die to second surface <b>526</b>. Further signal routings or coupling can thus be rendered at second surface <b>526</b> using electrically-conductive spheres <b>518</b>. For instance, wafer level packaging or bonding can be performed such that a first wafer (e.g., a detection wafer) comprising multiple image sensors can be electrically coupled to a second wafer (e.g., a signal processing wafer or ASIC wafer) using the electrically-conductive spheres <b>518</b>.

A transmembrane pore based sensor can be used in, for example, nucleic acid sequencing applications such as RNA/DNA sequencing applications. For example, in a DNA sequencing application, individual nucleotide incorporation events may be detected. Such events may include incorporation of a nucleotide into a growing strand that is complementary to a template. An enzyme (e.g., DNA polymerase) may incorporate nucleotides to a growing polynucleotide chain. The incorporated nucleotide is complimentary to the corresponding template nucleic acid strand, which is hybridized to the growing strand (e.g., polymerase chain reaction or PCR). The nucleotide incorporation events release tags from the nucleotides, which pass through a transmembrane pore and can be detected.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>E</figref>, in some embodiments, transmembrane pore based sensor <b>520</b>E includes a semiconductor substrate <b>572</b>, one or more conductive layers <b>576</b> disposed above the semiconductor substrate <b>572</b>, one or more detection electrodes <b>578</b> disposed above the semiconductor substrate <b>572</b> and conductive layers <b>576</b>, and a lipid bilayer <b>575</b> disposed above detection electrodes <b>578</b>. The semiconductor substrate <b>572</b> and one or more conductive layers <b>576</b> can implement integrated circuits for operation of the transmembrane pore based sensor <b>520</b>E.

For example, lipid bilayer <b>575</b> can include at least one ofa planar lipid bilayer, a supported bilayer, or a liposome. Lipid bilayer <b>575</b> can be a barrier that keeps ions, proteins, and other molecules where they should be and prevent them from diffusing into areas where they should not be.

As described above, because image sensors necessarily detect photons, they are sometimes also referred to as, or used as, photon detection sensors, photon counting sensors, or photoelectron counting sensors in this disclosure. Some photon detection sensors can be configured to be more sensitive to, or efficient in collecting, photons. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>F</figref> illustrates an exemplary photon sensing system <b>500</b>F with a cross-sectional view of an embodiment of TSV packaged photon detection sensor <b>520</b>F capable of performing a single molecule analysis of a biological or chemical sample. One example of the single molecule analysis is a single molecule nucleic acid sequencing analysis. In such an analysis, a single immobilized nucleic acid synthesis complex is used. The synthesis complex can include a polymerase enzyme, a template nucleic acid, and a primer sequence that is complementary to a portion of the template nucleic acid. The synthesis complex is disposed as a sample and analyzed to identify individual nucleotides as they are incorporated into the extended primer sequence. The incorporation of the individual nucleotides can be monitored by detecting an optically detectable label on the nucleotide associated with an incorporation event. Unincorporated nucleotides can be removed from the synthesis complex, and the labeled incorporated nucleotides (e.g., fluorescently labeled) are detected as a part of the immobilized complex. In some embodiments, single molecule primer extension reactions can be monitored in real-time to identify the continued incorporation of nucleotides in the extended primer sequence. In such a real-time sequencing (SMRT) analysis, the reaction process of incorporation of nucleotides in the extended primer sequence is monitored as it occurs.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">A single molecule analysis of a biological or chemical sample requires detecting and/or collecting photons emitted where the intensity or volume of the photon emissions (e.g., fluorescence emission) can be very low. Therefore, the photon detection and/or collection efficiency requirements can be of great importance in such single molecule analysis. Photon sensing system <b>500</b>F illustrates a system having the capability of satisfying the photon detection and/or collection efficiency requirements for such single-molecule analysis. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>F</figref>, photon detection sensor <b>520</b>F includes a semiconductor substrate <b>582</b>, a photon detection layer <b>584</b> disposed in semiconductor substrate <b>582</b>, and a filter <b>588</b>. Photon sensing system <b>500</b>F further includes one or more optical elements <b>589</b> disposed in a light guiding channel <b>585</b>, a first optical waveguide <b>581</b>, a second optical waveguide <b>583</b> disposed above the first optical waveguide <b>581</b>, and one or more openings or wells <b>587</b> disposed in second optical waveguide <b>583</b>.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">In some embodiments, one of more wells <b>587</b> is configured to receive the biological or chemical samples, for example, the single immobilized nucleic acid synthesis complex. Wells <b>587</b> can be formed as nanoscale wells disposed in second optical waveguide <b>583</b>. Second optical waveguide <b>583</b> can be, for example, a zero-mode waveguide. A zero-mode waveguide is an optical waveguide that guides light energy into a sample volume that is small in all dimensions compared to the wavelength of the light. Thus, second optical waveguide <b>583</b> can optically confine or substantially confine light being directed to the biological or chemical sample disposed in wells <b>587</b>. Second optical waveguide <b>583</b> can therefore form an optical confined area for more efficient illumination of the sample. For example, a small volume of a single immobilized nucleic acid synthesis complex may be disposed inside a well <b>587</b>. Because the synthesis complex is within an optically confined area provided by second optical waveguide <b>583</b> (e.g., a zero-mode waveguide), the excitation light <b>406</b> can be confined to the synthesis complex. As a result, the efficiency of illumination can be improved and the single molecule analysis can be performed on a small sample volume.

In some embodiments, light guiding channel <b>585</b> is disposed between first optical waveguide <b>581</b> and filter <b>588</b> of sensor <b>520</b>F. Light guiding channel <b>585</b> can include optical elements <b>589</b> such as reflective cones, reflective optical lenses, and/or diffractive optical lenses.

The corresponding optical element <b>589</b> can further be optically aligned with a corresponding photosensitive element <b>584</b>. The alignment of a well <b>587</b>, an optical element <b>589</b>, and a photosensitive element <b>584</b> can improve the emitted light collection efficiency.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">In some embodiments, one or more optical elements <b>589</b> can further provide light beam splitting. Optical elements <b>589</b> reflective and/or diffractive lenses that can split the emitted light into multiple beams (e.g., 2, 3, 4 beams). The number of beams provided by optical elements <b>589</b> can be configured to correspond to the number of photosensitive elements in photon detection layer <b>520</b>F. For example, the split beams may be configured in a linear manner, or in an array, (e.g., a 2&#xd7;2 or 3&#xd7;3 array) based on the configuration of the photosensitive elements of the photon detection sensor <b>520</b>F. By splitting the emitted light into multiple beams, less number of optical elements <b>589</b> may be required (e.g., one instead of four).</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>F</figref>, in some embodiments, photon detection sensor <b>520</b>F includes a filter <b>588</b> disposed between the light guiding channel <b>585</b> and a plurality of photosensitive elements of the photon detection layer <b>584</b>. Filter <b>588</b> can include one or more portions, for example, portions <b>588</b>A and <b>588</b>B, configured to allow lights having different wavelength ranges to reach different photosensitive elements of photon detection layer <b>584</b>. For example, filter portion <b>588</b>A can be configured to allow emitted light having a first wavelength range to travel to photosensitive elements <b>584</b>A and <b>584</b>B of photon detection layer <b>584</b>. Filter portion <b>588</b>B can be configured to allow emitted light having a second wavelength range to travel to photosensitive elements <b>584</b>C and <b>584</b>D of photon detection layer <b>584</b>. The first wavelength range may be different from the second wavelength range.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">The different portions of filter <b>588</b> enables detection of different labeled incorporated nucleotides (e.g., fluorescently labeled nucleotides).

Further, for the emitted fluorescence light that passes through the same filter portion, the intensity or amplitude of the light may be different for different nucleotides. Therefore, based on the different intensity or amplitude, one out of four labeled incorporated nucleotides (e.g., fluorescently labeled nucleotides) can be determined. The photosensitive elements <b>584</b>A-D of photon detection layer <b>584</b> can be the same or substantially the same as those described above, and are thus not repeatedly described.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>F</figref>, optical waveguides <b>581</b> and <b>583</b>, light guiding channel <b>585</b>, the filter <b>588</b>, and photon detection layer <b>584</b> of photon sensing system <b>500</b>F can enable a single molecule analysis using a small volume of sample.

Spheres <b>518</b> can be further electrically coupled to external signal processing circuitry. In some embodiments, photon detection sensor <b>520</b>F is a BSI-based sensor (e.g., the photosensitive elements <b>584</b>A-D are disposed closer to sample disposed in wells <b>587</b> than one or more conductive layers <b>586</b> for transmitting electrical signals and implementing signal processing circuits). Thus, similar to those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, pads <b>514</b> can be disposed at or near a back surface of a packaged semiconductor die (e.g., the surface at or near which no conductive layers for routing signals is disposed or a surface) or a processing back surface (e.g., back surface of a thinned die).

While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>E</figref> illustrates one photon detection sensor <b>520</b>F, it is appreciated that multiple photon detection sensors can be included in photon sensing system <b>500</b>F. The multiple photon detection sensors can be configured similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A or <b>4</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">With reference back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, throughput-scalable sensing system <b>300</b> includes a signal and data processing system <b>330</b>. In some embodiments, a signal processing circuitry of signal and data processing system <b>330</b> can be electrically coupled to one or more sensors <b>320</b>A-N to receive electrical signals (e.g., photoelectrons) generated by sensors <b>320</b>A-N. In some embodiments, the signal processing circuitry of signal and data processing system <b>330</b> can include one or more charge storage/transfer elements, an analog signal readout circuitry, and a digital control circuitry. In some embodiments, the charge storage/transfer elements (e.g., a charge transfer amplifier) can receive, amplifier, store, and/or read out electrical signals generated in sequence or in parallel by the photosensitive elements of a sensor <b>320</b> (e.g., using a rolling shutter or a global shutter); and transmit the received electrical signals to the analog signal read-out circuitry. The analog signal read-out circuitry may include, for example, an analog-to-digital converter (ADC), which converts analog electrical signals to digital signals.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">In some embodiments, the signal processing circuitry of signal and data processing system <b>330</b> can include a rolling shutter, which enables sequential readout of electrical signals generated by the photosensitive elements of a sensor <b>320</b>. A rolling shutter exposes different rows of a photosensitive elements array (e.g., a pixel array) of a sensor at different times and reads out in a chosen sequence. In a rolling shutter, although each row of the photosensitive elements array of the sensor may be subject to the same exposure time, the rows at the top of the photosensitive elements array of the sensor may end the exposure before the rows at the bottom of the photosensitive elements array of the sensor. This may lead to spatial distortion, especially for large scale image sensing systems. However, because each sensor <b>320</b>A-N in sensing system <b>300</b> is disposed on a separate semiconductor die using the group dicing technology, these sensors <b>320</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> can be small-to-medium scale sensors independent from other sensors. As described above, the group dicing technology reduces or avoids the requirements for large scale image sensing system using a large single pixel array for a sensor. Instead, sensing system <b>300</b> can include multiple small-medium size pixel arrays. As a result, a rolling shutter can be used in a throughput-scalable sensing system described (e.g., system <b>300</b>) in this disclosure without spatial distortion or with reduced spatial distortions.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">In some embodiments, the signal processing circuitry of signal and data processing system <b>330</b> can include a global shutter, which enables a substantial concurrent readout of electrical signals generated by the photosensitive elements of the sensors <b>320</b>. Using a global shutter can improve the signal readout speed over a rolling shutter. A global shutter can expose all photosensitive elements (e.g., pixels) simultaneously or concurrently. At the end of the exposure, the collected charge or electrical signal can be transferred to the readout nodes of the analog signal readout circuitry simultaneously or at substantially the same time. As a result, a global shutter eliminates or reduces spatial distortion, especially for large scale sensing systems. In some embodiments, eliminating or reducing spatial distortion can have significantly positive impact on high-throughput nucleotide sequencing, which frequently relies on high-resolution detection of large amounts of fine targets at high density. Global shutter techniques can improve the accuracy of co-registration of a large quantity (e.g., millions) of DNA image spots on many (e.g., thousands) sequencing images repeatedly recorded at different testing times.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">The above described rolling shutter or global shutter typically operates at a fixed rate in exposing photosensitive elements and transferred the collected charge or electrical signals to readout nodes. In some embodiments, the signal processing circuitry of signal and data processing system <b>330</b> can include an event triggered shutter. An event triggered shutter does not operate in a fixed rate. Instead, it is capable of selectively reading out of electrical signals generated by photosensitive elements of sensors <b>320</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a block diagram <b>600</b> illustrating an exemplary event-triggered shutter. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, a photon collection unit <b>602</b> can be controlled to collect photons of the light from the samples being analyzed at certain integration time. The collection of photons is sometimes also referred to as photosensitive element exposure. The photons collected over a predetermined integration time can be converted, by the photosensitive elements, to photoelectrons or electrical signals. An event-triggered shutter can include a sample and hole circuit <b>604</b> and a detection circuit <b>606</b>. Sample and hold circuit <b>604</b> can provide the electrical signals in the form of an output voltage. This output voltage can be provided to detection circuit <b>606</b> of the event-triggered shutter. In some embodiments, detection circuit <b>606</b> can include a voltage comparator that compares the output voltage to a threshold voltage. If the output voltage is greater than the threshold voltage, the collected charge or electrical signal (e.g., the output voltage) can be transferred to the readout nodes of the analog signal readout circuitry. Thus, detection circuit <b>606</b> of the event-triggered shutter can selectively read out electrical signals generated by the photosensitive elements based on a result of the comparison of an output voltage with a threshold voltage.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">An event-triggered shutter provides several advantages. For example, instead of blindly reading out all the electrical signals generated by the photosensitive elements, signals can be selectively read out for only effective events. This is particularly beneficial for chemiluminescence light detection, because electrical signals generated based on chemiluminescence light detection may not be produced at a fixed rate. Therefore, reading out such electrical signals at a fixed rate would unnecessarily increase data flow and impose extra processing burden on the signal and data processing circuitry. Further, event-triggered shutter can enable flexible signal readout by adjusting integration time and/or threshold voltages. For instance, by increasing integration time and/or reducing threshold voltage, low intensity light emissions can be detected (e.g., for analysis of samples having small volumes such as single molecule analysis, or single photon detection as described more in detail below). Therefore, an event-triggered shutter can enable reading out of both strong and weak electrical signals (corresponding to high and low light intensity light emissions). Further, in some embodiments, each photosensitive element (e.g., each pixel) can be configured to have one integration time using the event-triggered shutter. Thus, each photosensitive element can have exposure independent of other photosensitive elements, thereby improving the flexibility of reading out electrical signals for different pixels in a pixel array of a sensor.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">In addition to a signal processing circuitry, signal and data processing system <b>330</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> can include a data processing system. After the signal processing circuitry converts analog electrical signals to digital signals (e.g., using an ADC), it can transmit the digital signals to the data processing system for further processing. For example, the data processing system can perform various digital signal processing (DSP) algorithms (e.g., compression) for high-speed data processing. In some embodiments, at least part of the data processing system can be integrated with the signal processing circuitry on a same semiconductor die or chip. In some embodiments, at least part of the data processing system can be implemented separately from the signal processing circuitry of system <b>330</b> (e.g., using a separate DSP chip or cloud computing resources). Thus, data can be processed and shared efficiently to improve the performance of the sample analytical system. It is appreciated that at least a portion of the signal processing circuitry and the data processing system of signal and data processing system <b>330</b> can be implemented using, for example, CMOS-based application specific integrated circuits (ASIC), field programmable gate array (FPGA), discrete IC technologies, and/or any other desired circuit techniques.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, in some embodiments, one or more sensors <b>320</b> can be photon counting image sensors such as quanta CMOS image sensors (QISs). A QIS has very small photosensitive elements (e.g., 100-1000 nm pitch) with small full well capacity (e.g., 1-200 carriers). A QIS photosensitive element is also referred to as sub-diffraction limit (SDL) photosensitive element. An SDL photosensitive element can be sensitive to single photoelectrons, such that the presence or absence of one photoelectron results in a logical binary output of 0 or 1 at readout. An SDL photosensitive element is also frequently referred to as a &#x201c;jot&#x201d; device (Greek for &#x201c;smallest thing&#x201d;). And a QIS may include many photosensitive elements to generate hundreds, thousands, or millions of outputs (e.g., binary bits of 0s and 1s). The outputs from the photosensitive elements can form two dimension or three-dimensional arrays. For example, at any given time, a plurality of QIS photosensitive elements can provide 16&#xd7;16 array of outputs (or any size array depending on the two spatial dimensions of the QIS photosensitive elements). Such an array of outputs can form a bit plane, each corresponding to a field. Multiple bit planes generated by the plurality of QIS photosensitive elements at different time can form a data cube having a three-dimensional array (e.g., a 16&#xd7;16&#xd7;16) with the third dimension being the temporal dimension.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">In some embodiments, a single image pixel can be generated based on one or more such two-dimensional or three-dimensional arrays generated by the plurality of QIS photosensitive elements. For example, signal and data processing system <b>300</b> can process the 16&#xd7;16&#xd7;16 data cube and generate a single image pixel, which represents a local light intensity received by the QIS photosensitive elements. Accordingly, by adjusting or configuring the size of the two-dimensional arrays or three-dimensional arrays, the output image pixel size of a QIS is programmable for trading resolution with sensitivity. For example, if more QIS photosensitive element outputs (e.g., a large data cube) are included for generating a single image pixel, the light intensity is increased and the sensitivity of the QIS can be enhanced. And if less QIS photosensitive element outputs (e.g., a large data cube) are included for generating a single image pixel, the resolution of the output image may be increased with a reduced sensitivity. It is also appreciated that different image pixels may be generated based on data cubes of different sizes and the multiple data cubes may overlap.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">A QIS is one type of photon counting sensors or photoelectron-counting sensors that are capable of detecting a single photon. Other types of photon-counting sensors (e.g., sCMOS, EMCCD, or SPAD) often require avalanche multiplication to achieve high conversion gain. Thus, fabrication of these types of photon-counting sensors can require special processes that are complex and costly. A QIS is compatible with standard CMOS image sensor fabrication process. Further, as described above, a QIS has very small photosensitive elements (e.g., 100-1000 nm pitch) with small full well capacity (FWC). Thus, a QIS photosensitive element can have high conversion gain, low readout noise, and low dark current. As a result, a QIS does not require those complex, special, and costly processes used in other types of photon-counting sensors.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> illustrates an exemplary QIS-based sensing system <b>700</b> with a cross-sectional view of an embodiment of a TSV packaged QIS <b>720</b>.

The through-hole vias expose at least a portion of the electrically-conductive pads <b>814</b> such that pads <b>814</b> can be electrically coupled to a redistribution layer. After forming the through-hole vias, the second mask layer (e.g., a photoresist layer) can be removed.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>D</figref> illustrates depositing a redistribution layer <b>830</b>. Redistribution layer <b>830</b> includes conductors (e.g., metals) at least partially enclosed by through-hole vias <b>828</b>. In some embodiments, before depositing the conductors, a third mask layer (not shown) can be deposited to define pre-determined areas corresponding to one or more redistribution paths. Based on the defined pre-determined areas, one or more conductors can be deposited. The conductors can be metal-based conductors deposited using PVD (e.g., sputtering), CVD, PECVD, etc. Portions of the conductors of redistribution layer <b>830</b> can be deposited inside through-hole vias <b>828</b> and thus are partially enclosed by the corresponding through-hole vias <b>828</b>. The conductors can be in contact with the corresponding electrically-conductive pads <b>814</b> disposed at surface <b>816</b> of the wafer <b>802</b>. The conductors can extend from pads <b>814</b> to reroute electrical signals to desired areas.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>E</figref>, before disposing spheres <b>818</b> (e.g., solder balls), a solder mask layer <b>832</b> can be deposited in contact with the redistribution layer <b>830</b> and other areas of the wafers <b>802</b> and <b>804</b> (e.g., back surface <b>834</b> where no redistribution layer <b>830</b> is deposited) A solder mark layer can be, for example, a thin layer of polymer for protection the redistribution layer <b>830</b> against oxidation and for preventing solder bridges from forming between closely spaced conductors or spheres. Next, a fourth mask layer can be deposited to define areas corresponding to areas for attaching the electrically-conductive spheres <b>818</b>. Based on the defined areas, the solder mask layer can be etched to remove portions of the solder mask layer such that the underneath conductors of the redistribution layer <b>830</b> are exposed. The exposed conductors of the redistribution layer <b>830</b> can be in contact with spheres <b>818</b> for electrical coupling. Subsequent to the etching, the fourth mask layer can be removed. The electrically-conductive spheres <b>818</b> can be disposed at the areas defined for attaching the electrically-conductive spheres <b>818</b> (e.g., areas above the exposed conductors of the redistribution layer <b>830</b>). As a result, the redistribution layer <b>830</b> electrically couples the plurality of electrically-conductive pads <b>814</b> to the plurality of electrically-conductive spheres <b>818</b>. Thus, electrical signals can be redistributed or re-routed from pads <b>814</b> to spheres <b>818</b>, which can then be electrically coupled to external signal processing circuitry. As described above, the signal redistribution or rerouting enables a more compact, effective, or efficient packaging for large scale sensing system, without the requirement of using wiring bonding.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>F</figref> illustrates a process of removing detachable glass substrate <b>822</b>, which is adhesively bonded to wafer <b>802</b>.
