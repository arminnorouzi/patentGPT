level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0002" level="1">Technical Field</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to an initial setting method for an unmanned forklift. Priority is claimed on Japanese Patent Application No. 2021-110897, filed Jul. 2, 2021, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Background Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">For example, an unmanned forklift automatically carries out work to measure a distance to a surrounding object with a laser sensor, to identify a position of the unmanned forklift itself and a position of a target cargo (palette), to unload the cargo on a rack, and to load the cargo from the rack (for example, Patent Literature 1).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In order for the unmanned forklift to correctly unload and load the cargo, it is necessary to improve accuracy in identifying the position of the unmanned forklift. Therefore, when the unmanned forklift is introduced into a work area such as a warehouse, it is necessary to actually operate the unmanned forklift in accordance with an operation program prepared in advance and to carry out commissioning (initial setting) work for correcting a deviation amount from an actual environment.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">PATENT LITERATURE</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. 2016-210586</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a work area of an unmanned forklift, a plurality of racks are connected in a right-left direction. A region for one palette in the right-left direction of the rack is called a &#x201c;line&#x201d;, and a region for one palette in an up-down direction is called a &#x201c;stage&#x201d;. In addition, when the plurality of racks are aligned in a front-rear direction, a region for one palette in the front-rear direction is called a &#x201c;row&#x201d;. In initial setting work in the related art, the unmanned forklift measures the deviation amount by actually unloading palettes at all points (stop positions) where unloading and loading are performed, that is, for each row, each line, and each stage of the racks. However, the work is complicated, and requires a large amount of work times.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition, in order to improve work efficiency, it is conceivable to thin out locations for measuring the deviation amount in the initial setting work. For example, for the rack in each row, it is conceivable to measure the deviation amount only at three location lines such as both ends and a center in the right-left direction. However, according to this method, when there is a location where a floor surface is discontinuously inclined in the right-left direction at a place other than both ends and the center of the rack (for example, a floor surface having an inverted V-shape or a V-shape) or when there is a location where the floor surface is inclined in the front-rear direction (for example, a floor surface where the unmanned forklift leans forward), the deviation amount cannot be measured at this location. In this case, when the unmanned forklift unloads the palette at a location where the floor surface is inclined in this way, there is a risk in that the palettes or the palette and the rack may come into contact with each other.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure is made in view of the above-described problems, and provides an initial setting method for an unmanned forklift which can improve efficiency of initial work while suppressing degradation in operation accuracy of the unmanned forklift.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to an aspect of the present disclosure, an initial setting method for an unmanned forklift includes a step of acquiring a measurement value of floor surface inclination of a stop position where the unmanned forklift stops when the unmanned forklift unloads a palette on a rack, a step of setting the stop position where a predetermined inclination pattern is detected, as a precise adjustment position, from the acquired measurement value, a step of causing the unmanned forklift to unload the palette in accordance with an operation program, and measuring a deviation amount of the palette unloaded by the unmanned forklift, at the precise adjustment position, and a step of correcting a command value of the unmanned forklift at the stop position, based on the measured deviation amount.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to the initial setting method for the unmanned forklift

<b>1</b></figref> is a view illustrating a work area of the unmanned forklift according to the embodiment of the present disclosure. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a plurality of racks R are provided in the work area of an unmanned forklift <b>90</b>. In an example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the plurality of racks R (R<b>1</b>, R<b>2</b>, and so forth) are connected in a right-left direction (Y-direction, also referred to as a frontage direction). In addition, the respective racks R (R<b>1</b> and R<b>10</b>) are disposed back to back in a front-rear direction (X-direction, also referred to as a depth direction).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">For example, the rack R<b>1</b> has two lines (lines A<b>1</b> and A<b>2</b>) indicating a region on which palettes P are placed in the frontage direction (Y-direction). In addition, the rack R<b>1</b> has three stages (stages B<b>1</b>, B<b>2</b>, and B<b>3</b>) indicating a region on which the palettes P are placed in the up-down direction (Z-direction). In addition, the rack R<b>1</b> has one row (row Cl) indicating a region on which the palettes P are placed in the depth direction (X-direction). That is, the rack R<b>1</b> has six places in total for placing the palettes P. The other rack R also has a similar configuration. The numbers of the lines, the stages, and the rows of the racks R are examples, and in another embodiment, the numbers of the lines, the stages, and the rows of the racks R may be increased or decreased.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The unmanned forklift <b>90</b> includes a main body portion <b>900</b>, a lift device <b>901</b>, and a fork <b>902</b>. When the unmanned forklift <b>90</b> unloads a cargo, the unmanned forklift <b>90</b> aligns a position in the right-left direction (Fy-direction) of the unmanned forklift <b>90</b> with a predetermined position in the right-left direction (Y-direction) of the line serving as an unloading target, and stops a side (&#x2212;Fx-side) provided with the fork <b>902</b> toward the rack R. That is, a front surface of each line of the racks R is a stop position of the unmanned forklift <b>90</b>. In the following description, the lines and the stop positions may be described with the same reference numerals in some cases. For example, the stop position corresponding to a line A<b>1</b> of the rack R<b>1</b> will also be referred to as a stop position A<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In addition, the unmanned forklift <b>90</b> causes the lift device <b>901</b> to move the fork <b>902</b> in the up-down direction (Fz-direction) and the front-rear direction (Fx-direction), and performs unloading for placing the palette P at a predetermined position in each stage of each line.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As described above, in the initial setting method for the unmanned forklift <b>90</b> in the related art, a deviation amount between a target placement position and an actual placement position of the palette P is measured by causing the unmanned forklift <b>90</b> to actually unload the palette P in all the stages of all lines of the racks R. However, a large number of the racks R are installed in a work area. Consequently, according to a technique in the related art, it takes an extremely longtime for the initial setting. Therefore, in the initial setting method according to the present embodiment, floor surface inclination at each stop position of the unmanned forklift <b>90</b> is measured by an initial setting jig, and locations where the deviation amounts are actually measured by the unmanned forklift <b>90</b> are thinned out to improve efficiency.
