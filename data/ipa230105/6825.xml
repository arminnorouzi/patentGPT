The Pepper's Ghost artifice itself preferably being generated from at least one two-dimensional (2D) video image and projected onto a virtual, preferably topographical, screen thereby enabling multiple viewing angles, heights, and depths thus enhancing the three-dimensional appearance of the Pepper's Ghost artifice in the 3D virtual environment. Specifically, this innovation provides a reduction in bandwidth and costs when displaying humanoid characters in real time in the virtual 3D environment. While the methods disclosed with the present invention could be of utility to any type of virtual environment, the benefits are particularly significant for dynamic Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) environments.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In 1862 English scientist John Henry Pepper first demonstrated the effect now known as &#x201c;Pepper's Ghost&#x201d; to an audience viewing a stage with various objects on it. On his command, ghostly objects appeared to fade in or out of existence in the room and other objects in the room appeared to transform into different objects. Classically, the basic technique demonstrated in 1862 involves a stage that is specially arranged into two rooms, one main room that the audience can see into (i.e., the stage as a whole) and a second hidden room to the side or below, a.k.a. the &#x201c;blue room.&#x201d; A plate of clear glass (or Plexiglas or plastic film) is placed somewhere in the main room at an angle that reflects the view of the blue room towards the audience. Generally, this is arranged with the blue room to one side of the stage, and the plate of glass on the stage rotated around its vertical axis at 45 degrees. Care must be taken to make the glass as invisible as possible, normally hiding the lower edge in patterning on the floor and ensuring lights do not reflect off it.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">When the lights are bright on the stage and dark in the blue room, the reflected image cannot be seen. When the lighting in the blue room is increased, often with the stage lights dimming to make the effect more pronounced, the reflection becomes visible and any illuminated objects within the blue hidden room seem to appear, from thin air, in the space visible to the audience.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a side elevation view of a representative example of a traditional, prior art, Pepper's Ghost theatrical demonstration <b>10</b>. As shown in example <b>10</b>, a stage <b>11</b> is arranged directly in front of an audience <b>13</b> with the hidden blue room <b>12</b> located below the audience's sightline in this example. Placed on the stage <b>11</b> is a sheet of glass <b>14</b> ideally mounted at a 45 degree angle relative to the audience's <b>13</b> sightline. When the stage <b>11</b> is brightly illuminated and the blue room <b>12</b> is dark, the glass <b>14</b> is completely transparent to the audience <b>103</b> thereby allowing them to see whatever is on the stage <b>11</b> without any visual enhancement. However, when a ghost actor <b>16</b> in the blue room <b>12</b> is directly illuminated by a spotlight <b>17</b> the light reflected off of the ghost actor <b>16</b> bounces off of a blue room mirror <b>15</b> (preferably positioned at the same angle as the on stage sheet of glass <b>14</b>) onto the on-stage sheet of glass <b>14</b> creating a translucent image of the ghost actor <b>18</b> floating over the stage scene <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Of course, through the years the Pepper's Ghost illusion has been enhanced and modified, but the basic principle of partial reflection remained the same. For example, old carnival sideshows would typically feature a &#x201c;Girl-to-Gorilla&#x201d; trick where the girl would appear to morph into a gorilla from the perspective of the audience. This trick being a variation of Pepper's Ghost where the hidden blue room may be an identical mirror-image of the main room, so that its reflected image exactly matches the layout of the main room; thus, by gradually lowering the lighting in the main (girl) room while gradually increasing the lighting in the blue (gorilla) room the audience would perceive the girl gradually morphing into the gorilla. Pepper's Ghost illusions are even used today in wide ranging applications from Disney World&#xae; or Disney Land's&#xae; &#x201c;Haunted Mansion&#x201d; ghost organist player to the late singer Michael Jackson appearing at the Billboard Music Awards performing the song &#x201c;Slave To The Rhythm&#x201d; from his posthumous album as millions watched from home in May of 2014 (Forbes Magazine &#x201c;Man In The Translucent Material: How Virtual Michael Jackson Came To Be&#x201d;, 24 Jun. 2014).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Various embodiments of Pepper's Ghost are well known in the art. Notably, U.S. Pat. No. 7,883,212 (O'Connell et al.); U.S. Pat. No. 8,262,226 (LaDuke et al.); and U.S. Pat. No. 8,692,738 (Smithwick et al.) as well as U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2016/0266543 (Crowder et al.). However, O'Connell discloses (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> reproduced from FIG. 1 of O'Connell) &#x201c;An image projection apparatus (<b>100</b>) comprises a projector <b>106</b>), a frame (<b>108</b>), and a partially transparent screen (<b>110</b>) . . . (where) The projector (<b>106</b>) projects an image such that light forming the image impinges upon the screen (<b>11</b>) such that a virtual image is created from light reflected from the screen (<b>110</b>), the virtual image appearing to be located behind the screen (<b>110</b>)&#x201d; (Abstract) and is therefore only applicable to physical (real world) embodiments.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Although LaDuke also concerns itself with real world embodiments, LaDuke specifically discloses a &#x201c; . . . method of generating a Pepper's ghost illusion involving an image generation platform, such as a computer providing an anamorphically-distorted image coupled with some form of display projects an image (sic.), directly or indirectly on a spherical medium&#x201d; (Abstract). For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> (reproduced from FIG. 3 of LaDuke) illustrates an exemplary anamorphic Pepper's Ghost illusion assembly <b>30</b> with an electronic image generator <b>32</b> in the form of a flat panel display <b>36</b> configured to display an anamorphic-distorted image <b>44</b>. The image generator <b>32</b> is positioned adjacent to a hemispherical clear plastic medium <b>34</b> that is both reflective and transparent in a manner sufficient to achieve the Pepper's Ghost illusion. The hemispherical clear plastic medium <b>34</b> includes a lower portion <b>38</b> and a circular dark ambient light blocking cover <b>42</b>. During operation, the image generator <b>32</b> displays or projects a distorted image <b>44</b> upwardly toward the hemispherical medium <b>34</b> (for simplicity, the projected image is a ring) resulting in a non-distorted image <b>46</b> being displayed on the hemispherical clear plastic medium <b>34</b>.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Like O'Connell and LaDuke, Smithwick also addresses projections of Pepper's Ghost in real world embodiments, however Smithwick discloses a &#x201c; . . . dynamic mask display element for selectively providing an opaque or semi-opaque mask with a shape matching or selected to match a portion of the virtual object . . . &#x201d; (column 3, lines 9 thru 11), thereby enabling a Pepper's Ghost projection to appear &#x201c;opaque.&#x201d; Finally, the (now abandoned) Crowder application teaches systems and methods to enhance the Pepper's Ghost's appearance simulating a three-dimensional object by projecting onto topography (raised portions) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref> (reproduced from FIG. 9 of Crowder). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref>, the image source <b>270</b> is contoured (portion <b>271</b><i>a</i>) to the three-dimensional shape of a human face. By then projecting an image of a human face <b>271</b><i>b </i>onto the image source <b>271</b><i>a </i>results in a holographic like image <b>275</b> appearing on the foil frame <b>220</b> as seen by the viewer <b>260</b> over the background <b>250</b> having the appearance of realistic depth perspective.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Thus, all of the aforementioned prior art embodiments were concerned with projecting Pepper's Ghost in the real physical world, while being completely silent on Pepper's Ghost embodiments in virtual worlds typical of AR and VR environments. In AR and VR embodiments there remains a need to project or insert interactive and animated objects, particularly humanoid appearing objects, into a virtual environment. This need is particularly acute, due principally to bandwidth limitations when displaying in real time a familiar humanoid character in a virtual environment (e.g., a familiar friend appearing at a virtual Craps table) that interacts with the user operating an AR, VR, or 2D display (e.g., laptop computer) device. This bandwidth limitation is principally the reason that the ability to have multiple virtual reality users appear to each other in real time within the same virtual environment is generally not implemented to date.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Hence, there remains a need for improved AR, VR, or 2D display visual display techniques and mechanisms for creating or projecting three-dimensional images in virtual environments. Preferably, such an advanced virtual Pepper's Ghost display system would be capable of providing higher contrast, opaque appearing, and three-dimensional interactive virtual objects or characters that can be interspersed or located among/between various virtual environmental entities or scenes such as foreground and background entities or scenes while requiring little transmission and/or processing bandwidth, which heretofore has not been realized with the prior art.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Objects and advantages of the present invention will be set forth in part in the following description, or may be obvious from the description, or may be learned through practice of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In a general aspect of the invention, a method and system are provided for enabling Pepper's Ghost projections in completely virtual environments. These Pepper's Ghost projections being typically based on at least one two-dimensional (&#x201c;2D&#x201d;) source video image that is virtually projected onto at least one virtual screen surface placed strategically in the virtual 2D or 3D environment. Preferably, the screen surface(s) are not simple flat planes, but more geometrically complex 3D objects (e.g., hemispherical, conic sections, topography surfaces generally resembling a human body) with the associated 2D source images undergoing an anamorphic process to conform to the shape and size of the screen surfaces. The invention therefore building on the foundation of real world established prior art Pepper's Ghost embodiments, effectively transferring these embodiments into 3D virtual environments resulting in higher quality appearing interactive virtual projections that can be animated in real time with little bandwidth required.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In a general embodiment, a method and system are provided for creating 3D appearing Pepper's Ghost artifices in 3D virtual environments typically from live feed 2D images that may only partially depict the human subject of the artifice. With this general embodiment, the live feed 2D images (e.g., a person's face seated at a table) are typically transformed into anamorphic images projected onto at least one virtual geometric screen surface that is strategically placed within a virtual environment (e.g., live video feeds of a plurality of people's faces attending a virtual meeting being displayed on screens positioned around a virtual conference table). In a specific aspect to this general embodiment, various 2D images of the same object (e.g., a person's face) are prerecorded or prerendered from different perspectives (e.g., sides of a person's face) and seamlessly stitched to a live 2D image feed such that the prerecorded or rendered 2D portions and the live 2D image appear on different virtual screen surfaces that are arranged such that the various portions seamlessly blend into each other, thereby creating a 3D appearing Pepper's Ghost artifice from a combination of live and prerecorded or prerendered 2D images.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In an alternate embodiment, a plurality of prerecorded and/or prerendered 2D images are first stored via a separate process into a database where the prerecorded and/or prerendered 2D images are arranged in groups of different perspectives of the same subject with each perspective image including metadata indicating its position relative to the other perspectives. The database of prerecorded and/or prerendered varying 2D perspective images of various subjects is then accessed by subject to construct 3D appearing Pepper's Ghost artifices where any anamorphic modifications of the constructed images is subsequently performed with respect to the size and topology of the Pepper's Ghost screen surfaces selected for the subject's projections into the virtual environment. In an optional and preferred addition to the alternate embodiment, the prerecorded and/or prerendered 2D grouped subject images may be animated to create dynamic Pepper's Ghost artifices. In a specific embodiment, this animation may be triggered in real time by a subjected human user of the virtual environment&#x2014;e.g., hands and arms motion of the human subject user causing the corresponding Pepper's Ghost artifice's hands and arms to move in a similar manner, eye motion detected by the subject human user's VR headgear causing the corresponding Pepper's Ghost artifice's eyes and possibly body to move in the same direction&#x2014;e.g., the subjected human user walking in a direction causing the Pepper's Ghost artifice to walk in a similar direction in the virtual 3D environment, etc. This alternate optional embodiment having the advantage of lower bandwidth requirements for communicating with remote AR, VR, or 2D (e.g., laptop computer) devices.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In an alternate related embodiment, a plurality of virtual geometric screen surfaces are placed within a 3D virtual environment, such that a correlated 2D Pepper's Ghost artifice virtually projected artifice may appear to move within the 3D virtual environment by rapidly sequencing which virtual screen the 2D Pepper's Ghost artifice is virtually projected. In another related embodiment, portions of the 2D Pepper's Ghost artifice are distributed over a plurality of virtual geometric screen surfaces placed within a 3D virtual environment such that the perception of a 3D object is enhanced.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Described are a number of mechanisms and methodologies that provide practical details for enabling Pepper's Ghost artifices in virtual environments with low bandwidth requirements. Ideally, these mechanisms and methodologies provide animated humanoid Pepper's Ghost artifices, enabling interactions with multiple users.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The foregoing summary, as well as the following detailed description of the invention, will be better understood when read in conjunction with the appended drawings.

The resulting composite four virtual player images consequently being comprised of a combination of 2D projected anamorphic live feed facial video images onto virtual topographical screens combined with the associated body facsimile resulting in four different 3D appearing Pepper's Ghost artifices in the VR environment (<b>202</b> thru <b>205</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> showing how the four virtual Pepper's Ghost artifices would appear to an additional human player and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> displaying the same perspective as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> with the four virtual topographical Pepper's Ghost facial projection screens (<b>202</b>&#x2032; thru <b>205</b>&#x2032;) highlighted.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> illustrates a simulated 3D casino environment <b>200</b> with four virtual players seated (<b>202</b> thru <b>205</b>) around a poker table from the perspective of a fifth human player (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>). While the four virtual players seated around the poker table appear to be four discrete homogeneous images, each virtual player is comprised of a composite of a prerecorded and/or prerendered body (<b>206</b> thru <b>209</b>) model in congruence with an anamorphic live 2D video feed face (<b>202</b> thru <b>205</b>) projected onto a topographical virtual face screen sized and positioned with respect to the associated prerecorded and/or prerendered body (<b>206</b> thru <b>209</b>). Thus, in this exemplary embodiment, the anamorphic live feed facial images virtually projected onto a topographical virtual screen (<b>202</b> thru <b>205</b>) are combined with the prerecorded and/or prerendered body (<b>206</b> thru <b>209</b>) portions that move in congruence creating 3D appearing Pepper's Ghost artifices in a VR environment where interactions with other human players comprises anamorphic live feed 2D facial visual video (<b>202</b> thru <b>205</b>) as well as prerecorded and/or prerendered body facsimiles (<b>206</b> thru <b>209</b>).</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Thus, with the disclosures of this invention, each human player or observer is now transmitting and receiving body language nonverbal communication based on facial expressions and body movements (such as gestures, posture, and facial expressions) of the other players in addition to verbal communications, thereby enabling enhanced virtual human-to-human interaction previously unknown in the art. Preferably, in addition to live video feed facial Pepper's Ghost body language feedback projections (<b>202</b> thru <b>205</b>), this exemplary embodiment would also enable the coupled prerecorded and/or prerendered body (<b>206</b> thru <b>209</b>) facsimiles to move in concordance with the associated human player's body motions.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">This is a significant advancement in the art, as stated in the Mehrabian's Communication Model, human-to-human communications are generally governed by the 7%, 38%, 55% rule&#x2014;i.e., total information communicated from human-to-human typically consists of only 7% of the literal content of the message with the tone, intonation, and volume conveying another 38% of the information; and, as much as 55% of the information exchanged consisting of body language visual communications. Consequently, by enabling visual body language feedback from human player-to-player as disclosed herein, new levels of player interactions are achieved by typically broadcasting over 50% of human interaction information that has previously been absent in the art. Hence, the virtual human-to-human interactive experience is greatly enhanced, possibly altering game play where player-to-player feedback is essential (e.g., Poker) while at the same time requiring little additional processing and communications bandwidth.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">This concordance of an anamorphic live 2D video feed of at least a portion of real world human players with prerecorded and/or prerendered body parts optionally moving in synchronization with the real world human player results in more realistic 3D Pepper's Ghost artifices of people in a 3D virtual environment with substantially more human visual information communicated from player-to-player. More to the point, these realistic 3D Pepper's Ghost artifices of people with substantially more feedback are provided at a cost of very little additional bandwidth requirements, since only 2D live video feeds are required of typically portions of human player's bodies (e.g., faces) with optional additional body motion metrics transmitted from each player's local device to a central site for composition and relaying to the other player's devices. Additionally, the relaying and processing to other players' devices of the anamorphic live 2D video feeds and optional body motion metrics do not typically pose a significant communications bandwidth or processing burden on the other player's devices, the central site, and the associated Internet connections.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> illustrates the same representative example isometric perspective of the simulated 3D virtual casino poker environment <b>200</b>&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> with the four topographical Pepper's Ghost virtual facial screens (<b>202</b>&#x2032; thru <b>205</b>&#x2032;) shown highlighted with the anamorphic Pepper's Ghost virtual projections appearing blended for reference. From the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> illustration <b>200</b>&#x2032;, it can be seen that the four 3D appearing Pepper's Ghost artifices are a composite of live feed 2D facial video anamorphic projections onto discrete screens (<b>202</b>&#x2032; thru <b>205</b>&#x2032;) associated with each player coupled to prerecorded and/or prerendered body facsimiles (<b>206</b> thru <b>209</b>) optionally moving in synchronization with the real world human player resulting in a more realistic 3D Pepper's Ghost artifices of people with substantially more visual feedback information from each human player when compared to prior art avatars. Of course, as is apparent to one skilled in the art, the previous exemplary disclosed Pepper's Ghost artifices placed into a virtual 3D environment is compatible with virtually all digital interactive experiences&#x2014;e.g., Augmented Reality or &#x201c;AR&#x201d;, 2D flat screen.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>C and <b>2</b>D</figref> taken together, provide an exemplary embodiment of a 3D appearing Pepper's Ghost Blackjack dealer avatar (<b>222</b> and <b>224</b>) that is in reality a combination of two 2D Pepper's Ghost projections onto virtual flat screens. The resulting composite 2D projected avatar Blackjack dealer images onto two virtual flat screens placed parallel in virtual space creating a 3D appearing Pepper's Ghost avatar from a 2D embodiment in a virtual 3D environment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> illustrating how the virtual Pepper's Ghost avatar <b>222</b> would appear to a human player and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref> displaying a different perspective of the same scene with the Pepper's Ghost parallel virtual projection screens (<b>225</b> and <b>226</b>) highlighted.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> illustrates a simulated 3D casino environment <b>220</b> with a 2D Blackjack dealer avatar (<b>222</b> and <b>224</b>) as seen from the perspective of a human player (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>). The main body of the 2D Blackjack dealer avatar <b>222</b> appears in front of a 2D backdrop <b>221</b> and behind a 3D virtual gaming table <b>223</b>. However, the 2D Blackjack dealer avatar's left arm <b>224</b> appears on top of the virtual gaming table <b>223</b>. Thus, the Blackjack dealer avatar (<b>222</b> and <b>224</b>) while composed of flat 2D images nevertheless simulates a 3D appearance.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">As shown in <b>220</b>&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>E</figref>, the simulated 3D appearance of the 2D Blackjack dealer avatar (<b>222</b>&#x2032; and <b>224</b>&#x2032;) is accomplished with two separate projections onto two different virtual parallel Pepper's Ghost screens (<b>225</b> and <b>226</b>) embedded in the virtual environment. By separating the 2D Blackjack dealer avatar into two separate Pepper's Ghost projections, the screen <b>225</b> displaying the projection of the Blackjack dealer avatar's body <b>222</b>&#x2032; can be positioned behind the virtual gaming table <b>223</b> and in front of the 2D backdrop <b>221</b> with the screen <b>226</b> displaying the Blackjack dealer avatar's left arm <b>224</b>&#x2032; positioned in front of the virtual gaming table <b>223</b> in virtual 3D space. Thus, the two composite 2D Blackjack dealer avatar Pepper's Ghost projections simulate 3D depth without the burdensome bandwidth and processing requirements typical of animated 3D avatars in virtual 3D space. Again, even when displaying avatars instead of live 2D video feed images of human players, significant reduction in bandwidth and processing can be realized with pluralities of Pepper's Ghost 2D virtual projections that appear 3D in a virtual environment.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>E and <b>2</b>F</figref> taken together, provide an exemplary embodiment of a simulated 3D virtual casino environment with an anamorphic 2D Pepper's Ghost artifice of a human player projected sequential onto a series of curved virtual screens creating the appearance of the human player walking through a 3D virtual casino space. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>E</figref> illustrates <b>250</b> how the walking virtual Pepper's Ghost artifice (<b>260</b> thru <b>263</b>) would appear in the 3D casino space and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>F</figref> displaying <b>250</b>&#x2032; a different perspective of the same scene with the series of Pepper's Ghost virtual projection screens (<b>270</b> thru <b>273</b>) highlighted.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>E</figref> illustrates a simulated 3D casino environment <b>250</b> with a dealer avatar <b>251</b> and players (<b>252</b> thru <b>256</b>) as seen from the perspective of a human player (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>E</figref>). Walking in the background of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>E</figref> are a series of live human player anamorphic 2D Pepper's Ghost artifices (<b>260</b> thru <b>263</b>) where the series of 2D Pepper's Ghost artifices appear to be a single artifice moving through the 3D space of the virtual casino.

By encapsulating this audit structure as a NFT which is saved into a hash chain or blockchain the resulting forensic audit not only becomes complete but also unalterable.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> provides a representative example of optionally linking every access from a given user to part of a NFT <b>500</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, every time an user (<b>501</b>, <b>501</b>&#x2032;, and <b>501</b>&#x2033;) accesses a central site database <b>502</b> a NFT session <b>503</b> is created. In this example, each session <b>503</b> includes three different categories of data containing: (1) user authentication information <b>506</b>, (2) user's device authentication information <b>504</b>, and (3) and database <b>502</b> entity configuration <b>505</b> at the time of the access. Additionally, each session <b>503</b> can be sorted by: (a) the ID <b>506</b> of the user (<b>501</b>, <b>501</b>&#x2032;, and <b>501</b>&#x2033;) accessing a database <b>502</b> at a given time <b>509</b>, (b) the user's (<b>501</b>, <b>501</b>&#x2032;, and <b>501</b>&#x2033;) device <b>511</b> accessing the database <b>502</b> at a given time <b>509</b>, and (c) the portions of the database <b>502</b> (<b>510</b>, <b>512</b>, <b>514</b>) that were accessed at a given time <b>509</b>. Each session's <b>503</b> structure is also arranged such that the user's (<b>501</b>, <b>501</b>&#x2032;, and <b>501</b>&#x2033;) device and the database <b>502</b> portions are partitioned in their own discrete columns or silos (<b>504</b> and <b>505</b>, respectively) with separate, but related unique Headers <b>507</b> and <b>508</b> automatically generated by the NFT server for each column (<b>504</b> and <b>505</b>), thereby enabling identification of each session <b>503</b> of user (<b>501</b>, <b>501</b>&#x2032;, and <b>501</b>&#x2033;) and device authentication <b>504</b> as well as the database <b>505</b> data. A Time Tag <b>509</b> as well as user computing device Media Access Control or &#x201c;Mac&#x201d; address <b>511</b> is also provided in column <b>504</b> enabling the option of separate and discrete tracking of the user's (<b>501</b>, <b>501</b>&#x2032;, and <b>501</b>&#x2033;) device <b>504</b> and any associated Assets <b>513</b> that may be utilized to alter the user's Pepper's Ghost artifice's appearance. Finally, the database <b>502</b> portions accessed (<b>510</b> thru <b>514</b>) when this session <b>503</b> is in progress are also maintained in the NFT session <b>503</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, each session <b>503</b> can be saved into a blockchain <b>515</b> with the very first (root) session for a given user (<b>501</b>, <b>501</b>&#x2032;, and <b>501</b>&#x2033;) becoming &#x201c;Session 0&#x201d; or the &#x201c;Genesis Session&#x201d;. The next subsequent session <b>516</b> would include a pointer to the previous (Genesis Session) as well as a cryptographic hash (e.g., Secure Hash Algorithm at 256-bits or &#x201c;SHA-256&#x201d;) of the previous session <b>515</b> in the blockchain as well as its own session data. This blockchain process will continue as subsequent sessions (<b>517</b> and <b>518</b>) occur for the same user (<b>501</b>, <b>501</b>&#x2032;, and <b>501</b>&#x2033;) with each session essentially linked to all previous sessions in a manner such that no historical data can be altered without disturbing the integrity of the hash chain or blockchain. Thus, by maintaining the disclosed session <b>503</b> NFT structure in a blockchain its historical integrity is assured and becomes therefore suitable for forensic audits of the high integrity typically required of the gambling or gaming industry.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Since each blockchain contains no sensitive data (e.g., user authentication data would be embodied as a cryptographic hash), the blockchain can be freely duplicated and distributed whenever a new session is added. For example, the user's device and each Pepper's Ghost central site accessed can each maintain a copy of the blockchain. If any discrepancy arises between any parties holding copies of the blockchain it can easily be resolved by all parties adopting the longest blockchain of record.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Of course, as is apparent to one skilled in the art in lieu of this disclosure, utilizing NFTs to maintain historical integrity and enable possible forensic audits is not necessarily limited to virtual or augmented systems employing Pepper's Ghost systems. NFTs may be employed to maintain a cognizant identity of a given user and device with higher bandwidth virtual and augmented reality embodiments thereby allowing a user to maintain an identity despite changing avatars or other artifices appearance from time-to-time or environment-to-environment.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">It should be appreciated by those skilled in the art in view of this description that various modifications and variations may be made present invention without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention.
