INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In solid-state batteries, cycle characteristics (e.g., capacity retention) decrease due to a volume change of a negative electrode active material during charging and discharging. This is because it is difficult to maintain mechanical characteristics of a sulfide solid electrolyte against expansion and contraction of the negative electrode active material caused by charging and discharging, and peeling or cracking occurs at an interface between a negative electrode layer and a solid electrolyte layer, at an interface between the negative electrode active material and the solid electrolyte layer, or inside of the solid electrolyte layer.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Accordingly, it is an object of the present disclosure to provide a solid-state battery capable of improving cycle characteristics in view of the aforementioned problems.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Means for Solving the Problems</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In solid-state batteries, the bonding state of an interface significantly affects cell performance because ions and electrons are conducted by using an interface between a solid and a solid. Meanwhile, when expansion and contraction (a volume change) of an active material occur with charging and discharging, a good bonding state is not maintained at the interface, and the resistance may increase in some cases.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">For example, while a Si-based active material is known as a negative electrode active material having a high capacity, its volume change caused by charging and discharge is significant. In order to suppress deterioration in battery performance caused by expansion and contraction of the negative electrode active material, the inventors considered use of a soft polymer electrolyte as a solid electrolyte for the negative electrode layer. However, since the ionic conductivity of the polymer electrolyte is lower than that of an inorganic solid electrolyte in many cases, it is assumed that the inorganic solid electrolyte is used for a positive electrode layer from the viewpoint of improving the battery performance. Therefore, by using the polymer electrolyte and the inorganic solid electrolyte in combination, excellent battery performance can be obtained while suppressing deterioration in the bonding state of the interface between the solid and the solid in the negative electrode layer.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">However, the inventors have found that, when one of the positive electrode layer and the negative electrode layer of the solid-state battery contains an inorganic solid electrolyte, and the other contains a polymer electrolyte, the layer containing the inorganic solid electrolyte (e.g., the positive electrode layer) becomes a hard layer, and the layer containing the polymer electrolyte (e.g., the negative electrode layer) becomes a soft layer because the inorganic solid electrolyte is typically harder than the polymer electrolyte. As a result, when each layer is pressed for bonding, the layer containing the polymer electrolyte is easily deformed (e.g., expanded and warped). When such deformation occurs, and the positive electrode layer and the negative electrode layer come into contact with each other, an internal short circuit occurs, and cycle characteristics are degraded.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In view of the findings described above, the present application discloses a solid-state battery comprising: a first current collector layer; a first current collector tab protruding from an edge of the first current collector layer; a first active material layer laminated on the first current collector layer; a second current collector layer; a second current collector tab protruding from an edge of the second current collector layer; a second active material layer laminated on the second current collector layer; and a solid electrolyte layer arranged between the first active material layer and the second active material layer and including a polymer electrolyte, wherein the solid electrolyte layer is arranged so as to cover end surfaces of the first current collector layer and the first active material layer, and the first current collector tab protrudes through the solid electrolyte layer.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the solid-state battery described above, the second current collector layer, the second active material layer, the solid electrolyte layer, the first active material layer, the first current collector layer, the first active material layer, the solid electrolyte layer, the second active material layer, and the second current collector layer may be laminated in this order to form a power generating element.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the solid-state battery described above, end surfaces of the second current collector layer and the second active material layer may be covered with the solid electrolyte layer on at least a part other than a side where the second current collector tab is arranged. In this case, a plurality of the power generating elements may be stacked, and the plurality of the power generating elements may be bonded by the solid electrolyte layer covering the end surfaces of the second current collector layer and the second active material layer.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Advantageous Effects</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the solid-state battery of the present disclosure, a short circuit does not easily occur even when a polymer electrolyte is used for a negative electrode active material layer. Therefore, it is possible to use the polymer electrolyte for the negative electrode active material layer. As a result, it is possible to suppress peeling or cracking inside of a negative electrode layer or at an interface between the negative electrode layer and a solid electrolyte layer during charging and discharging, and obtain excellent cycle characteristics.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0009" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an exterior perspective view illustrating a power generating element <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a plan view illustrating the power generating element <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a front view illustrating the power generating element <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a left side view illustrating the power generating element <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along arrows V-V to illustrate the power generating element <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along arrows VI-VI to illustrate the power generating element <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example in which a negative electrode stack is coated with a solid electrolyte layer.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example in which the negative electrode stack is coated with the solid electrolyte layer.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example in which the negative electrode stack is coated with a solid electrolyte layer.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a configuration of a solid-state battery <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view illustrating a power generating element <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view illustrating the power generating element <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an embodiment in which the power generating elements <b>20</b> are stacked.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0010" level="1">MODES FOR EMBODYING THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0011" level="1">1.
