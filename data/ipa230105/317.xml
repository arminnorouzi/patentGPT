The lid <b>22</b> is a rigid member made of metal such as stainless steel. At least one of the distal end portion main body <b>20</b> or the lid <b>22</b> may be made of a rigid resin. Further, as long as at least one of the two screw holes H<b>20</b> is positioned on the proximal end side B of the recess C<b>51</b>, at least one of the two screw holes H<b>20</b> may be positioned inside the proximal end side B of the recess C<b>51</b>. For example, the screw hole H<b>20</b> may be provided in a member fixed to the bottom surface of the recess C<b>51</b> or inside the recess C<b>51</b> (such as a screw receiving member (not illustrated) separate from the distal end portion main body <b>20</b>).</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref>, the lid <b>22</b> is fixed in a state of entirely covering the opening of the recess C<b>51</b> by a screw <b>29</b> inserted through the through-hole H<b>22</b> and screwed into the screw hole H<b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The through-hole H<b>22</b> is a clearance hole having an inner diameter slightly larger than an outer diameter of the screw <b>29</b>. The screw <b>29</b> is a countersunk head screw. On an upper surface side of the through-hole H<b>22</b>, a countersink having the same size as the size of the seat surface of the screw <b>29</b> is provided. When the screw <b>29</b> is screwed into the screw hole H<b>20</b>, the seat surface of the screw <b>29</b> abuts on the countersink of the through-hole H<b>22</b>. Therefore, the lid <b>22</b> is accurately positioned in a state in which the central axis of the through-holes H<b>22</b> coincides with the central axis of the screws <b>29</b>. There are almost no gaps and no steps between an upper surface <b>29</b>SA of the head portion of the screw <b>29</b> (screw upper surface) and a front surface <b>22</b>SA of the lid <b>22</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the periphery of the opening of the recess C<b>51</b> of the distal end portion main body <b>20</b>, a thermosetting resin <b>28</b> is disposed before the lid <b>22</b> is disposed. The resin <b>28</b> is disposed in a gap between the lid <b>22</b> and the periphery of the opening of the recess C<b>51</b> of the distal end portion main body <b>20</b>. After the lid <b>22</b> is fixed by the screw <b>29</b>, a curing process of the resin <b>28</b> is performed. The lid <b>22</b> fixed by the screw <b>29</b> is not likely to move when the curing process of the resin <b>28</b> is performed. Therefore, the endoscope <b>1</b> has good workability during the manufacturing. Further, the recess C<b>51</b> is surely sealed by the resin <b>28</b>. Therefore, the endoscope <b>1</b> has excellent watertightness and high reliability.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the endoscope <b>1</b>, a groove GM including a bottom surface with substantially the same outer shape as the outer shape of the lid <b>22</b> is provided in the periphery of the opening of the recess C<b>51</b>. The lid <b>22</b> is fitted into the groove G<b>51</b>. The depth of the groove G<b>51</b> slightly exceeds the thickness of the lid <b>22</b>, and the inner dimension of the bottom surface of the groove G<b>51</b> is slightly larger than the outer dimension of the lid <b>22</b>. Therefore, there are no gaps and no steps between the front surface <b>22</b>SA of the lid <b>22</b> disposed on the groove G<b>51</b> and the outer side surface of the second arm portion <b>24</b> of the distal end portion main body <b>20</b>. However, in the endoscope of the present invention, the groove G<b>51</b> is not essential in the configuration of the distal end portion main body <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">After the lid <b>22</b> is fixed by the screw <b>29</b>, when there is a further gap between the groove G<b>51</b> and the lid C<b>22</b>, the gap is filled with the resin <b>28</b>, and then the curing process of the resin <b>28</b> is performed. In the endoscope <b>1</b>, the space between the lower surface of the lid C<b>22</b> and the bottom surface of the groove G<b>51</b> in the periphery of the recess C<b>51</b> is also filled with the resin. Therefore, the endoscope <b>1</b> has excellent watertightness and high reliability.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">For example, in a so-called crosshead screw, a cross-shaped groove T<b>29</b> for inserting a screwdriver is provided on a screw upper surface <b>29</b>SA. Therefore, foreign matters in the groove T<b>29</b> cannot be completely removed easily when the distal end cover <b>60</b> is removed and the distal end portion main body <b>20</b> is cleaned. In addition, when the endoscope is used and water enters the groove T<b>29</b>, the insulation property may be lowered.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The insulation ring <b>30</b> is firmly fixed to the distal end portion main body <b>20</b> by an adhesive (not illustrated). Unlike the distal end cover <b>60</b> which is attached and detached during normal cleaning, the insulation ring <b>30</b> is not removed during cleaning. For this reason, in the endoscope <b>1</b>, since foreign matters do not enter the groove T<b>29</b> of the screw <b>29</b>, workability at the time of cleaning is good.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the endoscope <b>1</b>, the screw <b>29</b> (screw hole H<b>20</b> and through-hole H<b>22</b>) is disposed only on the proximal end side B in the periphery of the recess C<b>51</b> of the distal end portion main body <b>20</b>.

In the endoscope <b>1</b>, the insulation ring <b>30</b> is a screw cover that covers the screw upper surface <b>29</b>SA.
