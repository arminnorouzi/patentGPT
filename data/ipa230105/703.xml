The present disclosure also relates to a method for lifting and/or transferring a patient, and to a method for repositioning a patient.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Immobilized patients in hospital or elderly care facilities must regularly be moved from one location to another, e.g. from a hospital bed to a wheelchair or from one bed to another bed or support surface. Caregivers may devote significant time and effort in lifting patients for the purpose of turning and repositioning, changing bed linens and taking care of the hygiene of the patients.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">For patients being bedridden or immobile, caregivers typically require the aid of lifting systems, such as ceiling- or floor-based lifts, during transfer and transport.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">One technique commonly used is to move or reposition a patient by means of a sling sheet and a lift. The sling sheet is placed underneath the patient, and then engaged with a lifting device that uses a hoist to lift a patient off a bed, after which the patient can be moved, repositioned or transferred to another bed. This movement can be a strenuous practice for caregivers, particularly where the patient is heavy relative to the caregiver.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Patients being bedridden are prone to developing pressure ulcers. The skin of such patients, particularly of elderly patients is fragile, and susceptible to shear forces and tearing of the skin, which may arise during sliding or movement of the patient. Gentle care and handling of this patient group is therefore critical.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Various types of support mattresses exist on the market, which aim to prevent the formation of pressure ulcers. Such mattresses may comprise a gel, a foam or air to redistribute pressure under the body.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Air-filled mattresses may be inflatable; i.e. comprising air-filled sacs that inflate and deflate alternatingly, as disclosed in reference U.S. Pat. No. 8,566,977 and U.S. Ser. No. 10/034,808 or may be pre-inflated with air as disclosed in e.g. US2018/0028381.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Furthermore, various types of patient handling sling sheets exist to enable the transfer of a patient from one surface to another by means of a lift to which the sling sheet is attached.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">While many patient support mattresses aim at protecting a patient from developing pressure ulcers when a patient is in a lying position, most sling sheets are designed to reduce the burden for caregivers; i.e. to prevent caregivers from becoming injured during lifting.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Transferring individuals with patient handling slings exposes them to high interface pressures. This problem is tackled in &#x201c;Pressure ulcer risk of patient handling sling use&#x201d; (JRRD, Volume 52, No 3, 2015, pages 291-300, Peterson et al). The article addresses the need for a more gentle approach for the purpose of lifting and transferring patients due to the risk of pressure ulcer formation. Furthermore, this article specifies that the interface pressure is elevated along the edges of a sling sheet; i.e. the sling seams, and that the anatomical areas exposed to the highest pressure during lifting are the lower thighs towards the groin and the knees, respectively.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Even though the high pressure areas that occur during lifting are not &#x201c;typical&#x201d; areas for the formation of pressure ulcers, the exposure to pressure at these areas may be harmful to the skin, particularly with elderly patients with a fragile skin or with patients having been bed-ridden during longer periods of time. Apart from elevated interface pressures, shear forces may arise during lifting and transferring a patient. Such shear forces may deform the underlying tissue and result in the formation of pressure ulcers. Furthermore, friction forces caused by sharp edges of a sling sheet in the area of the lower thighs may result in tearing of the skin, often referred to as &#x201c;skin tears&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In view of the above, there is a need for an improved patient transfer device that reduces the occurrence of pressure points and that protects the skin, and the underlying tissue of a patient during lifting. Furthermore, there is a need to provide for a proactive and simple means to minimize the burden for caregivers and staff dealing with lifting and transferring patients in a medical or care facility.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In view of the above mentioned and other drawbacks of the prior art, it is an object of the present disclosure to provide improvements with respect to patient lifting and transfer mattresses, particularly with respect to preventing the occurrence of pressure ulcers.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to a first aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a patient transfer mattress having a lateral (x) and a longitudinal (y) extension, wherein the mattress can be arranged in a resting configuration and in a lifting configuration; the mattress comprising a main mattress section and a bottom mattress section, wherein the bottom mattress section has a smaller lateral (x) extension than the main mattress section, wherein the main mattress section comprises a first set of lifting straps arranged along a first lateral edge of the main mattress section and a second set of lifting straps arranged opposite of the first set of lifting straps along a second lateral edge of the main mattress section, wherein the bottom mattress section comprises at least one first lower lifting strap arranged on a first lateral edge of the bottom mattress section opposite of at least one second lower lifting strap arranged on a second lateral edge of the bottom mattress section; the lifting straps being configured to be connected to a patient lifting device, wherein the bottom mattress section comprises a sealed compartment of air and is configured to cover the thighs of a patient in the lifting configuration.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The mattress of the present invention allows for a more gentle and safe means for lifting and transferring patients. Although the duration of a lift of a patient is relatively short, this can have a significant impact on the formation of pressure ulcers and the formation of skin tears, particularly if the patient's skin is fragile, which is often the case when a patient has been bedridden during longer (and shorter) periods of time.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Pressure and shear forces resulting from the tension of the lifting straps during lifting may be particularly harmful to the lower thighs and the folds of the knees of the patient. This particular area is exposed to high amounts of pressure, particularly when a patient is lifted in a seated position.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">When a patient is lifted, the provision of a sealed air compartment configured to cover the thighs of the patient results in a gentle &#x201c;air cradle&#x201d; around the thighs and just above the folds of the knees of a patient. A bolstering effect is thereby achieved on both the lower thighs and the folds of the knees as well as on the sides thereof. The provision of a sealed compartment of air provides a pressure offloading and pressure redistribution effect, and the risk of developing pressure ulcers during lifting is thereby reduced.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The size of the sealed air compartment may correspond to at least 80%, preferably at least 90% of the size of the bottom mattress section.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In other words, the sealed air compartment occupies substantially the entire bottom mattress section. This is to ensure that the regions at risk of developing pressure ulcers during lifting (i.e. the lower thighs and just above the knee folds of a patient) are efficiently offloaded and subject to less pressure points during lifting.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In embodiments, the air filling degree of the sealed air compartment is from 20 to 70%, preferably from 30 to 60%.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The sealed air compartment is typically preinflated with air to an air filling degree of from 20 to 70%, preferably from 30 to 60%. In other words, the bottom mattress section of the mattress of the present disclosure does not provide significant elevation of the thighs, but mainly serves to offload and redistribute the pressure in this region.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the lifting configuration of the mattress of the present disclosure, the bottom mattress section may be folded such that the sealed compartment of air forms at least two overlying air compartments.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">This is beneficial in various ways. First, the folded configuration of the sealed air compartment allows for the bottom mattress section to be adjusted and thereby correctly positioned just above the knee folds and covering the thighs of the patient.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Furthermore, the folded configuration of the sealed air compartment yields two overlying air compartments resulting in an improved pressure offloading and pressure redistribution effect. The &#x201c;cradle&#x201d; enclosing the thighs of the patient provides for an improved bolstering effect on both the lower thighs and the folds of the knees as well as on the sides thereof.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The inventors have found that the interface pressure at the lower thighs towards the folds of the knees is significantly reduced with a mattress according to the present disclosure. The formation of pressure ulcers is thereby prevented.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Due to the comfort and pressure re-distributing properties, the patient transfer mattress of the present disclosure could also constitute an alternative position in a patient turning schedule. Such turning and repositioning schedules are typically used in a care facility to aim in reducing the occurrence of pressure ulcers.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In embodiments, each of the lower lifting straps comprises at least a first and a second attachment means configured to attach the lifting straps to the bottom mattress section.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In other words, the lifting straps of the bottom mattress section may comprise two attachment means; i.e. two points of attachment on each side of the bottom mattress section. This way, folding of the bottom mattress section is facilitated.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The attachment means may be arranged at a distance, d1, from each other, wherein the distance, d1, corresponds to the minimum length by which the bottom mattress section is folded in the lifting configuration.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">During lifting, the lifting straps are stretched, which forces the air in the overlying air compartments of the sealed air compartment of the bottom mattress section to be &#x201c;trapped&#x201d; or enclosed underneath the knee folds and lower thighs of the patient. An improved bolstering effect is thus achieved, right beneath the thighs and knees, but also on the sides thereof.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Depending on the length of the patient being lifted, the length of the folded bottom mattress section may be adjusted. The caregivers may adjust the length of the fold depending on the length of the patient. However, the lowermost edge of the folded bottom mattress section should preferably be positioned just above the folds of the knees of the patient.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In embodiments, the lower lifting straps are arranged at a distance, d2, from the interface between the main mattress section and the bottom mattress section, wherein the distance, d2, is larger than the distance d1.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In other words, the lower lifting straps are arranged at a lower portion of the bottom mattress section, close to the lower edge of the bottom mattress section. This allows for the caregivers to adjust the length of the fold depending on the length of the patient. During lifting, typically only a part of the bottom mattress section is folded (not the entire bottom mattress). This is beneficial to obtain a relatively large bolstering area covering the lower thighs and the area just above the folds of the knees. The cushioning provided at the lower thighs also has a bolstering effect on the upper thighs. This cushioning effect helps to redistribute the pressure and to reduce the pressure on the sacrum, which is typically an area of risk for developing pressure ulcers.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In embodiments, the first and second sets of lifting straps comprise at least three lifting straps.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">This is to achieve an even distribution of load during lifting.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Preferably, the lifting straps of the main mattress section are arranged such that the distance, d3, between a first lifting strap and a neighbouring lifting strap is from 8 to 20 cm, preferably from 10 to 16 cm.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The distance between the lifting straps, d3, preferably does not exceed 20 cm. Otherwise, the patient body may be positioned unevenly on the mattress. For example, an overweight patient may have &#x201c;protruding&#x201d; body parts, such as the hips. When such a patient is lifted, there is a risk that he or she is positioned incorrectly, and thus also lifted incorrectly, resulting in an increased number of pressure points. The distance between the lifting straps should therefore be relatively short to eliminate this risk.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In order to further avoid this problem (incorrect positioning with e.g. an overweight patient) and to improve the distribution of load during lifting, each of the lifting straps of the first and said second sets of lifting straps comprises at least two attachment means. To optimize the load distribution and avoid harmful pressure points during lifting, the distance, d4, between each attachment means of the lifting straps of the main mattress section is substantially equal along the length of the lateral edges of the main mattress section, preferably wherein the distance, d4 is from 8 to 16 cm, e.g. from 10 to 14 cm.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">To enhance the patient comfort during lifting, the mattress may comprise two side mattress sections; each side mattress section extending from each lateral edge of the main mattress section.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The side mattress sections serve to &#x201c;enclose&#x201d; the patient in a cradle during lifting.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In embodiments, the main mattress section has a first longitudinal edge and a second longitudinal edge; the bottom mattress section extending from the second longitudinal edge, and wherein the mattress comprises a head mattress section extending from the first longitudinal edge of the main mattress section.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">This is to support the head and to increase the comfortability of the head during lifting.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In embodiments, the main mattress section comprises a first sealed compartment of air and the sealed compartment of air of the bottom mattress section is a second sealed compartment of air; the first and the second sealed compartments of air being configured to overlap in an area of the main mattress section.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Typically, the air compartments overlap in area of the lower portion of the main mattress section. This area corresponds to the area below where the sacrum of the patient is to be positioned. The sacrum region is an area exposed to a lot of pressure and shear, and an area of particular risk for developing pressure ulcers. The provision of overlapping air compartments at the lower portion of the main mattress allows for an improved offloading of the sacrum area, both in the resting configuration, as well as in the lifting configuration.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In embodiments, the first compartment of air and the second compartment of air are unattached to each other.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">During lifting, the product is folded as a &#x201c;taco shell&#x201d;, and the fact that the air compartments are unattached, yet overlapping allows the air to move freely and to adapt to the patient's body yielding a more conformable transfer device. If the bladders would have been attached to each other, tensions could form between the air compartments which could impair the conformability and result in an impaired offloading of the sacrum region.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In embodiments, the mattress comprises a top layer and a bottom layer, wherein the first compartment of air is attached to the top layer and the second compartment of air is attached to the bottom layer.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The first compartment of air may first be attached to the top layer of the mattress, and the second compartment of air may be attached to the bottom layer.
