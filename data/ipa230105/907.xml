However, researchers have re-evaluated therapeutic approaches for sepsis after failures of over 40 clinical trials of anti-inflammatory agents. Recent clinical data reveal that more than 60% of septic patients survive through the initial inflammatory storm but rapidly progress to a longer immunosuppressive state, which is characterized by paralysis and death of immune cells, leading to the inability to clear invading pathogens, an increased susceptibility to hospital-acquired infections, and a high mortality rate. Therefore, what is needed are novel compositions and methods for engineering cells and methods for treating diseases (for example, sepsis).</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In some aspects, disclosed herein is an antigen presenting cell, comprising:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0006">a lipid-based nanoparticle, comprising:        <ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">            <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0007">a recombinant polynucleotide, comprising:            <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">                <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0008">a first nucleic acid encoding an antimicrobial peptide;</li>                <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0009">a second nucleic acid encoding cathepsin B; and</li>                <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0010">a third nucleic acid encoding a linker; and</li>            </ul>            </li>            <li id="ul0003-0002" num="0011">a vitamin-lipid.</li>        </ul>        </li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0007" num="0012">In some embodiments, the first nucleic acid and the second nucleic acid are linked by third nucleic acid.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0013">In some embodiments, the recombinant polynucleotide is encapsulated by the vitamin-lipid.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0014">In some embodiments, the recombinant polynucleotide comprises an RNA or a DNA.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0015">In some embodiments, the antimicrobial peptide comprises the sequence SEQ ID NO: 1.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0016">In some embodiments, the first nucleic acid comprises the sequence SEQ ID NO: 2.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0017">In some embodiments, the second nucleic acid comprises the sequence SEQ ID NO: 4.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0018">In some embodiments, the linker comprises a cathepsin B sensitive linker.

Schematic illustration of adoptive macrophage transfer and chemical structures of the vitamin-derived lipids. a) Construction of MACs for sepsis therapy. MACs stands for macrophages loaded with antimicrobial peptides/cathepsin B in the lysosomes. The AMP-CatB mRNA is encapsulated in the vitamin C lipid nanoparticle (VcLNP) and delivered to the macrophage where the mRNA is translated in the endoplasmic reticula and translocated into the lysosomes. Within the lysosomes, the cleavable linker is cleaved by the lysosomal CatB, releasing the AMP-IB367. After phagosomes carrying MDR bacteria fuse with the lysosomes, the ingested MDR bacteria will be eradicated by the pre-stored AMP-IB367. b) Chemical structures of vitamin-derived lipids including VB3-Lipid, Vc-Lipid, VD-Lipid, VE-Lipid, and VH-Lipid.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.

However, researchers have re-evaluated therapeutic approaches for sepsis after failures of over 40 clinical trials of anti-inflammatory agents. Clinical data reveal that more than 60% septic patients survive through the initial inflammatory storm but rapidly progress to a longer immunosuppressive state, which is characterized by paralysis and death of immune cells, leading to inability to clear invading pathogens, increased susceptibility to hospital-acquired infections, and high mortality rate. As a result, potential therapeutic targets have been extensively explored in order to treat sepsis such as removing the anaphylatoxin C5a or blocking the C5a receptor. Meanwhile, approaches aiming to restore immune function have been developed and tested in patients with sepsis.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0048">Macrophages are one of the most efficient pathogen scavengers during infections. In patients with sepsis, impaired macrophages/monocytes can be primarily responsible for the insufficient antimicrobial defense. Several small clinical trials of immunostimulatory agents have indicated benefits in reversing deactivated macrophages/monocytes, thereby enhancing infection eradication. In contrast, meta-analysis of large clinical trials did not show significant changes in reducing the patient mortality. Several reasons can lead to these different clinical results. First, the immunostimulatory agents are not able to restore the function of impaired macrophages/monocytes to their original levels. Second, invaded bacteria are usually trapped in macrophage phagosomes which further fuse with lysosomes to form phagolysosomes. Within phagolysosomes, reactive oxygen species (ROS), reactive nitrogen species (RNS), and lysozymes work synergistically to clear bacteria. However, many bacteria, such as <i>Staphylococcus aureus </i>and <i>Escherichia coli </i>have evolved immune escape mechanisms for thwarting phagolysosomal killing, including scavenging ROS and RNS, and resisting lysozymes, resulting in intracellular survival and recurrent infections. Third, although combined antibiotic therapy is the standard treatment in the sepsis clinical guideline, 70%-80% of sepsis death is related to persistent infections, indicating the prevalence of antibiotic resistance and the paucity of new antimicrobial agents. As an alternative, immunotherapy based on adoptive cell transfer bypasses the need for restoring the dysfunctional immune cells and therefore provides potential benefits in immunocompromised patients.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0049">Disclosed herein is adoptive transfer using macrophages loaded with antimicrobial peptides/cathepsin B in the lysosomes (MACs). To construct the MACs, the antimicrobial peptides/cathepsin B (AMP-CatB) mRNA was designed. Vitamin C lipid nanoparticles (VcLNPs) were identified with more efficient delivery of mRNA than Lipofectamine 3000 and electroporation in both the RAW264.7 cell line and bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs). The VcLNPs allow specific accumulation of AMP-CatB in the macrophage lysosomes, the key location for antibacterial activities. It is also disclosed herein that adoptive MAC transfer eliminates MDR bacteria including <i>Staphylococcus aureus </i>and <i>Escherichia coli</i>, and restores mouse body conditions in the immunocompromised sepsis models, which provides a strategy for overcoming MDR bacteria-induced sepsis and shed light on the development of nanoparticle cell therapy for infectious diseases.

In some embodiments, a recombinant expression cassette comprising a promoter operably linked to a second nucleic acid (e.g. polynucleotide) may include a promoter that is heterologous to the second nucleic acid (e.g. polynucleotide) as the result of human manipulation (e.g., by methods described in Sambrook et al., <i>Molecular Cloning&#x2014;A Laboratory Manual</i>, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., (1989) or Current Protocols in Molecular Biology Volumes 1-3, John Wiley &#x26; Sons, Inc.

In another example, a recombinant expression cassette may comprise nucleic acids (e.g. polynucleotides) combined in such a way that the nucleic acids (e.g. polynucleotides) are extremely unlikely to be found in nature. For instance, human manipulated restriction sites or plasmid vector sequences may flank or separate the promoter from the second nucleic acid (e.g. polynucleotide). One of skill will recognize that nucleic acids (e.g. polynucleotides) can be manipulated in many ways and are not limited to the examples above.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0064">The term &#x201c;expression cassette&#x201d; or &#x201c;vector&#x201d; refers to a nucleic acid construct, which when introduced into a host cell, results in transcription and/or translation of an RNA or polypeptide, respectively. In some embodiments, an expression cassette comprising a promoter operably linked to a second nucleic acid (e.g. polynucleotide) may include a promoter that is heterologous to the second nucleic acid (e.g. polynucleotide) as the result of human manipulation (e.g., by methods described in Sambrook et al., <i>Molecular Cloning&#x2014;A Laboratory Manual</i>, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., (1989) or Current Protocols in Molecular Biology Volumes 1-3, John Wiley &#x26; Sons, Inc.

Such sequences are then said to be &#x201c;substantially identical.&#x201d; This definition also refers to, or may be applied to, the compliment of a test sequence. The definition also includes sequences that have deletions and/or additions, as well as those that have substitutions. As described below, the preferred algorithms can account for gaps and the like. Preferably, identity exists over a region that is at least about 10 amino acids or 20 nucleotides in length, or more preferably over a region that is 10-50 amino acids or 20-50 nucleotides in length. As used herein, percent (%) nucleotide sequence identity is defined as the percentage of amino acids in a candidate sequence that are identical to the nucleotides in a reference sequence, after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity. Alignment for purposes of determining percent sequence identity can be achieved in various ways that are within the skill in the art, for instance, using publicly available computer software such as BLAST, BLAST-2, ALIGN, ALIGN-2 or Megalign (DNASTAR) software. Appropriate parameters for measuring alignment, including any algorithms needed to achieve maximal alignment over the full-length of the sequences being compared can be determined by known methods.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0066">For sequence comparisons, typically one sequence acts as a reference sequence, to which test sequences are compared. When using a sequence comparison algorithm, test and reference sequences are entered into a computer, subsequence coordinates are designated, if necessary, and sequence algorithm program parameters are designated. Preferably, default program parameters can be used, or alternative parameters can be designated. The sequence comparison algorithm then calculates the percent sequence identities for the test sequences relative to the reference sequence, based on the program parameters.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0067">One example of an algorithm that is suitable for determining percent sequence identity and sequence similarity are the BLAST and BLAST 2.0 algorithms, which are described in Altschul et al. (1977) <i>Nuc. Acids Res. </i>25:3389-3402, and Altschul et al. (1990) <i>J. Mol. Biol. </i>215:403-410, respectively. Software for performing BLAST analyses is publicly available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). This algorithm involves first identifying high scoring sequence pairs (HSPs) by identifying short words of length W in the query sequence, which either match or satisfy some positive-valued threshold score T when aligned with a word of the same length in a database sequence. T is referred to as the neighborhood word score threshold (Altschul et al. (1990) <i>J. Mol. Biol. </i>215:403-410). These initial neighborhood word hits act as seeds for initiating searches to find longer HSPs containing them. The word hits are extended in both directions along each sequence for as far as the cumulative alignment score can be increased. Cumulative scores are calculated using, for nucleotide sequences, the parameters M (reward score for a pair of matching residues; always &#x3e;0) and N (penalty score for mismatching residues; always &#x3c;0). For amino acid sequences, a scoring matrix is used to calculate the cumulative score. Extension of the word hits in each direction are halted when: the cumulative alignment score falls off by the quantity X from its maximum achieved value; the cumulative score goes to zero or below, due to the accumulation of one or more negative-scoring residue alignments; or the end of either sequence is reached. The BLAST algorithm parameters W, T, and X determine the sensitivity and speed of the alignment. The BLASTN program (for nucleotide sequences) uses as defaults a wordlength (W) of 11, an expectation (E) or 10, M=5, N=&#x2212;4 and a comparison of both strands. For amino acid sequences, the BLASTP program uses as defaults a wordlength of 3, and expectation (E) of 10, and the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix (see Henikoff and Henikoff (1989) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>89:10915) alignments (B) of 50, expectation (E) of 10, M=5, N=&#x2212;4, and a comparison of both strands.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0068">The BLAST algorithm also performs a statistical analysis of the similarity between two sequences (see, e.g., Karlin and Altschul (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:5873-5787). One measure of similarity provided by the BLAST algorithm is the smallest sum probability (P(N)), which provides an indication of the probability by which a match between two nucleotide or amino acid sequences would occur by chance. For example, a nucleic acid is considered similar to a reference sequence if the smallest sum probability in a comparison of the test nucleic acid to the reference nucleic acid is less than about 0.2, more preferably less than about 0.01.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0069">The phrase &#x201c;codon optimized&#x201d; as it refers to genes or coding regions of nucleic acid molecules for the transformation of various hosts, refers to the alteration of codons in the gene or coding regions of polynucleic acid molecules to reflect the typical codon usage of a selected organism without altering the polypeptide encoded by the DNA. Such optimization includes replacing at least one, or more than one, or a significant number, of codons with one or more codons that are more frequently used in the genes of that selected organism.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0070">The term &#x201c;nucleobase&#x201d; refers to the part of a nucleotide that bears the Watson/Crick base-pairing functionality. The most common naturally-occurring nucleobases, adenine (A), guanine (G), uracil (U), cytosine (C), and thymine (T) bear the hydrogen-bonding functionality that binds one nucleic acid strand to another in a sequence specific manner.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0071">Nucleic acid is &#x201c;operably linked&#x201d; when it is placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. For example, DNA for a presequence or secretory leader is operably linked to DNA for a polypeptide if it is expressed as a preprotein that participates in the secretion of the polypeptide; a promoter or enhancer is operably linked to a coding sequence if it affects the transcription of the sequence; or a ribosome binding site is operably linked to a coding sequence if it is positioned so as to facilitate translation. Generally, &#x201c;operably linked&#x201d; means that the DNA or RNA sequences being linked are near each other, and, in the case of a secretory leader, contiguous and in reading phase. However, operably linked nucleic acids (e.g. enhancers and coding sequences, or multiple coding sequences) do not have to be contiguous. Linking is accomplished by ligation at convenient restriction sites. If such sites do not exist, the synthetic oligonucleotide adaptors or linkers are used in accordance with conventional practice. In some embodiments, a promoter is operably linked with a coding sequence when it is capable of affecting (e.g. modulating relative to the absence of the promoter) the expression of a protein from that coding sequence (i.e., the coding sequence is under the transcriptional control of the promoter).</p><p id="p-0064" num="0072">The term &#x201c;gene&#x201d; or &#x201c;gene sequence&#x201d; refers to the coding sequence or control sequence, or fragments thereof.

A polynucleotide sequence as referred to herein may be used interchangeably with the term &#x201c;gene&#x201d;, or may include any coding sequence, non-coding sequence or control sequence, fragments thereof, and combinations thereof. The term &#x201c;gene&#x201d; or &#x201c;gene sequence&#x201d; includes, for example, control sequences upstream of the coding sequence (for example, the ribosome binding site).</p><p id="p-0065" num="0073">The term &#x201c;nanoparticle&#x201d; as used herein refers to a particle or structure which is biocompatible with and sufficiently resistant to chemical and/or physical destruction by the environment of such use so that a sufficient number of the nanoparticles remain substantially intact after delivery to the site of application or treatment and whose size is in the nanometer range. For the purposes of the present invention, a nanoparticle typically ranges from about 1 nm to about 1000 nm, from about 50 nm and about 500 nm, from about 50 nm and about 350 nm, from about 100 nm and about 250 nm, or from about 110 nm and about 150 nm.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0074">The phrase &#x201c;symptoms of sepsis&#x201d; refers to any symptom characteristic of a subject with sepsis including but not limited to, arterial hypotension, metabolic acidosis, fever, decreased systemic vascular resistance, tachypnea and organ dysfunction.

In some embodiments, a desired therapeutic result is reduction or clearance of a pathogen. Therapeutically effective amounts of a given therapeutic agent will typically vary with respect to factors such as the type and severity of the disorder or disease being treated and the age, gender, and weight of the subject. The term can also refer to an amount of a therapeutic agent, or a rate of delivery of a therapeutic agent (e.g., amount over time), effective to facilitate a desired therapeutic effect. The precise desired therapeutic effect will vary according to the condition to be treated, the tolerance of the subject, the agent and/or agent formulation to be administered (e.g., the potency of the therapeutic agent, the concentration of agent in the formulation, and the like), and a variety of other factors that are appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art.

Vitamin Lipid Nanoparticles Provide Adoptive Macrophage Transfer to Treat Multidrug Resistant Bacterial Sepsis</heading><p id="p-0151" num="0250">The data disclosed herein show that adoptive transfer of macrophages loaded with antimicrobial peptides/cathepsin B in the lysosomes (MACs) provides the immunocompromised sepsis host to boost innate immunity, prevent bacterial immune evasion, and eliminate multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a</i></figref>, an mRNA (AMP-CatB) was designed and constructed with multiple components, encoding an antimicrobial peptide IB367 (AMP-IB367), a cathepsin B (CatB), and a cleavable linker. AMP-IB367 is a broad-spectrum AMP with rapid bactericidal activity and has been confirmed in clinical trials. CatB, an endogenous protein, is first translated as an inactive precursor in the cytoplasm and translocated into the lysosome. These precursors are then processed into mature Cat B. The function of the CatB component is incorporated to transport the AMP-IB367 into the lysosomes, which are fused with the bacteria-containing phagosomes. The free AMP-IB367 need to be released from the AMP-CatB protein in order to eradicate the bacteria. Therefore, a CatB sensitive linker was added in the mRNA sequence. Lysosomes have a large amount of CatB proteins, facilitating the release of AMP-IB367. In order to equip macrophages with the designed mRNAs, an efficient mRNA delivery system is needed for macrophages, one of the hardest-to-transfect cells. Macrophages uptake different vitamins to achieve their biological functions.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0251">Through the initial screening and two rounds of characterization, the formulation of vitamin C lipid nanoparticles (VcLNPs) allowed AMP-CatB mRNA to be effectively delivered into macrophages. The mRNA is translated to functional proteins in the cytoplasm and the proteins are further translocated into lysosomes. In the lysosomes, the CatB sensitive linker is cleaved by CatB proteins and thus the APM-IB367 is released. When phagosomes encapsulating bacteria fuse with lysosomes, the ingested bacteria are exposed to both pre-stored AMP-IB367 and lysosomal antimicrobial components. Although immune evasion strategies may protect MDR bacteria from phagolysosomal killing mechanisms, the AMP-IB367 is able to kill these bacteria because of its high antibacterial activity against MDR bacteria in animal models and in humans. Consequently, the adoptive transfer of MACs rescues MDR bacteria induced sepsis with immunosuppression by restoring the innate immunity, overcoming bacterial immune evasion, and eradicating the infection.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0252">Five vitamins were first selected: vitamin B3, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, and vitamin H (also called vitamin B7), and then incorporated lipid tails using the methods reported previously. The amino lipids were installed on these vitamins through an ester bond or amide bond (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>b</i></figref>). These five vitamin-derived lipids were named as VB3-Lipid, Vc-Lipid, VD-Lipid, VE-Lipid, and VH-Lipid. The tertiary amines in the lipid chain can be ionized at an acidic condition and interact with mRNAs. The structures of these vitamin-derived lipids were confirmed by <sup>1</sup>H NMR and mass spectrum (MS) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> to <b>6</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0154" num="0253">Next, these vitamin-derived lipids were formulated into vitamin-lipid nanoparticles (VLNPs) accordingly. Particle size of VLNPs ranged from 127&#xb1;1 to 174&#xb1;1 nm with polydispersity index (PDI)&#x3c;0.3 except VHLNPs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b><i>a </i>and <b>7</b><i>b</i></figref>). The entrapment efficiency of mRNA was within the range from 52% to 99% and all VLNPs were positively charged (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b><i>c </i>and <b>7</b><i>d</i></figref>). In the initial screening in the RAW264.7 cells using the mRNA encoding firefly luciferase, VcLNPs were 20-fold more effectively for mRNA delivery than other four VLNPs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b><i>a</i></figref>). Moreover, VcLNPs were 10-fold better than Lipofectamine 3000 and were 50-fold better than electroporation at the same mRNA concentration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b><i>a</i></figref>). In addition, the highest luminescence intensity of VcLNP group was observed at 12 h from 6 to 24 h (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b><i>b</i></figref>). In order to further investigate the formulation of VcLNPs, an orthogonal array design was performed to fine-tune the component ratios. 16 different formulations were prepared based on an L16 (4)<sup>4 </sup>orthogonal array design table (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b><i>e</i></figref>). Formulation B2 (Lipid:DOPE:Cholesterol=30:30:40) emerged from this study (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b><i>c </i>and <b>8</b><i>e</i></figref>). Then, delivery efficiency was validated by comparison with the top formulation A10 (Lipid:DOPE:Cholesterol=30:30:50) in the orthogonal table. The luminescence intensity of the predicted formulation B2 was significantly higher than formulation A10 (P&#x3c;0.05, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b><i>d </i>and <b>8</b><i>e</i></figref>). To further improve mRNA delivery efficiency, the mass ratio of Vc-Lipid:mRNA of formulation B2 from 5:1 to 20:1 was examined (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b><i>d</i></figref>). In the second round of characterization, the luminescence intensity was enhanced as the mass ratio of Vc-Lipid:mRNA was increased until the mass ratio is 15:1 (formulation C5, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b><i>e</i></figref>). Formulation C5 of VcLNPs was positively charged in a spherical morphology from the Cryo-TEM image (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b><i>f </i></figref>and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b><i>f</i></figref>). Based on these results, this VcLNPs formulation with improved mRNA delivery efficiency over 7-fold than its initial formulation was chosen for further studies.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0254">Using a fluorescent probe, Alexa-Fluor 647 labelled RNA, 99.2% Alexa-Fluor 647 positive cells was observed in the group of VcLNPs, 21.5% in the group of Lipofectamine 3000, and 2.4% in the group of electroporation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b><i>a</i></figref>). Moreover, the fluorescence intensity was around 4-fold and 16-fold, respectively higher in the VcLNPs-treated cells compared to the cells treated with Lipofectamine 3000 or electroporation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b><i>b</i></figref>). These data demonstrated efficient cellular uptake of the VcLNPs. Then, the cells were incubated with VcLNPs in the presence of different endocytic inhibitors, 5-(N-methyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride (EIPA), methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MPCD), and chlorpromazine hydrochloride (CPZ), which inhibit macropinocytosis, caveolae- and clathrin-mediated endocytosis, respectively. Cellular uptake of VcLNPs was dramatically reduced by about 96% in the group of MPCD (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b><i>c </i>and <b>13</b><i>d</i></figref>), indicating a major role of caveolae-mediated endocytosis for these VcLNPs. In order to explore the endosomal escape mechanism, a calcein assay was performed. Calcein, a membrane-impermeable dye, is normally entrapped into the cell endosomes. Cells were treated with both calcein and VcLNPs, and diffused green fluorescence in the cell cytoplasm was observed, indicating that endosome membranes were ruptured and consequently VcLNPs are released to the cytoplasm (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b><i>e </i>and <b>13</b><i>f</i></figref>).</p><p id="p-0156" num="0255">To test whether the cathepsin B (CatB) was able to transport the payload into the lysosomes, the eGFP-CatB mRNA was constructed and delivered into the RAW264.7 cells using VcLNPs. The confocal microscopy of the live cells exhibited that eGFP-CatB co-localized with the LysoTracker&#xae; Red DND-99 in the lysosomes, with a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.91&#xb1;0.15 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b><i>g </i></figref>and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b><i>g</i></figref>), indicating that the CatB carried its payload into the lysosomes. Then, to evaluate the bactericidal activity of macrophages loaded with the AMP-IB367 in the lysosomes (MACs), the intracellular survival of multidrug resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus </i>(MDRSA) was quantified in the RAW264.7 cells treated by PBS (PBS-RAWs), free AMP-CatB mRNA (Fr-RAWs), empty VcLNPs (Em-RAWs), AMP-CatB mRNA VcLNPs/CatB inhibitor II (In-RAWs), and AMP-CatB mRNA VcLNPs (MAC-RAWs). Relative to other four treatments, MAC-RAWs showed the strongest bactericidal activity at all the time points tested with the percentage inhibition from 33% to 87% (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b><i>h</i></figref>). When the CatB function was inhibited using the CatB inhibitor II, the bactericidal activity was dramatically reduced (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b><i>h</i></figref>), indicating the importance of the release of AMP-IB367. No significant differences in the number of cells were observed in all five groups (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b><i>h</i></figref>); therefore, these results demonstrated that the pre-stored AMP-IB367 was able to hinder immune evasion by bacteria and eliminate them in the phagolysosomes.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0256">Given the potent in vitro bactericidal activity of MAC-RAWs, testing was performed assessing the therapeutic effects in MDRSA induced sepsis mice with immunosuppression. After 3 consecutive days of cyclophosphamide (CY) treatment, the decrease of body weights (BWs), white blood cells (WBCs), and lymphocytes (LYMs) mimicked an immunocompromised state in the sepsis patient. After infected by MDRSA, the mice were treated with PBS, PBS-RAWs, or MAC-RAWs. PBS-RAWs were injected both intraperitoneally (i.p.) and intravenously (i.v.) to treat the local and blood bacteria. For the MAC-RAWs, three administration methods were conducted with the same total cell number: i.p. injection alone, i.v. injection alone, and i.p.+i.v. injections. Because the lethality in immunosuppressed sepsis is associated with ineradicable pathogens, the bacterial colony forming units (CFUs) in the mouse blood were measured after 24 h of cell transfer. Similar to PBS treatment, PBS-RAWs did not reduce bacterial burden in the blood, while MAC-RAWs administrated via i.p. injection alone (MAC-RAWs (i.p.)) and MAC-RAWs administrated via both i.p. and i.v. injection (MAC-RAWs (i.p.+i.v.)) significantly reduced the bacterial CFUs in the blood (P&#x3c;0.01 and P&#x3c;0.001, respectively) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b><i>a</i></figref>). These results showed the bactericidal activity in vivo. Interestingly, MAC-RAWs (i.p.+i.v.) showed much stronger ability to clear bacteria than MAC-RAWs (i.p.) (P&#x3c;0.001, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>a</i></figref>). Moreover, on the 30<sup>th </sup>day, the survival rate of MAC-RAW (i.p.+i.v.) group was 58%, significantly improved compared to MAC-RAW (i.p.) group (P&#x3c;0.01, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b><i>b</i></figref>). Similarly, MAC-RAWs (i.p.+i.v.) showed better therapeutic effects on survival rate (P&#x3c;0.05) than MAC-RAWs (i.v.) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b><i>i</i></figref>).</p><p id="p-0158" num="0257">In the MAC-RAW (i.p.+i.v.) group, bacteria in the blood were not detectable in 3 out of the 7 survived mice at the 480 h (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b><i>f</i></figref>). Then, a repeat treatment for the 4 mice with persistent infections were performed, which consequently cleared the remaining bacteria in these mice (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b><i>g</i></figref>). After a month, the levels of BW, WBC and LYM of the 7 survived mice fully recovered (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b><i>c </i>to <b>9</b><i>e</i></figref>). Moreover, bacteria were not detectable in the blood and major organs (heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidneys) in these mice.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0258">The bactericidal activity using primary bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) was evaluated next, which are translatable for clinical applications. BMDMs were generated from the mouse bone marrow as reported in the literature and confirmed &#x2dc;83.5% cells were F4/80 positive. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b><i>a</i></figref>). Then, VLNPs were also screened and tested for their expression profile in BMDMs. Similar to the results in the RAW264.7 cells, VcLNPs were 5-fold more effective in mRNA delivery than other four VLNPs, 6-fold more effective than Lipofectamine 3000, and 150-fold more effective than electroporation. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b><i>b</i></figref>). Meanwhile, VcLNPs in BMDMs followed a consistent expression profile with the maximum luminescence intensity at 12 h. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b><i>c</i></figref>). Next, MAC-BMDMs were prepared using AMP-CatB mRNA VcLNPs, and evaluated regarding the in vitro bactericidal activity against MDRSA and multidrug resistant <i>Escherichia coli </i>(MDR <i>E. coli</i>). Compared to BMDMs treated by PBS (PBS-BMDMs), free AMP-CatB mRNA (Fr-BMDMs), empty VcLNPs (Em-BMDMs), and AMP-CatB mRNA VcLNPs/CatB inhibitor II (In-BMDMs), AMP-CatB mRNA VcLNPs (MAC-BMDMs) showed the strongest bactericidal activity against both MDRSA and MDR <i>E. coli </i>with the highest percentage inhibition of 85% and 74%, respectively (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b><i>d </i>and <b>10</b><i>f</i></figref>). In addition, all five groups showed comparable cell numbers (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b><i>e </i>and <b>10</b><i>g</i></figref>) and AMP-CatB mRNA VcLNPs did not induce obvious cytotoxicity in BMDMs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b><i>h</i></figref>).</p><p id="p-0160" num="0259">After validating the results in vitro, MAC-BMDMs were applied to mice with immunosuppression to treat MDRSA induced sepsis. Based on the data from the RAW264.7 cells, MAC-BMDMs were administrated to mice via both i.p. and i.v. injections. Analysis of the blood at 24 h showed that MAC-BMDMs were more effective in eliminating bacteria than PBS-BMDMs (P&#x3c;0.001, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b><i>a</i></figref>). Furthermore, MAC-BMDMs rescued 58% of the mice from immunosuppressed sepsis compared with only 10% rescued by PBS-BMDMs (P&#x3c;0.01, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b><i>b</i></figref>). Except for one mouse from the MAC-BMDM group displayed persistent infection, no bacteria were found in the blood in the other 6 survived mice at 480 h (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b><i>f </i>and <b>11</b><i>g</i></figref>). Similarly, after a repeat treatment for that mouse, all the mice showed normal levels of BW, WBC, and LYM (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b><i>c </i>to <b>11</b><i>e</i></figref>), and showed undetectable level of MDRSA in their blood and major organs (heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidneys).</p><p id="p-0161" num="0260">Bacteria are distributed into multiple organs within a few hours of infections. To profile the biodistribution of these macrophages, mRNA encoding firefly luciferase was delivered into the BMDMs (FLuc-BMDMs). Six hours post i.p.+i.v. injections of the FLuc-BMDMs, the luminescence intensity was measured in the following major organs usually infected by bacteria in this mouse model: peritoneal cavity, spleen, liver, lung, kidney, heart, and blood. The results showed a similar biodistribution in healthy and sepsis mice except that a higher luminescence intensity was detected in the lung of sepsis mice than that in healthy mice (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b><i>a</i></figref>). In the sepsis mice, the rank order of luminescence intensity is peritoneal cavity 52.7%), spleen (21.1%), lung (12.9%), liver (9.1%), and blood (3.0%). The BMDMs biodistribution was relatively consistent to the bacterial distribution in these sepsis mice (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b><i>b</i></figref>).</p><p id="p-0162" num="0261">Because sepsis hosts are usually exposed to mixed bacterial infections, a formidable challenge for curing sepsis, a mouse sepsis model was established with infections by both MDRSA and MDR <i>E. coli</i>. Because the mixed infections lead to more severe symptoms compared to single bacterial infection, mice were infected with a total 2&#xd7;10<sup>8 </sup>CUFs of bacteria, 2.5 fold less of the bacteria dose than that in the single infection model. Treatment with MAC-BMDMs significantly reduced 43% (P&#x3c;0.01) and 39% (P&#x3c;0.05) bacterial burden in the blood compared to the treatment with PBS and PBS-BMDMs, respectively (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b><i>a</i></figref>), indicating the enhanced ability of MAC-BMDMs to eliminate mixed MDR bacteria. The therapeutic efficacy of MAC-BMDMs was also reflected in the survival rate (83%) which was much higher than that of PBS group (P&#x3c;0.01) and PBS-BMDM group (P&#x3c;0.05) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b><i>b</i></figref>). In contrast, PBS-BMDMs did not significantly change the survival rate compared to the PBS. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b><i>b</i></figref>). Finally, normal levels of BW, WBC and LYM were observed in all the survived mice (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b><i>c </i></figref>to 12f), and no persistent infections were detected in the blood and major organs (heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidneys) at 480 h.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0262">What is shown herein are macrophages loaded with antimicrobial peptides/cathepsin B in the lysosomes (MACs) by delivery of mRNA encapsulated in the vitamin C lipid nanoparticles (VcLNPs). The data show that adoptive transfer of MACs beneficially reduced the bacterial burden and improved survival in multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria induced sepsis mice with immunosuppression by restoring innate immune defense, preventing bacterial immune evasion, and killing MDR bacteria. MACs were efficacious against sepsis induced by mixed strains of MDR bacteria. The superior therapeutic effects of the MACs administrated via i.p.+i.v. injections than i.p. or i.v. injection alone can be due to the infection process of sepsis. In the sepsis mice, bacteria are transported by the lymphatic system to the blood within a short period of time and then distributed to other organs via the blood circulation. The administration of i.v.+i.p. contributes to eliminating the bacteria invaded into the blood or colonized in the peritoneal cavity, leading to reduced bacterial CFUs and improved survival. When sepsis is diagnosed in an early stage, autologous macrophages can be prepared and engineered in approximately seven days. Next, these autologous MACs can be transferred back to patients with immunosuppression, which are the majority of sepsis patients under current treatment guidelines. Additionally, with the advance of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) technologies, allogeneic &#x201c;universal&#x201d; macrophages can be manufactured, enabling the iPSCs-derived MACs to become an off-the-shelf therapy for broad clinical applications including sepsis. Overall, adoptive transfer of MACs provides a curable strategy for patients with sepsis and MDR bacterial infection in the future.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="1">Example 2.

The preparation of mRNA LNPs was reported previously. Briefly, newly synthesized vitamin-derived lipids were formulated with DOPE, Cholesterol as well as firefly luciferase (FLuc) mRNA by pipetting for in vitro screenings or by a microfluidic mixing device for ex vivo studies. The NanoZS Zetasizer (Malvern) was used to measure the size and zeta potential. The entrapment efficiency was measured by the Ribogreen assay. The morphology of VcLNPs was examined on Thermo Scientific&#x2122; Glacios&#x2122; CryoTEM using the methods described before. In order to effectively deliver mRNA into macrophages, an initial screening was performed using the five vitamin-lipid nanoparticles (VLNPs), Lipofectamine 3000, and electroporation. Newly synthesized vitamin-derived lipids were formulated with DOPE, Cholesterol (Lipid:DOPE:Cholesterol=20:30:40, mole ratio) as well as FLuc mRNA (Lipid:mRNA=10:1, mass ratio) in the initial screening. Delivery efficiency of mRNA was determined by the luciferase expression assay. Next, the dynamics of FLuc expression followed by two rounds of characterization were carried out after the initial screening. Briefly, VcLNPs from A-1 to A-16 were prepared based on the orthogonal array design table L<sub>16 </sub>(4)<sup>4 </sup>and the top formulation was predicted by the FLuc expression data. After the top formulation was validated, the second round of characterization focused on fine tuning the mass ratio of Vc-Lipid:mRNA.

RAW264.7 cells were seeded in a 6-well plate at 10<sup>5 </sup>cells/well and cultured for 24 h. Then, cells were treated by FLuc mRNA and Alexa-Fluor 647-labeled RNA (1:1, weight ratio) using Lipofectamine 3000, VcLNPs, or electroporation. After 3 h incubation, cellular uptake was quantified by a flow cytometer (LSRII, BD). To study endocytosis pathways of VcLNPs, cellular uptake assay was performed in the presence of different endocytotic inhibitors, including 5-(N-methyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride (EIPA), methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MPCD), and chlorpromazine hydrochloride (CPZ). For the endosomal escape assay, 2&#xd7;10<sup>4 </sup>cells were plated in an imaging dish (ibidi) for 24 h, and then 150 &#x3bc;g/mL of calcein was added to the cells with or without VcLNPs containing Alexa-Fluor 647-labeled RNA for 6 h at 37&#xb0; C.

Briefly, C57BL/6 mice were intraperitoneally injected cyclophosphamide (CY) at a dosage of 100 mg/kg for 3 consecutive days before bacterial infection. Their immunocompromised states were assessed by monitoring the body weights (BWs), counting white blood cells (WBCs) by a hemocytometer, and counting lymphocytes (LYMs) by the Kwik-Diff stain. Mice were then intraperitoneally inoculated with 0.1 ml of bacterial suspension (5&#xd7;10<sup>8 </sup>CFUs/mouse for MDRSA infections and 2&#xd7;10<sup>8 </sup>CFUs/mouse for mixed MDRSA and MDR <i>E. coli </i>infections). Afterwards, the mice were administrated by 0.2 mL PBS or 0.2 mL cell suspension (total 2 million cells/mouse). After 24 h infection, the blood was collected from the facial vein to quantify bacterial CFUs. The survival of mice was assessed every 12 h within the first 6 days and then every 24 h for the following 24 days based on 20% loss of BW and the early removal criteria. After 30 days, blood was collected from all survived mice and the number of WBC and LYM were counted. After that, the mice were euthanized and major organs (heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidneys) were aseptically homogenized to quantify the bacterial CFUs.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0272">Biodistribution of macrophages and bacteria.
