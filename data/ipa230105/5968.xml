However, when the field-effect mobility is increased, the transistor has a problem with its characteristics, that is, the transistor tends to be normally on. Note that &#x201c;normally on&#x201d; means a state where a channel exists without application of a voltage to a gate electrode and current flows through the transistor.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Furthermore, in a transistor that uses an oxide semiconductor film in a channel region, oxygen vacancies which are formed in the oxide semiconductor film adversely affect the transistor characteristics. For example, oxygen vacancies formed in the oxide semiconductor film are bonded with hydrogen to serve as carrier supply sources. The carrier supply sources generated in the oxide semiconductor film cause a change in the electrical characteristics, typically, shift in the threshold voltage, of the transistor including the oxide semiconductor film.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">When the amount of oxygen vacancies in the oxide semiconductor film is too large, for example, the threshold voltage of the transistor is shifted in the negative direction, and the transistor has normally-on characteristics. Thus, especially in the channel region of the oxide semiconductor film, the amount of oxygen vacancies is preferably small or the amount with which the normally-on characteristics are not exhibited.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In view of the foregoing problems, an object of one embodiment of the present invention is to improve field-effect mobility and reliability of a transistor including an oxide semiconductor film.

INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Hereinafter, embodiments will be described with reference to drawings. However, the embodiments can be implemented in many different modes, and it will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art that modes and details thereof can be changed in various ways without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Thus, the present invention should not be interpreted as being limited to the following description of the embodiments.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In the drawings, the size, the layer thickness, or the region is exaggerated for clarity in some cases. Therefore, embodiments of the present invention are not limited to such a scale. Note that the drawings are schematic views showing ideal examples, and embodiments of the present invention are not limited to shapes or values shown in the drawings.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Note that in this specification, ordinal numbers such as &#x201c;first&#x201d;, &#x201c;second&#x201d;, and &#x201c;third&#x201d; are used in order to avoid confusion among components, and the terms do not limit the components numerically.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Note that in this specification, terms for describing arrangement, such as &#x201c;over&#x201d;, &#x201c;above&#x201d;, &#x201c;under&#x201d;, and &#x201c;below&#x201d;, are used for convenience in describing a positional relation between components with reference to drawings. Further, the positional relation between components is changed as appropriate in accordance with a direction in which the components are described. Thus, the positional relation is not limited to that described with a term used in this specification and can be explained with another term as appropriate depending on the situation.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In this specification and the like, a transistor is an element having at least three terminals of a gate, a drain, and a source. In addition, the transistor has a channel region between a drain (a drain terminal, a drain region, or a drain electrode) and a source (a source terminal, a source region, or a source electrode), and current can flow between the drain and the source through the channel region. Note that in this specification and the like, a channel region refers to a region through which current mainly flows.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Further, functions of a source and a drain might be switched when transistors having different polarities are employed or a direction of current flow is changed in circuit operation, for example. Therefore, the terms &#x201c;source&#x201d; and &#x201c;drain&#x201d; can be switched in this specification and the like.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Note that in this specification and the like, the expression &#x201c;electrically connected&#x201d; includes the case where components are connected through an &#x201c;object having any electric function&#x201d;. There is no particular limitation on an &#x201c;object having any electric function&#x201d; as long as electric signals can be transmitted and received between components that are connected through the object. Examples of an &#x201c;object having any electric function&#x201d; include a switching element such as a transistor, a resistor, an inductor, a capacitor, and elements with a variety of functions as well as an electrode and a wiring.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In this specification and the like, the term &#x201c;parallel&#x201d; means that the angle formed between two straight lines is greater than or equal to &#x2212;10&#xb0; and less than or equal to 10&#xb0;, and accordingly also covers the case where the angle is greater than or equal to &#x2212;5&#xb0; and less than or equal to 5&#xb0;. The term &#x201c;perpendicular&#x201d; means that the angle formed between two straight lines is greater than or equal to 80&#xb0; and less than or equal to 100&#xb0;, and accordingly also covers the case where the angle is greater than or equal to 850 and less than or equal to 95&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In this specification and the like, the terms &#x201c;film&#x201d; and &#x201c;layer&#x201d; can be interchanged with each other. For example, the term &#x201c;conductive layer&#x201d; can be changed into the term &#x201c;conductive film&#x201d; in some cases. Also, the term &#x201c;insulating film&#x201d; can be changed into the term &#x201c;insulating layer&#x201d; in some cases.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Unless otherwise specified, the off-state current in this specification and the like refers to a drain current of a transistor in an off state (also referred to as non-conduction state and cutoff state). Unless otherwise specified, the off state of an n-channel transistor means that a voltage (V<sub>gs</sub>) between its gate and source is lower than the threshold voltage (V<sub>th</sub>), and the off state of a p-channel transistor means that the gate-source voltage V<sub>gs </sub>is higher than the threshold voltage V<sub>th</sub>. For example, the off-state current of an n-channel transistor sometimes refers to a drain current that flows when the gate-source voltage V<sub>gs </sub>is lower than the threshold voltage V<sub>th</sub>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The off-state current of a transistor depends on V<sub>gs </sub>in some cases. Thus, &#x201c;the off-state current of a transistor is lower than or equal to I&#x201d; may mean &#x201c;there is V<sub>gs </sub>with which the off-state current of the transistor becomes lower than or equal to I&#x201d;. Furthermore, &#x201c;the off-state current of a transistor&#x201d; means &#x201c;the off-state current in an off state at predetermined V<sub>gs</sub>&#x201d;, &#x201c;the off-state current in an off state at V<sub>gs </sub>in a predetermined range&#x201d;, &#x201c;the off-state current in an off state at V<sub>gs </sub>with which sufficiently reduced off-state current is obtained&#x201d;, or the like.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">As an example, the assumption is made of an n-channel transistor where the threshold voltage V<sub>th </sub>is 0.5 V and the drain current is 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;9 </sup>A at V<sub>gs </sub>of 0.5 V, 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;13 </sup>A at V<sub>gs </sub>of 0.1 V, 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;19 </sup>A at V<sub>gs </sub>of &#x2212;0.5 V, and 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;22 </sup>A at V<sub>gs </sub>of &#x2212;0.8 V. The drain current of the transistor is 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;19 </sup>A or lower at V<sub>gs </sub>of &#x2212;0.5 V or at V<sub>gs </sub>in the range of &#x2212;0.8 V to &#x2212;0.5 V; therefore, it can be said that the off-state current of the transistor is 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;19 </sup>A or lower. Since there is V<sub>gs </sub>at which the drain current of the transistor is 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;22 </sup>A or lower, it may be said that the off-state current of the transistor is 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;22 </sup>A or lower.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In this specification and the like, the off-state current of a transistor with a channel width W is sometimes represented by a current value in relation to the channel width W or by a current value per given channel width (e.g., 1 &#x3bc;m). In the latter case, the off-state current may be expressed in the unit with the dimension of current per length (e.g., A/&#x3bc;m).</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The off-state current of a transistor depends on temperature in some cases. Unless otherwise specified, the off-state current in this specification may be an off-state current at room temperature, 60&#xb0; C., 85&#xb0; C., 95&#xb0; C., or 125&#xb0; C.

When an oxide semiconductor in which the atomic ratio of In to Zn is larger than that of the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b>_<b>2</b> is used as the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b>_<b>1</b>, the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b>_<b>1</b> serves as a channel and becomes a main current path.

Structure of Oxide Semiconductor Film</heading><p id="p-0276" num="0275">An oxide semiconductor is classified into a single crystal oxide semiconductor and a non-single-crystal oxide semiconductor. Examples of a non-single-crystal oxide semiconductor include a c-axis-aligned crystalline oxide semiconductor (CAAC-OS), a polycrystalline oxide semiconductor, a nanocrystalline oxide semiconductor (nc-OS), an amorphous-like oxide semiconductor (a-like OS), and an amorphous oxide semiconductor.</p><p id="p-0277" num="0276">The CAAC-OS has c-axis alignment, its nanocrystals are connected in the a-b plane direction, and its crystal structure has distortion.

At the distortion, a polygonal nanocrystal such as a pentagonal nanocrystal or a heptagonal nanocrystal is included in some cases. Note that a clear grain boundary cannot be observed even in the vicinity of distortion in the CAAC-OS. That is, a lattice arrangement is distorted so that formation of a grain boundary is inhibited. This is probably because the CAAC-OS can tolerate distortion owing to a low density of the atomic arrangement in an a-b plane direction, the interatomic bond distance changed by substitution of a metal element, and the like.</p><p id="p-0279" num="0278">The CAAC-OS tends to have a layered crystal structure (also referred to as a layered structure) in which a layer containing indium and oxygen (hereinafter, In layer) and a layer containing the element M, zinc, and oxygen (hereinafter, (M, Zn) layer) are stacked. Note that indium and the element M can be replaced with each other, and when the element M of the (M, Zn) layer is replaced with indium, the layer can also be referred to as an (In, M, Zn) layer.

This means that the CAAC-OS has small amounts of impurities and defects (e.g., oxygen vacancies). Thus, with the CAAC-OS, a composite oxide semiconductor is physically stable; thus, a composite oxide semiconductor which is resistant to heat and has high reliability can be provided.</p><p id="p-0320" num="0319">Note that in the case where the oxide semiconductor is deposited with a sputtering apparatus, a film having an atomic ratio deviated from the atomic ratio of the target is formed.

When sDOS is formed in the composite oxide semiconductor, the sDOS serves as a carrier trap, resulting in a reduction in on-state current and field-effect mobility.</p><p id="p-0372" num="0370">Therefore, when a composite oxide semiconductor is formed with the use of an argon gas, it is preferable to supply oxygen into the composite oxide semiconductor after formation thereof so that oxygen vacancies in the composite oxide semiconductor are compensated and sDOS is reduced.</p><p id="p-0373" num="0371">Such oxygen supply can be conducted by, for example, performing heat treatment in an atmosphere that contains oxygen after the formation of the composite oxide semiconductor, or performing plasma treatment in an atmosphere that contains oxygen. Alternatively, either an insulating film that is in contact with the composite oxide semiconductor of one embodiment of the present invention or an insulating film in the vicinity of the composite oxide semiconductor is made to contain excess oxygen. The mode in which such an insulating film contains excess oxygen are described in Embodiment 1.</p><p id="p-0374" num="0372">Note that one embodiment of the present invention is not limited to the above-mentioned manufacturing method by a sputtering method. A pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method, a plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) method, a thermal chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method, an atomic layer deposition (ALD) method, a vacuum evaporation method, or the like may be used. As an example of a thermal CVD method, a metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) method can be given.</p><heading id="h-0037" level="1">2-7. Transistor Including Oxide Semiconductor Film</heading><p id="p-0375" num="0373">Next, a transistor including an oxide semiconductor film is described.</p><p id="p-0376" num="0374">Note that when the composite oxide semiconductor is used for a transistor, the transistor can have high carrier mobility and excellent switching characteristics. In addition, the transistor can have high reliability.</p><p id="p-0377" num="0375">An oxide semiconductor film with a low carrier density is preferably used for a transistor. For example, an oxide semiconductor film whose carrier density is lower than 8&#xd7;10<sup>11</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>, preferably lower than 1&#xd7;10<sup>11</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>, or further preferably lower than 1&#xd7;10<sup>10</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>, and greater than or equal to 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;9</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>is used as the oxide semiconductor film.</p><p id="p-0378" num="0376">In order to reduce the carrier density of the oxide semiconductor film, the impurity concentration in the oxide semiconductor film is reduced so that the density of defect states can be reduced. In this specification and the like, a state with a low impurity concentration and a low density of defect states is referred to as a highly purified intrinsic or substantially highly purified intrinsic state. A highly purified intrinsic or substantially highly purified intrinsic oxide semiconductor film has few carrier generation sources, and thus can have a low carrier density. A highly purified intrinsic or substantially highly purified intrinsic oxide semiconductor film has a low density of defect states and accordingly has a low density of trap states in some cases.</p><p id="p-0379" num="0377">Charges trapped by the trap states in the oxide semiconductor film take a long time to be released and may behave like fixed charges. Thus, the transistor whose channel region is formed in the oxide semiconductor having a high density of trap states has unstable electrical characteristics in some cases.</p><p id="p-0380" num="0378">To obtain stable electrical characteristics of the transistor, it is effective to reduce the concentration of impurities in the oxide semiconductor film. In order to reduce the concentration of impurities in the oxide semiconductor film, the concentration of impurities in a film that is adjacent to the oxide semiconductor film is preferably reduced. As examples of the impurities, hydrogen, nitrogen, alkali metal, alkaline earth metal, iron, nickel, silicon, and the like are given.</p><p id="p-0381" num="0379">Here, the influence of impurities in the oxide semiconductor film will be described.</p><p id="p-0382" num="0380">When silicon or carbon that is one of Group 14 elements is contained in the oxide semiconductor film, defect states are formed in the oxide semiconductor. Thus, the concentration of silicon or carbon in the oxide semiconductor and around an interface with the oxide semiconductor (measured by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS)) is set lower than or equal to 2&#xd7;10<sup>18 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>, and preferably lower than or equal to 2&#xd7;10<sup>17 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>.</p><p id="p-0383" num="0381">When the oxide semiconductor film contains alkali metal or alkaline earth metal, defect states are formed and carriers are generated, in some cases. Thus, a transistor including an oxide semiconductor film which contains alkali metal or alkaline earth metal is likely to be normally on. Therefore, it is preferable to reduce the concentration of alkali metal or alkaline earth metal in the oxide semiconductor film. Specifically, the concentration of alkali metal or alkaline earth metal in the oxide semiconductor film measured by SIMS is set lower than or equal to 1&#xd7;10<sup>18 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>, and preferably lower than or equal to 2&#xd7;10<sup>16 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>.</p><p id="p-0384" num="0382">When the oxide semiconductor film contains nitrogen, the oxide easily becomes n-type by generation of electrons serving as carriers and an increase of carrier density. Thus, a transistor whose semiconductor includes an oxide semiconductor that contains nitrogen is likely to be normally-on. For this reason, nitrogen in the oxide semiconductor is preferably reduced as much as possible; the nitrogen concentration measured by SIMS is set, for example, lower than 5&#xd7;10<sup>19 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>, preferably lower than or equal to 5&#xd7;10<sup>18 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>, further preferably lower than or equal to 1&#xd7;10<sup>18 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>, and still further preferably lower than or equal to 5&#xd7;10<sup>17 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>.</p><p id="p-0385" num="0383">Hydrogen contained in an oxide semiconductor film reacts with oxygen bonded to a metal atom to be water, and thus causes an oxygen vacancy (V<sub>O</sub>), in some cases. Due to entry of hydrogen into the oxygen vacancy (V<sub>O</sub>), an electron serving as a carrier is generated in some cases. In some cases, bonding of part of hydrogen to oxygen bonded to a metal atom causes generation of an electron serving as a carrier. Thus, a transistor including an oxide semiconductor which contains hydrogen is likely to be normally on. Accordingly, it is preferable that hydrogen in the oxide semiconductor be reduced as much as possible. Specifically, the hydrogen concentration measured by SIMS is set lower than 1&#xd7;10<sup>20 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>, preferably lower than 1&#xd7;10<sup>19 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>, further preferably lower than 5&#xd7;10<sup>18 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>, and still further preferably lower than 1&#xd7;10<sup>18 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>.</p><p id="p-0386" num="0384">Note that oxygen vacancies (V<sub>O</sub>) in the oxide semiconductor film can be reduced by introduction of oxygen into the oxide semiconductor. That is, the oxygen vacancies (V<sub>O</sub>) in the oxide semiconductor film disappear when the oxygen vacancies (V<sub>O</sub>) are filled with oxygen. Accordingly, diffusion of oxygen into the oxide semiconductor film can reduce the amount of oxygen vacancies (V<sub>O</sub>) in a transistor and improve the reliability of the transistor.</p><p id="p-0387" num="0385">As a method for introducing oxygen into the oxide semiconductor film, for example, an oxide in which oxygen content is higher than that in the stoichiometric composition is provided in contact with the oxide semiconductor. That is, in the oxide, a region including oxygen in excess of that in the stoichiometric composition (hereinafter also referred to as an excess oxygen region) is preferably formed. In particular, in the case of using an oxide semiconductor film in a transistor, an oxide including an excess-oxygen region is provided in a base film, an interlayer film, or the like in the vicinity of the transistor, whereby oxygen vacancies in the transistor are reduced, and the reliability can be improved.</p><p id="p-0388" num="0386">When an oxide semiconductor film with sufficiently reduced impurity concentration is used for a channel formation region in a transistor, the transistor can have stable electrical characteristics.</p><p id="p-0389" num="0387">At least part of this embodiment can be implemented in combination with any of the other embodiments and the other examples described in this specification as appropriate.</p><heading id="h-0038" level="1">Embodiment 3</heading><p id="p-0390" num="0388">In this embodiment, examples of a display device that includes the transistor described in the above embodiments are described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0391" num="0389"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> is a top view illustrating an example of a display device.

Examples of a display device including an electron emitter include a field emission display (FED) and an SED-type flat panel display (SED: surface-conduction electron-emitter display). An example of a display device including a liquid crystal element is a liquid crystal display (a transmissive liquid crystal display, a transflective liquid crystal display, a reflective liquid crystal display, a direct-view liquid crystal display, or aprojection liquid crystal display). An example of a display device including an electronic ink display or an electrophoretic element is electronic paper. In a transflective liquid crystal display or a reflective liquid crystal display, some or all of pixel electrodes may function as reflective electrodes. For example, some or all of pixel electrodes may contain aluminum, silver, or the like. In this case, a memory circuit such as an SRAM can be provided under the reflective electrodes, leading to lower power consumption.</p><p id="p-0397" num="0395">As a display system of the display device <b>700</b>, a progressive system, an interlace system, or the like can be employed. Furthermore, color elements controlled in pixels at the time of color display are not limited to three colors: R, G, and B (R, G, and B correspond to red, green, and blue, respectively). For example, four pixels of an R pixel, a G pixel, a B pixel, and a W (white) pixel may be used. Alternatively, a color element may be composed of two colors of R, G, and B as in PenTile layout.

For example, a red (R) coloring layer, a green (G) coloring layer, a blue (B) coloring layer, and a yellow (Y) coloring layer can be combined as appropriate. With the use of the coloring layer, high color reproducibility can be obtained as compared with the case without the coloring layer. Here, by providing a region with a coloring layer and a region without a coloring layer, white light in the region without the coloring layer may be directly utilized for display. By partly providing the region without a coloring layer, a decrease in the luminance of a bright image due to the coloring layer can be suppressed, and power consumption can be reduced by approximately 20% to 30% in some cases. In the case where full-color display is performed using a self-luminous element such as an organic EL element or an inorganic EL element, elements may emit light in their respective colors R, G, B, Y, and W.

For example, circular polarization may be obtained by using a polarizing substrate and a retardation substrate. In addition, a backlight, a sidelight, or the like may be used as a light source.</p><p id="p-0422" num="0420">In the case where a liquid crystal element is used as the display element, a thermotropic liquid crystal, a low-molecular liquid crystal, a high-molecular liquid crystal, a polymer dispersed liquid crystal, a ferroelectric liquid crystal, an anti-ferroelectric liquid crystal, or the like can be used. These liquid crystal materials exhibit a cholesteric phase, a smectic phase, a cubic phase, a chiral nematic phase, an isotropic phase, or the like depending on conditions.</p><p id="p-0423" num="0421">In the case where a horizontal electric field mode is employed, a liquid crystal exhibiting a blue phase for which an alignment film is unnecessary may be used. The blue phase is one of liquid crystal phases, which is generated just before a cholesteric phase changes into an isotropic phase when the temperature of a cholesteric liquid crystal is increased. Since the blue phase appears only in a narrow temperature range, a liquid crystal composition in which several weight percent or more of a chiral material is mixed is used for the liquid crystal layer in order to improve the temperature range. The liquid crystal composition containing a liquid crystal exhibiting a blue phase and a chiral material has a short response time and optical isotropy, which eliminates the need for an alignment process. An alignment film does not need to be provided, and thus, rubbing treatment is not necessary; accordingly, electrostatic discharge damage caused by the rubbing treatment can be prevented, and defects and damage of a liquid crystal display device in the manufacturing process can be reduced. Moreover, the liquid crystal material that exhibits a blue phase has small viewing angle dependence.</p><p id="p-0424" num="0422">In the case where a liquid crystal element is used as a display element, a twisted nematic (TN) mode, an in-plane switching (IPS) mode, a fringe field switching (FFS) mode, an axially symmetric aligned micro-cell (ASM) mode, an optical compensated birefringence (OCB) mode, a ferroelectric liquid crystal (FLC) mode, an anti-ferroelectric liquid crystal (AFLC) mode, or the like can be used.</p><p id="p-0425" num="0423">Furthermore, a normally black liquid crystal display device such as a vertical alignment (VA) mode transmissive liquid crystal display device may also be used.

One gate is formed using the conductive film <b>654</b> and the other gate is formed using a conductive film <b>623</b> overlapping with the semiconductor film <b>653</b> with the insulating film <b>682</b> provided therebetween. Such a structure enables control of threshold voltages of a transistor. In that case, the two gates may be connected to each other and supplied with the same signal to operate the transistor. Such a transistor can have higher field-effect mobility and thus have higher on-state current than other transistors. Consequently, a circuit capable of high-speed operation can be obtained. Furthermore, the area occupied by a circuit portion can be reduced. The use of the transistor having high on-state current can reduce signal delay in wirings and can reduce display unevenness even in a display panel in which the number of wirings is increased because of increase in size or resolution.</p><p id="p-0518" num="0516">Note that the transistor included in the circuit <b>659</b> and the transistor included in the display portion <b>662</b> may have the same structure.

The element layer includes, for example, a display element, and may additionally include a wiring electrically connected to the display element or an element such as a transistor used in a pixel or a circuit.</p><p id="p-0534" num="0532">In addition, here, a flexible member which supports the element layer at a stage at which the display element is completed (the manufacturing process is finished) is referred to as a substrate. For example, a substrate includes an extremely thin film with a thickness greater than or equal to 10 nm and less than or equal to 300 &#x3bc;m and the like.</p><p id="p-0535" num="0533">As a method for forming an element layer over a flexible substrate provided with an insulating surface, typically, there are two methods shown below. One of them is to directly form an element layer over the substrate. The other method is to form an element layer over a support substrate that is different from the substrate and then to separate the element layer from the support substrate to be transferred to the substrate. Although not described in detail here, in addition to the above two methods, there is a method in which an element layer is formed over a substrate which does not have flexibility and the substrate is thinned by polishing or the like to have flexibility.</p><p id="p-0536" num="0534">In the case where a material of the substrate can withstand heating temperature in a process for forming the element layer, it is preferable that the element layer be formed directly over the substrate, in which case a manufacturing process can be simplified. At this time, the element layer is preferably formed in a state where the substrate is fixed to the support substrate, in which case transfer thereof in an apparatus and between apparatuses can be easy.</p><p id="p-0537" num="0535">In the case of employing the method in which the element layer is formed over the support substrate and then transferred to the substrate, first, a separation layer and an insulating layer are stacked over the support substrate, and then the element layer is formed over the insulating layer. Next, the element layer is separated from the support substrate and then transferred to the substrate. At this time, selected is a material with which separation at an interface between the support substrate and the separation layer, at an interface between the separation layer and the insulating layer, or in the separation layer occurs. With the method, it is preferable that a material having high heat resistance be used for the support substrate or the separation layer, in which case the upper limit of the temperature applied when the element layer is formed can be increased, and an element layer including a more highly reliable element can be formed.</p><p id="p-0538" num="0536">For example, it is preferable that a stack of a layer containing a high-melting-point metal material, such as tungsten, and a layer containing an oxide of the metal material be used as the separation layer, and a stack of a plurality of layers, such as a silicon oxide layer, a silicon nitride layer, a silicon oxynitride layer, and a silicon nitride oxide layer be used as the insulating layer over the separation layer.</p><p id="p-0539" num="0537">As the method for separating the support substrate from the element layer, applying mechanical force, etching the separation layer, and making a liquid permeate the separation interface are given as examples.

In that case, a separation trigger may be formed by, for example, locally heating part of the organic resin with laser light or the like, or by physically cutting part of or making a hole through the organic resin with a sharp tool, and separation may be performed at an interface between the glass and the organic resin. As the above-described organic resin, a photosensitive material is preferably used because an opening or the like can be easily formed. The above-described laser light preferably has a wavelength region, for example, from visible light to ultraviolet light. For example, light having a wavelength of greater than or equal to 200 nm and less than or equal to 400 nm, preferably greater than or equal to 250 nm and less than or equal to 350 nm can be used. In particular, an excimer laser having a wavelength of 308 nm is preferably used because the productivity is increased. Alternatively, a solid-state UV laser (also referred to as a semiconductor UV laser), such as a UV laser having a wavelength of 355 nm which is the third harmonic of an Nd:YAG laser, may be used.</p><p id="p-0542" num="0540">Alternatively, a heat generation layer may be provided between the support substrate and the insulating layer formed of an organic resin, and separation may be performed at an interface between the heat generation layer and the insulating layer by heating the heat generation layer.
