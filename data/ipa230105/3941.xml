The MOST technology was specified by a cooperation founded in 1998, which was a partnership of carmakers, setmakers, system architects, and key component suppliers. Their objective was to define and adopt a common multimedia network protocol and application object model. As a result of their efforts, MOST technology has emerged as a global standard for implementing current requirements for multimedia networking in automobiles.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The MOST150 interface introduced in October 2007 provides a physical layer to implement Ethernet in automobiles as the transport for audio, video, voice, and data signals via plastic optical fiber (POF). More recently (2014), the IEEE 802.3bv Ethernet Task Force specified a physical layer for 1 Gbps over 1 mm step-index POF for distances up to 50 meters. POF provides several advantages over highbandwidth Graded-Index multimode fiber (GI-MMF) due to its large core diameter of 0.98 mm compared to .05 mm for standard glass graded-index multimode fiber types. The large core diameter eliminates the need for high-precision optical connectors and no polishing is required. These attributes make the connector very low cost. However, large core optical fiber types (&#x3e;0.05 mm) support a large number of guided fiber modes and consequently, the fiber exhibits high modal dispersion and low bandwidth, making them only useful for low date rates &#x2264;1 Gb/s and short reaches &#x2264;50 meters.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As more video services and sensors are integrated into the vehicular network higher data rates up to 25 Gbps are required. For data rates exceeding 1 Gbps, graded-index multimode fiber, such as Types OM1, OM2, OM3, and OM4, or small core graded-index plastic optical fiber is required. The smaller core diameters of the graded-index fibers reduce the number of fiber modes and the graded index of refraction equalizes the mode group delays thereby reducing the modal dispersion penalty. Fiber types OM1 and OM2, are no longer recommended by industry Standards and are considered obsolete and therefore, for automotive applications OM3 is the optimum choice for glass MMF. Higher bandwidth OM4 demands a price premium and is for long reach applications greater than 100 meters, which far exceeds the requirements for automotive applications. GI-POF can also be a good alternative.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Optical connectors used for GI-MMF, such as the LC and SC, and the newer SN and MDC connectors, are ultra-high precision, low insertion loss, physical contact connectors and consequently, not ideal for dirty harsh environments and are prohibitively expensive for automotive applications. These connector types are designed primarily for use in controlled environments over a much reduced application temperature range, and are easily contaminated making them unsuitable for dirty automotive applications.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Hence, for next generation higher-speed automotive optical transport data rates &#x3e;1 Gbps, it is desireable to have a low cost optical fiber connector that supports small core diameter (typically 50 mircons) high-bandwidth graded-index multimode fiber, in harsh conditions and over a wide temperature range.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">An optical fiber connector has a lens component and a fiber component. The lens component has at least one lens and an opening with at least one V-groove therein. The at least one lens is associated with the at least one V-groove. The fiber component is configured to be partially inserted into the lens component and has at least one bare fiber flexible retention feature configured to retain a fiber of a fiber optic cable within the at least one V-groove and also to align the fiber with the lens.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. is an isometric view of one embodiment of a duplex MOST optical fiber connector according to the present invention.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is isometric views of the fiber side component of the MOST optical fiber connector of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is isometric views of the lens side component of the MOST optical fiber connector of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows the assembly direction of the fiber side component of the MOST optical fiber connector into the lens side component.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.

The angle on the eight wedges <b>150</b> matches that of the geometry on the mating component allowing for the precise alignment and location of the fiber side of the connector in the lens side of the connector.
