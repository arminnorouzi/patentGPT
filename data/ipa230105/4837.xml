num="0003">Conventionally, a predictor is known as a language analysis model that extracts an intrinsic expression for an input having a series structure such as a word (a character, a character string, and a symbol) in sentence data of text, a document, or the like.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">When this predictor is a machine learning model, the predictor first performs machine learning using each combination of teacher data and a teacher label. Next, the predictor inputs sentence data to be analyzed, and predicts an eigenvalue expression of each word in the sentence data, that is, predicts a possibility of something being a word of a label learned by the predictor.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Here, for example, the predictor outputs a range from &#x201c;0&#x201d; to &#x201c;1&#x201d; for each word in the sentence data as a predicted value of the eigenvalue expression. This predicted value indicates that something has a higher possibility of being the label as this predicted value is closer to &#x201c;1.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition, when the predictor described above is caused to perform learning, it is necessary to cause it to perform learning using a large amount of teacher data and teacher labels to improve accuracy of prediction of something being the label.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">For this reason, a learning device that causes the predictor to perform learning using teacher data and teacher labels is used (refer to, for example, Patent Literature 1).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">PRIOR ART DOCUMENTS</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Documents</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Patent Document 1</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. 2008-225907</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the learning of a predictor described above, it is necessary to perform learning using much teacher data and many teacher labels to improve accuracy in prediction of an eigenvalue expression.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, it is not clear whether each of the teacher data and the teacher labels used for learning is effective for the learning of a predictor. That is, it is not known whether each of the teacher data and the teacher labels used for learning is data that improves accuracy in prediction of a predictor.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">For this reason there is a disadvantage that the accuracy in prediction of a predictor cannot be improved even if much teacher data and many teacher labels are used, or it takes a long time to cause it to perform learning until a predetermined accuracy in prediction is obtained.
