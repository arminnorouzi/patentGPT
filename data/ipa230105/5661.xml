The primary coil is connected to an input circuit in which voltage is to be transformed, and the secondary coil is connected to an output circuit in which the transformed voltage is used.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">More specifically, when an AC current of the input circuit passes through the primary coil, a magnetic flux whose strength and direction varies is generated in response to the AC current. A change of the magnetic flux induces an AC voltage in the secondary coil, and the turn ratio of the primary and secondary coils determines a voltage transformation ratio. The transformer is used in various types of electronic devices&#x2014;for example, liquid crystal displays (LCD), flat panel displays (FPD), plasma display panels (PDP), printers, and so on.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, the transformer is configured by including a bobbin made of resin around which the primary coil and the secondary coil are wound, an inner core inserted into the bobbin, and a cover core covering the bobbin. A primary coil terminal is placed on one side of the bobbin to electrically connect the input circuit and the primary coil, and a secondary coil terminal is placed on the other side of the bobbin to electrically connect the output circuit and the secondary coil.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The bobbin, which is made of resin as mentioned above, is made by plastic injection molding according to design conditions so that a hollow portion for mounting the inner core is formed inside, where the coils are wound around the bobbin and the inner core is inserted and fixed to the hollow portion of the bobbin.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, when an AC current of the input circuit passes through the primary coil, a change in current flowing through the primary coil produces a magnetic flux change in the inner core, an induced current flows through the secondary coil by a magnetic flux created in the inner core, and the induced current flowing through the secondary coil is provided to the output circuit. In this instance, the cover core prevents outward leakage of magnetic flux by enclosing the magnetic flux created in the inner core.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, the above conventional technology is problematic in that it cannot cope with optimum discharge voltage which varies with gases, because the number of turns in a coil wound on a secondary bobbin is constant.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In view of this, the present disclosure is directed to provide a portable plasma device in which a switch circuit is added and attached to a secondary bobbin of a high-voltage transformer, which can apply optimum discharge voltage depending on the type of gas introduced into the plasma device since the number of turns on the secondary bobbin can be adjusted according to the on or off state of the switch, and can therefore improve plasma generation efficiency.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present disclosure provides a secondary bobbin of a high-voltage transformer including: a main body; barrier portions dividing the main body into a predetermined number of multiple segments along the length of the main body; winding portions where a coil is wound on the multiple segments; and a plurality of switch circuit portions connecting neighboring barrier portions by a switch, wherein the number of turns is adjusted depending on whether the switch is on or off.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The switch circuit portions may include single pole double throw (SPDT) switches.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The thickness of each of the barrier portions may be determined by the average number of turns calculated by the following equation:</p><p id="p-0014" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Average number of turns=Sum of the numbers of turns on both sides of barrier portion/2<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0015" num="0013">The switch circuit portions may be individually switched on or off.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0014">When a switch circuit portion is switched on, neighboring winding portions connected to the switched-on switch circuit portion may be electrically connected through a circuit.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0015">The plurality of switch circuit portions may be sequentially switched on or off along the length of the main body.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0016">Another exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure provides a portable plasma device including: a handset comprising a discharge voltage regulator, a secondary bobbin of a high-voltage transformer, and an electrode assembly;

Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, the secondary bobbin <b>10</b> of the high-voltage transformer may include a main body <b>100</b>, barrier portions <b>200</b>, winding portions <b>300</b>, and switch circuit portions <b>400</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0027">The main body <b>100</b> has a predetermined length and may have a secondary coil wound on the outer circumference. A core insertion hole <b>110</b> through which a core is inserted and passes may be formed at an inner center of the main body <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0028">The core insertion hole <b>110</b> may be formed in such a way that it penetrates the center along the length of the main body <b>100</b>. The shape of a cross-section of the core insertion hole <b>110</b> may correspond to the shape of a cross-section of the core inserted into the core insertion hole <b>110</b>, examples of which include, but not limited to, circular, rectangular, and polygonal.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0029">An inside wall of the core insertion hole <b>110</b> may be coated with an insulating material so that the core inserted into the core insertion hole <b>110</b> and the coil wound on the main body <b>100</b> are kept insulated from each other.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0030">A plurality of barrier portions <b>200</b> may be placed at predetermined intervals along the length of the main body <b>100</b>, and may divide the main body <b>100</b> into multiple segments and be formed along the outer circumference of the main body <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0031">The barrier portions <b>200</b> may be spaced at equal distances or at predetermined distances.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0032">The spacing distance between each of the plurality of barrier portions <b>200</b> may be predetermined so that the secondary bobbin <b>10</b> of the high-voltage transformer generates and applies an optimum discharge voltage which varies for different types of gases introduced into the plasma device.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0033">The barrier portions <b>200</b> each may have a thickness of 0.3 mm to 5 mm. A barrier portion thickness less than 0.3 mm may shorten the distance between the windings of the secondary coil wound on each segment of the outer circumference, and this may lead to insufficient electrical insulation. With a barrier portion thickness more than 5 mm, the secondary coil may not have enough windings to accommodate the thickness of the barrier portions <b>200</b> by comparison to its insulation effect. Thus, the thickness of the barrier portions <b>200</b> may not exceed 5 mm.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0034">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the thickness of the barrier portions <b>200</b> may vary with the number of turns on the winding portions <b>300</b> wound on both sides of each of the barrier portions <b>200</b>. That is, the thickness of each of the barrier portions <b>200</b> may be proportional to the average number of turns between two winding portions <b>300</b> placed on both sides of the barrier portion <b>200</b>. As the number of turns in a coil wound on a winding portion <b>300</b> increases, the voltage applied in the winding portion <b>300</b> increases, which may cause damage to the secondary bobbin <b>10</b> due to the voltage. Accordingly, it is important that the barrier portions <b>200</b> prevent damage to the secondary bobbin <b>10</b> by providing sufficient insulation between the winding portions <b>300</b>. As such, the thickness of each of the barrier portions <b>200</b> may be determined in such a way as not to cause damage to the secondary bobbin <b>10</b>. The average number (S) of turns may be calculated by the following equation.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Average number of turns=Sum of the numbers of turns on both sides of barrier portion/2<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0039" num="0035">A guard <b>120</b> may be formed on both ends of the main body <b>100</b>.
