It would be apparent to those skilled in the art that the embodiment described below is merely an example of the present disclosure and modifications and variations may be made therein without departing from the scope of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the following description, a frontward direction <b>51</b> is defined as a direction in which an ink cartridge <b>30</b> is inserted into a cartridge-attachment section <b>110</b>. A rearward direction <b>52</b> is defined as a direction in which the ink cartridge <b>30</b> is extracted from the cartridge-attachment section <b>110</b>. In the following example, the ink cartridge <b>30</b> is inserted and extracted horizontally relative to the cartridge-attachment section <b>110</b>. Hence, description will be made assuming that the frontward direction <b>51</b> and the rearward direction <b>52</b> are horizontal, but the frontward direction <b>51</b> and the rearward direction <b>52</b> may not be horizontal. Further, a downward direction <b>53</b> is defined as a direction perpendicular to the frontward direction <b>51</b> or the rearward direction <b>52</b>. An upward direction <b>54</b> is defined as a direction opposite the downward direction <b>53</b>. Further, a rightward direction <b>55</b> is defined as a direction perpendicular to the frontward direction <b>51</b> and the downward direction <b>53</b>. A leftward direction <b>56</b> is defined as a direction opposite the rightward direction <b>55</b>. Accordingly, in a state where the ink cartridge <b>30</b> is attached to the cartridge-attachment section <b>110</b> and is used therewith, the downward direction <b>53</b> coincides with the gravitational direction and the upward direction <b>54</b> is opposite the gravitational direction. That is, in the state where the ink cartridge <b>30</b> is attached to the cartridge-attachment section <b>110</b> and is used therewith, an outer surface of a main bottom wall <b>42</b> of a housing <b>130</b> faces downward in the gravitational direction. Further, the rightward direction <b>55</b> and the leftward direction <b>56</b> are defined as directions perpendicular to the frontward direction <b>51</b> and the downward direction <b>53</b>. More specifically, in the state where the ink cartridge <b>30</b> is attached to the cartridge-attachment section <b>110</b> and is used therewith, the rightward direction <b>55</b> is a direction toward the right and the leftward direction <b>56</b> is a direction toward the left when the ink cartridge <b>30</b> is viewed from a rear side thereof. Note that a state where the ink cartridge <b>30</b> is attached to the cartridge-attachment section <b>110</b> and is used therewith implies a state where the ink cartridge <b>30</b> has been completely inserted into an attached position in the cartridge-attachment section <b>110</b>. At the attached position of the ink cartridge <b>30</b>, an ink supply tube <b>102</b> of the cartridge-attachment section <b>110</b> is inserted in an ink supply portion <b>34</b> of the ink cartridge <b>30</b> and is connected thereto. Further, hereinafter, a posture of the ink cartridge <b>30</b> in a state where the ink cartridge <b>30</b> is attached to the cartridge-attachment section <b>110</b> and is used thereby will be referred to as an &#x201c;operable posture.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Further, in the following description, the frontward direction <b>51</b> and the rearward direction <b>52</b> may be collectively referred to as a front-rear direction. The upward direction <b>54</b> and the downward direction <b>53</b> may be collectively referred to as an up-down direction. The rightward direction <b>55</b> and the leftward direction <b>56</b> may be collectively referred to as a left-right direction.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the following description, &#x201c;facing frontward&#x201d; includes facing in a direction including a frontward component, and &#x201c;facing rearward&#x201d; includes facing in a direction including a rearward component. Further, &#x201c;facing downward&#x201d; includes facing in a direction including a downward component, and &#x201c;facing upward&#x201d; includes facing in a direction including an upward component. For example, &#x201c;a front surface faces frontward&#x201d; denotes that the front surface may face in a frontward direction, or the front surface may face in a direction inclined relative to the frontward direction.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">[Overview of Printer <b>10</b>]</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a printer <b>10</b> is an image-recording apparatus configured to record an image by selectively ejecting ink droplets onto a sheet based on an inkjet recording system.

That is, one of the protrusion <b>43</b> and the rib <b>67</b>, which is higher than the remaining one of the protrusion <b>43</b> and the rib <b>67</b>, first collides against the floor <b>160</b>. Since the protrusion <b>43</b> is higher than the rib <b>67</b> in the present embodiment, the horizontal surface <b>154</b> (the highest point) of the protrusion <b>43</b> collides against the floor <b>160</b> prior to the rib <b>67</b>.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">Thereafter, the ink cartridge <b>30</b> pivots clockwise in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, due to the gravitational force or acceleration thereof, and the upper edge <b>67</b>FU of the front end <b>67</b>F of the rib <b>67</b> then collides against the floor <b>160</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. With this structure, compared to a configuration where the ink cartridge <b>30</b> were without the rib <b>67</b>, there is a smaller change in posture of the housing <b>130</b> (angular rotation) upon collision of the dropped ink cartridge <b>30</b> against the floor <b>160</b>. Thus, splash of ink through the ink supply port <b>71</b> of the ink supply portion <b>34</b> is less likely to occur. Incidentally, a state depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a state where the protrusion <b>43</b> and the rib <b>67</b> of the ink cartridge <b>30</b> are in contact with a single flat plane (i.e., the floor <b>160</b>, or the imaginary plane <b>150</b>). In this state, a gap is formed between the imaginary plane <b>150</b> and the IC board <b>64</b> vertically.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">Further, since the front edges <b>65</b>F of the electrodes <b>65</b> of the IC board <b>64</b> is positioned further rearward of the center point C<b>2</b> in the front-rear direction, clearance (a gap) can be reliably ensured between the imaginary plane <b>150</b> and the IC board <b>64</b> in the up-down direction. Accordingly, in a case where the ink cartridge <b>30</b> is dropped and collides against the floor <b>160</b>, there is less likely that the function in the IC board <b>64</b> gets damaged by, for example, contact of the IC board <b>64</b> against the floor <b>160</b>.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">Still further, the dimension in the front-rear direction of the rib <b>67</b> between the front end <b>67</b>F and the rear end <b>67</b>R is greater than the distance in the front-rear direction between the front end <b>63</b>F of the sub top wall <b>63</b>, which is a frontmost end of the housing <b>130</b>, and the front end <b>67</b>F of the rib <b>67</b>. That is, the rib <b>67</b> extends in the front-rear direction such that the front end <b>67</b>F thereof is provided at a position in the vicinity of the front end <b>63</b>F of the housing <b>130</b>. With this structure, clearance (a gap) in the up-down direction can be further reliably ensured between the imaginary plane <b>150</b> and the IC board <b>64</b> compared to a case where the front end <b>67</b>F of the rib <b>67</b> is not provided near the front end <b>63</b>F of the housing <b>130</b>. Further, since the rib <b>67</b> has a long dimension in the front-rear direction, impact may hardly occur on the top wall <b>39</b> of the housing <b>130</b> in a case where the ink cartridge <b>30</b> is dropped and collides against the flat plane such as the floor <b>160</b>.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">Still further, in the present embodiment, the protrusion <b>43</b> and the rib <b>67</b> protrude upward from the top wall <b>39</b> and are immovable in the up-down direction and relative to the top wall <b>39</b>. The IC board <b>64</b> is positioned between the protrusion <b>43</b> and the rib <b>67</b> in the front-rear direction and is lower than the imaginary plane <b>150</b> passing through each of the first point (the boundary <b>156</b> on the upper surface of the protrusion <b>43</b>) and the second point (the upper edge <b>67</b>FU of the front end <b>67</b>F of the rib <b>67</b>) and extending in the left-right direction. With this structure, when the ink cartridge <b>30</b> is dropped onto a flat plane such as the floor <b>160</b>, a gap (clearance) can be reliably formed between the flat plane (the floor <b>160</b>) and the IC board <b>64</b>. Accordingly, the IC board <b>64</b> can be reliably protected from the impact at the time of fall of the ink cartridge <b>30</b> onto the floor <b>160</b>.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Further, in the ink cartridge <b>30</b> of the present embodiment, the front end <b>67</b>F of the rib <b>67</b> is positioned forward of the ink supply port <b>71</b> of the ink supply portion <b>34</b> in the frontward direction <b>51</b>. That is, the front-rear dimension of the rib <b>67</b> can be made longer, compared to a conventional cartridge whose ink supply portion is positioned forward the front end <b>67</b>F of the rib <b>67</b>.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">In an attempt to increase a volume of a storage chamber, an ink supply portion tends to be arranged to a position further forward, i.e., in a direction away from the protrusion <b>43</b>, as in the above-mentioned conventional cartridge. When this conventional cartridge is dropped onto the floor <b>160</b>, the protrusion <b>43</b> first comes into contact with the floor <b>160</b> and subsequently the rib <b>67</b> comes into contact with the floor <b>160</b> as described earlier. While the protrusion <b>43</b> and the rib <b>67</b> sequentially collide against the floor <b>160</b>, the ink cartridge may pivot about the protrusion <b>43</b>. During the pivoting of this ink cartridge, rotational movement is applied to the ink supply portion <b>34</b> positioned frontward than the front end <b>67</b>F of the rib <b>67</b>. As a result, leakage of ink through the ink supply port <b>71</b> of the ink supply portion <b>34</b> is likely to occur.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">In contrast, in the ink cartridge <b>30</b> according to the present embodiment, the front end <b>67</b>F of the rib <b>67</b> is positioned forward of the ink supply portion <b>34</b> provided at the housing <b>130</b> (lower base <b>130</b>B) defining the first and second storage chambers <b>32</b>, <b>33</b> therein. With this structure of the embodiment, compared to the above conventional cartridge, the pivoting amount (amount of angular rotation) of the ink cartridge <b>30</b> can be made smaller when the ink cartridge <b>30</b> is dropped onto the floor <b>160</b>. Thus, rotational moment imparted on the ink supply portion <b>34</b> at the time of collision against the floor <b>160</b> can also be made smaller, thereby reducing a risk of ink leakage through the ink supply port <b>71</b>. The ink cartridge <b>30</b> according to the present embodiment can thus suppress occurrence of ink leakage through ink supply portion <b>34</b> at the time of dropping onto the floor <b>160</b>, without decrease in volume of the storage chamber in the housing <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">Further, the longer front-rear dimension of the rib <b>67</b> of the present embodiment can also serve to mitigate the impact to be transmitted to the top wall <b>39</b> upon collision of the rib <b>67</b> against a flat plane such as the floor <b>160</b>, and can provide an enhanced strength to the top wall <b>39</b> of the housing <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">Further, since the dimension of the rib <b>67</b> in the front-rear direction is greater than the dimensions thereof in the up-down direction and the left-right direction, the rib <b>67</b> is hard to get damaged even when the rib <b>67</b> is made into contact with a flat plane such as the floor <b>160</b> as a result of a fall of the ink cartridge <b>30</b> onto the floor <b>160</b>. Further, since the first protrusion <b>43</b> is constituted by the right protruding portion <b>43</b>R and the left protruding portion <b>43</b>L connected to each other by the rear protruding portion <b>43</b>B, the first protrusion <b>43</b> has a higher impact-resistance than that of the rib <b>67</b>.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">Further, since the rear protruding portion <b>43</b>B has the engaging surface <b>43</b>BF facing rearward in the front-rear direction for engagement with the lock shaft <b>145</b> of the cartridge case <b>101</b> in a state where the ink cartridge <b>30</b> is attached to the cartridge case <b>101</b>, the rearward-facing surface (the engaging surface <b>43</b>BF) of the first protrusion <b>43</b> can be used for positioning of the ink cartridge <b>30</b> in the cartridge case <b>101</b>, without provision of a separate engaging member on the ink cartridge <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">Further, the sub top wall <b>63</b> extends from the second main top wall <b>62</b>, and is positioned forward of the second main top wall <b>62</b> in the front-rear direction. Hence, even when the ink cartridge <b>30</b> is dropped onto a flat surface such as the floor <b>160</b>, the sloped sub top wall <b>63</b> is less likely to collide against the floor <b>160</b>. Further, since the rib <b>67</b> is positioned to extend across the boundary <b>70</b> between the second main top wall <b>62</b> and the sub top wall <b>63</b>, the boundary <b>70</b> can be reinforced by the rib <b>67</b>.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">Further, the boundary <b>70</b> is positioned below the imaginary plane <b>150</b> in the above-described embodiment.

Consequently, deformation of the top wall <b>39</b> near the boundary <b>70</b> can be suppressed.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">Further, since the rib <b>67</b> extends along the sub top wall <b>63</b> and the second main top wall <b>62</b> of top wall <b>39</b>, the rib <b>67</b> has a dimension sufficiently long enough to reinforce the top wall <b>39</b> of the housing <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">Further, the upper surface of the rib <b>67</b> has the sub upper surface <b>69</b> and the main upper surface <b>68</b>. The sloped sub upper surface <b>69</b> is positioned forward of the main upper surface <b>68</b> in the front-rear direction. With this structure, the sub upper surface <b>69</b> is less likely to come into contact with the cartridge case <b>101</b> during the insertion of the ink cartridge <b>30</b> into the cartridge case <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">Further, since the front end <b>67</b>F of the rib <b>67</b>, which tends to be applied with an external force, is positioned frontward than any one of the engaging pawls <b>86</b> in the front-rear direction, the external force applied to the rib <b>67</b> is less likely to be transmitted to the engaging pawls <b>86</b>.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">Further, the rear end <b>67</b>R of the rib <b>67</b> is positioned further rearward than one of the engaging holes <b>86</b> that is positioned frontmost thereamong in the front-rear direction. That is, the rib <b>67</b> extends in the front-rear direction to have a length long enough to cover an entire dimension of the frontmost engaging hole <b>86</b> in the front-rear direction, thereby further reinforcing the cover <b>134</b>.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">Further, since the rib <b>67</b> is in a form of a wall elongated in the front-rear direction, the rib <b>67</b> is hard to interfere with a component of the cartridge case <b>101</b> during the attachment of the ink cartridge <b>30</b> into the cartridge case <b>101</b>. Further, since the front-rear dimension of the rib <b>67</b> is greater than the vertical dimension thereof, the rib <b>67</b> is hard to get damaged even when the rib <b>67</b> is made into contact with the floor <b>160</b> as a result of a fall of the ink cartridge <b>30</b> onto the floor <b>160</b>. Further, the protrusion <b>43</b> is constituted by the right protruding portion <b>43</b>R and the left protruding portion <b>43</b>L connected to each other by the rear protruding portion <b>43</b>B.
