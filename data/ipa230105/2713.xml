id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">Disclosed are a biomimic system simulating lung tissue, a method for manufacturing same, and a microfluidic control method using same, wherein the biomimic system comprises lung epithelial cells and lung fibroblasts, which are isolated from human lungs, and commercially available vascular endothelial cells, and wherein a microfluid flows through the biomimic system. Each chamber inside the corresponding system can allow a fluid, which contains gas and a medium, to flow therethrough and simulate respiration-like movement, wherein all of the three types of cells can survive inside the system even when one week or more have elapsed after through-flow of the fluid. In addition, the pH and pO<sub>2 </sub>in the chamber can be monitored by using a pH sensor and a gas partial pressure sensor inside the system, and thus the three types of cells inside the system can be exposed to external environments, drugs, and the like under the same conditions as in the lungs in vivo. Therefore, a wide range of studies including modeling of lung diseases by harmful substances and testing of therapeutic drug efficacy can be conducted, and further, the utilization to in vitro disease modeling, customized medicine prescriptions, and the like can also be made.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="124.21mm"

for respiration and is an organ that obtains oxygen and releases carbon dioxide through inhalation and exhalation of air. Red blood cells in the blood, which pass through the capillaries of the alveoli where gas exchange takes place in the lung, transport carbon dioxide produced in the body, then release the carbon dioxide out of the body through the alveoli, take oxygen from the atmosphere, and transport oxygen throughout the body. Therefore, unlike other organs in the human body, gas flows in and out in the lung.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Meanwhile, in-vivo and in-vitro models for the study of lung diseases are still not sufficiently developed due to the characteristics of the lung. For example, animal models often do not develop pathological abnormalities of the airways and lungs as found in humans, and most in-vitro models cannot reproduce the tissue components and the structural complexity of actually variously differentiated airway epithelial cells. Further, as described above, in-vitro models simulating the lungs should be exposed to the gas containing oxygen for the study. However, if in-vitro models manufactured using commercially available cells are exposed to the gas, cells die, for example, within three days, and thus the in-vitro models are not appropriate for a series of processes of model production, drug effect exploration, drug toxicity screening, and the like, which take at least seven days or longer.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Accordingly, the present inventors have conducted a study on a microfluidic system in which cells survive for a long period of time even while the gas and the medium-containing fluid is perfused, so that simulation of various lung disease models, efficacy test for therapeutic drugs, other harmful substance tests, in-vitro diagnosis, and personalized medicine prescription are enabled, and have completed the present invention.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to an aspect, an object of the present invention is to provide a microfluidic system simulating a lung tissue which includes lung epithelial cells and lung fibroblasts, which are isolated from a human lung, and commercially available vascular endothelial cells, and where a gas and a medium-containing fluid are perfused inside the system, and a pH sensor and a pO<sub>2 </sub>sensor which senses partial oxygen pressure (pO<sub>2</sub>) among gas partial pressures are included.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to another aspect, an object of the present invention is to provide a method of manufacturing the microfluidic system simulating a lung tissue.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to another aspect, an object of the present invention is to provide a method of monitoring a cell culture environment in the microfluidic system simulating a lung tissue, which includes a step of perfusing a microfluid to the microfluidic system simulating a lung tissue and measuring pH and pO<sub>2</sub>.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to an aspect, the present invention provides a microfluidic system simulating a lung tissue, the system including a first layer; a second layer; a third layer; a first chamber for gas perfusion between the first layer and the second layer; and a second chamber for medium-containing fluid perfusion between the second layer and the third layer, in which the second layer may include a porous membrane, the porous membrane may include lung epithelial cells, lung fibroblasts, and commercially available vascular endothelial cells (human umbilical vein endothelial cells), the lung epithelial cells may face the first chamber, the vascular endothelial cells may face the second chamber, the lung fibroblasts may be present between the vascular endothelial cells and the lung epithelial cells, the lung epithelial cells and the lung fibroblasts may be cells isolated from a human lung, and the first layer and the third layer may include one or more pH sensors and one or more gas pO<sub>2 </sub>sensors, respectively.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to another aspect, the present invention provides a method for manufacturing the microfluidic system simulating a lung tissue, including a step (1) of coating a porous membrane of a second layer with an extracellular matrix; a step (2) of seeding and culturing lung epithelial cells isolated from a human on the coated porous membrane; and a step (3) of seeding and culturing lung fibroblasts isolated from a human and the commercially available vascular endothelial cells (human umbilical vein endothelial cells) on an opposite surface of the porous membrane on which the lung epithelial cells are seeded.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In addition, according to another aspect, the present invention provides a method of monitoring a cell culture environment in the microfluidic system simulating a lung tissue, the method including a microfluidic perfusion step of perfusing gas to the first chamber of the microfluidic system simulating a lung tissue and perfusing the medium-containing fluid to the second chamber; and a step of measuring pH by the pH sensor of the system and measuring pO<sub>2 </sub>by the pO<sub>2 </sub>sensor.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Advantageous Effects of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The present invention relates to a microfluidic system simulating a lung tissue including lung epithelial cells and lung fibroblasts isolated directly from human lungs, in which a gas and a medium-containing fluid may be perfused in each chamber inside the system, and all the three types of cells in the system may survive even when a week or more have elapsed after the perfusion of the gas and the fluid.
