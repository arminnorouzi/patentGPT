level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to a system, methods and nodes for managing a communication network subscription identifier that is associated with a device. The present disclosure also relates to a computer program and a computer program product configured, when run on a computer to carry out methods for managing a communication network subscription identifier that is associated with a device.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The &#x201c;Internet of Things&#x201d; (IoT) refers to devices enabled for communication network connectivity, so that these devices may be remotely managed, and data collected or required by the devices may be exchanged between individual devices and between devices and application servers. Such devices, examples of which may include sensors and actuators, are often, although not necessarily, subject to severe limitations on processing power, storage capacity, energy supply, device complexity and/or network connectivity, imposed by their operating environment or situation, and may consequently be referred to as constrained devices.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Mobile communication networks are increasingly used by IoT devices, and continuing dramatic increase in the use of these devices for a wide range of services is expected in the coming years. One obstacle to this growth in the use of IoT devices is the cost of the devices, and in particular the cost of the Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC) and embedded UICC (eUICC) technologies that are used to hold and protect subscriber credentials. These credentials are used in the authentication process that enables access to a mobile network. The cost of such technologies is almost on par with the cost of the modem of the IoT device.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Implementing Subscriber Identification Module (SIM) functionality through UICC and eUICC technologies is thus prohibitively expensive in the context of realizing a vision of several tens of billions of mobile connected devices in the near future. Alternative solutions to the UICC and eUICC have been proposed to address this cost issue. Such solutions include integrated UICC (iUICC) and Machine Communication Identity Module (MCIM). These solutions would lower cost significantly by implementing the SIM functions in circuitry that is integrated in the device modem or main processing chip. While addressing the cost issues associated with UICC and eUICC, the iUICC and MCIM offer lower strength subscription protection owing to their tightly integrated nature. It is very difficult, if not impossible, to fully apply strict security assurance procedures like Common Criteria in iUICC and MCIM, as it is very hard to have the circuitry for the SIM functions fully isolated from the rest of the chip. A strict security assurance for the whole chip would be an insurmountably difficult task that would also be extremely costly.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">When using tightly integrated SIM solutions, there is therefore an increased risk of subscription fraud that could arise from credentials being exfiltrated from a device and cloned into another device. An additional complication for device owners when considering subscription fraud prevention is that device testing, device repair and management of broken devices all require a degree of control over which subscription identifiers are used in test and replacement devices.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">US 20110014939 discloses a method for detection of subscription fraud on the basis of location information in a local network. However, location information may not be sufficient to detect fraudulent use of credentials in all use cases, and in addition, the method of US 20110014939 fails to account for situations in which a device may be roaming, and so connected to a visited network as opposed to its home network.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is an aim of the present disclosure to provide a system, methods, nodes and computer readable medium which at least partially address one or more of the challenges discussed above. It is a further aim of the present disclosure to provide a system, methods, nodes and computer readable medium which cooperate to ensure that cloned subscription credentials may not be used to obtain network access authentication.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to a first aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a system for managing a communication network subscription identifier associated with a device.

Aspects of the present disclosure propose binding a subscription identifier to a characteristic of a device with which the identifier is to be used, such that the subscription identifier is uniquely associated with the device characteristic. When the subscription identifier is presented by a device seeking network access, the binding between subscription identifier and device characteristic may be verified to ensure that the device presenting the subscription identifier is in possession of the characteristic to which the subscription identifier is bound. The nature of the device characteristic to which a subscription identifier is bound may vary according to different examples of the present disclosure. Two categories of device characteristic are proposed in the present disclosure: behavioural characteristics and permanent identities.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">IoT devices are life-cycle managed through some form of Device Management system. In addition to collecting application related data (e.g. sensor data) the Device Management system manages Software updates to correct bugs or address security vulnerabilities. In order to secure the link between the device and the Device Management system, and to enable a user to claim and maintain ownership of the device, IoT devices are often equipped with a device identity that is permanent and independent of a mobile network to which the device may connect, and consequently independent of the operator of such a network. The permanent device identity comprises a permanent device identifier (PDI) and at least one associated credential. A permanent device identity of this nature may be distinguished from a subscription identity, which comprises a subscription identifier such as an International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI), which is assigned by a communication network to subscribers to the network. The permanent device identity is not used for network access authentication, and remains unchanged even if a subscription identity (including a subscription identifier) for the device is updated, for example if the device is to be connected to another network owned by another MNO. Permanent device identities are used by the Device Management system for identifying individual devices, even if the device management system may also be aware of and make use of a subscription identifier allocated to a device. Permanent device identities lend themselves much more readily to strong protection against exfiltration of the identity credentials which may be comprised in the identity. Cloning of a permanent device identity may therefore be considered to be practically infeasible.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to one example of the present disclosure, during a phase in which a device is registered in a device management system, and a subscription is arranged for the device, a permanent device identity may be bound to a subscription identifier for the device, such as an IMSI, and may also be bound to use or behavioural characteristics including mobile network cell information, and network functions that the device owner wishes the device to have. The permanent device identity is bound to the subscription identifier via its component permanent device identifier. As the permanent device identity is for all practical purposes not cloneable, and is bound (via its identifier) to the subscription identifier associated with the device, it is possible to check this binding before, during or after authentication by a network authentication agent. This check may discover that the binding is correct, or that the binding is incorrect, or that during network registration the same IMSI appears again but with a different permanent device identifier bound to it. Such a &#x201c;re-binding&#x201d; may be blocked or may trigger a fraud alarm that blocks network access until proper authorisation is established and the previous registered device management owner confirms the rebinding is correct and the device should be allowed to access the network.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some circumstances, a device may not be provided with a permanent device identity but only a device identifier, which may be permanent or non-permanent. Some mobile devices, for example, are only provided with an International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI), which can be changed or cloned and so is not a basis for a secure binding between device and subscription identity. In such circumstances, it may be desirable to use a behavioural device characteristic for binding to the subscription identifier assigned to a device. The behavioural characteristic may be provided by a Device Connection Service (DCS) when the device is registered. The behavioural characteristic may for example include information, provided by the device owner (or in some cases the manufacturer of the device), about how the device connects to the network. Such information may, for example, be obtained from a Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD). This behaviour may then be observed by the DCS when the device connects to the network and/or during registration, in order to enable a comparison with the behaviour characteristic bound to the subscriber identifier presented by the device. For example, a device owner can indicate that a device is a stationary device such as a temperature sensor or a pump valve controller, in which case the DCS can record the network cell number and other network characteristics for binding to the subscriber identifier assigned to the device. In further examples, a behavioural characteristic may also encompass environmental factors, which may in some examples be linked to location, including altitude, temperature, electricity, land air and/or underwater deployments etc. Any such factors may be provided on registration of a device and observed when the device connects to the network.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">When a device connects to a communication network, the DCS may observe the network characteristics of the connecting device and pass this to a Verification Node for comparison with the behavioural characteristic bound to the subscription identifier presented by the device. The Verification Node is a new functional service entity, which may be implemented on a physical or virtual node and may in some examples be co-located with one or more other services. The Verification node compares an observed behavioural characteristic from the DCS with a stored behavioural characteristic that is bound to the subscription identifier presented by the device, and performs an analysis to determine whether the connectivity is normal (observed and bound behavioural characteristics are consistent) or is potentially fraudulent (mismatch between the observed and bound behavioural characteristics). If a potential fraud is detected, the Verification node may push an alarm condition to a Network Access node, such as a Network Access Authentication Function (NAAF). Alternatively a Network Access node such as a NAAF may pull a verification result from the Verification node when it performs network access verification.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some circumstances, the Network Access node for a particular device may be in a visited network, for example as a visited network Mobility Management Entity (MME) in a 4G network. In such circumstances, only the home network knows that a presented subscription identifier is associated with a device for which a Verification node service is available. To inform the Network Access node, the home network, for example a Core Network node such as a Home Subscription Server (HSS), may push a Unique Resource Identifier (URI) of the appropriate Verification node to the visiting network. The URI may be included with the authentication information that the home network pushes to the visited network under existing attach procedures. In other examples, for example in which a behavioural characteristic is bound to a subscription identifier, the DCS may have connection information that will be used for verification of a binding. In such examples, the home network (for example a Core Network node such as a HSS) may contact the DCS and pull connection information for provision to the Verification node to allow the Verification node to perform a binding check. If the binding check is unable to confirm that the device is in possession of a bound characteristic, the visiting network may be informed using standard network procedures that access should not be granted.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an overview of a network architecture <b>100</b> within which the system, methods and nodes of the present disclosure may be deployed.

It will be appreciated from the following discussion that the system <b>200</b> may comprise one or more elements of the architecture <b>100</b> described above. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the system <b>200</b> comprises a Core Network node <b>210</b> configured to provide a subscription identifier for the device to a Device Management node with management responsibility for the device.

The Verification node may comprise a new functional entity providing verification services as discussed above and in greater detail below. According to examples of the present disclosure, the Network Access node may comprise a Network Access Authentication Function (NAAF), Mobility Management Entity (MME) or Access Management Function (AMF), and may be located in a home or visited network. It will be appreciated that the nodes of the system <b>200</b> comprise functional entities that may be deployed on one or more physical or virtual nodes.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The nodes of the system <b>200</b> cooperate to provide binding by the Verification node <b>230</b> of a subscription identifier to a device characteristic, and to verify that a device presenting the subscription identifier is in possession of the characteristic bound to the identifier. As noted above, binding a characteristic to a subscription identifier comprises creating a unique association between these two elements. In some examples, the unique association may be immutable. In some circumstances, it may be required to re-bind a subscription identifier to a new device characteristic, for example in the event of testing of different devices with the same IMSI, replacement of a broken device with the same IMSI, subscription transfer between devices, etc. In such circumstances, the immutable nature of the binding between subscription identifier and device characteristic means that such a &#x201c;re-binding&#x201d; is in fact the creation of a new association for the subscription identity, which may be approved by the Device Management node through a signature, and not an updating of an existing binding.

In further examples, the performance and use of the cryptographic calculations may take place before or after a network authentication procedure.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0042">In some examples of the present disclosure, the device that is in possession of a characteristic and presenting a subscription identifier may be a constrained device. For the purposes of the present disclosure, a constrained device comprises a device which conforms to the definition set out in section 2.1 of IETF RFC 7228 for &#x201c;constrained node&#x201d;. According to the definition in IETF RFC 7228, a constrained device is a device in which &#x201c;some of the characteristics that are otherwise pretty much taken for granted for Internet nodes at the time of writing are not attainable, often due to cost constraints and/or physical constraints on characteristics such as size, weight, and available power and energy. The tight limits on power, memory, and processing resources lead to hard upper bounds on state, code space, and processing cycles, making optimization of energy and network bandwidth usage a dominating consideration in all design requirements. Also, some layer-2 services such as full connectivity and broadcast/multicast may be lacking&#x201d;. Constrained devices are thus clearly distinguished from server systems, desktop, laptop or tablet computers and powerful mobile devices such as smartphones. A constrained device may for example comprise a Machine Type Communication device, a battery powered device or any other device having the above discussed limitations. Examples of constrained devices may include sensors measuring temperature, humidity and gas content, for example within a room or while goods are transported and stored, motion sensors for controlling light bulbs, sensors measuring light that can be used to control shutters, heart rate monitors and other sensors for personal health (continuous monitoring of blood pressure etc.) actuators and connected electronic door locks. IoT devices may comprise examples of constrained devices. Examples of the present disclosure may provide particular advantages when implemented in connection with constrained devices, owing to the trend in such devices toward integration of SIM function circuitry into a main processing chip and the security risks associated with such integration, as discussed in greater detail above.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0043">It will be appreciated that the system <b>200</b> described above comprises a plurality of different nodes, each of which performs respective method steps in order to carry out the cooperation that achieves the above discussed functionality. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> to <b>11</b></figref> are flow charts illustrating process steps in methods that may be carried out at individual nodes according to different examples of the present disclosure.

The method <b>300</b> is performed by a Verification node. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the method <b>300</b> comprises receiving, from a Device Management node with management responsibility for the device, a subscription identifier for the device and a characteristic of the device in step <b>310</b>. The method <b>300</b> further comprises, in step <b>320</b>, binding the subscription identifier to the characteristic such that the subscription identifier is uniquely associated with the characteristic, and, in step <b>330</b>, storing the bound subscription identifier and characteristic in a memory.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a flow chart illustrating process steps in another example of method <b>400</b>, performed by a Verification node, for managing a communication network subscription identifier associated with a device, which may be a constrained device as discussed above. The steps of the method <b>400</b> illustrate one example way in which the steps of the method <b>300</b> may be implemented and supplemented in order to achieve the above discussed and additional functionality.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0046">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, according to the method <b>400</b>, the Verification node carrying out the method first receives, in step <b>402</b>, a Device Management key associated with a Manager of the device. The Device Management key may be received, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, directly from a Device Management node with management responsibility for the device. In such examples, the Device management key may be received in the form of a certificate, and one or more trusted Certification Authorities (CAs) may have been configured which the received certificate must chain to in order for the Device Management Key to be trusted by the Verification node. In other examples, some registration and/or configuration may be performed by a trusted party relating to what key(s) are to be trusted by the Verification node.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0047">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the Verification node then sends, to a Core Network node at step <b>404</b>, an identification of the Verification node, wherein the identification comprises a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) of the Verification node. The identifier of the Verification node may further comprise a certificate (for example a Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificate) of the Verification node.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0048">In step <b>406</b>, the Verification node receives, from a Core Network node, a subscription identifier binding policy and a subscription identifier to which the policy applies. The binding policy may specify under what circumstances a new binding may be created for a subscription identifier, or conditions that must be fulfilled for a binding to take place (certificate or signature required etc.).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0049">In step <b>410</b>, the Verification node receives, from the Device Management node with management responsibility for the device, a subscription identifier for the device and a characteristic of the device. The characteristic of the device received from the Device Management node may comprise at least one of a behavioural characteristic or a permanent device identity.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0050">A behavioural characteristic may for example include information, provided by the device owner, about how the device connects to the network. For example, a device owner can indicate that a device is a stationary device and a behavioural characteristic for the device may include information about a location from which the device is expected to connect, such as mobile network cell information. A behavioural characteristic may additionally or alternatively include network functions that the device owner wishes the device to have, or any other information relating to how the device connects to and interacts with the network. The behavioural characteristic may then be observed by a Device Connection Service (DCS) for comparison with a bound behavioural characteristic.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0051">A permanent device identity, as discussed above, comprises a permanent device identifier and a credential. A permanent device identity is independent of a mobile network to which the device may connect, and consequently is independent of the operator of such a network. A permanent device identity, and its constituent permanent device identifier, may thus be distinguished from a subscription identifier, such as an International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI), which is assigned by a communication network to subscribers to the network. Permanent device identities are used by a device management system for identifying individual devices, even if the device management system may also be aware of and make use of a subscription identifier allocated to a device. A credential that is part of a permanent device identity, and therefore associated with the corresponding permanent device identifier, may in some examples comprise a device specific public key associated with a corresponding device specific private key, or may be a device specific symmetric key.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0052">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, after receiving a subscription identifier and characteristic of the device from the Device Management node in step <b>410</b>, the Verification node then checks, at step <b>412</b>, a signature included with the received subscription identifier and characteristic of the device using the Device Management key received in step <b>402</b>. In step <b>414</b>, the Verification node also checks whether a subscription identifier binding policy that applies to the subscription identifier received from the Device Management node has been received in step <b>406</b>. If such a subscription identifier binding policy has been received, the Verification node checks, in step <b>416</b>, whether binding of the subscription identifier received from the Device Management node to the characteristic received from the Device Management node is consistent with the subscription identifier binding policy.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0053">If binding of the subscription identifier received from the Device Management node to the characteristic received from the Device Management node is consistent with the subscription identifier binding policy, the Verification node proceeds, in step <b>420</b>, to bind the subscription identifier to the characteristic such that the subscription identifier is uniquely associated with the characteristic. In step <b>430</b>, the Verification node stores the bound subscription identifier and characteristic in a memory. In the case of a characteristic comprising a permanent device identity, the Verification node may bind the permanent device identity to the subscription identifier using the permanent device identifier part of the permanent device identity. In this manner, the permanent device identifier is explicitly bound to the subscription identifier, and via this binding, the entire permanent device identity, including the credential that is also part of the permanent device identity and is associated with the permanent device identifier, is also bound to the subscription identifier.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0054">The steps of the methods <b>300</b> and/or <b>400</b> thus enable a Verification node to bind a subscription identifier assigned to a device by a Core Network node of a communication network to a characteristic of the device. The binding may be subject to various checks to ensure that the binding should go ahead, and creates a unique association between the subscription identifier and the characteristic, which association may be immutable. In some examples, the association may be a new association for a subscription identifier that has already been bound to a different device characteristic in the past. This situation is referred to as a &#x201c;re-binding&#x201d;, and may be subject to additional restrictions set out in a subscription identifier binding policy or imposed directly through a confirmatory check with a mobile network operator via a Core Network node or with a Device Management node.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0055">The methods <b>300</b> and/or <b>400</b> may be complimented by methods carried out at a device, a Network Access node, a Core Network node a Device Management node and the Verification node, in order to verify that a device presenting a subscription identifier is in possession of the device characteristic to which the identifier has been bound by the Verification node. This is discussed in further detail below.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a flow chart illustrating process steps in a method <b>500</b> for verifying a communication network subscription identifier associated with a device. The method is performed by the device and comprises, in a first step <b>510</b>, receiving a parameter from a Network Access node. The received parameter may for example be a RAND value received as part of an Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) procedure, an Extensible Authentication Procedure (EAP)-AKA procedure, or an EAP-AKA&#x2032; procedure, or may be a random value received as part of a post authentication challenge. In step <b>520</b>, the device generates, on the basis of the received parameter, a parameter for sending to the Network Access node. The generated parameter may be the received challenge parameter, to be returned with a signature or Message Authentication Code (MAC), or may be a RES parameter generated as part of an AKA, EAP-AKA or EAP-AKA' procedure.

The comparison enables the Network Access node to confirm that the device is in possession of the bound characteristic, for example because it was able to accurately decrypt an encrypted RAND and generate the correct RES, or because it has correctly encrypted RES, or correctly generated a MAC or signature.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a flow chart illustrating process steps in a method <b>700</b> for verifying a communication network subscription identifier associated with a device, which may be a constrained device, as discussed above.

This system may be controlled by the owner of the device or licensed to a third party.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0115">As discussed above, the two options illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b> to <b>14</b></figref> demonstrate two different ways in which the above entities may cooperate to check that a subscriber identity is being used by the intended device, and to detect when exfiltrated subscriber credentials are being used in a device that is different from the intended device.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Option 1: Permanent Device Identity Characteristic</heading><p id="p-0101" num="0116">A device manufacturer of a UE registers device identities for the UE in a database (illustrated as DevDDB in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b> to <b>14</b></figref>). Typically, each entry consists of a device identifier (e.g. product type, serial number, etc.) and the public key portion of the device key pair of the device identity. It is this information that can be bound to a subscription identifier by the Verification node, for example during registration of the device in the device management system (DevMan in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b> to <b>14</b></figref>) when subscription is arranged for the device. In addition to the device identifier, behavioural characteristics including mobile network cell information and network functions that the device owner wishes the device to have may also be bound to the subscription identifier. The binding is handled by the Verification node (VS in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b> to <b>14</b></figref>) based on information provided by the device management system (DevMan) and the Device Connection Service (DCS).</p><p id="p-0102" num="0117">Specifically, the IMSI assigned to the device may be bound together with the permanent device identifier of the permanent device identity. The permanent device identifier is a piece of data that names or enumerates the identity credentials in the (name) space of all possible identifiers that are in use. As the device identity is not cloneable, and is uniquely associated with the IMSI, it is possible during, prior to, or after the authentication by the NAAF, to discover that the binding of the device identifier is not correct, or that during registration the IMSI appears again but with a different device identifier to be bound with. Such a re-binding can either be blocked or trigger a fraud alarm that temporarily blocks re-binding until proper authorisation is established and the previous registered device management owner grants permission for the re-binding to proceed. It will be appreciated that as the VS is under control of the MNO, it is always the MNO that takes the final decision to approve or disapprove the (re-binding), for example by providing a binding policy to the VS (as illustrated in step <b>150</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>). The VS is registered at the MNO and a TLS certificate may be provided (as illustrated in step <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>) for secure communication between the VS and the MNO.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0118">Re-binding of a subscription identifier to a different device may be appropriate in a range of different circumstances relating to testing, handling of broken devices and repair.

This can be done in various ways, for example, using the Remote SIM Provisioning, RSP, protocol(s) as specified by the GSMA, illustrated at step <b>170</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, the binding consists of:</p><p id="p-0107" num="0128">Registration of the public key of the device management owner, which key can be used to check a signature accompanying a bind or re-bind instruction, step <b>100</b>.

In one example, DKey is the public key of the device identity, i.e. the public key associated with the PDI. In other examples, DKey may also be a symmetric key in order to fit with existing network authentication protocols and parameter lengths. However, DKey should be strongly linked to the PDI and may, for example, be securely derived from a device secret associated with the PDI. The derived key should then be established by an interaction between the VS and the UE or (less secure) a device database such as DevDDB where the secrets are available, and which can deliver the DKey. An example derivation of a symmetric DKey is described in detail below.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0133">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, the rebinding is a consequence of registration during an attach procedure. A rebinding could also be realised as an operation that does not necessarily happen via a network attachment. There could for example be another connection, WiFi, Bluetooth, NFC, or cables, that allows IMEI and IMSI to be passed from the UE to DCS before step <b>210</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> (or alternatively passed directly from the UE to the DevMan, which may then provide this information to DCS and where step <b>210</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is skipped). In this case the access to the DCS (or DevMan) (API) should be authenticated to prevent misuse of access to DCS (or DevMan). Rebinding will also need a confirmation from the device manager (device owner) and the MNO. MNO control is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> via a policy in step <b>150</b>, however the MNO may wish such control to be exercised explicitly per device and per IMSI.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0134">Binding verification can be performed in different ways, for example by the HSS, by the VS at attachment or by the VS after attachment. Binding verification by the VS may be automatically triggered when the device requests network access (for example through a DCS) or the NAAF (for example in an MME) can request binding verification by the VS. Binding verification may comprise checking that the authentication challenge response is encrypted using the DKey at the UE. The NAAF may compare the encrypted authentication challenge response to the expected (encrypted) response. In order to be able to do this, the NAAF may obtain the encrypted expected response from the HSS authentication vector or may obtain DKey (from the HSS or the VS) and encrypt the expected response. In another alternative, the UE may decrypt an encrypted rand challenge RAND during or after authentication. In this case, response verification by the NAAF against the expected response as delivered by the HSS implies that the device, in case of asymmetric keys being used, must have the correct private key associated with PDI and, in case of symmetric keys being used, must have correct DKey associated with PDI, and that the device therefore holds the correct subscribed credentials.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0135">In some examples, the device and/or HSS may provide a MAC or digital signature to the NAAF, and hence to the visited network, as proof of the binding. If the NAAF is in a visited network, then only the home network knows that the subscription is associated with a device for which a VS service is available. In order to inform the NAAF of this fact, the home network (HSS) may push the URI of the VS to the NAAF together with the authentication information (AV) that the home network pushes to the visited network during an attach process. Alternatively, the home network may provide a public verification key that the visited network can use to verify the device signature. Further details of binding verification are provided below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Alternatives for IMSI and Device Identity Binding Verification</heading><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Co-Signing at UE</heading><p id="p-0115" num="0136">Here the NAAF in the (visited) network expects the UE to deliver an extra field in a response of the AKA procedure, where this extra field is a digital signature (in the case of an asymmetric key pair associated with PDI where the private key is used to sign) or MAC (in the case a symmetric key associated with PDI where the symmetric key (DKey) is used in calculation of the MAC). The digital signature or MAC is computed on the random RAND in the AKA or the ordinary response RES. The NAAF can check this additional response field using information, from the VS or the HSS, about the correct device public key (in case of a signature) or the expected extra response field value (in case of a MAC). This option would be appropriate for situations in which the subscription credentials are traditional AKA type including EAP-AKA variants. This option may also be used in situations where network authentication is based on EAP-TLS as recently standardized for use in 5G systems. The are many possibilities of EAP-TLS exchanged data from device to network on which the signature or MAC may be computed, e.g. the resulting EMSK.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Encryption of RAND in Authentication Vector (AV)</heading><p id="p-0116" num="0137">Another approach to verifying an explicit binding is to encrypt the random challenge value in the authentication procedure. The UE decrypts the encrypted random challenge and recovers the correct RAND to be used in the authentication procedure. The UE (or the SIM inside the UE) computes the authentication response which is sent to the NAAF.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0138">Variant 1: In this variant, which covers two alternatives, there is no change required to an existing NAAF. In a first alternative, the HSS fetches from the VS a derived key DKey and uses this key to encrypt the RAND. The HSS provides the encrypted RAND to the NAAF in the AV and the NAAF sends this to the UE. The UE decrypts the RAND to obtain RAND such that normal AKA authentication can be performed. The NAAF may be unaware of passing on an encrypted RAND and may thus perform as specified for existing 3G, 4G and 5G networks. In a second alternative, the VS may perform the encryption of the RAND using DKey, the RAND having been provided to the VS by the HSS with a request for the VS to perform the encryption. The encrypted RAND may then be passed via the NAAF to the UE as in the first alternative. In both the above discussed alternatives, a device that uses a cloned subscription credential will not be in possession of or able to generate the same DKey as is used to encrypt the RAND (as it will not have the correct permanent device identity) and so will be unable to decrypt the RAND properly before passing it to the authentication procedures.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0139">Variant 2: In this variant, which also covers two alternatives, changes to existing NAAFs are required. In a first alternative, RAND is encrypted using DKey by the NAAF, where DKey is obtained from VS. The UE decrypts the RAND to obtain RAND so that normal AKA authentication can be performed. In a second alternative, the VS performs encryption of RAND using DKey upon request from NAAF. This second alternative is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b><i>a </i></figref>&#x201c;Verification via VS&#x201d; where VS performs encryption of RAND. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b><i>a</i></figref>, the HSS, on receiving an authentication request from the NAAF in the visited network (step <b>550</b>), returns an Authentication Vector (AV) including RAND to the visited network and includes the URL of the appropriate VS (step <b>580</b>). The visited network sends a request to the VS to encrypt RAND, including the IMSI presented by the device (step <b>590</b>). The VS encrypts RAND using the DKey bound to the IMSI (step <b>600</b>) and returns the encrypted RAND to the visited network (step <b>610</b>). The visited network sends an authentication challenge to the UE including the encrypted RAND from the VS (step <b>620</b>). The UE derives DKey from a device secret associated with PDI (step <b>630</b>), decrypts the received encrypted RAND and computes RES (step <b>640</b>), and returns the RES to the visited network (step <b>650</b>). The visited network compares the RES received from the UE to an XRES from the AV (step <b>660</b>), and grants service (step <b>670</b>) if the check is successful. As for a RAND encrypted by the HSS, a device that uses a cloned subscription credential will not properly decrypt the RAND before passing it to the ordinary authentication procedures, and so will not generate the correct RES to be granted network access.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">Encryption of XRES in Authentication Vector (AV)</heading><p id="p-0119" num="0140">Instead of encrypting the random challenge value in the authentication procedure to verify an explicit binding, it is possible to encrypt the expected result XRES. After computing the ordinary authentication response RES in the AKA procedure, the UE encrypts RES with a derived symmetric key (DKey). The NAAF has received the encrypted response as the expected response XRES (encrypted), or may encrypt a received XRES using an appropriate key. At the UE side this derived key is derived from the private key or secret key associated with PDI. For example, this derivation may include parameters about the MME the NAAF is associated with (for example string &#x201c;MME-MNO-name&#x201d;) and the RAND in the authentication challenge the NAAF sends to the UE. The NAAF may obtain via the MME the derived key from either the VS or the HSS. The VS may also perform encryption of XRES using DKey upon request from the NAAF where the NAAF provides the XRES (that it obtained from HSS). It will be appreciated that the VS and HSS are supposed to have authenticated the MME and know the proper MME parameters in accordance with an agreement that allows the MME to access the VS or HSS services. If the NAAF is provided with an encrypted XRES, then the verification of the binding may be transparent to the NAAF, as the NAAF performs its usual comparison of RES and XRES values without knowledge that these values are encrypted. This variant is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b><i>b </i></figref>&#x201c;Verification via HSS&#x201d; where HSS performs encryption of XRES. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b><i>b</i></figref>, the HSS, on receiving an authentication request from the NAAF in the visited network (step <b>320</b>), obtains PDI and the device specific key DKey from the VS (steps <b>350</b>, <b>360</b>, <b>370</b>, <b>380</b>). The HSS then encrypts XRES using DKey (step <b>390</b>) and returns encrypted XRES to the visited network with the AV (step <b>400</b>). The visited network sends an authentication challenge to the UE including the RAND from the received AV (step <b>410</b>). The UE derives DKey from device secret associated with PDI (step <b>420</b>), computes and encrypts RES using DKey (step <b>430</b>), and returns the encrypted RES to the visited network (step <b>440</b>). The visited network compares the encrypted RES from the UE to the encrypted XRES from the AV (step <b>450</b>), and grants service (step <b>460</b>) if the check is successful.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Post-Verification Via VS</heading><p id="p-0120" num="0141">Another approach to verifying an explicit binding is to perform a post authentication challenge-response flow. According to this approach, the UE proves possession of PDI associated private/secret key upon request. This may typically involve the UE signing a parameter using the PDI associated key. The parameter may be a challenge (which may be the RAND used in latest authentication or a new random value sent to the UE) and may involve the IMSI value. This approach is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b><i>c </i></figref>&#x201c;Post verification via VS&#x201d;. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b><i>c</i></figref>, normal authentication is performed at steps <b>700</b> to <b>770</b>, following which, information about the connection to the device is monitored (step <b>780</b> and <b>790</b>). If a potential fraud is suspected on the basis of the monitored connection, the VS sends a message to the visited network (step <b>800</b>) to temporarily block access and force proof of possession of the correct identifier. The visited network sends an error message (step <b>820</b>) with an implicit request to sign a parameter. The UE signs the parameter, so providing proof of possession of PDI associated key and returns the signature to the visited network (step <b>830</b>). The visited network forwards the signature to the VS for checking (step <b>840</b>) and, in the event of misuse (the signature does not match that which should have been produced if the correct key had been used), the VS reports the misuse via the DCS (step <b>860</b>) to the HSS (step <b>870</b>) and the HSS instructs the visited network to terminate service (step <b>880</b> and <b>890</b>).</p><p id="p-0121" num="0142">In some of the examples above illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b> and <b>13</b></figref>, the DKey is a public key associated with PDI. For various reasons including performance and keeping the same lengths for the encrypted RAND and XRES, it may be preferable to have DKey as a symmetric key as illustrated above using other examples related to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b> and <b>13</b></figref>. However, DKey should be strongly linked to the PDI. For example, it may be securely derived from a device secret associated with PDI, and for example included in the permanent device identity, or the device may have an additional (master device) secret from which the DKey is derived. The derived key should be established by an interaction between the VS and the UE or (less secure) a device database such as DevDDB where the secrets are available, and which can deliver the DKey. In the cases in which the DKey is obtained from an interaction with the UE, this interaction may for example occur between steps <b>280</b> and <b>290</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>. The actual derivation may be performed as:</p><p id="p-0122" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>DKey=KDF(device secret, H=hash (&#x2018;UE RANDOM&#x2019; concatenated with &#x2018;VS parameters&#x2019;))<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0123" num="0143">Where KDF and hash are a key derivation functions such as HKDF, as specified by IETF in RFC 5869, and cryptographic hash function, respectively. Examples of suitable hash functions include SHA256 or SHA3. The random value UE RANDOM and VS parameters may be used to ensure that different VSs get different DKeys and that for a new registration a new DKey will be used. It may be assumed that the UE stores the hash result H so it later can re-derive DKey. The random value UE RANDOM is generated by the UE to ensure that a dishonest VS cannot obtain a derived key that another VS has legitimately obtained. VS parameters can be for example the name of the VS or its DNS address or a date, tax/vat number, etc.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0144">In some examples, if there are circumstances that mean using the device private key directly is less favourable, it is possible to generate a key automatically based on MNO characteristics.

This option may be advantageous if a device does not have a permanent device identity but only an assigned identifier such as an International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI), which can be changed or cloned and so is not a basis for a secure binding between device and subscription identity. A behavioural characteristic may be provided by a Device Connection Service (DCS) when the device is registered. The behavioural characteristic may for example include information, provided by the device owner, about how the device connects to the network. This behaviour may then be observed by the DCS when the device connects to the network and/or during registration, in order to enable a comparison with the behaviour characteristic bound to the subscriber identifier presented by the device. For example, a device owner can indicate that a device is a stationary device such as a temperature sensor or a pump valve controller, in which case the DCS can record the network cell number and other network characteristics for binding to the subscriber identifier assigned to the device. In some examples a non-permanent device identifier may also be included in the binding.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0146">Binding during device registration is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b><i>a</i></figref>. An IMEI, assigned IMSI and expected behavioural information for a device are provided to a device management system by a device owner (step <b>170</b>). This information is forwarded to the VS (step <b>210</b>) and the VS performs appropriate checks of accompanying signatures and approvals as discussed above before binding the behavioural characteristic, in the form of expected behavioural information, to the assigned IMSI (steps <b>220</b> to <b>260</b>). The DCS can observe the behaviour of the device when it seeks to connect (steps <b>310</b> and <b>510</b>), or the gathered DCS information of the device at the time of registration can be used, or both, for the purposes of assembling behavioural information. For example, the device owner can indicate that the device is a stationary device, for example a temperature sensor or a pump valve controller. The DCS may then record the network cell number and other network characteristics at step <b>190</b> and locks them against re-registration. The DCS and VS thus work together; the DCS provides behavioural information/status of the UE and the VS performs binding and verification of observed behaviour.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0147">As discussed above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, the binding illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b><i>a </i></figref>is triggered by an attach procedure, but explicit rebinding may also be envisaged.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0148">Binding verification in the case of a behavioural characteristic may also be achieved in arrange of different ways, and three alternatives are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b></figref> <i>b, </i><b>14</b><i>c </i>and <b>14</b><i>d</i>.

The observed behavioural characteristics are passed to the VS (step <b>320</b>), which compares the observations with the registered information (steps <b>330</b> and <b>340</b>). The VS performs an analysis based on the registered information and potentially logged information about the device network history and declares that connectivity is normal or is potentially fraudulent on request from the HSS (steps <b>380</b> and <b>390</b>). The HSS then either proceeds to generate and send an Authentication Vector or signal misuse accordingly.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0149">In another alternative, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b><i>c </i></figref>&#x201c;Verification via Visited Network&#x201d;, the NAAF requests a verification check from the VS (step <b>580</b>) after receiving the AV and a VS URI from the HSS (step <b>570</b>) but before sending the authentication challenge to the UE (step <b>620</b>). As in the illustrated example, the NAAF is in a visiting network (MME), only the HSS in the home network knows that a presented subscription identifier is associated with a device for which a VS service is available. To inform the NAAF, the home network therefore pushes the URI of the VS to the visited network together with the authentication information that the home network pushes to the visiting network under the authentication procedure when the device wants to attach. On receipt of the verification check request from the visited network, the VS again performs an analysis based on the registered information and potentially logged information about the device network history from the DCS (step <b>520</b>) and declares that connectivity is normal or is potentially fraudulent (step <b>610</b>). The visited network then either proceeds with authentication or denies network access.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0150">In another alternative, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b><i>d </i></figref>&#x201c;Post verification via DCS/VS&#x201d;, the DCS monitors network connection behaviour of an authenticated device (step <b>680</b>), and whenever a significant change occurs in the DCS observed network/device information, the DCS may request a verification check from the VS (step <b>690</b>). The VS performs a binding check (steps <b>700</b>, <b>710</b>) and reports the result to the DCS (step <b>720</b>). In the case of misuse, the DCS send a report to the HSS (step <b>730</b>), which then reports subscription misuse to the visited network (step <b>740</b>), allowing the visited network to terminate service to the device (step <b>750</b>). The visited network may be informed using standard network procedures that access should not be granted or should be terminated. If the change in network behaviour has a legitimate cause, then network access may be suspended until the new network behaviour characteristic is bound to the subscription identifier used by the device in a rebinding procedure approved by the device management system (representing the owner or user of the device).</p><p id="p-0131" num="0151"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b> to <b>14</b></figref> thus illustrate different ways in which the methods <b>300</b> to <b>1100</b> may be implemented.
