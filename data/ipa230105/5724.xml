num="0001">The present invention is directed to a method of sputter-coating substrates with two opposed, two-dimensionally extended surfaces or of manufacturing sputter coated substrates with two opposed, two-dimensionally extended surfaces, also called &#x201c;plate shaped&#x201d; substrates. Thereby more than one plate-shaped substrates are continuously rotated around a common axis and, considered in radial direction with respect to the common axis, equally distant from the substrates. The substrates are thus continuously rotated along a common ring-locus around the common axis. The ring-locus has an inner and an outer periphery as well as a center line i.e. a circular locus line centered between the outer and the inner peripheries of the ring-locus.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">During their rotational movement around the common axis, the substrates are passed over at least one magnetron sputter source. The magnetron sputter source comprises a stationary magnetron-magnet arrangement and a circular target with a target center and a target center axis and a sputter surface which faces towards the ring-locus. The stationary magnetron magnet-arrangement generates an area of magnetron plasma along the sputter surface of the target.</p><heading id="h-0001" level="1">Definition</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0003">We understand under a &#x201c;magnetron magnet-arrangement&#x201d; an arrangement of magnets&#x2014;at least predominantly of permanent magnets&#x2014;adjacent to the backside of the target, i.e. adjacent to that side of the target which is opposite to the sputter surface. The magnetron magnet-arrangement generates a magnetic field with magnetic field lines arcing over the sputter surface in at least one tunnel like pattern which, seen towards the sputter surface, is close looped. We call this magnetic field &#x201c;magnetron magnetic field&#x201d;. The magnetron magnet-arrangement comprises at least one loop of magnetic pole surfaces of one magnetic polarity facing the target backside and, nested within that loop, an arrangement of magnetic pole surfaces of the other magnetic polarity facing the target backside. The arrangement of magnetic pole surfaces nested within the addressed loop of magnetic pole surfaces may be a loop of magnetic poles surfaces as well. The magnetron magnet arrangement may comprise more than one of the addressed loops of magnetic pole surfaces and of the respectively nested arrangements of magnetic pole surfaces. The magnetic pole surfaces may be surfaces of magnets, of magnets linked by a magnetic yoke arrangement, of pole shoes from magnets etc.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0004">We understand under the term &#x201c;area of magnetron plasma&#x201d; the close-looping area along the sputter surface of the target, along which a plasma burns with increased intensity compared to plasma burning aside that area. The area of magnetron plasma follows the magnetron magnetic field generated by the magnetron magnet-arrangement and has a plasma-intensity distribution substantially proportional to the directional magnetron magnetic field components parallel to the sputter surface, i.e. perpendicular to the electric field impinging on the target-cathode. It is along the area of magnetron plasma that the sputter surface is most eroded or sputtered off, leading to the so called &#x201c;racetracks&#x201d; in the sputter surface. Accordingly, it is along the area of magnetron plasma, defined by the magnetron magnet-arrangement, that the substrate is most sputter coated. Due to the interaction of the angled electric field and magnetron magnetic field, electrons are trapped in and along the magnetron magnetic field so that the area of magnetron plasma is often also called &#x201c;electron trap&#x201d;.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0005">From the U.S. Pat.
