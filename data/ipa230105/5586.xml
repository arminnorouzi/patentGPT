This failure leads to hyperglycemia, i.e., the presence of an excessive amount of glucose within the blood plasma. Persistent hyperglycemia has been associated with a variety of serious symptoms and life threatening long-term complications such as dehydration, ketoacidosis, diabetic coma, cardiovascular diseases, chronic renal failure, retinal damage and nerve damages with the risk of amputation of extremities. Because healing is not yet possible, a permanent therapy is necessary which provides constant glycemic control in order to constantly maintain the level of blood analyte within normal limits. Such glycemic control is achieved by regularly supplying external drugs to the body of the patient to thereby reduce the elevated levels of blood analyte. An external biologically effective drug (e.g., insulin or its analog) is commonly administered by means of daily injections. In some cases, multiple, daily injections of a mixture of rapid- and long-acting insulin are administered via a reusable transdermal liquid dosing device.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a first aspect, a method comprises: receiving, using a computer system and for a person with diabetes for whom amounts of insulin ingestion is not detected, blood glucose values for a time period, wherein a first changed insulin dosage recommendation was issued to the person with diabetes during the time period; determining, using the computer system and based on the blood glucose values, whether the person with diabetes has taken into account the first changed insulin dosage recommendation in administering insulin; and taking an action based on the determination.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Implementations can include any or all of the following features. The determination indicates that the person with diabetes has taken into account the first changed insulin dosage recommendation, and wherein the action comprises generating a second changed insulin dosage recommendation to the person with diabetes. The determination indicates that the person with diabetes has not taken into account the first changed insulin dosage recommendation, and wherein the action comprises preventing a second changed insulin dosage recommendation from being generated to the person with diabetes. The determination indicates that the person with diabetes has not taken into account the first changed insulin dosage recommendation, and wherein the action comprises generating a communication without a second changed insulin dosage recommendation. The communication is generated to the person with diabetes or to a physician. The blood glucose values include a first blood glucose profile from before the first changed insulin dosage recommendation was generated, and a second blood glucose profile from after the first changed insulin dosage recommendation was generated. The method further comprises determining, based on the first blood glucose profile and the second blood glucose profile, percentiles of the blood glucose values for the time period. Determining whether the person with diabetes has taken into account the first changed insulin dosage recommendation in administering insulin comprises applying an equality test to the first blood glucose profile and the second blood glucose profile. Determining whether the person with diabetes has taken into account the first changed insulin dosage recommendation in administering insulin comprises using a trained classifier.

In some implementations, a computer-based approach can be applied for determining whether a person with diabetes is at least considering a received communication regarding a change in an insulin therapy setting. For example, a trained classifier, equality testing, and/or hypothesis testing can be applied to determine whether the adjustment recommendations are being taken into account. In some implementations, determining whether the person with diabetes has taken into account a changed insulin dosage recommendation in administering insulin can include looking for a change in blood glucose values that is opposite to a direction of the first changed insulin dosage recommendation. For example, if the changed insulin dosage recommendation includes an increase of insulin, the determination can evaluate whether the blood sugar levels have decreased. As another example, if the changed insulin dosage recommendation includes a decrease of insulin, the determination can evaluate whether the blood sugar levels have increased.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Insulin delivery devices include, but are not limited to, insulin injection pens, insulin inhalers, insulin pumps, and insulin syringes. The improper dosing of insulin, whether due to human error, malfunction of an insulin pen, skipping doses, double dosing, or incorrect dosing, is always a concern. Methods, devices, and systems provided herein are described for the delivery of insulin, collection of blood glucose data, and/or the treatment of diabetes. Moreover, methods, devices, and systems provided herein may be adapted for the delivery of other medications, the collection of other analyte data, and/or the treatment of other diseases. Methods, devices, and systems provided herein are described by exemplifying features and functionalities of a number of illustrative embodiments. Other implementations are also possible.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Some examples herein refer to an insulin injection pen. An insulin injection pen includes at least one container holding insulin (e.g., an insulin cartridge), a dial or other mechanism to specify a dose, and a pen needle for transcutaneous delivery of the insulin into the tissue or vasculature of the person with diabetes. In a reusable insulin injection pen, the insulin container (e.g., the cartridge) is replaceable or refillable. A prefilled insulin injection pen is intended for use during a limited time. The dose-specifying mechanism can include a rotatable wheel coupled to mechanics and/or electronics for capping the administered amount of insulin at the volume of the specified dose (e.g., in terms of a number of units of insulin). The dose-specifying mechanism can have a mechanical and/or electronic display that reflects the current setting of the mechanism. The pen needle can be permanently attached to the housing of the insulin injection pen (e.g., as in the case with a disposable pen), or it can be removable (e.g., so that a new needle can be applied when needed). For example, a replaceable pen needle can include a hollow needle affixed to a fitting configured for removeable attachment to an end of the insulin injection pen.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Some examples herein refer to a mobile communication device. As used herein a mobile communication device includes, but is not limited to, a mobile phone, a smartphone, a wearable electronic device (e.g., a smart watch), a tablet, a laptop computer, a portable computer, and similar devices. A mobile communication device includes one or more processors, a non-transitory storage device (e.g., a memory and/or a hard drive) holding executable instructions for operating the mobile communication device, wireless communication components, and one or more input and/or output devices (e.g., a touchscreen, display, or keyboard). The mobile communication device can operate according to one or more application programs stored locally on the mobile communication device, or remotely (e.g., when using cloud computing), or combinations thereof. The mobile communication device can execute at least one operating system in order to perform functions and services.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Some examples herein refer to a continuous glucose monitor (CGM). A CGM is an electronic device configured to take readings of glucose values on an ongoing basis or at regular intervals in order to estimate the blood glucose level of the person with diabetes. Some CGMs determine blood glucose values periodically (e.g., after a certain number of seconds or minutes) and output the information automatically or upon being prompted. The CGM may include wireless communication components for one or more types of signaling, including, but not limited to, Near-Field Communication (NFC) and/or Bluetooth communication.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some embodiments, systems, devices, and methods provided herein can recommend insulin doses (e.g., dosages of long-acting and/or rapid-acting insulin) using any suitable technique. In some embodiments, recommended insulin dosages may be based upon blood glucose data (e.g., current estimated glucose value (EGV) from a CGM, flash glucose monitor, blood glucose meter, or any other sensor, blood glucose trend data, etc.), insulin administration data (bolus dosage amounts of rapid-acting insulin, dosages of long-acting insulin, dosage times, calculation of Insulin-on-Board (&#x201c;IOB&#x201d;) and/or active insulin, etc.), meal data (mealtimes, user estimated carbohydrates, user estimated meal categorizations, user estimated glycemic impact of meal user meal history, user meal trends, etc.), and/or one or more insulin delivery parameters (e.g., total daily dose of basal insulin or long-acting insulin, carbohydrate-to-insulin ratio (CR), insulin sensitivity factor (ISF), etc.). Methods, devices and systems provided herein can, in some embodiments, adjust insulin delivery parameters over time based on glucose data and/or insulin administration data.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Some examples herein refer to long-acting insulin and rapid-acting insulin, or in some cases more generally to first and second types of insulin. Insulin used for therapeutic treatment is often synthesized human insulin. Moreover, different insulins can be characterized in how quickly they typically begin to work in the body of the person with diabetes after administration, and/or how long they typically remain active in the body of the person with diabetes. Rapid-acting insulin can be used to dose for meals or to correct high blood sugar. There is more than one type of insulin that can be considered a rapid-acting insulin. Many, but not necessary all, rapid-acting insulins begin working within about one hour after administration. Similarly, there is more than one type of insulin that can be considered a long-acting insulin, and many, but not necessarily all, long-acting insulins begin working about one hour or longer after administration. Long-acting insulin is often referred to as basal insulin (e.g., insulin used to support basic metabolic needs). Generally, a long-acting insulin has a greater active time (i.e., the length of time that the insulin continues to be active in the body of the person with diabetes after administration) than a rapid-acting insulin. As such, a long-acting insulin is an example of a type of insulin having an active time that is longer than an active time for a type of insulin such as a rapid-acting insulin.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Examples herein refer to TDBD. The TDBD can reflect a setting of an insulin therapy corresponding to the amount of long-acting insulin to be administered. The actual TDBD of a person with diabetes may not be known. Rather, a programmed TDBD value can be entered into a diabetes therapy management system for the person and can be adjusted as needed. A TDBD mismatch value, moreover, can represent a determination of a relationship between the programmed TDBD value and the unknown actual TDBD value. In some implementations, the determined TDBD mismatch value represents a division of the programmed TDBD value with the unknown actual TDBD value. For example, a new (i.e., adjusted) TDBD value can be calculated by dividing the programmed TDBD value by the determined TDBD mismatch value.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an example of a system <b>100</b> where compliance with insulin therapy recommendations can be evaluated. The system <b>100</b> can be used with one or more other examples described elsewhere herein. The system <b>100</b> includes a diabetes therapy management system <b>102</b>. In some implementations, the diabetes therapy management system <b>102</b> is configured for use by a person with diabetes for monitoring, controlling, and/or documenting the treatment of diabetes. The diabetes therapy management system <b>102</b> can include one or more components. For example, the diabetes therapy management system <b>102</b> can be or include an insulin injection pen, a pen cap for an insulin injection pen, a CGM, and/or a smartphone having software installed. That is, the diabetes therapy management system <b>102</b> may not automatically administer doses of insulin to the person; rather, the diabetes therapy management system <b>102</b> may inform the person about available data and/or recommendation to aid the person in deciding whether to ingest insulin and in what amount. Moreover, the diabetes therapy management system <b>102</b> may not directly measure the amount of insulin ingested by the person.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The system <b>100</b> includes a diabetes therapy recommendation system <b>104</b>. In some implementations, the diabetes therapy recommendation system <b>104</b> is configured to exchange information with the diabetes therapy management system <b>102</b>, such as by wired and/or wireless communication. For example, the diabetes therapy recommendation system <b>104</b> can receive blood glucose values regarding the person with diabetes from the diabetes therapy management system <b>102</b> at periodic intervals or at random times, and can generate one or more diabetes-related recommendations based on the blood glucose values to the diabetes therapy management system <b>102</b>. If the diabetes therapy management system <b>102</b> does not directly measure the amount of insulin ingested by the person, the diabetes therapy recommendation system <b>104</b> does not have direct information about what dosage the person is actually ingesting.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The system <b>100</b> includes a compliance evaluation system <b>106</b>. In some implementations, the compliance evaluation system <b>106</b> is configured to exchange information with the diabetes therapy recommendation system <b>104</b>, such as by wired and/or wireless communication. For example, compliance evaluation system <b>106</b> can receive processable data regarding the person with diabetes (e.g., blood glucose values) from the diabetes therapy recommendation system <b>104</b>, and can provide one or more determinations of recommendation compliance based on the processable data.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">One or more user interfaces can be presented to a person with diabetes. In some implementations, the diabetes therapy management system <b>102</b> can provide a user interface for presenting one or more recommendations. For example, the recommendation can be presented on a display or screen, automatically or upon request.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">A user interface can depict insulin data. In some cases, the user interface can indicate an amount insulin on board (JOB) in an insulin ingestion device (e.g., an insulin injection pen or a pump), which may be only for a particular type of insulin (including, but not limited to, rapid-acting insulin). In some implementations, IOB (sometimes referred to as active insulin) can be defined as the amount of insulin that has been delivered and is still active in the person's body based on estimated duration of insulin action. In some cases, an IOB calculation may be for both rapid-acting and long-acting insulin. In some cases, the user interface can display information, including, but not limited to, the time and/or amounts of the most recent doses of quick-acting and/or long-acting insulins. In some cases, the user interface can permit the user to click on the insulin data or otherwise navigate in the mobile app to more detailed and/or more complete insulin delivery data. In some cases, a user interface can overlay blood glucose data and insulin delivery data in any suitable format, such as a graphical display of the timing of blood glucose data vs. the timing of insulin delivery data.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In use, a user (e.g., the person with diabetes and/or a caregiver) can use the diabetes therapy management system <b>102</b> to get recommendations regarding an appropriate insulin dosage. In the case of an upcoming need to deliver long-acting insulin, a text can be presented that provides a recommended long-acting insulin dosage. In some cases, a recommended dosage may appear on a pen cap of an insulin injection device. In the case of the user wanting to deliver a bolus of rapid-acting insulin, the user may press a bolus calculator button on the diabetes therapy management system <b>102</b> to enter into a bolus calculator. Any suitable bolus calculator could be used in systems, methods, and devices provided herein. For example, the bolus calculator can provide a user interface for a user to enter a meal announcement as either a correction only, a small meal, a normal sized meal, or a large meal. Upon selecting the meal size, the user interface can provide a recommended bolus dosage based on a number of carbohydrates associated with the corresponding button and optionally based upon blood glucose data. Additionally, or alternatively, dose capture pen caps for the insulin injection pen can include a user interface that permits the user to announce a meal size, including, but not limited to, a small meal, medium meal, or large meal.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-B</figref> show examples of graphical user interfaces <b>200</b> and <b>250</b>, respectively. The graphical user interfaces <b>200</b> and/or <b>250</b> can be used in combination with one or more other examples described elsewhere herein. Each of the graphical user interfaces <b>200</b> and <b>250</b> can be presented on a suitable display, including, but not limited to, a display of the diabetes therapy management system <b>102</b>. In some implementations, the graphical user interface <b>200</b> relates to an insulin injection pen for a certain type of insulin, such as a long-acting insulin pen. For example, the graphical user interface <b>200</b> can be presented on a display of a pen cap for the certain type of insulin. In some implementations, the graphical user interface <b>250</b> relates to an insulin injection pen for a certain other type of insulin, such as a rapid-acting insulin pen. For example, the graphical user interface <b>250</b> can be presented on a display of a pen cap for the certain other type of insulin.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">One or more of the graphical user interfaces <b>200</b> and <b>250</b> can support one or more types of processes relating to insulin therapy management. In some implementations, a pairing process can be supported that seeks to establish a connection between the pen cap and one or more other devices. For example, connection between the pen cap and a smartphone can be established. In some implementations, a daily use process can be supported that corresponds to the person's with diabetes ordinary use of the pen cap, after one or more successful pairings with the other device(s), to manage diabetes therapy.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some implementations, a daily use workflow for the graphical user interface <b>200</b> can include a default screen (e.g., presenting a name of the insulin currently contained in the insulin injection pen), a timer screen <b>202</b>, and/or a dose suggestion screen <b>204</b>. For example, the person with diabetes can cycle through two or more screens using an input control (e.g., of the diabetes therapy management system <b>102</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). For example, the graphical user interface <b>200</b> can automatically return to presenting the default screen if no action is undertaken using the pen cap (e.g., by way of a button other otherwise) within a predefined time period.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some implementations, the timer screen <b>202</b> presents a time that has elapsed since the last dose (e.g., since a most recent capping/uncapping event that qualifies as an indicator of insulin dosage). For example, the timer screen currently states that it has been 3 hours and 10 minutes since the last dose. In some implementations, the elapsed time can be based on actual dosage timing (e.g., as reported by an injection device), or on a proxy for insulin injection timing other than capping/uncapping.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some implementations, the dose suggestion screen <b>204</b> presents an insulin dosage suggestion <b>206</b>. The insulin dosage suggestion <b>206</b> can contain one or more recommendations to the person with diabetes. For example, the insulin dosage suggestion <b>206</b> currently suggests that the person with diabetes should ingest a daily dose of insulin (e.g., long-acting insulin) corresponding to an amount of 23 u (units).</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some implementations, a daily use workflow for the graphical user interface <b>250</b> can include a default screen (e.g., presenting a name of the insulin currently contained in the insulin injection pen), a timer screen <b>252</b>, a blood glucose value screen <b>254</b>, a blood glucose value screen <b>256</b>, a dose suggestion screen <b>258</b>, and/or a dose suggestion screen <b>260</b>.

In some implementations, the elapsed time can be based on actual dosage timing (e.g., as reported by an injection device), or on a proxy for insulin injection timing other than capping/uncapping.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some implementations, the blood glucose value screens <b>254</b> and/or <b>256</b> presents data obtained by way of a glucose monitor or another glucose sensor (e.g., a CGM). For example, the blood glucose value screen <b>254</b> can present a value of a blood glucose estimate (e.g., 320 mg/dL), present a trend indication (e.g., an arrow pointing up, or towards the right and up, or to the right, or towards the right and down, or down), and/or a suggestion that the person with diabetes should check his or her blood glucose (BG). For example, the blood glucose value screen <b>256</b> can present a value of a blood glucose estimate (e.g., 320 mg/dL), present a trend indication (e.g., an arrow pointing up, or towards the right and up, or to the right, or towards the right and down, or down), and an insulin dosage suggestion as to whether the person with diabetes should ingest a correction dose (e.g., here zero units is recommended).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some implementations, the dose suggestion screen <b>258</b> presents an insulin dosage suggestion <b>262</b> relating to a meal. The insulin dosage suggestion <b>262</b> can contain one or more recommendations to the person with diabetes based on information about the meal. For example, the insulin dosage suggestion <b>262</b> currently suggests that the person with diabetes should ingest 4 units of insulin if the meal is a small meal, 7 units if the meal is a medium meal, and 10 units if the meal is a large meal. In some implementations, the pen cap for which the graphical user interface <b>250</b> is implemented may work in combination with one or more glucose monitors or another glucose sensor. For example, the graphical user interface <b>250</b> can work with a CGM. As another example, the graphical user interface <b>250</b> can work with a blood glucose meter.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The graphical user interface <b>200</b> and/or <b>250</b> can present one or more other types of information not illustrated in the present examples.

In some implementations, based on blood glucose data collected from the person with diabetes, the diabetes therapy recommendation system <b>104</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) can change at least one insulin dosage recommendation and provide the changed insulin dosage recommendation to the diabetes therapy management system <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Persons with diabetes can choose to take any of multiple approaches toward the changed insulin dosage recommendation (as well as toward the original insulin dosage recommendation.) A first category of persons may always or often follow the insulin dosage recommendation that is presented by the diabetes therapy management system <b>102</b>. Such a person is likely to take the changed insulin dosage recommendation presented by the diabetes therapy management system <b>102</b> into account, and to comply with the changed insulin dosage recommendation. A second category of persons may always or often view the insulin dosage recommendation that is presented by the diabetes therapy management system <b>102</b> and use the insulin dosage recommendation in performing their own calculation of the dosage of insulin to ingest. For example, the person may usually apply a dose that is a predefined amount (e.g., in terms of unit or percentage) above or below the insulin dosage recommendation. That is, while such a person does not, or does not always, ingest exactly the recommended amount, he or she does take the changed insulin dosage recommendation presented by the diabetes therapy management system <b>102</b> into account in managing their insulin intake. A third category of persons may seldom or never follow the insulin dosage recommendation that is presented by the diabetes therapy management system <b>102</b>. While such a person does ingest insulin, they are determining the dosage without the benefit of the insulin dosage recommendation available by the diabetes therapy management system <b>102</b>. That is, such a person does not take the changed insulin dosage recommendation presented by the diabetes therapy management system <b>102</b> into account.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The third category of person exemplified above can merit special arrangements from the perspective of the diabetes therapy recommendation system <b>104</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). In some implementations, changes in insulin dosage recommendations may not be implemented all at once; rather, a gradual increase or decrease in the insulin dosage recommendation can occur over a period of time, such as multiple weeks or months. Moreover, the insulin dosage recommendation for the next iteration (e.g., a two-week period) is generated based on the assumption that the person has taken the amount of insulin that was recommended in the previous iteration (i.e., in the previous insulin dosage recommendation). Since the third category of person does not take the changed insulin dosage recommendation into account, their dosage of insulin may not increase/decrease according to the insulin dosage recommendation over that period of time. As a result, a discrepancy between the insulin dosage recommendations and the person's actual insulin dosage can develop over time. This may be undesirable, as a newly generated insulin dosage recommendation does not take into account the actual dosage ingested by the person with diabetes. To address this and/or other situations, one or more approaches for evaluating compliance with insulin dosage recommendations can be followed.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a computing platform <b>300</b> for evaluating compliance with insulin dosage recommendations.

In disclosed embodiments, any suitable glucose sensor may provide blood glucose data <b>318</b>, for example, a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), a flash glucose monitor, a blood glucose meter (BGM). In the case of CGMs and flash glucose monitors, they may be configured to provide blood glucose data <b>318</b> based on interstitial fluid glucose levels of a person, which may be correlated to blood glucose levels. A BGM may be configured to provide blood glucose data based on a blood sample.

Dosing event data may include data about insulin dosing actions at one or more times and may include, for example, a dosing time or time range, type of insulin (e.g., LA insulin and rapid acting (RA) insulin) dosed, brand of insulin, and/or amount of dosed insulin. In some embodiments, dosing event data may include an indication of a dosing mechanism, for example, injection pen, inhaler, or infusion pump. In some embodiments, dosing event data may include an indication of whether dosing event data, in part or in whole, is based on an actual dosing action (e.g., detecting insulin delivery, for example, based on a manual action of a pump or a control signal configured to cause insulin delivery), user tracking of dosing actions (e.g., a PWD or caregiver enters a dose using a therapy application executing on a mobile device), or inferred dosing actions (e.g., from capping/uncapping of an injection pen).</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Processor(s) <b>302</b> may be configured to execute a number of engines for performing disclosed embodiments.

The actual TDBD of a person with diabetes may not be known. Rather, a programmed TDBD value can be entered into a diabetes therapy management system for the person and can be adjusted as needed. A TDBD mismatch value, moreover, can represent a determination of a relationship between the programmed TDBD value and the unknown actual TDBD value. In some implementations, the determined TDBD mismatch value represents a division of the programmed TDBD value with the unknown actual TDBD value. For example, a new (i.e., adjusted) TDBD value can be calculated by dividing the programmed TDBD value by the determined TDBD mismatch value. The term TDBD is sometimes often applied in the context of insulin therapy administration by way of a pump device. Other terms can be used to refer to the dosage of long-acting insulin over a 24-hour period, including, but not limited to, daily long-acting insulin. As used herein, the term TDBD also includes the concept of daily long-acting insulin.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In a contemplated operation, a learning engine can train TDBD regressor <b>305</b> using training data and sets of engineered features (i.e., the feature sets in Table I) selected for model training purposes.

The compliance evaluation system <b>106</b> can collect one or more types of pre-change data <b>400</b> and one or more types of post-change data <b>402</b>. The term &#x201c;pre-&#x201d; here refers to periods of time before a particular changed insulin dosage recommendation is generated. For example, when recommendations are updated at the beginning of a new iteration (e.g., every two weeks), the pre-change data <b>400</b> can include data from more than two weeks ago (e.g., data from 2-4 weeks back in time). The term &#x201c;post-&#x201d; here refers to periods of time after a particular changed insulin dosage recommendation is generated. Similarly, the post-change data <b>402</b> can include data from the most recent two weeks since the current recommendation was generated (e.g., data from 0-2 weeks back in time). Each of the pre-change data <b>400</b> and the post-change data <b>402</b> can include one or more types of information.

The graph <b>404</b> can show a blood glucose level over a period of time associated with the pre-change data <b>400</b>. The percentiles <b>406</b> can show the percentage of time that the person with diabetes spent, during the relevant time period, in various ranges of blood sugar levels. For example, the percentiles <b>406</b> can reflect what percent of time was spent below a lower blood sugar threshold (e.g., 70 mg/dl), what percent of time was spent within an intermediate range of blood sugar threshold (e.g., 70-180 mg/dl), and what percent of time was spent above an upper blood sugar threshold (e.g., 180 mg/dl). Here, the post-change data <b>402</b> includes a graph <b>408</b> and percentiles <b>410</b>. The graph <b>408</b> can show a blood glucose level over a period of time associated with the post-change data <b>402</b>.

For example, the compliance classifier <b>412</b> evaluates the pre-change data <b>400</b> and the post-change data <b>402</b> to determine if the post-change data <b>402</b> reflects that the person with diabetes has taken into account the changed insulin dosage recommendation that was generated. The determination can involve classifying the post-change data <b>402</b> as either being compliant with the changed insulin dosage recommendation (e.g., reflecting that the person at least took the changed insulin dosage recommendation into account in administering insulin), or as not being compliant with the changed insulin dosage recommendation (e.g., reflecting that the person did not take the changed insulin dosage recommendation into account in administering insulin). The compliance classifier <b>412</b> can be trained on one or more kinds of data, including simulated data or actual patient data.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Training the compliance classifier <b>412</b> can include at least the following operations. A first set of blood glucose profiles can be generated, the first set of blood glucose profiles corresponding to first persons with diabetes who do not take into account a changed insulin dosage recommendation in administering insulin.

Simulation engine <b>624</b> may be configured to simulate insulin therapy scenarios for a variety of PWDs. PWD profiles are created that represent a cross-section of PWDs in terms of characteristics such as physiology (e.g., age, weight, height, complicating health conditions, diurnal profile variation, etc.), lifestyle (e.g., eating behaviors, exercise behaviors, diurnal variations, sleeping behaviors, meal sizes, meal times, etc.), socio-economic factors (e.g., income, race, geographic location, marriage status, child status, etc.), differences in how PWDs measure and track meal intake, differences in the operation and quality of insulin delivery systems and components the PWDs use, physiology parameters (e.g., TDBD, CR, correction factor), mismatches in physiology parameters used for dosing compared to the true underlying parameters, carbohydrate counting errors, blousing behavior (e.g., missed meals or missed boluses), CGM errors, insulin delivery pathway faults, and/or unmeasured physiological factors affecting blood glucose (as a lump model) (e.g., illness, other medications, etc.).

When the determination indicates that the person with diabetes has taken into account the first changed insulin dosage recommendation, the action can include generating another changed insulin dosage recommendation to the person with diabetes. For example, the diabetes therapy recommendation system <b>104</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) can continue to generate insulin dosage recommendations to the person, including, if applicable, a changed insulin dosage recommendation. When the determination indicates that the person with diabetes has not taken into account the first changed insulin dosage recommendation, the action can include preventing another changed insulin dosage recommendation from being generated to the person with diabetes. For example, the diabetes therapy recommendation system <b>104</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) can cease to generate insulin dosage recommendations to the person, including, any changed insulin dosage recommendations. When the determination indicates that the person with diabetes has not taken into account the first changed insulin dosage recommendation, the action can include generating a communication without another changed insulin dosage recommendation. For example, the diabetes therapy recommendation system <b>104</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) can generate a so-called insight that addresses the current situation (e.g., by stating that it appears the person with diabetes needs to ingest higher or lower doses of insulin), but without generating a numerical insulin dosage recommendation. Such an insight can, appropriately worded, be generated to the person with diabetes or to the person's physician.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows an example of a method <b>700</b>. The method <b>700</b> can be used with one or more other examples described elsewhere herein. The method <b>700</b> can include more or fewer operations than shown. Two or more operations can be performed in a different order unless otherwise indicated.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0080">At <b>702</b>, blood glucose values for a person with diabetes can be received. In some implementations, no detection is made of the amounts of insulin ingestion by the person with diabetes. The blood glucose values can be detected using a CGM or a BGM, to name just two examples. The blood glucose values relate to a time period. Particularly, during the time period a changed insulin dosage recommendation was made to the person with diabetes. As such, some of the blood glucose values can relate to times before the changed insulin dosage recommendation, and others of the blood glucose values can relate to times after the changed insulin dosage recommendation.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0081">At <b>704</b>, it can be determined whether the person with diabetes has taken into account the changed insulin dosage recommendation in administering insulin. In some implementations, the notion of taking the changed insulin dosage recommendation into account includes, but is not limited to, whether the person with diabetes is following the changed insulin dosage recommendation. For example, the person with diabetes may take the changed insulin dosage recommendation into account in making a change in insulin dosage without necessarily following the changed insulin dosage recommendation. A trained classifier can evaluate the blood glucose data to make such a determination. For example, one or more of the features listed in Table I above can be taken into account.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0082">At <b>706</b>, an action can be taken based on the determination. In some implementations, the action can include changing an insulin dosage recommendation. In some implementations, the action can include preventing another changed insulin dosage recommendation from being generated to the person with diabetes. In some implementations, the action can include generating a communication without another insulin dosage recommendation.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0083">A trained regressor can be used in the performance of the method <b>700</b>. In some implementations, the trained TDBD regressor <b>305</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) can be used in determining whether a person with diabetes has taken into account a changed insulin dosage recommendation in administering insulin. The trained TDBD regressor <b>305</b> can predict, using the blood glucose values, at least a first TDBD mismatch value corresponding to time before the change and at least a second TDBD mismatch value corresponding to time after the change. In some implementations, if the first and second TDBD mismatch values are sufficiently different from each other, then the determination is made that the person with diabetes has taken into account a changed insulin dosage recommendation in administering insulin. For example, a hypothesis test can be performed to determine if the first and second TDBD mismatch values are sufficiently different from each other.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates an example architecture of a computing device <b>800</b> that can be used to implement aspects of the present disclosure, including any of the systems, apparatuses, and/or techniques described herein, or any other systems, apparatuses, and/or techniques that may be utilized in the various possible embodiments.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0085">The computing device illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> can be used to execute the operating system, application programs, and/or software modules (including the software engines) described herein.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0086">The computing device <b>800</b> includes, in some embodiments, at least one processing device <b>802</b> (e.g., a processor), such as a central processing unit (CPU).
