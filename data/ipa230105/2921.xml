water decomposition including the transition metal-doped nickel phosphide nanostructure. More specifically, a transition metal-doped nickel phosphide nanostructure can be prepared by converting a zinc oxide nanostructure grown on a substrate vertically by hydrothermal synthesis to a transition metal-doped nickel oxide nanostructure by cation exchange and then phosphorizing the nickel oxide. The transition metal-doped nickel phosphide nanostructure of the present disclosure is advantageous in that it has superior catalytic activity and conductivity due to large surface area. In addition, when used as a catalyst for water decomposition under an alkaline condition, it has a low overvoltage and can have excellent catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction or oxygen evolution reaction.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="81.70mm" wi="158.75mm" file="US20230002922A1-20230105-D00000.TIF"

Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">With ongoing industrial development, fossil fuels such as coal, petroleum, natural gas, etc. are being depleted. In addition, due to the problems of environmental pollution, global warming, etc. by the fossil fuels, development of energy sources capable of replacing the fossil fuel is being demanded. As alternative energy technologies, conversion of natural energy such as solar power, wind power, tidal power, etc. to electrical energy, production of hydrogen energy using natural resources such as water, etc. are being researched and developed globally.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Among them, renewable hydrogen fuel is drawing a lot of attentions in order to cope with the global CO<sub>2 </sub>regulation issue. Although reforming is a general method of producing hydrogen, it has the problems that the process is performed at high temperature and high pressure and it is not environmentally friendly because carbon dioxide is generated during the production of hydrogen. Therefore, many researchers are paying attention to a more effective water decomposition method.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For effective water decomposition, both a hydrogen evolution catalyst and an oxygen evolution catalyst should have high performance in the same electrolyte. In addition, since the process of intermediates formed from water decomposition are attached to and then detached from the surface of the catalyst is repeated and, therefore, catalyst activation energy is necessary, provision of many active sites and fast charge transport on the catalyst surface are important for effective production of hydrogen.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, the existing water decomposition catalysts are expensive because precious metal catalysts such as platinum (Pt), ruthenium (Ru), iridium (Ir) are used. Although several researches are being conducted on transition metal oxides as non-precious metal catalyst for replacing the precious metal catalysts recently, low hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity and low conductivity are big obstacles to the production of hydrogen.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, research and development are necessary for a new non-precious metal catalyst based on a transition metal, instead of a precious metal catalyst, which resolves the disadvantage of the non-precious metal catalysts and has improved catalytic activity and conductivity.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">REFERENCES OF THE RELATED ART</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Patent Documents</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">(Patent document 1) Korean Patent Registration No. 10-1670860.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present disclosure is directed to providing a transition metal-doped nickel phosphide nanostructure which exhibits superior electrochemical stability and durability and, at the same time, improved catalytic activity and conductivity due to large surface area.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present disclosure is also directed to providing a catalyst for electrochemical water decomposition, which has superior catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction or oxygen evolution reaction by including the transition metal-doped nickel phosphide nanostructure.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present disclosure is also directed to providing an electrode including the catalyst for electrochemical water decomposition.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present disclosure is also directed to providing an electrochemical water decomposition device including the electrode, a counter electrode and an electrolyte or an ionic liquid.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present disclosure is also directed to providing a method for preparing a transition metal-doped nickel phosphide nanostructure.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present disclosure provides a transition metal-doped nickel phosphide nanostructure including: a substrate; and a plural transition metal-doped nickel phosphide nanostructure grown and aligned on the substrate in a vertical direction, wherein the transition metal-doped nickel phosphide nanostructure is doped with a transition metal on the entire surface or a portion thereof.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present disclosure also provides a catalyst for electrochemical water decomposition, which includes the transition metal-doped nickel phosphide nanostructure.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present disclosure also provides an electrode including the catalyst for electrochemical water decomposition.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The present disclosure also provides an electrochemical water decomposition device including the electrode, a counter electrode and an electrolyte or an ionic liquid.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The present disclosure also provides a method for preparing a transition metal-doped nickel phosphide nanostructure, which includes: a step of adding a zinc precursor and a hydroxide on a substrate and growing a plural zinc oxide nanostructure aligned on the substrate in a vertical direction; a step of adding a nickel precursor and a transition metal precursor on the zinc oxide nanostructure and converting the zinc oxide nanostructure to a transition metal-doped nickel oxide nanostructure through primary heat treatment; and a step of adding a phosphorus precursor to the transition metal-doped nickel oxide nanostructure and preparing a transition metal-doped nickel phosphide nanostructure through secondary heat treatment.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The transition metal-doped nickel phosphide nanostructure according to the present disclosure is advantageous in that it has superior electrochemical stability and durability and, at the same time, superior catalytic activity and conductivity due to large surface area.

id="p-0033" num="0032">The present disclosure relates to a transition metal-doped nickel phosphide nanostructure, a method for preparing the same, and a catalyst for electrochemical water decomposition including the transition metal-doped nickel phosphide nanostructure.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As described above, hydrogen production through electrolysis requires high cost because a precious metal catalyst should be used. Although non-precious metal catalysts based on transition metal oxides have been studied to replace the precious metal catalyst, commercial-scale hydrogen production is difficult due to low hydrogen evolution reaction activity and low conductivity.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">According to the present disclosure, a transition metal-doped nickel phosphide nanostructure can be prepared by converting a zinc oxide nanostructure grown on a substrate vertically by hydrothermal synthesis to a transition metal-doped nickel oxide nanostructure by cation exchange and then phosphorizing the nickel oxide. The transition metal-doped nickel phosphide nanostructure of the present disclosure is advantageous in that it has superior catalytic activity and conductivity due to large surface area. In addition, when used as a catalyst for water decomposition under an alkaline condition, it can exhibit low overvoltage and significantly improved hydrogen or oxygen evolution reaction efficiency.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Specifically, the present disclosure provides a transition metal-doped nickel phosphide nanostructure including: a substrate; and a plural transition metal-doped nickel phosphide nanostructure grown and aligned on the substrate in a vertical direction, wherein the transition metal-doped nickel phosphide nanostructure is doped with a transition metal on the entire surface or a portion thereof.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Specifically, the substrate can be a material which has superior conductivity, facilitates gas diffusion and has many active sites. Specifically, it can be a nickel foam, although not being limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The nickel phosphide nanostructure is doped with a transition metal on the entire surface or a portion thereof, such that the nickel phosphide and the doped transition metal have optimum electronic structure and, thus, can activate water decomposition interaction. In addition, by using a transition metal instead of a precious metal and forming a plural nanostructure grown and aligned on the substrate in a vertical direction, the catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction or oxygen evolution reaction under an alkaline condition can be improved significantly owing to large surface area and superior physical stability.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The nickel phosphide of the transition metal-doped nickel phosphide nanostructure can be NiP, Ni<sub>2</sub>P or a mixture thereof, specifically Ni<sub>2</sub>P. In particular, since the Ni<sub>2</sub>P exhibits lower negative charge (&#x2212;0.07 eV) as compared to other nickel phosphides, it can provide a space for adsorption of an ion on the surface during hydrogen evolution reaction or oxygen evolution reaction and thus can provide highly improved performance.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The nickel phosphide nanostructure can have a layered structure and can have an interplanar distance (d-spacing) of 0.1-0.5 nm, specifically 0.2-0.3 nm, most specifically 0.21-0.24 nm, as measured by X-ray diffractometry.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The transition metal of the transition metal-doped nickel phosphide nanostructure can be one or more selected from a group consisting of Fe, Mo, V and Co, specifically Fe or Mo. The transition metal-doped nickel phosphide nanostructure is favorable in that it has higher conductivity and is more effective for water decomposition than a non-precious metal catalyst using a transition metal oxide owing to electron delocalization due to low electronegativity.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The doping amount of the transition metal in the transition metal-doped nickel phosphide nanostructure can be 1-20 wt %, specifically 2-18 wt %, most specifically 7-16 wt %, based on 100 wt % of the nickel phosphide nanostructure. If the transition metal doping amount is less than 1 wt %, conductivity and catalytic activity may be decreased. Otherwise, if it exceeds 20 wt %, catalytic reaction may be interrupted due to excessive doping of the transition metal in the nickel phosphide.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The transition metal-doped nickel phosphide nanostructure can be a plural nanostructure grown and aligned on the substrate in a vertical direction to provide an increased reaction area of a catalyst. It can be in the form of a nanowire, a nanotube or a nanorod, specifically a nanowire. The transition metal-doped nickel phosphide nanostructure can improve catalytic activity by providing many active sites on the catalyst surface due to its large surface area. In addition, since porous nickel foam is integrated with the substrate, current can be transferred easily and reactants and products can be diffused appropriately.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The transition metal-doped nickel phosphide nanostructure can have an average diameter of 80-200 nm, specifically 90-150 nm, more specifically 95-120 nm, most specifically 98-110 nm. If the average diameter is smaller than 80 nm, the nanostructure may collapse during reaction due to weak physical stability. Otherwise, if it exceeds 200 nm, catalytic activity may be decreased due to decrease in catalyst surface area.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The present disclosure also provides a catalyst for electrochemical water decomposition, which includes the transition metal-doped nickel phosphide nanostructure.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The catalyst for electrochemical water decomposition can be applied as a catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction or a catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">As a specific example, the catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction can include a molybdenum (Mo)-doped nickel phosphide nanostructure.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">As a specific example, the catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction can include an iron (Fe)-doped nickel phosphide nanostructure.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The present disclosure also provides an electrode including the catalyst for electrochemical water decomposition.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The present disclosure also provides an electrochemical water decomposition device including the electrode, a counter electrode and an electrolyte or an ionic liquid.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The present disclosure also provides a method for preparing a transition metal-doped nickel phosphide nanostructure, which includes: a step of adding a zinc precursor and a hydroxide on a substrate and growing a plural zinc oxide nanostructure aligned on the substrate in a vertical direction; a step of adding a nickel precursor and a transition metal precursor on the zinc oxide nanostructure and converting the zinc oxide nanostructure to a transition metal-doped nickel oxide nanostructure through primary heat treatment; and a step of adding a phosphorus precursor to the transition metal-doped nickel oxide nanostructure and preparing a transition metal-doped nickel phosphide nanostructure through secondary heat treatment.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> schematically shows a process of preparing a transition metal-doped nickel phosphide nanostructure according to the present disclosure. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, after adding a zinc precursor and a hydroxide on a substrate of nickel foam, a plural zinc oxide nanostructure aligned on the substrate in a vertical direction can be grown by hydrothermal synthesis. Then, after adding a nickel precursor and a transition metal precursor to the zinc oxide nanostructure, the zinc oxide nanostructure can be converted to a transition metal-doped nickel oxide nanostructure by cation exchange. Then, after adding a phosphorus precursor, a transition metal-doped nickel phosphide nanostructure can be formed by phosphorizing the nickel oxide nanostructure.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Hereinafter, each step will be described in detail.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the step of growing the zinc oxide nanostructure, zinc ion is generated when hydrothermal synthesis is conducted after a zinc precursor and a hydroxide are added on a substrate. Then, a plural zinc oxide nanostructure grown and aligned on the substrate in a vertical direction with a uniform size can be grown by oxidation with the hydroxide. The zinc precursor can be one or more selected from a group consisting of Zn(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, Zn(OH)<sub>2 </sub>and Zn(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, specifically Zn(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The hydroxide can be one or more selected from a group consisting of ammonium hydroxide (NH<sub>4</sub>OH), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), potassium hydroxide (KOH), barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)<sub>2</sub>) and lithium hydroxide (LiOH), specifically ammonium hydroxide (NH<sub>4</sub>OH).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The zinc precursor and the hydroxide can be mixed at a weight ratio of 1:1-3:140, specifically 3:10-3:50, most specifically 3:20-1:10. If the mixing ratio of the zinc precursor and the hydroxide does not satisfy the above range, a nanowire may not be grown.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The zinc oxide nanostructure can be grown by hydrothermal synthesis. The hydrothermal synthesis can be performed at 80-200&#xb0; C. for 2-24 hours, specifically at 85-150&#xb0; C. for 4-12 hours, most specifically at 90-100&#xb0; C. for 6-8 hours. If the hydrothermal synthesis temperature and time do not satisfy the above ranges, the catalyst surface area may be decreased and charge transfer may be interrupted as the zinc oxide nanostructure is formed on the substrate with nonuniform size and without alignment.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In the step of conversion to the transition metal-doped nickel oxide nanostructure, by conducting primary heat treatment after adding a nickel precursor and a transition metal precursor on the zinc oxide nanostructure, zinc oxide is converted to nickel oxide as zinc atom is completely exchanged with nickel atom with the structure of the zinc oxide nanostructure intact, and the zinc oxide nanostructure can be converted to a transition metal-doped nickel oxide nanostructure by doping a dopant transition metal at the same time.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The nickel precursor can be one or more selected from a group consisting of nickel acetate, nickel halide, nickel nitrate, nickel hydroxide and nickel carbonyl, specifically nickel halide. As a specific example, the nickel halide can be one selected from a group consisting of NiCl<sub>2</sub>, NiBr<sub>2 </sub>and NiI<sub>2</sub>, specifically NiCl<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The transition metal precursor can be M<sub>x</sub>Cl<sub>y </sub>(wherein M is Mo, Fe, V or Co, x satisfies 1&#x2264;x&#x2264;5 and y satisfies 2&#x2264;y&#x2264;10).

If the mixing ratio of the nickel precursor and the transition metal precursor does not satisfy the above range, nickel crystal may not be formed and a nanowire may not grow properly.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In the step of conversion to the transition metal-doped nickel oxide nanostructure, the primary heat treatment can be performed by cation exchange at 550-850&#xb0; C. for 0.3-4 hours.
