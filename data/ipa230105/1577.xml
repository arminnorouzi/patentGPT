The robot control system includes a robot <b>100</b>, a control apparatus <b>200</b> controlling the robot <b>100</b>, and an information processing apparatus <b>300</b>. The robot <b>100</b> is installed on a platform <b>500</b>. The information processing apparatus <b>300</b> is e.g. a personal computer.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The robot <b>100</b> includes a base <b>110</b> and a robot arm <b>120</b>. An end effector <b>150</b> is attached to the distal end portion of the robot arm <b>120</b>. Further, a vibration sensor <b>410</b> and a force sensor <b>420</b> are provided in the hand of the robot arm <b>120</b>. In the present disclosure, &#x201c;the hand of the robot arm <b>120</b>&#x201d; refers to a portion from the distal end of the robot arm <b>120</b> to the end effector <b>150</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The robot arm <b>120</b> is sequentially coupled by four joints J<b>1</b> to J<b>4</b>. &#x201c;Joint&#x201d; is also referred to as &#x201c;axis&#x201d;. A TCP (Tool Center Point) as a control point of the robot <b>100</b> is set near the distal end portion of the robot arm <b>120</b>. &#x201c;Control point&#x201d; is a point as a reference for control of the robot arm <b>120</b>. The TCP can be set in an arbitrary position. The control of the robot <b>100</b> refers to control of a position and an attitude of the TCP. In the embodiment, a four-axis robot having the robot arm <b>120</b> with the four joints J<b>1</b> to J<b>4</b> is exemplified, however, a robot having any arm mechanism with one or more joints can be used. The robot <b>100</b> of the embodiment is a horizontal articulated robot, however, a vertical articulated robot may be used.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The vibration sensor <b>410</b> is a sensor that can detect vibration of the robot <b>100</b>. Generally, the vibration may be detected by measurements of temporal changes of one of a position, a velocity, and an acceleration. As the vibration sensor <b>410</b>, e.g. a position sensor, a gyro sensor, an acceleration sensor, an inertial measurement unit, or the like may be used. Note that the vibration sensor <b>410</b> may be provided in another position than the hand of the robot arm <b>120</b>. For example, when the vibration of the platform <b>500</b> is a constraint condition for the optimization processing, a vibration sensor may be provided in the platform <b>500</b>. When the vibration is not a constraint condition, the vibration sensor <b>410</b> can be omitted.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The force sensor <b>420</b> is a sensor detecting a force applied to the end effector <b>150</b>. As the force sensor <b>420</b>, a load cell that can detect a force in a single axial direction and a force sensor and a torque sensor that can detect force components in a plurality of axial directions can be used. In the embodiment, a six-axis force sensor is used as the force sensor <b>420</b>. The six-axis force sensor detects magnitude of forces parallel to three detection axes orthogonal to one another and magnitude of torque around the three detection axes in an intrinsic sensor coordinate system. Note that the force sensor <b>420</b> may be provided in another position than the hand of the robot arm <b>120</b>, e.g. one or more joints of the joints J<b>1</b> to J<b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the embodiment, the robot <b>100</b> fits a first workpiece WK<b>1</b> into a hole HL of a second workpiece WK<b>2</b>, and thereby, executes work to assemble the two workpieces WK<b>1</b>, WK<b>2</b>. In the work, force control using a force detected by the force sensor <b>420</b> is executed. Note that, when the force control is not used, the force sensor <b>420</b> can be omitted.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a block diagram showing functions of the information processing apparatus <b>300</b>.

The control apparatus <b>200</b> is further coupled to the interface circuit <b>330</b>. Measurement results of sensors <b>400</b> of the robot <b>100</b> are supplied to the information processing apparatus <b>300</b> via the control apparatus <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The sensors <b>400</b> include a current sensor <b>430</b> measuring currents of motors provided in the respective joints of the robot <b>100</b> and a joint encoder <b>440</b> detecting motion positions of the respective joints in addition to the vibration sensor <b>410</b> and the force sensor <b>420</b> explained in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. At least part of the sensors <b>400</b> is used for obtainment of a performance index value and a constraint evaluation value used for optimization processing of a motion parameter, which will be described later.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The processor <b>310</b> has a function as a parameter setting section <b>311</b> setting a control parameter of the robot <b>100</b>. The parameter setting section <b>311</b> includes functions of an operation execution unit <b>312</b> and a parameter search unit <b>314</b>. The operation execution unit <b>312</b> controls the robot <b>100</b> to execute work according to a robot control program. The parameter search unit <b>314</b> executes processing of searching for the control parameter of the robot <b>100</b>. The function of the parameter setting section <b>311</b> is realized by the processor <b>310</b> executing a computer program stored in the memory <b>320</b>. Note that part or all of the functions of the parameter setting section <b>311</b> may be realized by a hardware circuit.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the memory <b>320</b>, a parameter initial value IP, a search condition SC, an optimization result OR, and a robot control program RP are stored. The parameter initial value IP is an initial value of the control parameter. The search condition SC is a condition for searching of the control parameter in the optimization processing. The optimization result OR is a result of the optimization processing of the control parameter. The robot control program RP includes a plurality of commands for moving the robot <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a flowchart showing a procedure of setting processing of the control parameter. At step S<b>110</b>, a worker selects work for which the control parameter is set and a motion for evaluation, and the parameter search unit <b>314</b> receives the selection. In the embodiment, fitting work of two workpieces WK<b>1</b>, WK<b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is selected. The robot control program RP is a program in which the motion of the work is described.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The motion for evaluation refers to a motion as an object for which an objective function and a constraint condition of the optimization processing are evaluated. In the embodiment, for example, the following five motions are used as the motions for evaluation:</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">(1) Motion M<b>1</b>: move the end effector <b>150</b> to above the first workpiece WK<b>1</b>, and then, move the end effector downward to the position of the first workpiece WK<b>1</b>,</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">(2) Motion M<b>2</b>: grip the first workpiece WK<b>1</b> by the end effector <b>150</b>,</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">(3) Motion M<b>3</b>: move the gripped first workpiece WK<b>1</b> upward, move the first workpiece horizontally to above the second workpiece WK<b>2</b>, and then, move the first workpiece downward immediately above the second workpiece WK<b>2</b>,</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">(4) Motion M<b>4</b>: fit the first workpiece WK<b>1</b> in the second workpiece WK<b>2</b>, and</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">(5) Motion M<b>5</b>: release the first workpiece WK<b>1</b> and move the end effector <b>150</b> to above.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As the motions for evaluation, motions formed by further division into smaller pieces than these examples may be used.

For example, the processing at steps S<b>190</b>, S<b>200</b> may be executed immediately after the processing at steps S<b>130</b> to S<b>150</b> is executed once or after the processing at steps S<b>160</b> to S<b>180</b> is executed twice or more.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0093">Or, the above described step S<b>190</b> may be omitted and, at step S<b>200</b>, for example, the worker may change the constraint condition using the third window shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>11</b></figref>, and the optimization processing at step S<b>130</b> may be executed again. Note that the change proposal of the constraint condition is presented to the worker at step S<b>190</b>, and thereby, there is an advantage that the change of the constraint condition and the re-execution of the optimization processing may be started after the worker confirms the presented change proposal of the constraint condition.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0094">As described above, in the embodiments, with respect to the plurality of candidate values used in the plurality of iterations of the control parameter, the processing result containing the correlation chart showing the values of the objective function and the constraint evaluation values is displayed, and thereby, an appropriate candidate value may be determined as the setting value of the control parameter according to the display of the processing result.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">Other Embodiments</heading><p id="p-0101" num="0095">The present disclosure is not limited to the above described embodiments, but may be realized in various aspects without departing from the scope thereof.
