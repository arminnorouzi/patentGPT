id="p-0037" num="0036">Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail according to the attached drawings. Note that the configurations shown in the following embodiments are merely examples, and the present invention is not limited to the shown configurations.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block configuration diagram of an image capturing apparatus typified by an interchangeable lens type digital camera in the embodiment. The image capturing apparatus in the embodiment is constituted by a main-body of the image capturing apparatus <b>100</b> and a lens unit <b>180</b> that can be mounted to/unmounted from the main-body of the image capturing apparatus <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the main-body of the image capturing apparatus <b>100</b>, a shutter <b>120</b> controls the exposure amount of a later-described image capturing device <b>122</b>. The image capturing device <b>122</b> includes an image sensor that is constituted by a CCD or CMOS element that converts an optical image to an electric signal. R, G, and B color filters are arranged on a surface of the image sensor in a Bayer arrangement. Therefore, the image data immediately after obtaining of an image by the image capturing device <b>122</b> is constituted by pixel data obtained from pixels in the Bayer arrangement. Also, the image capturing device <b>122</b> has an A/D conversion processing function. An AF evaluation value detection unit <b>123</b> calculates an AF evaluation value from contrast information obtained from a digital image signal or a phase difference obtained from parallax images, and the image capturing device <b>122</b> outputs the obtained AF evaluation value to a system control unit <b>150</b>. Note that the image sensor in the present embodiment is a so-called full-size sensor.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">An image processing unit <b>124</b> performs predetermined pixel interpolation processing, resizing processing such as reduction, and color conversion processing on image data output from the image capturing device <b>122</b> or image data from a memory control unit <b>115</b>. Also, the image processing unit <b>124</b> can acquire information regarding the distance between a subject and the image capturing apparatus. Specifically, the image processing unit <b>124</b> acquires the distance to a subject by detecting a phase difference between two given parallax images, and acquires information regarding distance to the subject from the image capturing apparatus for each pixel. Moreover, the image processing unit <b>124</b> performs predetermined computation processing using image data obtained by capturing an image, and the system control unit <b>150</b> performs exposure control and distance measurement control based on the computation result. Thus, AE (automatic exposure) processing and EF (automatic flash adjustment) processing of TTL (through-the-lens) type are performed. Also, the image processing unit <b>124</b> performs AF (autofocus) processing, and may use an output of the AF evaluation value detection unit <b>123</b> included in the image capturing device <b>122</b> when performing the AF processing. Moreover, the image processing unit <b>124</b> also performs predetermined computation processing using image data obtained by capturing an image, and performs AWB (automatic white balance) processing of the TTL type using the obtained computation result. Also, the image processing unit <b>124</b> also creates a multiplexed image by performing processing for synthesizing a plurality of images. Moreover, the image processing unit <b>124</b> converts RAW image data in a Bayer arrangement to image data including three components per pixel by performing debayering processing, and also performs encoding and decoding processing.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The output data of the image capturing device <b>122</b> is written into a memory <b>132</b> via the image processing unit <b>124</b> and a memory control unit <b>115</b>, or directly written into the memory <b>132</b> via the memory control unit <b>115</b>. The memory <b>132</b> stores image data that has been acquired by the image capturing device <b>122</b> and subjected to A/D conversion, and image data for display in a display unit <b>128</b>. The memory <b>132</b> has a sufficient memory capacity for storing a predetermined number of still images and a moving image and audio of a predetermined length. Also, the memory <b>132</b> functions as a memory for image display (video memory). A D/A converter <b>113</b> converts data for image display stored in the memory <b>132</b> to analog signals and supplies the analog signals to the display unit <b>128</b>. In this way, image data for display written into the memory <b>132</b> is displayed in the display unit <b>128</b> via the D/A converter <b>113</b>. The display unit <b>128</b> performs display on a display such as an LCD in accordance with the analog signals from the D/A converter <b>113</b>. The digital signals obtained by A/D conversion performed by the image capturing device <b>122</b> and stored in the memory <b>132</b> are converted into analog signals by the D/A converter <b>113</b>, and the analog signals are successively transmitted to the display unit <b>128</b> for display, making it possible to realize an electronic viewfinder that performs through-the-lens image display.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">A nonvolatile memory <b>156</b> is an electrically erasable and recordable memory, and is a flash memory or the like. Constants and programs, for example, for operating the system control unit <b>150</b> are stored in the nonvolatile memory <b>156</b>. In this context, &#x201c;programs&#x201d; may refer to programs for executing various flowcharts that will be described later. Also, the nonvolatile memory <b>156</b> stores a lens table <b>156</b><i>a </i>in which a model name of a lens unit that can be connected to the main-body of the image capturing apparatus <b>100</b> is associated with characteristic information of the lens unit. The characteristic information of a lens unit includes the size of an image circle.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The system control unit <b>150</b> integrally controls the processing units of the main-body of the image capturing apparatus <b>100</b> by executing programs stored in the above-described nonvolatile memory <b>156</b>. The reference sign <b>152</b> indicates a system memory, and is a RAM. Constants and variables for operating the system control unit <b>150</b>, programs read out from the nonvolatile memory <b>156</b>, and the like are deployed in the system memory <b>152</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">A system timer <b>153</b> is a timer unit for measuring time periods for various types of controls and the time of an integrated clock. A mode switching switch <b>160</b>, a first shutter switch <b>162</b> and a second shutter switch <b>163</b> that are included in a shutter button <b>161</b>, and the operation unit <b>170</b> function as operation members for inputting various instructions to operate the system control unit <b>150</b>. The mode switching button <b>160</b> switches the operation mode of the system control unit <b>150</b> to any of a still image recording mode, a moving image recording mode, and a reproduction mode. The still image recording mode includes an automatic shooting mode, an automatic scene determination mode, a manual mode, various types of scene modes in which different settings are configured for individual shooting scenes, a program AE mode, a custom mode, a multiple-exposure imaging mode, and the like. The mode can be directly switched to any of these modes by using the mode switching button <b>160</b>. Alternatively, it is also possible to switch, using the mode switching button <b>160</b>, to the still image recording mode and then to switch, using another operation member, to any of these modes included in the still image recording mode. Similarly, the moving image recording mode may also include a plurality of modes.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">When the shutter button <b>161</b> provided in the main-body of the image capturing apparatus <b>100</b> is operated, that is, pressed half-way (the shooting preparation instruction), the first shutter switch <b>162</b> is turned on and generates a first shutter switch signal SW<b>1</b>. Upon receiving the first shutter switch signal SW<b>1</b>, the system control unit <b>150</b> starts AF (autofocus) processing, AE (automatic exposure) processing, AWB (automatic white balance) processing, EF (automatic flash adjustment) processing, and the like.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">When the operation of the shutter button <b>161</b> is completed, that is, the shutter button <b>161</b> is pressed fully (the shooting instruction), the second shutter switch <b>163</b> is turned on and generates a second shutter switch signal SW<b>2</b>. Upon receiving the second shutter switch signal SW<b>2</b>, the system control unit <b>150</b> starts a series of shooting processing from reading out the signal from the image capturing device <b>122</b> to writing of image data to the recording medium <b>190</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">By selecting various functional icons displayed on the display unit <b>128</b>, appropriate functions for each situation are assigned to the operation members of the operation unit <b>170</b>, and the operation members thus act as various function buttons. Examples of these function buttons include an end button, a back button, an image scrolling button, a jump button, a narrow-down button, and an attribute change button. For example, a menu screen that enables setting of various settings is displayed on the display unit <b>128</b> by pressing the menu button. The user can set various settings intuitively by using the menu screen, which is displayed in the display unit <b>128</b>, four-direction (up, down, left, right) buttons, and a SET button. The menu screen that enables setting of various settings includes a screen for selecting, when the multiple-exposure imaging mode has been selected, an image that has been shot in the past and is recorded in the recording medium <b>190</b> as a base image, and the multiple-exposure imaging in which a shot image is synthesized on a selected base image is also possible. Moreover, a screen is also included for enabling selection as to whether or not the size of an image to be read out as a shot image is cropped to an APS-C sensor size, and if a setting for cropping is selected, shooting can be performed in the APS-C sensor size even in a case where a lens unit for a full-size sensor is mounted.

The imaging lens <b>181</b> is constituted by a plurality of lenses including a focus lens for performing focus adjustment by moving in an optical axis direction and a zoom lens for performing zooming. Also, an aperture <b>182</b> adjusts an amount of light to the image capturing device <b>122</b> of the main-body of the image capturing apparatus <b>100</b>. A lens unit control unit <b>183</b> controls the entire lens unit <b>180</b> in accordance with control signals from the system control unit <b>150</b> of the main-body of the image capturing apparatus <b>100</b>, and controls driving of the focus lens and the zoom lens of the imaging lens <b>181</b> and the aperture <b>182</b>.
