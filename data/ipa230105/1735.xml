In a free-ink writing instrument, ink is free to move within the instrument tank in accordance with the movements imposed by the user to the instrument. Commonly, felt pens comprise a writing tip in the form of a nib and a cap to close off the nib. The nib is typically kept wet by the ink used for writing. Closing of the nib is be necessary to prevent the solvents of the ink from evaporating and nib from drying out A dried out nib may impair the writing quality of the nib or render the entire felt pen irreversibly useless, thereby shortening the life of the latter. Further, an uncovered nib can lead to unintentional stains on surfaces, e.g. clothes or skin of the user. Also, it may be tedious for the user to recap a felt pen after every use, especially when drawing with multiple colors. Further, a cap may be displaced leading to the nib drying out.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present disclosure aims to address one or more problems in the prior art.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a first aspect, the present disclosure relates to a free-ink writing instrument comprising:</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">a tank for storing a writing ink;</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">a nib having a first end protruding within the tank for being in contact with writing ink and a second opposite end located outside the tank for dispensing writing ink outside the writing instrument, characterized in that the writing instrument further comprises a nib nib drying delay component that is locally arranged around the first end of the nib in a liquid tight manner and configured to locally retain ink therein so as to keep the first nib end in contact with locally retained ink whatever the spatial position of the writing instrument</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to this first aspect, the nib nib drying delay component located around the first nib end may retain ink locally in contact with the first nib end so as to keep it wet as long as possible, thereby delaying drying of the nib and improving cap-off time performances of the writing instrument when the latter is provided with a cap.

The terms or words used in the description and the aspects of the present disclosure are not to be construed limiting as only having common-language or dictionary meanings and should, unless specifically defined otherwise in the following description, be interpreted as having their ordinary technical meaning as established in the relevant technical field. The detailed description will refer to specific embodiments to better illustrate the present disclosure, however, it should be understood that the presented disclosure is not limited to these specific embodiments.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In a first exemplary embodiment, the present disclosure relates to a writing instrument. An example of a writing instrument according to the present disclosure is described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The writing instrument <b>10</b> may comprise a tubular body <b>12</b>. The tubular body may be a unitary body, or it may comprise multiple components. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the tubular component is made of multiple components and comprises a tip component <b>13</b> comprising a writing orifice which is located at the distal end of the tip component <b>13</b>. The writing instrument <b>10</b> may further comprise in the tubular body a tank (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) for storing a writing ink which may be arranged proximally to the writing orifice within or as part of the tubular body <b>12</b>. The writing instrument is a free ink instrument wherein the writing ink is free to circulate or flow in the tank. In other words, the writing ink circulates instantaneously on either side of the tank, e.g. as a result of gravity. In particular, it is to be understood that the writing ink is able to move within the tank when the writing instrument is handled or moved by a user. The writing instrument may be a marker, a felt pen, a highlighter, a permanent or non-permanent marker or any other type of writing instrument.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The writing instrument <b>10</b> may further comprise a nib <b>24</b> which may be in fluid communication with the tank. In the exemplary embodiment, the fluid communication may be established by the nib <b>24</b> comprising a fibrous or porous part which extends into the tank and is configured to transport ink from the tank by capillarity. In some embodiments, one or more intermediate components may be located between the nib and the tank containing free ink.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments, the nib <b>24</b> of the writing instrument may be in a fixed position within the tubular body <b>12</b> with the writing end of the nib permanently protruding through the writing orifice as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Such a writing instrument may be equipped with a cap <b>14</b> that is provided to close off the writing end nib after use of the instrument (in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> the cap <b>14</b> is represented at a distance of the the writing end of the nib).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some other embodiments not illustrated, the nib may be configured to be axially translatable within the tubular body of the writing instrument, in a known manner, between a first retracted position in which the nib is positioned within the tubular body and not protruding through the writing orifice and a second extended position in which the nib protrudes through the writing orifice. In such embodiments (retractable system), the writing instrument does not need any cap.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a first exemplary embodiment of a writing instrument according to the present disclosure shows a schematic partial axial cross section of the rear part of the tubular body <b>12</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> encasing the writing ink tank <b>20</b> storing writing ink I.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The nib <b>24</b> may have an end <b>24</b><i>a, </i>called a first end, which protrudes within the tank <b>20</b>. The protruding first nib end <b>24</b><i>a </i>is in contact with writing ink stored within the tank when the writing instrument <b>10</b> is filled with ink before any use. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the writing instrument <b>10</b> has already been used and part of the ink originally stored in the tank has been dispensed outside the instrument, thereby showing a tank filled in part with ink I. The first nib end <b>24</b><i>a </i>is left exposed to air and is no longer in permanent contact with ink, which may entail risks of drying of the nib. The nib <b>24</b> may have a second opposite end <b>24</b><i>b </i>located outside the tank for dispensing writing ink outside the writing instrument. This second nib end <b>24</b><i>b </i>is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> in the exemplary embodiment but not in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> which only illustrates the part of the nib <b>24</b> which is located in the rear part of the tubular body <b>12</b>. In this Figure, the writing instrument <b>10</b> is in a vertical position with the second nib end <b>24</b><i>b </i>and the writing orifice of the instrument of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> in an upper position, the first nib end <b>24</b><i>a </i>being in a lower position.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The nib <b>24</b> may extend axially between both first end <b>24</b><i>a </i>and second end <b>24</b><i>b </i>along a longitudinal axis A which here coincides with the longitudinal axis of the tubular body <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, which may differ depending on the writing instrument configurations.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the writing instrument <b>10</b> may comprise in a known manner a baffle or buffer system or arrangement <b>26</b> through which the nib <b>24</b> axially extends. Baffle or buffer system/arrangement <b>26</b> may surround the nib <b>24</b> along part of its length and extend transversally through a peripheral wall <b>12</b><i>a, </i>e.g. cylindrical wall, of the tubular body <b>12</b>. Such an arrangement enables ink flow regulation towards the front part of the tubular body. Other configurations where nib and baffle/buffer are arranged in series may also be envisaged.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The writing instrument <b>10</b> may further comprise a nib drying delay component <b>30</b> located in a first part of the tank <b>20</b> and locally arranged around the protruding first end <b>24</b><i>a </i>of the nib in close contact therewith so as to provide liquid tight sealing between the first nib end <b>24</b><i>a </i>and the surrounding nib drying delay component <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The nib drying delay component <b>30</b> may be configured through its shape to retain ink locally around the first nib end <b>24</b><i>a </i>and in contact therewith (in other words, the nib drying delay component forms a local ink reservoir or ink trap around the first nib end and that is separate from the remaining second part of the tank where the ink is stored) so as to maintain a permanent contact with ink, thereby maintaining the first nib end <b>24</b><i>a </i>wet as long as possible to avoid drying out of the latter and therefore improving cap-off time performances of the writing instrument. To be noted that by wetting the nib with ink on the rear side (first nib end), the second nib end will be fed with ink (by capillarity) so as to prevent drying.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The locally retained ink around the first nib end <b>24</b><i>a </i>(in the first part of the tank) may be useful whatever the spatial position of the writing instrument. In particular, it is useful when the first nib end <b>24</b><i>a </i>is no longer in contact with ink I (as shown in the upright position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) due to the already dispensed ink. This may also occur when the writing instrument <b>10</b> is in a horizontal position and the ink volume that remains stored in the second part of the tank is no longer sufficient for the first nib end <b>24</b><i>a </i>to be in contact with the latter.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The nib drying delay component <b>30</b> may comprise a surrounding wall <b>32</b> (e.g. in plastic or metal) that extends between the first nib end <b>24</b><i>a </i>and a peripheral wall <b>20</b><i>a </i>(e.g. cylindrical wall) of the tank <b>20</b> so as to form an ink trap in a first portion <b>32</b><i>a </i>of the surrounding wall that is adjacent the first nib end <b>24</b><i>a. </i>A volume of ink i may be locally trapped and retained within the area surrounding the first nib end <b>24</b><i>a </i>and enclosed by the first portion <b>32</b><i>a </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The surrounding wall may be a separate component which is added in the tank during the assembly of the writing instrument or be part of the molding process of the tank itself. The wall <b>32</b> may more specifically be rigid so as to keep its shape and ensure the ink trapping function.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The surrounding wall <b>32</b> may further comprise a second wall portion <b>32</b><i>b </i>that is located farther from the first nib end <b>24</b><i>a </i>than the first wall portion <b>32</b><i>a </i>and that transversally extends to the peripheral wall <b>20</b><i>a. </i>The second wall portion <b>32</b><i>b </i>may be provided with openings, here peripheral openings O, e.g. regularly distributed along a circumference of the second wall portion <b>32</b><i>b. </i>These openings O may be configured to allow ink I stored in the second part of the tank to flow through these openings and ingress into the space delimited by the wall <b>32</b>, the rear part of the baffle or buffer system/arrangement <b>26</b> (other arrangements may be provided) and therefore into the ink trap. This ink flow may be made possible when the writing instrument <b>10</b> is moved to or toward an appropriate position, i.e. either in a horizontal position when the volume of ink I is sufficient or when the tank is above first nib end <b>24</b><i>a </i>to adopt a writing position (and the latter is above the second nib end <b>24</b><i>b</i>). A volume of ink i may therefore be trapped as explained above and may subsequently be available as a local ink reservoir when the writing instrument is returned to a position where the tank is no longer above the first nib end <b>24</b><i>a, </i>but at the same level or even at a lower position.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the exemplary embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the surrounding wall <b>32</b> may have a substantially funnel shape with a narrow portion <b>32</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> in contact with the first nib end <b>24</b><i>a </i>and a wide portion <b>32</b><i>b</i><b>1</b> in contact with the surrounding peripheral wall <b>20</b><i>a </i>of the tank. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the funnel-shaped surrounding wall <b>32</b> flares out from the first nib end <b>24</b><i>a </i>along longitudinal axis A, i.e. towards the front part of the tubular body and the second nib end <b>24</b><i>b </i>(not represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). The surrounding wall <b>32</b> may be substantially curved with a concavity oriented towards the rear or second part of the tank. This concave shape makes it possible to maintain a certain amount of free ink in permanent contact with the nib (to keep it wet). Such a feature makes it possible to allow a greater surface of contact between ink and the nib. This feature provides greater efficiency when the the writing instrument is in nib up position (vertical or not). To be noted that other surrounding wall shapes may alternately be envisaged (e.g. a frusto conical shape or a convex shape to provide the same or likewise advantages).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As more particularly illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the first nib end <b>24</b><i>a </i>may comprise an axial terminating portion <b>24</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> that faces the bottom <b>20</b><i>b </i>of the tank <b>20</b> and a circumferential portion <b>24</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> that faces the surrounding peripheral wall <b>20</b><i>b </i>of the tank. The axial terminating portion <b>24</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> may be connected to the circumferential portion <b>24</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> by a bevelled portion.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The nib drying delay component <b>30</b>, here the surrounding wall <b>32</b>, may be locally arranged around the circumferential portion <b>24</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> of the first nib end <b>24</b><i>a </i>in a liquid tight manner therewith while leaving free or unobstructed the axial terminating portion <b>24</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> which can therefore be directly in contact with ink, either before the first use (filled tank) or when the writing instrument is moved with its rear part at a upper position than its front part.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a variant embodiment wherein the ink that has been trapped around the first nib end <b>124</b><i>a </i>is being prevented from flowing out through the openings O&#x2032; of the surrounding wall <b>132</b> (toward the second part of the tank <b>120</b>) when the writing instrument is being moved.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In this respect, micro-valves <b>134</b> may be arranged in the openings O&#x2032; (mounted on the surrounding wall <b>132</b>) so as to enable therethrough a flow of stored ink in a first direction into the ink trap when the writing instrument is moved to or toward an appropriate position (as explained above to create a local ink reservoir around the first nib end <b>124</b><i>a</i>). This is made possible thanks to the ink pressure applied on the micro-valves. These micro-valves prevent ink from flowing out of the ink trap through these openings in a second opposite direction when the writing instrument is being moved to a position where the first nib end is at the level of the tank or at an upper position than the tank (nib up position) by virtue of gravity and/or weight of ink stored in the ink trap. By way of example, The micro-valves which can be used are conventional ones, such as umbrella-type valves, usually made of elastomeric materials. More generally, the choice of a micro-valve may be done in a way that it can be opened thanks to low pressure variation (a few millibars considering that the height of ink in a writing instrument is generally a few centimeters). It can also be a simple flap working with gravity (closed when writing instrument is in nib up position and opened thanks to the force applied by the ink column when the writing instrument is in nib down position).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Alternatively, the openings O&#x2032; equipped with micro-valves or the like (avoiding ink to flow back to the tank) may be arranged in the first portion of the wall <b>132</b> that is closer to the nib end portion than the second portion of the wall where the micro-valves or the like are provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> (close to the peripheral wall of the tank). The configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> (with the openings O&#x2032; close to the tank peripheral wall) is particularly effective when the writing instrument (e.g. marker) is in horizontal position and the tank contains a low quantity of ink. This advantage also applies to the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> embodiment.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">A second exemplary embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> takes over the same principle as described above of creating a local ink reservoir (ink trap) around the first nib end that protrudes in the ink tank so as to make ink available around the first nib end and in contact therewith in a permanent manner (to maintain the first nib end in wet condition), even when the writing instrument is in a position where the writing ink stored in the tank is no longer in contact with the first nib end (the trap with foamed material has the advantage of being efficient whatever the writing instrument position). Cap-off time is therefore improved due to permanent contact between the first nib end and trapped ink as for the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref> of which the features and advantages are taken over here, except when technically incompatible with each other. Only the nib drying delay component of the writing instrument differs from the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref> exemplary embodiments. The corresponding elements keep their own references.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">As schematically represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the writing instrument <b>200</b> comprises a nib drying delay component <b>230</b> which may comprise a foamed member <b>232</b> that surrounds the first nib end <b>24</b><i>a </i>in a liquid tight manner therewith. The foamed member may be tightly adjusted around the first nib end <b>24</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The foamed member <b>232</b> may be formed of a foamed material that is configured to be filled with ink stored in the tank <b>20</b> when the writing instrument <b>200</b> is moved to or toward an appropriate position i.e. either in a horizontal position when the volume of ink is sufficient or when the tank <b>20</b> is above first nib end <b>24</b><i>a </i>to adopt a writing position (and the latter is above the second nib end <b>24</b><i>b </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). A volume of ink may therefore be trapped within the foam and may subsequently be available as a local ink reservoir when the writing instrument is returned to a position where the tank <b>20</b> is no longer above the first nib end <b>24</b><i>a, </i>but at the same level or even at a lower position. To be noted that at the very first use of the writing instrument <b>200</b> the level of ink within the tank is generally sufficient for the first nib end <b>24</b><i>a </i>to remain submerged in the stored ink. At the very first use, the foamed member <b>232</b> which may be located above the level of ink stored in the tank (depending on the product configuration) may be soaked with ink due to the writing instrument handling during assembly, co-packing and/or transportation.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The foamed member has retention properties that allow to retain/store ink locally around the first nib end <b>24</b><i>a </i>and maintain the latter wet. The retained/stored ink may be delivered or dispensed to the first nib end thanks to its capillarity power.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">It may be preferable that the capillarity power of the foamed member <b>232</b> be less than the capillarity power of the nib <b>24</b> so as to permit a controlled transfer of ink from the foam to the nib over time.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">By way of example, the foamed material may be a filler with polyester fibers and a plastic wrap (e.g. made of polypropylene), or a polyester or polyurethane based foam. The foamed material may also be a porous component with polyamide or polypropylene fibers.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some embodiments, the foamed member <b>232</b> may have a transverse dimension extending transversally relative to the longitudinal axis A. that may be chosen so that, in a horizontal position of the writing instrument <b>200</b>, ink I that is stored in the tank <b>20</b> can fill the foamed material of the foamed member <b>232</b>. This dimension (e.g. diameter for a ring) may be adjusted, e.g. increased, so as to increase the chances for the foamed member to capture ink and be filled therewith when the writing instrument <b>200</b> is horizontal and the volume/level of ink in the tank has decreased since the very first use of the instrument (fully filled tank). For example, the transverse dimension of the foamed member <b>232</b> may substantially correspond to the inner diameter of the tank.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In some embodiments, the foamed member may be substantially ring-shaped as schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> for the sake of design simplicity. However, other alternative shapes may be envisaged depending on the circumstances.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some other embodiments not depicted, the writing instrument of the present disclosure may be provided both with a nib drying delay component <b>30</b> and a nib drying delay component <b>230</b>. In such an embodiment, the nib drying delay component <b>30</b> (e.g. surrounding wall <b>32</b>) may be provided around the foamed member <b>232</b> of the nib drying delay component <b>230</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> for example (foamed member located in the ink trap formed by the surrounding wall). This arrangement may provide additional amount of ink in contact with the nib and therefore may further improve the cap-off time of the writing instrument.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In some other embodiments not depicted, the writing instrument of the present disclosure may be provided both with a nib drying delay component <b>30</b> and a nib drying delay component <b>230</b>. In such an embodiment, the foamed member <b>232</b> of the nib drying delay component <b>230</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> for example may be located close to the terminating portion of the first nib end and the nib drying delay component <b>30</b> (e.g. surrounding wall <b>32</b>) may be provided around the portion of the first nib end that is farther from the terminating portion of the latter so as to be located downstream the foamed member <b>232</b> when considering the flow of ink from the tank towards the nib (foamed member located outside the ink trap formed by the surrounding wall).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some other embodiments not depicted, the systems as described and illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> to <b>4</b></figref> may be equipped with an actuation mechanism, springs etc. in order to be used in a retractable free-ink writing instrument.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Although the preferred embodiments of the present disclosure have been disclosed for illustrative purposes, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications and alterations are possible, without departing from the spirit of the present disclosure.
