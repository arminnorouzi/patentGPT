A cell limiting current test is performed by holding the cell at a specific voltage for a specific amount of time, and measuring the resulting current provided by the cell at a set time endpoint. As a cell is initially held to a voltage (using an instrument that adjusts the current drain from the cell to reach the set voltage), the current will initially be high, and decline asymptotically to a relatively constant level. Typically, the set time is chosen at a point where the current is in this relatively constant range.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As used herein, &#x201c;cell limiting current at 0.9V&#x201d; means the current provided by a metal-air electrochemical cell at 0.9V, at the end of 60 seconds during which the cell has been held at a voltage of 0.9V.

Prior to this test, the cell should not be under any load for at least 60 seconds.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">It has now been observed that oxygen utilization in a metal-air electrochemical cell may be unexpectedly improved through the combination of an electrolyte having a fluorinated amphoteric surfactant and lithium hydroxide in a cell housing having limited air access. The electrolyte formulation has been found to increase closed cell voltage and cathode half-cell voltage, while allowing for reduction in oxygen access required by the cell for a given current draw and/or maintaining a desirable closed circuit voltage. This greater efficiency in oxygen utilization and higher cell voltage enables the use of a smaller vent area to the exterior of the cell, reducing exposure to the detrimental effects of moisture (H<sub>2</sub>O vapor) and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>). This greater efficiency in oxygen utilization and higher cell voltage also enables the use of less porous diffusion layers between the air access ports and the active cathode material, also reducing exposure to the detrimental effects of moisture and CO<sub>2</sub>. These changes reduce the access to oxygen and improve performance at low and high humidity conditions as well as environments with elevated CO<sub>2 </sub>concentrations.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Described herein is the combination of a high voltage anode formulation composed of an amphoteric fluorosurfactant and a cell designed such that the cell limiting current is reduced to the lowest possible level while still meeting the drain rate use requirements. The present technology provides a battery that includes an air cathode, an anode, an aqueous electrolyte that includes an amphoteric surfactant, and a housing that includes one or more air access ports defining a total area of void space (&#x201c;vent area&#x201d;). The ratio of a number of the variables to the vent area has been tested for a variety of cells.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In accordance with the surprising observations described herein, when an amphoteric fluorsurfactant is used in the electrolyte of the batteries of the present technology, the minimum required total vent area defined by the air access ports was found to be surprisingly low. By way of example, in the improved batteries of the present technology the total vent area of a size 312 cell may be 0.0660 mm<sup>2</sup>, a 24% reduction from the standard/convention dimension of 0.0869 mm<sup>2</sup>. In some embodiments, the size 312 vent area may be 0.033 mm<sup>2</sup>. In some embodiments, the size 312 vent area may be from about 0.01 mm<sup>2 </sup>to about 0.1 mm<sup>2</sup>, or from about 0.03 mm<sup>2 </sup>to about 0.07 mm<sup>2</sup>. As another example, in the improved batteries of the present technology the total vent area of size 13 cell may be 0.0998 mm<sup>2</sup>, a 30% reduction from the reduced from the standard/convention dimension of 0.1295 mm<sup>2</sup>. In some embodiments, the size 13 vent area may be 0.1295 mm<sup>2</sup>, or about 0.0499 mm<sup>2</sup>. In some embodiments, the size 13 vent area may be from about 0.04 mm<sup>2 </sup>to about 0.15 mm<sup>2</sup>, or about 0.05 mm<sup>2 </sup>to about 0.13 mm<sup>2</sup>, or from about 0.09 mm<sup>2 </sup>to about 0.13 mm<sup>2</sup>. Without being bound by theory, it is proposed that the reduced vent area is made possible by the high voltage and more efficient electrolyte formulation (i.e., including an amphoteric fluorosurfactant and optionally LiOH.xH<sub>2</sub>O) where the amphoteric fluorosurfactant may help reduce voltage suppression while maintaining gassing reliability and the combination of the components in the anode may provide for a significantly enhanced improvement in cell voltage and cell performance.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">As a point of reference, a size 13 cell has outer dimensions of about 8.0 mm in diameter and about 5.4 mm in height, while a size 312 cell has outer dimensions of about 8.0 mm in diameter and about 3.6 mm in height. These are nominal dimensions and typical actual dimensions are 0 to 0.2 mm smaller than the nominal. The external volume is calculated here, and shown in Table 1 below, as if the cell were a cylinder at nominal dimensions, although the actual cell volumes may be slightly less both due to deviations in actual dimensions for each cell produced, and to one end of the cell incorporating a notch to prevent backwards insertion of such small devices. Electrode interfacial areas are calculated based on the diameter of the hole through the insulator (6.7 mm) on the inside of the cell.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="259pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Illustrative Cell dimensions for new invention</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="6"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="56pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="56pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>Insulator</entry><entry>Nominal</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Nominal</entry><entry>Nominal</entry><entry>Nominal</entry><entry>through hole</entry><entry>electrode</entry></row><row><entry>Cell</entry><entry>Diameter</entry><entry>Height</entry><entry>external</entry><entry>inside</entry><entry>interfacial</entry></row><row><entry>Size</entry><entry>(mm)</entry><entry>(mm)</entry><entry>volume (mm<sup>3</sup>)</entry><entry>diameter (mm)</entry><entry>area (mm<sup>2</sup>)</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="6" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>312</entry><entry>8.0</entry><entry>3.6</entry><entry>180</entry><entry>6.706</entry><entry>35.32</entry></row><row><entry>&#x2002;13</entry><entry>8.0</entry><entry>5.4</entry><entry>270</entry><entry>6.725</entry><entry>35.52</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="6" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>Typical cell</entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>limiting</entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>current at</entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>1.15 V for</entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>invention</entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>(mA) [called</entry><entry>Cell limiting</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>Typical cell</entry><entry>current</entry><entry>current at 1.15</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Vent area/</entry><entry>limiting current</entry><entry>density for</entry><entry>V/ cell</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Vent area</entry><entry>interfacial</entry><entry>at 0.9 V for</entry><entry>internal</entry><entry>limiting current</entry></row><row><entry>Size</entry><entry>(mm<sup>2</sup>)</entry><entry>area</entry><entry>invention (mA)</entry><entry>testing]</entry><entry>at 0.9 V</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="6" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>312</entry><entry>0.0660</entry><entry>1.87 &#xd7; 10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup></entry><entry>12</entry><entry>10</entry><entry>0.833</entry></row><row><entry>&#x2002;13</entry><entry>0.0998</entry><entry>2.81 &#xd7; 10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup></entry><entry>13</entry><entry>10</entry><entry>0.769</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="6" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0047" num="0045">As noted above, the dimensions provided are approximate, and they may range from their nominal values to their actual values. Accordingly, we note that the external volumes that may be calculated may range for a cell from about 150 mm<sup>3 </sup>to about 300 mm<sup>3</sup>. Further, the interfacial areas of some cells may vary for a number of reasons including variation in exact thickness of the cell housing, the actual diameter of the cell insulators, and the like. Thus, the interfacial area may range from about 25 mm<sup>2 </sup>to about 50 mm<sup>2</sup>. More broadly, interfacial area of similar format cells range from 15 to 75 mm<sup>2</sup>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0046">The cell limiting current of the cells at 1.15 V is dependent upon the cell design. The design factors that affect this element include but are not limited to the vent area of the cell, the diffusion layer porosity between the air access ports and the cathode active layer, and the electrolyte and anode elements. Ultimately, these design elements will affect the ability of the cell to access and utilize oxygen efficiently. Thus, the ratio of limiting current at 1.15 V to vent area will provide a measure of those abilities no matter the size of the cell. According to various embodiments, a cell may be provided in which a ratio of limiting current at 1.15 V to vent area is greater than 100 mA/mm<sup>2</sup>. In some embodiments, this ratio may be greater than about 150 mA/mm<sup>2</sup>, greater than 200 mA/mm<sup>2</sup>, greater than 210 mA/mm<sup>2</sup>, or greater than 250 mA/mm<sup>2</sup>. In other embodiments, this ratio may be from about 10 mA/mm<sup>2 </sup>to about 1000 mA/mm<sup>2</sup>, from about 80 mA/mm<sup>2 </sup>to about 500 mA/mm<sup>2</sup>, from about 70 mA/mm<sup>2 </sup>to about 300 mA/mm<sup>2</sup>, from about 70 mA/mm<sup>2 </sup>to about 220 mA/mm<sup>2</sup>, or from about 100 mA/mm<sup>2 </sup>to about 200 mA/mm<sup>2</sup>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0047">Another measure of electrode capacity is found in the relationship between the vent area and the interfacial area, the area between the anode and cathode. The ratio of these values provides a measure of the relative area of the air access ports that allow air access to the cathode, as compared to the amount of electrode interface that couples the activity of the cathode to the electrolyte and anode electrochemical reaction. Without being bound by theory, the ratio of vent area to interfacial area indicates the relative kinetic properties of the transport of oxygen into the cell vs. the activation and transport of the oxygen and incorporation into the electrolyte for use with the anode, as dictated by the properties of the triple phase boundary at the cathode-anode interface. The interfacial area is a rough estimate of the amount of triple phase boundary required, assuming volume, tortuosity and wettability are constant. If the vent area required is small, less oxygen enters the cell and less is available for conversion to hydroxyl groups and oxygen ions in the electrolyte. The assumption is that the overpotential for the reaction on the anode must therefore be smaller as less excess reactant is required in the electrolyte. Alternatively, there could be a higher activity at the cathode sites to convert into reactants in the electrolyte. The ratio of vent area to interfacial area may be about 1.0&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;4 </sup>or greater, or about 1.0&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;4 </sup>or greater. The ratio of vent area to interfacial area may be from about 1.0&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;4 </sup>to about 3.0&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>. The ratio of vent area to interfacial area may be from about 1.0&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>to about 3.0&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>. In various embodiments, the ratio of vent area to interfacial area may be from about 1.0&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>to about 3.0&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>, from about 1.0&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>to about 2.4&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>, or from about 1.4&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>to about 3.0&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0048">Further measures of cell activity and stability may be found by measuring the ratio of cell limiting current at 1.15 V to cell limiting current at 0.9 V. The cell limiting current at 1.15 V represents the maximum current that can be generated by the cell at 1.15 V, which is a reasonable voltage in the operating window of a hearing aid device. The cell limiting current at 0.9 V represents the maximum current at the lowest reasonable operating voltage this battery should see. The 0.9 V cell limiting voltage represents kinetic phenomenon far from equilibrium. B y studying the ratio of these two values, it is possible observe that different rate limiting steps and mechanisms are at play at these two potentials as dictated by the battery design. According to various embodiments, a cell may be provided in which a ratio of cell limiting current at 1.15 V to cell limiting current at 0.9 V is greater about 0.6. In some embodiments, this ratio may be greater than about 0.7 or greater than 0.75. In other embodiments, this ratio may be from about 0.6 to 0.9.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0049">The cell limiting current at 0.9V also indicates the current the cell is able to provide when the current becomes limited by the availability of oxygen to the cathode. This current is &#x201c;limiting&#x201d; in two senses: one, because the current changes little with time after an initial approximately 30 seconds when the cell is held at 0.9V (the electrochemical definition), but also, second, because a further reduction in voltage below 0.9V results in little change in current due the position of this voltage on the cell's polarization curve. In the design of the cell for a specific application, choices are made in the size and number of air access ports, and the porosity of other layers of material that oxygen must diffuse through to reach the reaction site. The cell must have adequate limiting current to support the desired discharge current range of the cell when in use. However, if the limiting current at 0.9V is any higher than needed, the cell is adversely affected. This adverse effect is because moisture (H<sub>2</sub>O vapor) and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) have very similar diffusion characteristics through air access ports and membrane layers. Thus, higher limiting current at 0.9V serves as a proxy for more diffusion of water vapor and carbon dioxide. Diffusion of water vapor in or out of the cell will occur whenever the cell is not in an environment with equilibrium humidity, and will change the makeup of the cell and adversely affect its performance. Likewise, carbon dioxide is known to dissolve in the electrolyte, reduce ionic conductivity, and reduce the cell performance. Thus, it is desirable for the cell to have the lowest limiting current at 0.9V possible while supporting the desired discharge current rates.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0050">The limiting current measured at 1.15V, as referred to earlier, is an approximation of the highest usable constant current load for the cell, because this is measured at a working voltage for the cell. It is noteworthy that this measurement is only &#x201c;limiting&#x201d; in time, but it is sensitive to small changes in voltage, unlike the limiting current measured at 0.9V, because it is on a rather flat part of the polarization curve where small changes in voltage result in large changes in current. Therefore, a cell with a higher ratio of limiting current at 1.15V to limiting current at 0.9V is advantageous, because it can be designed to provide the same current under device working conditions as an ordinary cell, while having a lower limiting current at 0.9V, and, therefore, lower moisture and carbon dioxide transport.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0051">It has now been found that with the cells described herein, a continuous current may be provided while the cell has a lower limiting current at 0.9V, than previously required. A limiting current at 0.9V of only twice the continuous current is required. Thus, for 6 mA current, only 12 mA limiting current at 0.9V is required, and this cell provides superior results because of the reduction in moisture and carbon dioxide transport.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0052">The above rule could be modified depending on the voltage requirement and current pulse requirements of the application, but the general principle and differences in the designs still applies. For an ordinary cell, if a limiting current at 0.9V that is twice the maximum continuous current required is adequate, then with the invented cell, a limiting current at 0.9V of only 1.33 times the continuous current would be equally adequate. In this case, if the continuous current demanded is 9 mA, an ordinary cell would need to be designed with limiting current at 0.9V of 18 mA, but the invented cell could be designed with limiting current at 0.9V of 12 mA.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0053">In any embodiment herein, the amphoteric fluorosurfactant may include a short-chain perfluoro substituent, which cannot break down to perfluorooctanoic acid.

However, in any embodiment of the present disclosure, the battery of the present disclosure may be as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates that in cell <b>10</b> of the battery, the negative electrode contains the anode can assembly <b>22</b>, with an anode can <b>24</b> including an electrochemically reactive anode <b>26</b>, contained therein and an insulating gasket <b>60</b>. The anode can <b>24</b> has a base wall <b>28</b>, and circumferential downwardly-depending side wall <b>30</b>. Side walls <b>30</b> terminate in a circumferential can foot <b>36</b>. The base wall and side walls <b>30</b> generally define the anode cavity <b>38</b> within the anode can <b>24</b>, which cavity contains the anode <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0057">The anode can <b>24</b> may include an alloy of copper, which includes copper and metals such as aluminum, silicon, cobalt, tin, chromium, zinc, and mixtures of any two or more thereof. For example, in any embodiment disclosed herein, the entire anode can <b>24</b> may include an alloy of copper.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0058">The cathode <b>42</b> comprises the area from below the separator <b>74</b> to the cathode can <b>44</b>. This cathode <b>42</b> area includes the porous diffusion layer <b>57</b>, the cellulose air diffusion layer and the cathode active layer <b>72</b>. Cathode can <b>44</b> has a bottom <b>46</b>, and a circumferential upstanding side wall <b>47</b>. Bottom <b>46</b> has a generally flat inner surface <b>48</b>, a generally flat outer surface <b>50</b>, and an outer perimeter <b>52</b> defined on the flat outer surface <b>50</b>. A plurality of air access ports <b>54</b> extend through the bottom <b>46</b> of the cathode can <b>44</b>, providing avenues for traverse of oxygen through the bottom <b>46</b> into the adjacent cathode can assembly <b>40</b>. An air reservoir <b>55</b> spaces the cathode can assembly <b>40</b> from bottom <b>46</b> and the corresponding air access ports <b>54</b>. A porous diffusion layer <b>57</b> and a cellulose air diffusion layer <b>32</b> fill the air reservoir <b>55</b>. Side wall <b>47</b> of the cathode can has an inner surface <b>56</b> and an outer surface <b>58</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0059">As noted above, the air access ports <b>54</b> define the vent areas through which oxygen may pass into the cell forming a voltaic cell with zinc generating an electric current. In accordance with the surprising observations described herein, when an amphoteric fluorosurfactant is used in the electrolyte of the batteries of the present technology, the minimum required total vent area defined by the air access ports <b>54</b> was found to be surprisingly low. As discussed earlier, where the metal-air battery is a size 13 cell the total vent area defined by all of the air access ports in the housing is from about 0.05 mm<sup>2 </sup>to about 0.1995 mm<sup>2</sup>. Thus, in any embodiment disclosed herein of a size 13 cell, the total vent area defined by all of the air access ports may be from about 0.05 mm<sup>2 </sup>to about 0.10 mm<sup>2</sup>, from about 0.06 mm<sup>2 </sup>to about 0.095 mm<sup>2</sup>, from about 0.06 mm<sup>2 </sup>to about 0.085 mm<sup>2</sup>, from about 0.07 mm<sup>2 </sup>to about 0.09 mm<sup>2</sup>, or from about 0.08 mm<sup>2 </sup>to about 0.085 mm<sup>2</sup>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0060">The anode can assembly <b>22</b> is electrically insulated from the cathode can assembly <b>40</b> by an insulating gasket <b>60</b>. Insulating gasket <b>60</b> includes a circumferential side wall <b>62</b> disposed between the upstanding side wall <b>47</b> of the cathode can and the downwardly-depending side wall <b>30</b> of the anode can. An insulating gasket foot <b>64</b> is disposed generally between the can foot <b>36</b> of the anode can and the cathode can assembly <b>40</b>. An insulating gasket top <b>66</b> is positioned at the locus where the side wall <b>62</b> of insulating gasket <b>60</b> extends from between the side walls <b>30</b> and <b>47</b> adjacent the top of the cell.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0061">The outer surface <b>68</b> of the cell <b>10</b> is thus defined by portions of the outer surface of the top of the anode can <b>24</b>, outer surface <b>58</b> of the side wall <b>47</b> of the cathode can <b>44</b>, outer surface <b>50</b> of the bottom of the cathode can <b>44</b>, and the top <b>66</b> of the insulating gasket <b>60</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0062">The insulating gasket <b>60</b> performs at least two primary functions. First, the insulating gasket <b>60</b> serves as a closure for the cell <b>10</b>, to prevent anode <b>26</b> and/or electrolyte from leaking from the cell between the outer surface of the side wall of the anode can <b>30</b> and the inner surface <b>56</b> of the side wall of the cathode can <b>47</b>. Thus, the insulating gasket <b>60</b> must possess adequate liquid sealing properties to prevent such leakage. Generally, such properties are available in a variety of resiliently deformable thermoplastic polymeric materials.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0063">Second, the insulating gasket <b>60</b> provides electrical insulation, preventing all effective direct electrical contact between the anode can <b>24</b> and the cathode can <b>44</b>. Accordingly, the side wall <b>62</b> of the insulating gasket <b>60</b> must circumscribe, and provide electrical insulation properties about, the entirety of the circumference of the battery between outer surface and inner surface <b>56</b>, generally from the top of side wall <b>47</b> to the bottom of side wall <b>30</b>. Similarly, the foot <b>64</b> of the insulating gasket <b>60</b> must circumscribe, and provide electrical insulation properties about, the entirety of the circumference of the cell between foot <b>36</b> of side wall <b>30</b>, the lower portion of side wall <b>47</b>, and the outer perimeter portion of the cathode can assembly <b>40</b>. The combination of good liquid sealing properties and good electrical insulation properties is typically achieved by molding known battery-grade nylon polymeric material in the desired configuration.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0064">In order to meet the electrical insulation requirements, the insulating gasket <b>60</b> may have good dielectric insulation properties, may have a minimum thickness about side wall <b>62</b>, and may be free of any pinholes or other imperfections that might permit transmission of electric current between side walls <b>30</b> and <b>47</b>. Thickness for the insulating gasket side wall <b>62</b> of about 200 to about 250 microns are common in conventional electrochemical cells. Thickness as thin as 100 microns are found in higher-performing cells and are acceptable for cells of the disclosure, using the same resiliently deformable thermoplastic nylon material as the thicker insulating gaskets of the conventional art</p><p id="p-0069" num="0065">Depending on the structure of the battery to which the insulating gasket is to be applied, intermediate thicknesses such as, e.g., 150 microns, 140 microns, 127 microns, or the like, may be selected for some cells. However, where cell volume efficiency is a driving consideration, preferred thicknesses are less, for example 120 microns or 110 microns to as thin as 100 microns. Thus, the range of thicknesses for insulating gaskets <b>60</b> preferred for use in cells <b>10</b> of the disclosure has a lower end of about 100 microns. Other methods of insulation, potentially with still thinner insulating materials, are possible and are not incompatible with the material disclosed here.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0066">It should be noted that in this design, the inside diameter of the insulator defines the approximate usable interfacial area between the anode and cathode. However, in other cell designs, a different component may control the interfacial area, and yet the concept of interfacial area is equally important in that case.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0067">In any embodiment disclosed herein, it may be porous diffusion layer <b>57</b> is a micro-porous hydrophobic polymeric material such as a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane about 25 to about 100 microns thick, which permits passage of air therethrough and which is generally impervious to battery electrolyte. For example, the porous diffusion layer <b>57</b> is Teflon&#x2122;. In any embodiment disclosed herein, it may be porous diffusion layer <b>57</b>, in combination with the air access ports <b>54</b>, is used to efficiently transport oxygen to the active reaction surface area of the cathode assembly.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0068">The cellulose air diffusion layer <b>32</b> may be located underneath the porous diffusion layer <b>57</b> and act as a protective lateral air diffusion layer. Specifically, when the cell is activated, the anode can assembly <b>22</b> presses down on the separator <b>74</b> and the cellulose air diffusion layer <b>32</b> helps to protect the air access ports <b>54</b> from being completely covered.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0069">Active layer <b>72</b> may further include a connecting substratum, such as a conductive woven nickel wire layer (not shown), capable of interfacing, as a current collector, with the cathode can. In any embodiment disclosed herein, carbon may form a matrix surrounding the conductive layer of nickel wire. Nickel may be used for the conductive layer because nickel exhibits little or no corrosion in the environment of the zinc air cell, and also because nickel is an excellent electrical conductor. In any embodiment disclosed herein, the thickness of the cathode assembly between the separator <b>74</b> and the porous diffusion layer <b>57</b> may be as small as possible.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0070">The aqueous electrolyte for the metal-air batteries of the present technology may include a base, such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH), potassium hydroxide (KOH), or a combination thereof.

The cell is configured such that air enters the cell through air access ports <b>54</b> prior to contacting the diffusion layer <b>32</b>. Accordingly, the carbon dioxide scrubbing agent may be applied to an interior surface of the cell, within the air reservoir <b>55</b>, to remove or at least mitigate carbon dioxide as it enters the cell through the air access ports <b>54</b>. The scrubbing agent may also be embedded within or deposited on any of the cellulose air diffusion layer <b>32</b>, the cathode <b>42</b>, or the porous diffusion layer <b>57</b>. The scrubbing agent may be deposited as a powder, as a film by applying it through a solvent that is later removed, or by other practical means.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0090">In any embodiment disclosed herein, the carbon dioxide scrubbing agents may be added to the alkaline electrolyte. In such embodiments, the scrubbing agents are selected such that the material reactions with carbon dioxide first, while preserving the NaOH or KOH that is present in the electrolyte. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that as CO<sub>2 </sub>enters a zinc-air cell, the CO<sub>2 </sub>can dissolve in the aqueous electrolyte, thereby forming carbonic acid. The carbonic acid may then react with the scrubber prior to reaction with the NaOH or KOH present in the electrolyte, such that the desired alkalinity of the electrolyte is maintained.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0091">In any embodiment disclosed herein, a carbon dioxide scrubbing agent may be included in packaging that contains a hearing aid cell (according to the present technology) to minimize storage damage due to carbon dioxide exposure, prior to use of the cell. For example, the packaging may contain a chamber which is intended for holding a zinc-air cell, such as a hearing aid battery, for storage or sale. The packaging may include any of the carbon dioxide scrubbing agents as powders, coatings on the packaging materials, or embedded within the plastics or papers that make up the packaging and chamber forming materials.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0092">The anode includes an anode active material, and an anode can assembly may surround the anode active material. In any embodiment disclosed herein, the anode active material may include zinc and the anode referred to as a &#x201c;zinc anode.&#x201d; In this regard, it is to be noted that, as used herein, anode &#x201c;active material&#x201d; may refer to a single chemical compound that is part of the discharge reaction at the anode of a cell and contributes to the cell discharge capacity, including impurities and small amounts of other moieties that may be present therein. Anode &#x201c;active material&#x201d; does not include current collectors, electrode leads, etc., that may contain or support the zinc active material.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0093">Physical modifications to the anode may also improve cell service life, either alone or in combination with chemical modifications noted above. For example, one can efficiently discharge cells having an advantageously lower concentration of hydroxide ions in the electrolyte than can be used in conventional cells by reducing diffusion resistance for the hydroxide ions. This can be accomplished, for example, by adjusting the zinc particle size distribution to provide in the anode a narrow distribution of similar zinc particle sizes, thereby enhancing porosity (diffusion paths) for the hydroxide ions. In addition to improving diffusion properties, the particle size distributions of this disclosure also provide the porosity sites for the precipitation of ZnO, thereby delaying anode passivation. This approach is effective for use in the anodes of zinc air battery cells and can be used in combination with other improvements disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0094">Suitable zinc particle size distribution is one in which at least 70% of the particles have a standard mesh-sieved particle size within a 100 micron size range and in which the mode of the distribution is between about 100 and about 300 microns. A suitable zinc particle size distribution includes particle size distributions meeting the above-noted tests and having a mode of about 100 microns, about 150 microns, or about 200 microns. In any embodiment disclosed herein, it may be about 70% of the particles are distributed in a size distribution range narrower than about 100 microns, for example about 50 microns, or about 40 microns, or less.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0095">The positive electrode may include a cathode can assembly <b>40</b>, which includes a cathode can <b>44</b> and the cathode <b>42</b>. An exemplary embodiment of the cathode <b>42</b> is best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. An active layer <b>72</b> of the cathode <b>42</b> is interposed between the separator <b>74</b> and the porous diffusion layer <b>57</b>. Active layer <b>72</b> ranges preferably between about 50 microns and about 1,250 microns thick, and facilitates the reaction between the hydroxyl ions in the electrolyte and the cathodic oxygen of the air. The separator <b>74</b> may include or consist of one or both of a micro-porous plastic membrane and a micro-porous cellulosic paper. The micro-porous plastic membrane is about 25 microns thick and typically composed of polypropylene. The paper material is 70-90 microns thick with a basis weight of 20 to 25 g/m<sup>2</sup>, and typically composed of polyvinyl alcohol and cellulosic material. The separator has the primary function of preventing anodic zinc particles from coming into physical contact with the remaining elements of the cathode <b>42</b>. The separator <b>74</b> however, does permit passage of hydroxyl ions and water therethrough to the cathode assembly. Here, the cathode is an air cathode and the cathode active layer includes carbon.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0096">The side wall <b>47</b> of the cathode can <b>44</b> is joined to the bottom <b>46</b> of the can by intermediate element <b>80</b>.

The inner surface, if any, of the intermediate element <b>80</b> is represented at the joinder of the inner surface <b>48</b> of the bottom <b>46</b> and the inner surface <b>56</b> of the side wall <b>47</b>. The inner surfaces <b>48</b> and <b>56</b> may come together at a sharp corner, such that the inner surface of the intermediate element is of nominal dimension. To the extent the corner material is worked in forming the corner, the corner may be work hardened, whereby the corner structure is strengthened with respect to bottom <b>46</b> and side wall <b>47</b> as the corner structure is formed at intermediate element <b>80</b>.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0097">In any embodiment disclosed herein, the can/housing may be formed entirely of a metal or alloy having a hydrogen overvoltage similar to that of the cathode (as opposed to plating or cladding the can) so long as sufficient strength and ductility are available from the material selected. Materials in addition to nickel, having such hydrogen overvoltage properties, include, for example and without limitation, cobalt and gold. In some embodiments, such materials may be coated as one or more coating layers onto the core layer by, for example, plating, cladding, or other application processes. The materials which provide sufficient strength and ductility may also be used as single layer materials in place of the composite structure. Single layer materials comprehend CRS or other suitable material as a core layer.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0098">In any embodiment disclosed herein, a steel strip plated with nickel and nickel alloy may be used because of cost considerations, and because pre-plated steel strip, which generally requires no post-plating processes, is commercially available. The metal in the can/housing is preferably both ductile enough to withstand the drawing process, and strong and rigid enough, to tolerate and otherwise withstand cell crimping and closure processes as well as to provide primary overall structural strength to the cell/battery.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0099">In any embodiment disclosed herein, the housing may be include nickel-clad stainless steel; cold-rolled steel plated with nickel; INCONEL&#xae; (a non-magnetic alloy of nickel); pure nickel with minor alloying elements (e.g. Nickel 200 and related family of Nickel 200 alloys such as Nickel 201, etc.), all available from Huntington Alloys, or DURANICKEL&#xae; 301, available from Special Metals. For example, the housing may be made of nickel-plated stainless steel. Some noble metals may also find use as plating, cladding, or other coating for can/housing metals, including covering steel strip plated with nickel, and mild steel strip subsequently plated with nickel after fabricating the can.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0100">Where multiple layers are used (e.g., CRS) coated on opposing sides with nickel, the present disclosure contemplates optional additional (e.g. fourth, fifth, etc.) layers, either between the nickel and CRS, or with a nickel layer between the CRS and the additional layer(s). For example, gold, cobalt, or other excellent electrical conductor can be deposited on some or all of the outer surface of the cathode can (outside the nickel layer) after the can is drawn, or drawn and ironed. As an alternative, such fourth etc. layer can be, for example, a bond-enhancing layer between the CRS and the nickel.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0101">Where the can/housing is fabricated using a typical raw material structure of nickel/stainless steel (SST)/nickel/NI/SST/NI as the sheet structure, such sheet structure may be from about 0.05 mm to about 0.3 mm.

To further illustrate the contributions of the electrolyte itself to the performance of the batteries of the present technology, three aqueous electrolytes were generated and assessed as follows. The three electrolytes were:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0108">(1) an aqueous electrolyte including 33% potassium hydroxide (by weight of the electrolyte) and 2% zinc oxide (by weight of the electrolyte);</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0109">(2) an aqueous electrolyte including 33% potassium hydroxide (by weight of the electrolyte), 2% zinc oxide (by weight of the electrolyte), and 7,500 ppm of a carboxylated amine surfactant; and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0110">(3) an aqueous electrolyte of the present technology, including 33% potassium hydroxide (by weight of the electrolyte), 2% zinc oxide (by weight of the electrolyte), and 10,000 ppm of an amphoteric fluorosurfactant.<br/>Cathode performance resulting from use of an electrolyte was tested independently from anode performance by placing a pure zinc reference electrode in the solution close to the cathode (note: the same distance from the cathode was used for all tests), where the cathode had unlimited air access on one side and was exposed to the electrolyte on the other side (&#x201c;cathode half cell&#x201d;). Subsequently, a current draw of 1 mA/cm<sup>2 </sup>and 5 mA/cm<sup>2 </sup>were applied to the cathode and the potential versus the pure zinc reference was recorded for each electrolyte described above. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the aqueous electrolyte of the present technology (3) exhibited improved behavior with less voltage drop with the same current draw over aqueous electrolytes (1) and (2).</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0116" num="0111">Example 6. To further illustrate the difference between the present technology and prior art, a large number of size 13 cells of each type were tested for limiting current at 1.15V and 0.9V. It is observed that the ratio of limiting current at 1.15V to limiting current at 0.9V is greater for the present technology than for commercial cells. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates the ratio for both cell types. To examine in further detail, the limiting current at 1.15V was plotted against limiting current at 0.9V for multiple cells of each type. It is observed that both limiting currents vary from cell to cell, but are correlated with each other, having a relatively constant ratio that is a characteristic of the present technology vs. commercial cells.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0112">Example 7. Size 13 cells were discharged at constant current, shown in FIG. 8. The cell of the present technology has limiting current at 0.9V of 12 mA. When discharged at a rate of 4 mA, or one-third of the limiting current at 0.9V, it provides a voltage greater than 1.2V through the majority of the discharge. This is particularly important since many practical devices send &#x201c;low battery&#x201d; warnings to the user when the voltage drops below about 1.1V.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0113">When the cell of the present technology is discharged at 6 mA, or half of the limiting current at 0.9V, it is still able to provide voltage greater than 1.17V through the first half of discharge.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0114">By comparison, a commercially available cell with limiting current at 0.9V of 18 mA, discharged at 6 mA, is reflecting a current drain equal to one-third of the limiting current at 0.9V. It provides lower voltage than the present technology. In addition, the higher limiting current will lead to more moisture and carbon dioxide transport, affecting the cell negatively, particularly in lower-rate conditions in which the time of discharge is longer.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0115">Example 8.
