The invention is in particular intended to be fitted at a front end of said vehicle so as to facilitate or, conversely, to shut off the passage for an air flow into a cooling module arranged inside the motor vehicle. The air flow is more specifically intended to circulate inside one or more heat exchangers provided inside said cooling module.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is common practice to use such an air inlet shut-off device to reduce the drag coefficient, and also to improve cooling and air-conditioning performance in a motor vehicle. Such a shut-off device can for example comprise at least one curtain that can move between a closed position in which it shuts off a passage opening for the air flow and an open position in which the air flow is able to circulate through this same passage opening. Such a device is usually known as an ACS (Active Curtain Shutter).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The ACS is preferably installed in a grille of the motor vehicle. With the curtain in the open position, air can circulate through the grille and help in particular to cool the engine of the motor vehicle. With the curtain in the closed position, air does not enter via the grille, which reduces drag and thus makes it possible to reduce fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. The ACS thus makes it possible to reduce energy consumption and contamination when the engine does not need to be cooled by exterior air.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The curtain of an ACS is generally flexible, which means that it can be stowed compactly by rolling it up on itself around a roller shaft when it takes up its open position. The roller shaft is generally secured along one of the sides of the passage opening of the ACS and connected to a drive device so as to roll up the curtain around said roller shaft to bring it into the open position and so as to unroll the curtain to bring it into the closed position.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">If the drive device breaks down or becomes jammed, the curtain can get stuck in its closed position, but the curtain getting stuck in this position can limit the circulation of the air flow and have a negative impact on the performance of the heat exchangers inside the cooling module.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The aim of the present invention is therefore to at least partially overcome the drawbacks encountered in the prior art and to propose an improved ACS that makes it possible to bring the curtain into its open position even in the event of failure of the drive device.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention therefore relates to an air inlet shut-off device for a motor vehicle, the shut-off device comprising a support frame including a first and a second crosspiece that are parallel to one another and connected by lateral uprights so as to define at least one passage opening for an incoming air flow, said device including at least one curtain that can move between a closed position in which the curtain at least partially covers the passage opening and an open position in which said curtain allows the incoming air flow to pass through the passage opening, said curtain including an edge secured to a roller shaft extending on the support frame along one of the sides of the passage opening, the roller shaft being connected to a drive device so as to roll up the curtain around said roller shaft to bring it into the open position and so as to unroll the curtain to bring it into the closed position, the shut-off device being characterized in that it further comprises an automatic return system for the curtain which includes:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0009">an elastic element which is elastic in elongation along the rolling axis of the roller shaft, said elastic element being secured at a first of its ends to the roller shaft in such a way as to be rotated by said roller shaft and vice versa,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0010">a cylindrical slider intended to move in translation along the rolling axis of the roller shaft and in rotation about this same axis, said slider being secured to a second end of the elastic element in such a way as to be rotated indirectly by the roller shaft and vice versa, said slider also including a helical groove on its outer surface, the support frame including a fixed finger configured to be inserted in the helical groove on the slider.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0010" num="0011">By virtue of the elastic energy stored in the elastic element of the curtain return system when the curtain goes from the open position to the closed position, and by virtue of the kinematics of the slider indirectly connected to the roller shaft via the elastic element, it is possible rotate the roller shaft via the automatic return system so as to force the curtain to take up its open position to allow the air flow to circulate through the passage opening, even if the drive device is not working. The automatic return system thus makes it possible to bring the curtain back into its open position in order to free the passage opening through the frame of the device, thus allowing the air flow to circulate inside the cooling module comprising one or more heat exchangers, thereby preventing the engine of the motor vehicle from heating up too much.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0012">The invention can further comprise one or more of the following aspects taken alone or in combination:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0013">the elastic element of the automatic return system for the curtain is a spring having turns helically wound around the rolling axis of the roller shaft;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0014">the elastic element is a traction spring;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0015">the cylindrical slider has, at its end connected to the elastic element, a wall forming a housing space intended to receive at least some of the turns of the elastic element;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0016">endings of the helical groove on the outer face of the cylindrical slider form stops configured to come into contact with the fixed finger of the support frame so as to define the terminal positions of the slider in its translational movement along its axis of movement;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0005" num="0017">the device includes a central pin arranged inside the hollow end of the roller shaft such that it projects from said end;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0006" num="0018">the central pin is configured to move in translation inside the hollow end of the roller shaft along the rolling axis;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0007" num="0019">the slider is rigidly secured to the central pin;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0008" num="0020">one end of the roller shaft has a shoulder;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0009" num="0021">the cylindrical slider and the elastic element are positioned coaxially to this shoulder so as to be movable in translation on this shoulder along the rolling axis; and</li>        <li id="ul0004-0010" num="0022">a linear ball bearing is interposed between the shoulder at the end of the roller shaft and the cylindrical slider.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0023">Note that all of the features and configurations described above are purely examples.

The air flow F flows substantially parallel to a direction X which corresponds to the longitudinal axis of the motor vehicle <b>1</b>. The air inlet shut-off device <b>10</b> is in particular arranged behind a grille <b>3</b> fitted at the front end of the motor vehicle <b>1</b>. A cooling module <b>5</b> which includes at least one heat exchanger <b>7</b>, <b>9</b> through which the air flow F is intended to pass as it enters the motor vehicle <b>1</b> via the grille <b>3</b>, is also placed behind the grille. The heat exchanger or exchangers <b>7</b>, <b>9</b> extend in planes parallel to those generated by the directions Y and Z of the trihedron XYZ. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the cooling module <b>5</b> includes more specifically two heat exchangers <b>7</b> and <b>9</b> which are arranged on either side of the shut-off device <b>10</b> along the axis X.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0035">The cooling module <b>5</b> comprises for example an upstream heat exchanger <b>7</b> (left-hand side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), upstream relative to the direction of circulation of the air flow F, and a downstream heat exchanger <b>9</b> (right-hand side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) arranged in series along the longitudinal axis X of the motor vehicle <b>1</b>. In this particular arrangement, it is the upstream heat exchanger <b>7</b> through which the air flow F passes first, and the downstream heat exchanger <b>9</b> second.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0036">The upstream heat exchanger <b>7</b> is for example a cooling radiator, referred to as a low-temperature cooling radiator, which acts to cool a coolant in a heat exchange loop, referred to as a low-temperature loop, and comprising in particular an air-conditioning condenser and/or a charge air cooler. The downstream heat exchanger <b>9</b> is, for example, a high-temperature cooling radiator intended to cool a coolant in a heat exchange loop comprising an engine of the vehicle. The air that passes through this downstream exchanger <b>9</b> cools the engine coolant.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0037">As shown for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>b</i></figref>, the air inlet shut-off device <b>10</b> comprises a support frame <b>13</b> configured to support a curtain <b>15</b>. The support frame <b>13</b> includes more specifically a first crosspiece <b>17</b> and a second crosspiece <b>19</b> opposite the first crosspiece <b>17</b>. The first crosspiece <b>17</b> and the second crosspiece <b>19</b> are parallel to one another and oriented substantially horizontally across the width of the vehicle. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>b</i></figref>, the first crosspiece <b>17</b> and the second crosspiece <b>19</b> are oriented in the direction Y.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0038">The support frame <b>13</b> further comprises two lateral uprights <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> which extend between the ends of the first crosspiece <b>17</b> and the second crosspiece <b>19</b> of the support frame <b>13</b> so as to define at least one passage opening intended to be taken by the air flow F passing through the grille <b>3</b> at the front end of the motor vehicle <b>1</b>. The two lateral uprights <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> are oriented substantially vertically in the direction Z.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0039">The support frame <b>13</b> of the air inlet shut-off device <b>10</b> is in particular rigid; it is for example made of plastic. The first and second crosspieces <b>17</b> and <b>19</b> and the lateral uprights <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> are in particular produced by injection molding. In order to improve the stiffness of said support frame <b>13</b> the latter can be molded as a single component.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0040">The support frame <b>13</b> supports a curtain <b>15</b> that can move between a closed position (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>b</i></figref>) in which the curtain <b>15</b> at least partially covers the passage opening defined by the extent of the support frame <b>13</b> and an open position (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>a</i></figref>) in which said curtain <b>15</b> allows the incoming air flow F to pass through the passage opening.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0041">The curtain <b>15</b> includes a first edge <b>31</b> secured to a first roller shaft <b>23</b> extending on the support frame <b>13</b> along one of the sides of the passage opening. The curtain <b>15</b> further includes a second edge <b>32</b> opposite its first edge <b>31</b>. The second edge <b>32</b> of the curtain <b>15</b> can be rigidly secured to a rod <b>34</b> which can in particular stiffen said second edge <b>32</b>. The ends of the rod <b>34</b> can moreover be positioned in rails arranged on the lateral uprights <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> of the frame <b>13</b>. The rod <b>34</b> thus makes it possible to hold the curtain <b>15</b> in place against the support frame <b>13</b> and to guide the curtain <b>15</b> in its movement between its open position and its closed position.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0042">The curtain <b>15</b> can in particular be obtained by cutting. It is for example made of a flexible material, such as a glass fiber-based cloth covered with an impermeable, water-repellent coating.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0043">The curtain <b>15</b> can in particular take the form of a rectangular or trapezoidal cloth. The dimensions of the curtain <b>15</b> overall correspond to the dimensions of the support frame <b>13</b>. The lengths of the first <b>31</b> and second <b>32</b> edges of the curtain <b>15</b> correspond approximately and respectively to the length of the first crosspiece <b>17</b> and to the length of the second crosspiece <b>19</b>. The gap between the first <b>31</b> and the second <b>32</b> edges of the curtain <b>15</b> is in particular greater than or equal to the distance separating the first <b>17</b> and the second <b>19</b> crosspiece in the direction of closure and opening of the curtain <b>15</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0044">In the embodiment of the shut-off device <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b><i>a</i>, <b>2</b><i>b </i></figref>and <b>3</b>, the first roller shaft <b>23</b> is arranged at the first crosspiece <b>17</b> of the support frame <b>13</b>. The first roller shaft <b>23</b> moreover extends parallel to the first crosspiece <b>17</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0045">The shut-off device <b>10</b> further comprises a second roller shaft <b>25</b> extending on the support frame <b>13</b>, along a side of the passage opening opposite to that bearing the first roller shaft <b>23</b>. The second roller shaft <b>25</b> is in particular arranged at the second crosspiece <b>19</b> of the support frame <b>13</b>. The second roller shaft <b>25</b> moreover extends parallel to the second crosspiece <b>19</b> of the support frame <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0046">The first <b>23</b> and the second <b>25</b> roller shafts are therefore parallel to one another. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b><i>a </i></figref>to <b>3</b>, the first roller shaft <b>23</b> is arranged above the second roller shaft <b>25</b>. In other words, the first roller shaft <b>23</b> is closer to the roof of the motor vehicle <b>1</b> while the second roller shaft <b>25</b> is closer to the base of the motor vehicle <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0047">The first <b>23</b> and the second <b>25</b> roller shafts are each connected to the support frame <b>13</b> by bearings <b>27</b> so as to be able to rotate about a rolling axis A<b>1</b>, A<b>2</b> belonging to each roller shaft <b>23</b> or <b>25</b>. These rolling axes A<b>1</b>, A<b>2</b> are preferably parallel to the first <b>17</b> and second <b>19</b> crosspieces of the support frame <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0048">The first roller shaft <b>23</b>, to which the first edge <b>31</b> of the curtain <b>15</b> is secured, is connected to a drive device <b>38</b> (visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b><i>a </i></figref>and <b>3</b>) so as to roll up the curtain <b>15</b> around said first roller shaft <b>23</b> in order to bring it into the open position and so as to unroll the curtain <b>15</b> in order to bring it into the closed position. This drive device <b>38</b> interacts for example with an electric actuator <b>39</b> secured to the support frame <b>13</b> and connected to the first roller shaft <b>23</b> by a gear system (visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0049">The shut-off device <b>10</b> further includes a transfer element <b>40</b> for transferring the rotation of the first roller shaft <b>23</b> to the second roller shaft <b>25</b>. According to a first embodiment of the transfer element <b>40</b> shown more specifically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, it can include a notched belt connecting the first roller shaft <b>23</b> and the second roller shaft <b>25</b>, passing via the tensioner pulleys <b>36</b> arranged on the support frame <b>13</b>. Thus, when the first roller shaft <b>23</b> is rotated by the drive device <b>38</b> under the effect of the actuator <b>39</b>, the notched belt of the transfer element <b>40</b> rotates the second roller shaft <b>25</b>. The notches on this type of belt limit the risk that the belt will slip on the roller shafts <b>23</b> and/or <b>25</b> or on the tensioner pulleys <b>36</b> when they are rotating. Such a belt fitted to the transfer element <b>40</b> is not very energy intensive and transmits the movement effectively without generating too much noise.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0050">According to a second embodiment (not shown) of the transfer element <b>40</b>, this can include at least one pinion arranged on each of the first and second roller shafts <b>23</b> and <b>25</b>. Said pinions are connected by a transmission chain such that when the first roller shaft <b>23</b> is rotated by the drive device <b>38</b>, the assembly formed by the pinions and the chain rotates the second roller shaft <b>25</b>. This embodiment advantageously differs from the above embodiment by its long lifetime.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0051">Thus, when the curtain <b>15</b> is rolled up around the first roller shaft <b>23</b>, this corresponds to its open position and the air flow F can circulate through the passage opening so as to reach the heat exchangers <b>7</b>, <b>9</b> of the cooling module <b>5</b> arranged behind the grille <b>3</b>. Rolling up the curtain <b>15</b> around the first roller shaft <b>23</b> with which it is associated makes it possible to stow it easily and compactly when it is in its open position.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0052">When the curtain <b>15</b> is unrolled (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>b</i></figref>), it extends between the first <b>17</b> and the second <b>19</b> crosspiece of the support frame <b>13</b> in the direction of closure and opening of the curtain <b>15</b>, thus obstructing the air flow F by blocking the passage opening. This then corresponds to its closed position.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0053">In the event of failure of the opening system which includes, inter alia, the drive device <b>38</b>, the actuator <b>39</b> and the transfer element <b>40</b> connecting the first and the second roller shafts <b>23</b>, <b>25</b>, the curtain <b>15</b> can get stuck in the closed position. Staying in the closed position can be detrimental as it limits the circulation of the air flow F in particular at low speeds of travel. This can result in less efficient cooling which can potentially lead to overheating.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0054">To overcome this drawback, the shut-off device <b>10</b> also includes an automatic return system <b>50</b> for the curtain <b>15</b> which is shown in detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b><i>a</i>, <b>4</b><i>b </i></figref>and <b>5</b>. This automatic return system <b>50</b> is in particular arranged between the support frame <b>13</b> and the roller shaft <b>23</b> and makes it possible to automatically open the curtain <b>15</b> if the opening system described above breaks down.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0055">This automatic return system <b>50</b> is more specifically arranged at one end of the roller shaft <b>23</b>. According to a particular embodiment of the shut-off device <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>b</i></figref>, the drive device <b>38</b> and the automatic return system <b>50</b> for the curtain <b>15</b> are arranged at opposite ends of the first roller shaft <b>23</b>, i.e. in the upper corners of the support frame <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0056">The automatic return system <b>50</b> includes, on the one hand, an elastic element <b>52</b> which is elastic in elongation along the rolling axis A<b>1</b> and, on the other hand, a cylindrical slider <b>58</b> intended to move in translation along the rolling axis A<b>1</b> of the roller shaft <b>23</b> and in rotation about this same axis A<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0057">The elastic element <b>52</b> and the slider <b>58</b> rotate as one with the first roller shaft <b>23</b>. Thus, when said shaft <b>23</b> turns about its rolling axis A<b>1</b>, the elastic element <b>52</b> and the slider <b>58</b> are also rotated about this axis A<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0058">The element <b>52</b> is &#x201c;elastic in elongation&#x201d; in the sense that it is deformable longitudinally along the rolling axis A<b>1</b> of the first roller shaft <b>23</b>. The elastic element <b>52</b> is more specifically configured to be stretched and possibly compressed along this rolling axis A<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0059">According to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b</i></figref>, the elastic element <b>52</b> can take the form of a spring having turns helically wound around the rolling axis A<b>1</b> of the roller shaft <b>23</b>. In this specific embodiment, the elastic element <b>52</b> resembles more specifically a traction spring. As well as being economical, this specific configuration of the elastic element <b>52</b> is notable for its relatively low weight and advantageous compactness inside the automatic return system <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0060">The elastic element <b>52</b> is arranged between an end of the roller shaft <b>23</b> and the slider <b>58</b>, it includes more specifically a first end <b>54</b> secured to the first roller shaft <b>23</b> and a second end <b>56</b> secured to the slider <b>58</b>. From the kinematic point of view, the elastic element <b>52</b> is secured by its first end <b>54</b> to the roller shaft <b>23</b> in such a way as to be rotated by said roller shaft <b>23</b> and vice versa. In other words, when the roller shaft <b>23</b> is rotated by the drive device <b>38</b>, the first end <b>54</b> of the elastic element <b>52</b> secured to the roller shaft <b>23</b> is itself also rotated about the rolling axis A<b>1</b>, thus causing the entire elastic element <b>52</b> to rotate about this same axis A<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0061">Since the second end <b>56</b> of the elastic element <b>52</b> is secured to the slider <b>58</b>, the latter is itself also rotated about the rolling axis A<b>1</b> when the elastic element <b>52</b> turns about the rolling axis A<b>1</b>. In other words, the slider <b>58</b> is secured to the second end <b>56</b> of the elastic element <b>52</b> in such a way as to be indirectly rotated by the roller shaft <b>23</b> and vice versa.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0062">The term &#x201c;vice versa&#x201d; in this case means that rotation about the rolling axis A<b>1</b> initiated by the slider <b>58</b> can also rotate both the elastic element <b>52</b> and the roller shaft <b>23</b> about this same axis A<b>1</b> in the absence of resistance to the movement from the drive device <b>38</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0063">The slider <b>58</b> is intended to move in translation along the rolling axis A<b>1</b> of the roller shaft <b>23</b> in addition to its rotation about this same axis A<b>1</b> caused indirectly by the roller shaft <b>23</b>. The slider <b>58</b> has a cylindrical shape and includes on its outer surface a helical groove <b>60</b> similar to a screw thread. In an area contiguous to the place where the slider <b>58</b> is arranged, the support frame <b>13</b> includes a fixed finger <b>70</b> configured to be inserted in the helical groove <b>60</b> made in the outer surface of the cylindrical slider <b>58</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0064">The helical groove <b>60</b> can have endings <b>61</b>, <b>62</b> which form stops configured to come into contact with the fixed finger <b>70</b> of the support frame <b>13</b> so as to define the terminal positions of the slider <b>58</b> in its translational movement along its axis of movement A<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0065">More specifically, when the curtain <b>15</b> is in the open position, an end of the fixed finger <b>70</b> is in contact with a first ending <b>61</b> of the helical groove <b>60</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>a</i></figref>. The slider <b>58</b> is then closest to the end of the roller shaft <b>23</b> and the elastic element <b>52</b> is compressed. In the case where the elastic element <b>52</b> is a helical spring, the turns of said spring are very close to one another.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0066">Conversely, when the curtain <b>15</b> is in the closed position, the end of the fixed finger <b>70</b> is in contact with a second ending <b>62</b> of the helical groove <b>60</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>b</i></figref>. The slider <b>58</b> is then closer to the lateral upright <b>21</b> of the support frame <b>13</b> than in its previous position and the elastic element <b>52</b> is stretched.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0067">The interaction between the fixed finger <b>70</b> and the helical groove <b>60</b> of the slider <b>58</b> imposes a coupling between the translational movement of the slider <b>58</b> along the rolling axis A<b>1</b> and the rotation of the slider <b>58</b> about this same axis A<b>1</b>. The distance travelled in translation by the slider <b>58</b> thus depends on the number of turns of the helical groove <b>60</b> on the outer surface of the slider <b>58</b> and on the gap between two neighboring turns of said groove <b>60</b>. More specifically, each rotation of the slider <b>58</b> about the rolling axis A<b>1</b> shifts the slider <b>58</b> in translation along this axis A<b>1</b> such that the fixed finger <b>70</b> of the support frame <b>13</b> is positioned in one of the turns neighboring the turn in which it was situated previously. This is more specifically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> in which the movement of the slider <b>58</b> is shown step by step from the moment when the fixed finger <b>70</b> is in contact with the ending <b>62</b> of the helical groove <b>60</b> (closed position of the curtain <b>15</b>) to the moment when the fixed finger <b>70</b> is in contact with the ending <b>61</b> of the helical groove <b>60</b> (open position of the curtain <b>15</b>).</p><p id="p-0057" num="0068">To prevent expansion of the diameter of the turns of the elastic element <b>52</b> in a radial direction, perpendicular to the rolling axis A<b>1</b>, the slider <b>58</b> can have, at its end connected to the elastic element <b>52</b>, a wall <b>53</b> forming a cylindrical housing space V intended to receive at least some of the turns of the elastic element <b>52</b>. The number of turns, their spacing and the cylindrical housing space V delimited by the wall <b>53</b> at the end of the slider <b>58</b> can be dimensioned such that all of the turns or at least some of the turns of the elastic element <b>52</b> compressed or at rest are inside said housing space V, as in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>a</i></figref>. The wall <b>53</b> forming the housing space V thus makes it possible to protect the elastic element <b>52</b> from any external contamination (water, dust, dirt, etc.). The wall <b>53</b> forming the housing space V also offers a compact arrangement of the components <b>52</b>, <b>58</b> of the automatic return system <b>50</b> of the curtain <b>15</b> inside the shut-off device <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0069">For further compactness, the end of the roller shaft <b>23</b> near which the automatic return system <b>50</b> for the curtain <b>15</b> is arranged can be hollow. The device <b>10</b> can thus include a central pin <b>26</b> arranged inside the hollow end of the roller shaft <b>23</b> such that the central pin <b>26</b> projects from said hollow end. This embodiment is more specifically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b><i>a</i>, <b>4</b><i>b </i></figref>and <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0070">In these same Figs., the central pin <b>26</b> is connected to the support frame <b>13</b> by a bearing <b>27</b> so as to be able to turn about the rolling axis A<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0071">The central pin <b>26</b> is configured to move in translation along the rolling axis A<b>1</b> inside the hollow end of the roller shaft <b>23</b>. The slider <b>58</b> is rigidly secured to this central pin <b>26</b> so as to move in translation with the latter. The central pin <b>26</b> thus allows effective guidance of the slider <b>58</b> relative to the roller shaft <b>23</b> during its movements in translation along the rolling axis A<b>1</b>. The central pin <b>26</b> moreover prevents the diameter of the turns of the elastic element <b>52</b> from narrowing in a radial direction, perpendicular to the rolling axis A<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0072">According to another embodiment (not shown) of the automatic return system <b>50</b> for the curtain <b>15</b>, the end of the roller shaft <b>23</b> near which said return system <b>50</b> is arranged has a shoulder. The cylindrical slider <b>58</b> and the elastic return element <b>52</b> are thus arranged on this shoulder so as to be movable on the surface of said shoulder along the rolling axis A<b>1</b>. In this particular embodiment, a linear ball bearing (non shown in the figures) can be interposed between the shoulder at the end of the roller shaft <b>23</b> and the slider <b>58</b> so as to allow precise guidance in straight translation of the slider <b>58</b> along the rolling axis A<b>1</b> as well as allowing rotation of the slider <b>58</b> about this same axis A<b>1</b>. This embodiment can make it possible to reduce friction between the parts in addition to increasing the load capacity in this connection.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0073">When the curtain <b>15</b> is unrolled from its open position to its closed position, the finger <b>70</b> interacts with the helical groove <b>60</b> on the surface of the slider <b>58</b>, which is rotated by the roller shaft <b>23</b> via the elastic element <b>52</b>. This interaction between the finger <b>70</b> and the helical groove <b>60</b> thus gives rise to a movement of the slider <b>58</b> in translation along the rolling axis A<b>1</b>, thereby causing elongation of the elastic element <b>52</b> along this same axis A<b>1</b>. During this movement, the first end <b>54</b> and the second end <b>56</b> of the elastic element <b>52</b> are moved away from one another. In the case where the elastic element <b>52</b> is a spring with turns wound around the rolling axis A<b>1</b>, these turns are thus apart from one another. The elastic element <b>52</b> thus accumulates elastic energy.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0074">If the drive device <b>38</b> should break down, the energy accumulated via the elastic element <b>52</b> can be released so as to cause a movement of the slider <b>58</b> which rotates the roller shaft <b>23</b> about the rolling axis A<b>1</b> so as to bring the curtain <b>15</b> into its open position. The interaction between the finger <b>70</b> and the helical groove <b>60</b> on the surface of the slider <b>58</b> moves the latter in translation and in rotation until the finger <b>70</b> is blocked in the ending <b>61</b> of the helical groove <b>60</b>. The curtain <b>15</b> is thus rolled up around the roller shaft <b>23</b> and frees the passage opening through the support frame <b>13</b>, thus allowing the air flow F to circulate through this opening. It is thus possible to bring the curtain <b>15</b> back into its open position without necessarily having to use the drive device <b>38</b>. The automatic return system <b>50</b> can in particular be of use in emergency situations.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
