Further, due to having this characteristic, in a case where it is used as an imaging element in a solid-state imaging apparatus, a structure of stacking subpixels (stacked-type imaging element) in which subpixels include a combination of an on-chip color filter (OCCF) layer and an imaging element, and are two-dimensionally arranged, which is not possible in a conventional solid-state imaging apparatus, can be obtained (e.g., see Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2011-138927). Furthermore, since a demosaicing process is not necessary, there is an advantage in that false colors do not occur. In the following description, an imaging element including a photoelectric conversion unit provided on or above a semiconductor substrate will be referred to as a &#x201c;first-type imaging element&#x201d; for the sake of convenience, a photoelectric conversion unit forming the first-type imaging element will be referred to as a &#x201c;first-type photoelectric conversion unit&#x201d; for the sake of convenience, an imaging element provided in the semiconductor substrate will be referred to as a &#x201c;second-type imaging element&#x201d; for the sake of convenience, and the photoelectric conversion unit forming the second-type imaging element will be referred to as a &#x201c;second-type photoelectric conversion unit&#x201d; for the sake of convenience.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>66</b></figref> shows a configuration example of a conventional stacked-type imaging element (stacked-type solid-state imaging apparatus).

Furthermore, a first photoelectric conversion unit <b>310</b>A which is a first-type photoelectric conversion unit is disposed above the semiconductor substrate <b>370</b> (specifically, above the second imaging element <b>341</b>).

Therefore, when light is emitted to the photoelectric conversion unit and is photoelectrically converted in the photoelectric conversion unit, charges can be stored in the photoelectric conversion layer. Therefore, at the start of exposure, it becomes possible to completely deplete the charge storage portion and remove charges. As a result, it is possible to suppress occurrence of a phenomenon in which kTC noise increases, random noise worsens, and degradation of the image quality is caused. In addition, the transfer control electrode disposed adjacent to the charge storage electrode and the first electrode through the insulating layer and disposed opposite to the photoelectric conversion layer through an insulating layer is further included. Therefore, when charges stored in the photoelectric conversion layer are transferred to the first electrode, high controllability can be attained. Since an area of the charge storage electrode does not decrease due to the disposition of the transfer control electrode, it is possible to suppress occurrence of a problem of an amount of saturated charges in the photoelectric conversion layer decreasing or sensitivity degrading. Further, the effects described in this specification are not limiting but are merely examples, and additional effects may be provided.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention"

Therefore, at the start of exposure, it becomes possible to completely deplete the charge storage portion and remove charges. As a result, it is possible to suppress occurrence of a phenomenon in which kTC noise increases, random noise worsens, and degradation of the image quality is caused.

In addition, since it is not necessary to decrease the area of the charge storage electrode in the disposition of the transfer control electrode, it is possible to suppress occurrence of the problem that an amount of saturated charges in the photoelectric conversion layer decreases or sensitivity degrades.</p><p id="p-0223" num="0290"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>64</b></figref> shows a conceptual diagram of a solid-state imaging apparatus of Embodiment 1.
