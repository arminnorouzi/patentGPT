Systems for tooth whitening have a mouthpiece, also termed a body, that sits around the teeth where homogenous illumination at a wavelength (&#x2dc;460 nm) and irradiance (25-100 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>) is directed onto the teeth, via direct illumination using LED arrays or waveguide illumination.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0005">Although blue light (400-495 nm) can be absorbed by staining molecules inside the teeth and improves the whitening results by facilitating the reaction between hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and staining molecules, it has been found that different users have different stain profiles for their teeth, and the tooth whitening results can be inconsistent and non-optimised.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0006">There is a need to address these issues.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0007">It would be advantageous to have improved means of teeth whitening. The object of the present invention is solved with the subject matter of the independent claims, wherein further embodiments are incorporated in the dependent claims. It should be noted that the following described aspects and examples of the invention apply also to the tooth whitening systems, the method of controlling a tooth whitening system, as well as to the computer program element and a computer readable medium.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0008">In a first aspect, there is provided tooth whitening system, comprising:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0009">a light source;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0010">a light detector; and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0011">a processing unit.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0011" num="0012">The light source is configured such that a wavelength of the light emitted is adjustable over a wavelength range of operation. The detector is configured to detect light emitted from the light source. The processing unit is configured to control the light source to adjust the wavelength of the light emitted by the light source and is configured to determine a measure of absorption for different wavelengths on the basis of the detected light for the different wavelengths. The processing unit is configured to utilize the determined measure of absorption to operate the light source at a wavelength at a peak in absorption.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0013">In other words, an adjustable incident light wavelength on the teeth is provided for higher whitening efficacy and consistency based on the feedback of the type of staining molecules inside the teeth.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0014">To put this another way, the processing unit is configured to control the light source to scan the wavelength of the light emitted over the wavelength range, and determine associated measures of absorption as the wavelength of the light emitted by the light source is scanned over the wavelength range, and then operate in a tooth whitening mode at the wavelength at the peak in absorption on the basis of the measures of absorption.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0015">In this manner, a tooth whitening system that uses light along with for example hydrogen peroxide can automatically operate at the correct wavelength for the stains that are present for a particular user, without having to know at what wavelength the system is operating. Also, once used and teeth have been whitened with respect to a specific stain further utilization of the system will automatically target the next most prevalent stain.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0016">Thus, the system can scan the wavelength of light emitted by the light source without knowing what that wavelength is, and then operate at the scan position associated with the peak in absorption to automatically target the most prevalent stain present.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0017">In an example, the processing unit is configured to control the light source to adjust the wavelength of the light emitted by the light source over the wavelength range of operation of at least 400-495 nm.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0018">In this manner, key teeth stains such as carotene, Tannins (coffee, tea), porphyrins, and fluoride stains can be targeted.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0019">In an example, the system comprises further at least one light source. The processing unit is configured to operate the further at least one light source at the wavelength at the peak in absorption on the basis of the measures of absorption.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0020">In other words, the system can scan the wavelength of light emitted by a first source without knowing what that wavelength is, and then operate the first light source at the scan position associated with the peak in absorption to automatically target the most prevalent stain present with that light source. However, that information can be used to operate further light sources at the same wavelength, again without knowing the wavelength. For example, the light sources can all be the same type and when driven in a particular manner are known to emit the same wavelength. Thus, the other light sources need only match their operational characteristics to the first light source to then operate at the same wavelength as the first light source and target the most prevalent stain present for a person's teeth. Thus, the further light source or sources could be placed at different places around the body to target different teeth to that targeted by the first light source. One of the further light sources could also be placed adjacent to the first light source to provide a simple manner of determining a peak in absorption with one light source, and then operating at a higher power through operation of more than one light source at that position. There could clearly be more than one light source at each position around the body to target specific teeth with a higher power available from one light source alone.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0021">In an example, the processing unit is configured to operate at a wavelength scan position associated with a maximum in determined measure of absorption.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0022">In an example, the processing unit is configured to operate at the wavelength at the peak in absorption comprising a comparison of the measures of absorption for the different wavelengths of the light emitted by the light source with one or more known absorption profiles of stain molecules.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0023">In other words, the absorption profile determined can be compared against known absorption spectra for different molecules to determine the stain type or combination of stain type (if multiple stains then percentages of stain types) facilitating the system to operate at the optimum wavelength.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0024">In an example, the light source is configured to operate over a range of light emission power. The processing unit is configured to control the light source to operate at an operational light power on the basis of the determined measure of absorption.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0025">Thus, the power of emitted light can be optimised in order to provide for effective tooth whitening.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0026">In an example, the processing unit is configured to control the light source to operate at the operational light power such that an intensity of light absorbed equals a required absorption intensity.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0027">In an example, the light source and detector are housed in a body such that when the body is placed adjacent to at least one of the user's teeth the source and detector are on opposites sides of the at least one of the users' teeth.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0028">In an example, the light source and detector are housed in a body such that when the body is placed adjacent to at least one of the user's teeth the source and detector are on the same side of the at least one of the users' teeth.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0029">In a second aspect, there is provided a tooth whitening system, comprising:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0030">a plurality of light sources;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0031">a plurality of light detectors; and</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0032">a processing unit.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0029" num="0033">Each light source is paired with a detector.

For each light source and detector pair the processing unit is configured to control each light source to adjust the wavelength of the light emitted by the light source and determine a measure of absorption for different wavelengths on the basis of the detected light for the different wavelengths. For each light source and detector pair the processing unit is configured to utilize the determined measure of absorption to operate the light source of each light source and detector pair at a wavelength at a peak in absorption.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0034">In this manner, different teeth that have different stains can be treated in a bespoke fashion to ensure that all the teeth are whitened effectively.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0035">To put this another way, the processing unit is configured to control the light source of a light source and detector pair to scan the wavelength of the light emitted over the wavelength range, and wherein the processing unit is configured to determine associated measures of absorption as the wavelength of the light emitted by the light source is scanned over the wavelength range, and wherein the processing unit is configured to operate in a tooth whitening mode for that light source and detector pair at the wavelength at the peak in absorption on the basis of the measures of absorption as the wavelength of the light emitted by the light source is scanned over the wavelength range.

The tooth whitening system comprises a light source, a light detector, and a processing unit.

The inventors realised that if the light wavelength was adjusted to the peak of the absorption spectrum of the staining molecules this would result in the highest absorption efficiency, facilitating the strongest reaction between hydrogen peroxide and the corresponding staining molecules and hence the shortest treatment time. In addition, power consumption of the light source as well as heat mitigation would be minimized if the wavelength was adjusted to the peak absorption of the staining molecules. This realisation led to the development of the new technique described here that automatically adjusts the light wavelength, and if necessary irradiance, incident on the teeth based on the feedback of the absorption of the staining molecules, providing significantly higher whitening efficacy and resultant shade consistency than the current systems. The technique automatically targets the stains most prevalent for a particular user, providing for a truly bespoke and more efficient tooth whitening technique, revolutionary in its simplicity where the actual wavelength of light being used in an operational tooth whitening mode (at a determined peak in absorption) does not need to be known. It was also realised that the new technique was compatible with mouthpiece bodies currently being used.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0139">In essence, the new technique involves identifying, within the blue light range (400-495 nm), what wavelength gives the strongest absorption to a user's teeth and automatically adjusting the wavelength, and if necessary also irradiance, to provide optimized and consistent whitening efficacy. Because the scattering coefficient of teeth is constant across the blue light range (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> that shows typical scattering coefficient of bovine incisors and human premolars, where the spectral dependence is similar for all samples, and the scattering coefficient is considered constant over the 400-495 nm range), the inventors realised that it was feasible to use transmission or diffuse reflectance measurement to derive a measure of absorption of the teeth&#x2014;in effect determine the absorption coefficient of teeth.
