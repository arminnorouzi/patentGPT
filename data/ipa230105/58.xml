Traditionally, poultry houses utilize incandescent bulbs, compact fluorescent lamps (CFL) or LED bulbs to provide a day/night cycle for the birds. Incandescent bulbs, however, typically consume large amounts of electricity, and the color of light produced is not controllable or conducive to bird growth and feeding. CFLs commonly flicker when dimmed, negatively impacting animal welfare. Traditional LED bulbs in the ceiling are not bright enough to provide enough light intensity for maximum live-performance and animal welfare.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Lights are typically mounted on the ceilings of poultry houses. It has been discovered that birds are attracted to lights, and it is thus desirable to provide lights closer to the feeder pans. Existing systems, however, are not capable of illuminating a preset color cycle and may also be difficult to install in existing poultry house configurations.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A lighting system of the described embodiments utilizes dual-color LED fixtures toggled using two independently controlled channels. The fixtures enable full control of light characteristics to optimize bird development. Additionally, the lighting system is readily installable using existing poultry house components.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In an exemplary embodiment, a lighting system is provided for a poultry feeding house with a feed line including a feed auger pipe, a plurality of feeder trays, and a shocker wire. The lighting system includes a wire harness attachable to the shocker wire or the feed auger pipe, where the wire harness encloses wires for powering the lighting system. A lighting fixture positioned beneath the wire harness and positionable on the feed auger pipe includes dual-color LED components using two independently controlled channels. A wire connection secured to the wire harness encapsulates wire leads to power and control the lighting fixture.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The lighting fixture may also include two rows of LED components. In some embodiments, the two rows of LED components may include a primary LED light resembling natural daylight (e.g., 4000-6500K, &#x3e;90CRI) and an optional secondary LED color such as green, blue, UV, etc. In some embodiments, the two rows may include a yellow light component and a green light component.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The system may include a plurality of lighting fixtures positionable along the feed auger pipe.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, the wire connection is a bracket as an overmolded section to protect the wires from corrosion or other environmental factors. The bracket may be T-shaped with a cross-member of the T-shape engaging the wire harness and a leg member of the T-shape securing a lead line to the lighting fixture.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, the wire connection may be a clamshell power connection with hinged halves. In this context, clamshell power connection may include an internal water-resistant liner adjacent an end where a lead line from the clamshell to the lighting fixture exits. The clamshell power connection may be configured to pierce a jack on the wires to make a connection to the lead line.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments, the lighting fixture may include a casing engageable with the feed auger pipe. The casing may include curved portions that are engageable with and shaped corresponding to an outside diameter of the feed auger pipe. Straps may be securable around the feed auger pipe and over the curved sections of the casing.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another exemplary embodiment, a lighting system for a poultry feeding house includes a wire harness attachable to the shocker wire or the feed auger pipe that encloses wires for powering the lighting system, a lighting fixture positioned beneath the wire harness and positionable on the feed auger pipe, and a wire connection secured to the wire harness. The lighting fixture includes dual-color LED components using two independently controlled channels, and the lighting fixture is positioned at poultry height or poultry eye level. The wire connection encapsulates wire leads to power and control the lighting fixture to protect the wire leads from detrimental effects of the poultry feeding house environment. A lead line extends from the wire connection to power the lighting fixture.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">These and other aspects and advantages will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>D</figref> show exemplary wiring feeding light lines utilizing the lighting system of the described embodiments;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an exemplary fixture in the lighting system of the described embodiments;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a sectional view through the feed auger pipe and a wire harness of the lighting system;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a perspective view of the lighting fixture from an opposite side of the feed auger pipe;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a variation using straps to secure the fixture and an exemplary clamshell power configuration;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows an exemplary clamshell power configuration; and</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a schematic illustration of an exemplary controller.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>D</figref> show components of an exemplary feed line in a poultry house. The feed line generally extends along a length of the poultry house and includes a plurality of feed stations <b>12</b> spaced approximately two feet apart (e.g., for chickens). Each poultry house may include multiple feed lines.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The feed stations <b>12</b> include a feeder tray <b>14</b> positioned adjacent an opening in a feed auger pipe <b>16</b>. Poultry feed is pushed through the feed auger pipe <b>16</b> by an auger within the pipe <b>16</b>. Openings in the auger pipe <b>16</b> above each feeder tray <b>14</b> permit the poultry feed to drop down from the pipe <b>16</b> into each feeder tray <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">A shocker wire <b>18</b> runs along the top of the feed auger pipe <b>16</b>. Historically, the shocker wire <b>18</b> is intended to carry a current to keep birds off of the feed auger pipe <b>16</b>, but the shocker wire in current poultry houses typically no longer carries a current. The shocker wire is now used to support the weight of the auger pipe among other things.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">It is known that poultry are attracted to light, and illuminating their feeding and watering stations will assist in ensuring that poultry receive proper amounts of food and drink. Light fixtures <b>36</b> (discussed in more detail below) may be provided along the feeder line above or near the feeder stations <b>12</b> for this purpose.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>4</b></figref> show an exemplary lighting system <b>30</b> of the described embodiments. The lighting system <b>30</b> is cooperable with existing poultry house structures including the shocker wire <b>18</b> and the feed auger pipe <b>16</b>. A wire harness <b>32</b> is attachable to the shocker wire <b>18</b> or the feed auger pipe <b>16</b>. In some embodiments, the wire harness <b>32</b> may be secured via zip ties <b>33</b> or the like to the shocker wire <b>18</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). The wire harness <b>32</b> encloses wires <b>34</b> for powering and controlling the lighting system.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">A lighting fixture <b>36</b> is positioned beneath the wire harness <b>32</b> and is positionable on the feed auger pipe <b>16</b>. In this position, light emitted from the lighting fixture <b>36</b> is essentially at bird height, or bird eye level. In some embodiments, the lighting fixture <b>36</b> includes a casing <b>38</b> that is configured to securely engage the auger pipe <b>16</b> (e.g., see the curved portions <b>37</b> of the casing in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>4</b></figref>). The casing <b>38</b> thus facilitates installation of the lighting fixtures <b>36</b> on the feed auger pipe <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Each lighting fixture <b>36</b> includes dual-color LED components <b>40</b> using two independently controlled channels. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>4</b></figref>, in some embodiments, the dual-color LED components include two rows of LED components <b>40</b>, for example including a yellow light component and a green light component.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">A T-shaped bracket <b>42</b> encapsulates wire leads to power and control the lighting fixture <b>36</b>. The bracket <b>42</b> is generally an overmolded section to protect the wires from corrosion or other environmental factors. As shown, a cross-member of the T-shape engages the wire harness <b>32</b> and a leg member of the T-shape secures a lead line <b>44</b> to the lighting fixture <b>36</b>. That is, the lead line <b>44</b> extends from the bracket <b>42</b> to the lighting fixture <b>36</b>. The bracket <b>42</b> and lead line <b>44</b> stabilize the lighting fixture <b>36</b> on the feed auger pipe <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the curved portions <b>37</b> of the casing <b>38</b> may be secured to the feed auger pipe <b>16</b> with straps <b>48</b> or the like such as stainless straps. The straps <b>48</b> are fixed around the feed auger pipe <b>16</b> over the curved sections <b>37</b> of the casing <b>38</b> and are secured via a suitable connector <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> also shows an alternative to the bracket <b>42</b> in the form of a clamshell power connection <b>52</b>. The clamshell power connection <b>52</b> includes hinged halves with an internal water-resistant liner adjacent the end where the lead line <b>44</b> exits. The clamshell power connection <b>52</b> could be attached to the light and clip on the wire harness <b>32</b> anywhere down the line. The clamping/closing of the clamshell power connection <b>52</b> pierces the jack on the wiring and makes the connection to the lead line <b>44</b> leading to the light fixture <b>36</b>. The drop length could be shortened to 8-12&#x2033; since they can be placed anywhere. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows an alternative clamshell power connection <b>52</b>&#x2032;.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">By using dual color LED fixtures toggled using two independently controlled channels, light output can be controlled to optimize poultry experience. Primary LED light resembling natural daylight (5000K, &#x3e;90CRI) is employed in addition to an optional secondary LED color such as green, blue, UV, etc. Primary and secondary light sources may be used independently, or simultaneously to produce the desired light intensity, color and spectrum to optimize welfare. It has been discovered that optimal lighting conditions for poultry feeding should include a period of warm white in the morning at sunrise, cool white during midday, and fading into warm white before sunset. See, for example, Blatchford, R. A., G. S. Archer, and J. A. Mench, 2012<i>&#x2014;Contrast in light intensity, rather than day length, influences the behavior and health of broiler chickens</i>. Poult Sci 91(8):1768-1774. doi: 10.3382/ps.2011-02051. The system could alternatively utilize UV and RGBA creating virtually infinite colors using the independently controlled channels.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The light patterns simulate the natural photo period under which jungle foul evolved into modern chickens. The dual-color LED components are independently controlled via a suitable house controller.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows an exemplary controller <b>46</b>. The controller <b>46</b> may include eight individual breakers used to supply power to the individual lines of feeder lights. Breakers are used to reset and quickly troubleshoot problems by identifying a defective line in the event of a fault. The controller <b>46</b> provides for independent manual dimming of both channels for each of the lighting fixture LED component rows. A common power wire terminates at the controller <b>46</b>, which supplies 48V DC and a pulse-width modulation signal for dimming purposes. The controller includes functionality to interface with existing poultry house controllers which provide a 0-10V signal for sunrise/sunset of the LEDs and/or a relay function for automated scheduling of the light/dark cycle.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In use, a wiring harness may be about 32 feet long, with lighting fixtures positioned every eight feet along the feed auger pipe. We expect to encounter no more than 44 feeder lights on a single &#x201c;breaker&#x201d; or auger line, which amounts to 11 harnesses per continuous length of feed line maximum. This length limit is typically based on the weight of feed being carried through that standard auger. For example, a 400-600 ft house would typically break in the center with a hopper feeding into the augers either in the center or from each end. We also expect to have no more than 8 total auger lines per house, resulting in 8 (max) breakers/controller.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The continuous section of feed line is around 300 feet on average. Most poultry houses are 400-600 feet long with 2-3 feed lines running long ways down the house and breaking in several locations where feed bins empty into the auger. The system can be delivered to the customer with the wire harness and a plurality of the lighting fixtures. The wire harness is secured to the shocker wire via zip ties or the like, and the lighting fixtures can be readily placed on the feed auger pipe. Installation does not require an electrician and is readily assembled by attaching to existing poultry feeding house components.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">It has been discovered that the birds prefer to eat in the light then digest and rest in the dark. The contrast or delta between light and dark areas should be significant to induce a natural behavioral response in the birds. By bringing the poultry house lighting closer to each of the feeder trays, the birds have more control over their environment, which provides for better poultry development. Additionally, research performed by the University of Arkansas has shown that lighting control can effect an increase in natural behavior such as &#x201c;dust-bathing,&#x201d; which improves poultry welfare and development.

By emitting light only at bird-height in the areas where feed and water are present, birds raised using the system of the described embodiments will have greater animal welfare and freedom of expression than those raised under standard ceiling lights.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">While the invention has been described in connection with what is presently considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention is not to be limited to the disclosed embodiments, but on the contrary, is intended to cover various modifications and equivalent arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
