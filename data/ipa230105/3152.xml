The invention further relates to a method for handling an exhaust aftertreatment unit for a vehicle, to an electrical heating element for use in exhaust aftertreatment unit, and to a vehicle comprising an exhaust aftertreatment unit.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">A vehicle typically comprises an engine for propelling the vehicle. The engine may be powered by various means, such as e.g. by liquid or gaseous fuel in an internal combustion engine, or by electric power in an electric machine. Moreover, hybrid solutions exist in which the vehicle is propelled both by an internal combustion engine and an electric machine.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In case the engine is a combustion engine, such as a diesel engine, it is common to provide the vehicle with an exhaust aftertreatment system, EATS, to handle emissions from the engine. An EATS for a diesel engine typically includes a diesel oxidation catalyst, DOC, a diesel particulate filter, DPF, and a selective catalytic reduction SCR catalyst. A reductant, such as urea or an ammonia comprising substance, is injected upstream of the SCR catalyst to assist in converting nitrogen oxides, also referred to as NOx, with the aid of a catalyst into diatomic nitrogen, N2, and water, and potentially carbon dioxide CO2 (depending on the choice of the reductant). The cleaned, or at least emission reduced, exhaust gases then leaves the EATS and the vehicle through the tailpipe of the vehicle. Other types of engines causing similar emissions as the diesel engine may utilize the same, or a similar, EATS.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Government regulations, together with a constant demand for increased fuel economy of the vehicle, implies a need for a more efficient operation of the EATS. For example, the EATS must heat up fast and have a high conversion efficiency also at very low loads when the temperature of the exhaust gases is low. The need of very efficient engines for meeting stringent CO2-requirements also leads to lower temperature of the exhaust gases and higher engine out NOx-levels which requires large amounts of reductant to be injected upstream the SCR catalyst. Furthermore, when using urea as the reductant, the urea requires heat to evaporate and hydrolyse into ammonia. If the temperature is low, there is a large risk for creating crystallization and deposits that reduce the effect of the EATS.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Electrical heating elements may be used to heat the exhaust gases to counteract the low temperature of the exhaust gases and reduce the associated disadvantages. However, the addition of electrical heating elements to the EATS increase the complexity of the system, and/or add components that risk being subject to failure and in need of maintenance or exchange. Failure of components in the EATS often requires time consuming servicing with costly downtime of the vehicle. Moreover, component failure which leads to component exchange, or even exchange of the complete EATS, is bad for the environment.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, there is a need in the industry for an improved EATS aiming to alleviate the above-mentioned drawbacks.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is an object of the present invention to at least partly alleviate the shortcomings discussed above in relation to known exhaust aftertreatment system, and provide an improved exhaust aftertreatment unit.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to a first aspect of the present invention, an exhaust aftertreatment unit for cleaning exhaust gases is provided. The exhaust aftertreatment unit comprises:</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">an emission reducing module, being a diesel particulate filter, DPF, and/or a diesel oxidation catalyst, DOC,</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">a selective catalyst reduction, SCR, catalyst,</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">an electrical heating element arranged upstream of the emission reducing module,</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">a casing housing at least the emission reducing module and the electrical heating element, and</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">a service lid removably arranged to cover a service opening of the casing through which the emission reducing module may be accessed,</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">wherein the electrical heating element is removably arranged relative the casing and is arranged accessible upon removal of the service lid and the emission reducing module.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Hereby, the electrical heating element is easily accessible in the exhaust aftertreatment unit and may be subject to maintenance or exchange. Thus, an exhaust aftertreatment unit which alleviates the shortcomings of low temperatures of the exhaust gases by means of the electrical heating element, but which has a simple configuration enabling easy access to the electrical heating element is provided. Thus, an improved exhaust aftertreatment unit is provided with a highly efficient removal of emission of the exhaust gases owing at least to the heating of the exhaust gases by the electrical heating element, while reducing the additional complexity of the electrical heating element as it is easily accessible upon removal of the service lid. Moreover, by arranging the electrical heating element upstream of the emission reducing module, the emission reducing module may be heated by the electrical heating element. Additionally or alternatively, any other component (such as e.g. a secondary catalyst as will be explained later in the text) arranged between the emission reducing module and the electrical heating element may be heated by the electrical heating element.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to at least one example embodiment, the emission reducing module comprises a first end portion (or downstream end portion) having a first end surface (or downstream facing surface) facing downstream of the fluid pathway in the exhaust aftertreatment unit, and comprises an opposite second end portion (or upstream end portion) having a second end surface (or upstream facing surface) facing upstream of the fluid pathway, wherein the electrical heating element is arranged upstream of the second end portion. For example, the electrical heating element is facing the second end surface. According to at least one example embodiment, the service lid is arranged to face the first end portion and the first end surface. That is, when the emission reducing module is arranged inside the casing, the first end portion is arranged to face the service lid, and the second end portion is arranged upstream of the first end portion.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to at least one example embodiment, the emission reducing module, i.e. the DPF and/or DOC, is removably arranged inside the casing and may be passed through the service opening upon removal of the service lid. It should be noted that the emission reducing module may comprise a stationary member being integrated and firmly attached to the casing, and an insert member which is removably arranged in the stationary member. For such embodiments, the insert member is removably arranged inside the casing and may be passed through the service opening upon removal of the service lid. Thus, throughout the present description, the emission reducing module may refer to the emission reducing module, or the insert member of the emission reducing module.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to at least one example embodiment, the electrical heating element is arranged on an opposite side of the emission reducing module compared to the service lid. That is, the service lid and the electrical heating element is arranged on opposite sides of the emission reducing module. Such configuration may be advantageous, as the electrical heating element and any electrical connections used to power the electrical heating element is arranged distant from the service lid and the service opening used when e.g. removing the emission reducing module. That is, as the emission reducing module may be removably arranged relative the casing and arranged accessible upon removal of the service lid, the emission reducing module may be accessed and/or removed from the casing without interfering with the electrical heating element. For example, if only the emission reducing module is subject to maintenance or exchange, it can be accessed or removed from the casing independently of the electrical heating element.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to at least one example embodiment, the electrical heating element is arranged inside the casing (e.g. during use of the exhaust aftertreatment unit), and may be removed relative the casing by being passed through the service opening, subsequent to removing the emission reducing module and the service lid (e.g. during maintenance of the exhaust aftertreatment unit). Hereby, the electrical heating element may be easily accessible via the service opening. For example, maintenance may be performed on the electrical heating element via the service opening or via the removed electrical heating element. Thus, and according to at least one example embodiment, the electrical heating element may be removed from the casing by being passed through the service opening for maintenance and/or for exchanging the component. The service lid may combine the function of being a service lid for both the electrical heating element and the emission reducing module.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The emission reducing module is a diesel particulate filter, DPF, i.e. being configured to remove particles, such as diesel particulate matter or soot, from the exhaust gases and/or a diesel oxidation catalyst, DOC arranged and configured to convert carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons into carbon dioxide. Thus, according to at least one example embodiment, the emission reducing module is a combined DPF/DOC, for example in which the DOC is arranged upstream of the DPF. According to at least one example embodiment, the emission reducing module is a DPF. According to at least one example embodiment, the emission reducing module is a DOC. In case the emission reducing module is a combined DPF/DOC, the DPF and DOC need not to be combined in the same unit, but the DPF and DOC may be comprised in separate units, wherein the separate units are separated by means of a gap. Thus, exhaust gases may enter the DOC, be subject to emission reduction in the DOC, and subsequently exit the DOC into the gap. Thereafter the exhaust gases enter the DPF from the gap, is subject to emission reduction in the DPF, and subsequently exit the DPF. The two separate units may according to one example embodiment be attached to each other, e.g. by a connecting element extending from the DPF to the DOC via the gap. However, according to at least one example embodiment, the DPF and the DOC of the combined DPF/DOC are comprised in the same unit.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to at least one example embodiment, the casing comprises a mounting socket housing the emission reducing module and the electrical heating element.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Hereby, the emission reducing module and the electrical heating element may be satisfactorily arranged inside the casing. During use of the electrical heating element, the electrical heating element may be arranged and configured to keep the temperature in the mounting socket at between 180&#xb0; C. and 300&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to at least one example embodiment, the emission reducing module and the electrical heating element are removably arranged relative the mounting socket. That is, the electrical heating element may be removably arranged relative the casing by being removably arranged relative the mounting socket. Correspondingly, the emission reducing module may be removably arranged relative the casing by being removably arranged relative the mounting socket.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The mounting socket is preferably arranged inside the casing such that the service lid faces a mouth or orifice of the mounting socket. Thus, upon removal of the service lid, the emission reducing module may be removed from the casing and the mounting socket by being passed by the mouth or orifice of the mounting socket and subsequently passed through the service opening. That is, the service opening and the mouth or orifice of the mounting socket are preferably co-axial. Hereby, the electrical heating element may be accessed via the service opening through the mouth or orifice of the mounting socket. Subsequently, the electrical heating element may be removed from the casing and the mounting socket by being passed through the mouth or orifice of the mounting socket and subsequently passed through the service opening.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to at least one example embodiment, the geometrical shape of the mounting socket is adapted to the geometrical shape of the emission reducing module. Hereby, the emission reducing module may be efficiently arranged inside the mounting socket. According to at least one example embodiment, the mounting socket is geometrically shaped as an open cylinder, or a tube. Correspondingly, the emission reducing module is preferably cylindrically shaped. The geometrical shape of the electrical heating element may according to at least one example embodiment be adapted to the geometrical shape of the mounting socket. For example, the electrical heating element may be geometrically shaped as a round, or circular, heating element, e.g. as a coil.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to at least one example embodiment, the mounting socket is integrated and firmly attached to the casing. It should be noted that the mounting socket may be the stationary member of the emission reducing module previously described. Alternatively, the stationary member of the emission reducing module is integrated and firmly attached to the mounting socket of the casing.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to at least one example embodiment, the electrical heating element is powered by at least one electrical connection extending from an external surface of the casing and into the mounting socket upstream of the electrical heating element.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Hereby, means for enabling that the emission reducing module may be accessed and/or removed from the casing without interfering with the electrical heating element is provided.

The emission reducing module <b>30</b>, the SCR catalyst <b>32</b>, the secondary catalyst <b>35</b> and the electrical heating element <b>38</b> are housed in a casing <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">The exhaust aftertreatment unit <b>20</b> is typically operated in the following manner: exhaust gases (to be cleaned) from the diesel engine enter the exhaust aftertreatment unit <b>20</b> via the inlet <b>22</b>, and encounters the electrical heating element <b>38</b> and is heated. Thereafter, the exhaust gases pass through the secondary catalyst <b>35</b> and the emission reducing module <b>30</b> by first passing through the DOC <b>30</b>B, the gap <b>30</b>C and the DPF <b>30</b>A. Thus, the fact that the exhaust gases are heated improves the performance of the emission reducing module <b>30</b> and the secondary catalyst <b>35</b> prior to that the flow of exhaust gases continuous along the fluid pathway <b>26</b> to a position in which the urea is injected by injector <b>34</b>. The injected reductant is thus mixed with the heated exhaust gases and the heat provided by the electrical heating element <b>38</b> may be adapted to be sufficient for evaporating and hydrolysing the urea into ammonia. The ammonia and exhaust gases thereafter enter the SCR catalyst <b>32</b> for catalytic reduction of the NOx, whereafter the cleaned exhaust gases are discharged from the exhaust aftertreatment unit <b>20</b> via the outlet <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the casing <b>40</b> comprises a mounting socket <b>41</b> housing at least some components of the exhaust aftertreatment unit <b>20</b>, here being the emission reducing module <b>30</b>, the secondary catalyst <b>35</b> and the electrical heating element <b>38</b>. Hereby, the components <b>30</b>, <b>35</b>, <b>38</b> may be satisfactorily arranged inside the casing <b>40</b>. The mounting socket <b>41</b> is in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> tubularly or cylindrically shaped and extends along a longitudinal axis L. Moreover, the electrical heating element <b>38</b> is powered by at least an electrical connection C extending from an external surface <b>43</b> of the casing <b>40</b> and into the mounting socket <b>41</b> upstream of the electrical heating element <b>38</b>. The electrical connection C comprises two electrical connection wires, a power wire (or phase wire, indicated with a &#x201c;+&#x201d;) and a neutral wire (indicated with a &#x201c;&#x2212;&#x201d;), but will typically simply be referred to as the electrical connection C in the following. The electrical connection C extends into the mounting socket in a direction along or parallel to the longitudinal axis L, which will be further discussed later in the text. The electrical connection C extends in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> through the casing <b>40</b> and the external surface <b>43</b> by means of a guide element <b>45</b> (typically one guide element for each electrical connection wire as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). Thus, the guide element <b>45</b> guides the electrical connection C through the casing <b>40</b> and the external surface <b>43</b>.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">For various reasons, accessibility of the emission reducing module <b>30</b>, the secondary catalyst <b>35</b> and/or the electrical heating element <b>38</b> is desirable. Thus, the casing <b>40</b> comprises a service opening <b>42</b> through which at least the emission reducing module <b>30</b> may be passed (if removed from the casing <b>40</b>). Thus, the emission reducing module <b>30</b> may be removed from the casing <b>40</b> for maintenance or exchange, and/or may be inserted into the casing <b>40</b> for installation. The service opening <b>42</b> is closable by means of a removably arranged service lid <b>44</b>. In other words, the service lid <b>44</b> is removably arranged to cover the service opening <b>42</b>. Thus, the service lid <b>44</b> may be considered as a separate component to the casing <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">The electrical heating element <b>38</b> is removably arranged relative the casing <b>40</b>, by being removably arranged relative the mounting socket <b>41</b>, e.g. by being detachable from the mounting socket <b>41</b> and/or the casing <b>40</b>. Correspondingly, the emission reducing module <b>30</b> (i.e. in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the DPF <b>30</b>A and the DOC <b>30</b>B) is removably arranged relative the casing <b>40</b>, by being removably arranged relative the mounting socket <b>41</b>, e.g. by being detachable from the mounting socket <b>41</b> and/or the casing <b>40</b>. Moreover, typically the secondary catalyst <b>35</b> is removably arranged relative the casing <b>40</b>, by being removably arranged relative the mounting socket <b>41</b>, e.g. by being detachable from the mounting socket <b>41</b> and/or the casing <b>40</b>. Thus, the electrical heating element <b>38</b> is arranged inside the casing <b>40</b>, and inside the mounting socket <b>41</b>, in such a way that it is accessible through the service opening <b>42</b> upon removal of the service lid <b>44</b>, the emission reducing module <b>30</b>, and the secondary catalyst <b>35</b>. Thus, the electrical heating element <b>38</b> may be removed from the casing <b>40</b> and the mounting socket <b>41</b> and exchanged and/or be subject to maintenance.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">A procedure of handling the exhaust aftertreatment unit <b>20</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, will now briefly be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. The method may be referred to as a method for accessing the electrical heating element <b>38</b> in the casing <b>40</b> and/or mounting socket <b>41</b>. First, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the service lid <b>44</b> is removed from the casing <b>40</b>. Subsequently, the emission reducing module <b>30</b> is removed from the casing <b>40</b> and the mounting socket <b>41</b> by first removing the DPF <b>30</b>A, and then removing the DOC <b>30</b>B. As the DOC <b>30</b>B is attached to the secondary catalyst <b>35</b> in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the secondary catalyst <b>35</b> is removed from the casing <b>40</b> and the mounting socket <b>41</b> together with emission reducing module <b>30</b> and the DOC <b>30</b>B. Hereby, the emission reducing module <b>30</b> and the secondary catalyst <b>35</b> are made accessible for e.g. maintenance or exchange. However, it should be noted that the secondary catalyst <b>35</b> is optional and may be omitted from the exhaust aftertreatment unit <b>20</b>, Moreover, the DOC <b>30</b>B or the DPF <b>30</b>A may be omitted from the exhaust aftertreatment unit <b>20</b>. Thus, the emission reducing module <b>30</b> may simply be a DPF or a DOC.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Once the emission reducing module <b>30</b> and the secondary catalyst <b>35</b> have been removed from the casing, the electrical heating element <b>38</b> is accessible via the service opening <b>42</b>. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the electrical heating element <b>38</b> is attached to the electrical connection C, and is thus removably arranged relative the casing <b>40</b> together with the electrical connection C. In more detail, the guide element <b>45</b> comprises a first guide element <b>45</b>A for guiding a first of the two electrical connection wires, and a second guide element <b>45</b>B for guiding the other of the two electrical connection wires. The electrical heating element <b>38</b> and the electrical connection C with its two electrical connection wires are removably attached to the first and second guide elements <b>45</b>A, <b>45</b>B. Thus, subsequently to removing the emission reducing module <b>30</b> and the secondary catalyst <b>35</b>, the electrical heating element <b>38</b> may be removed relative the casing <b>40</b> and the mounting socket <b>41</b> via the service opening <b>42</b>, by detaching the electrical connection C from the guide element <b>45</b>A, <b>45</b>B. Hereby, the electrical heating element <b>38</b> is made accessible for e.g. maintenance or exchange. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, as the electrical connection C extends inside the mounting socket <b>41</b> in a direction along or parallel to the longitudinal axis L (or rather, that the first and second electrical connection wires extends in a direction along or parallel to the longitudinal axis L), the electrical heating element <b>38</b> can be axially removed by passing the electrical heating element out of the casing <b>40</b> and the mounting socket <b>41</b> in a direction along or parallel to the longitudinal axis L such that the electrical connection C can be passed through the first and second guide elements <b>45</b>A, <b>45</b>B. Thus, the electrical connection C is avoided from interacting, and potentially getting stuck with, an internal surface of the mounting socket <b>41</b> during removal of the electrical heating element <b>38</b>.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">In another embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>B</figref>, the electrical heating element <b>38</b>&#x2032;, the at least one electrical connection C and the guide element <b>45</b>&#x2032; are removably attached to the external surface <b>43</b> of the casing. Here, the guide element <b>45</b>&#x2032; comprises at least one flange <b>46</b>&#x2032;, the flange <b>46</b>&#x2032; being firmly attached to the electrical connection C of the electrical heating element <b>38</b>&#x2032;. Moreover, the flange <b>46</b>&#x2032; is configured to be attached to an attachment portion <b>43</b>&#x2032; of the external surface <b>43</b> by means of screws <b>60</b>. Thus, the flange <b>46</b>&#x2032; comprise a plurality of threaded holes and is releasably mounted in the external surface <b>43</b> to the attachment portion <b>43</b>&#x2032; by means of that the screws is threadedly engageable with the threaded holes. Thus, the electrical heating element <b>38</b> may be removed from the casing and the external surface <b>43</b> together with the guide element <b>45</b>&#x2032; and the electrical connection C by unthreading the screws and thereby releasing the flange <b>46</b>&#x2032; from the attachment portion <b>43</b>&#x2032;, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>.
