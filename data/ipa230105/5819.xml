Semiconductor devices vary in the number and density of electrical components. Discrete semiconductor devices generally contain one type of electrical component, for example, light emitting diode (LED), small signal transistor, resistor, capacitor, inductor, and power metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET). Integrated semiconductor devices typically contain hundreds to millions of electrical components. Examples of integrated semiconductor devices include microcontrollers, microprocessors, memories, analog to digital or digital to analog converters, power management and charged-coupled devices (CCDs) as well as MEMS devices including digital micro-mirror devices (DMDs).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Semiconductor devices perform a wide range of functions such as signal processing, high-speed calculations, transmitting and receiving electromagnetic signals, controlling electronic devices, storing information, and creating visual projections for displays. Semiconductor devices are found in many fields of entertainment, communications, power conversion, networks, computers, and consumer products. Semiconductor devices are also found in military applications, aviation, automotive, industrial controllers, and office equipment.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Semiconductor devices exploit the electrical properties of semiconductor materials. The atomic structure of semiconductor material allows its electrical conductivity to be manipulated by the application of an electric field or base current or through the process of doping. Doping introduces impurities into the semiconductor material to manipulate and control the conductivity of the semiconductor device.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A semiconductor device contains active and passive electrical structures. Active structures, including bipolar, complementary metal oxide semiconductors, and field effect transistors, control the flow of electrical current. By varying levels of doping and application of an electric field or base current, the transistor either promotes or restricts the flow of electrical current. Passive structures, including resistors, capacitors, and inductors, create a relationship between voltage and current necessary to perform a variety of electrical functions. The passive and active structures are electrically connected to form circuits, which enable the semiconductor device to perform high-speed calculations and other useful functions.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Semiconductor devices are generally manufactured using two complex manufacturing processes, that is, front-end manufacturing, and back-end manufacturing, each involving potentially hundreds of steps. Front-end manufacturing involves the formation of a plurality of semiconductor die on the surface of a semiconductor wafer. Each semiconductor die is typically identical and contains circuits formed by electrically connecting active and passive components. Back-end manufacturing involves singulating individual semiconductor die from the finished wafer and packaging the die to provide structural support and environmental isolation. The term &#x201c;semiconductor die&#x201d; as used herein refers to both the singular and plural form of the words, and accordingly can refer to both a single semiconductor device and multiple semiconductor devices.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">One goal of semiconductor manufacturing is to produce smaller semiconductor devices. Smaller devices typically consume less power, have higher performance, can be produced more efficiently, have a smaller form factor, and may be less cumbersome when integrated within wearable electronics, portable handheld communication devices, such as phones, and in other applications. In other words, smaller semiconductor devices may have a smaller footprint, a reduced height, or both, which is desirable for smaller end products. A smaller semiconductor die size can be achieved by improvements in the front-end process resulting in semiconductor die with smaller, higher density active and passive components. Back-end processes may result in semiconductor device packages with a smaller footprint by improvements in electrical interconnection and packaging materials.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">An opportunity exists for improved semiconductor manufacturing.

Front-end manufacturing involves the formation of a plurality of die on the surface of a semiconductor wafer. Each die on the wafer contains active and passive electrical components, which are electrically connected to form functional electrical circuits. Active electrical components, such as transistors and diodes, have the ability to control the flow of electrical current. Passive electrical components, such as capacitors, inductors, resistors, and transformers, create a relationship between voltage and current necessary to perform electrical circuit functions.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Passive and active components are formed over the surface of the semiconductor wafer by a series of process steps including doping, deposition, photolithography, etching, and planarization. Doping introduces impurities into the semiconductor material by techniques such as ion implantation or thermal diffusion. The doping process modifies the electrical conductivity of semiconductor material in active devices, transforming the semiconductor material into an insulator, conductor, or dynamically changing the semiconductor material conductivity in response to an electric field or base current. Transistors contain regions of varying types and degrees of doping arranged as necessary to enable the transistor to promote or restrict the flow of electrical current upon the application of the electric field or base current.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Active and passive components are formed by layers of materials with different electrical properties. The layers can be formed by a variety of deposition techniques determined in part by the type of material being deposited. For example, thin film deposition can involve chemical vapor deposition (CVD), physical vapor deposition (PVD), electrolytic plating, and electroless plating processes. Each layer is generally patterned to form portions of active components, passive components, or electrical connections between components.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The layers can be patterned using photolithography, which involves the deposition of light sensitive material, e.g., photoresist, over the layer to be patterned. A pattern is transferred from a photomask to the photoresist using light. In one embodiment, the portion of the photoresist pattern subjected to light is removed using a solvent, exposing portions of the underlying layer to be patterned. In another embodiment, the portion of the photoresist pattern not subjected to light, the negative photoresist, is removed using a solvent, exposing portions of the underlying layer to be patterned. The remainder of the photoresist is removed, such as by a stripping process, leaving behind a patterned layer. Alternatively, some types of materials are patterned by directly depositing the material into the areas or voids formed by a previous deposition/etch process using techniques such as electroless and electrolytic plating.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Patterning is the basic operation by which portions of the photoresist material are partially removed, so as to provide a pattern or electroplating template for the subsequent formation of structures, such as patterning redistribution layers (RDLs), under bump mentalization (UBM), copper posts, vertical interconnects, or other desirable structures. Portions of the semiconductor wafer can be removed using photolithography, photomasking, masking, oxide or metal removal, photography and stenciling, and microlithography. Photolithography includes forming a pattern in reticles or a photomask and transferring the pattern into the surface layers of the semiconductor wafer. Photolithography forms the horizontal dimensions of active and passive components on the surface of the semiconductor wafer in a two-step process. First, the pattern on the reticle, masks or direct write imaging design file are transferred into a layer of photoresist. Photoresist is a light-sensitive material that undergoes changes in structure and properties when exposed to light. The process of changing the structure and properties of the photoresist occurs as either negative-acting photoresist or positive-acting photoresist. Second, the photoresist layer is transferred into the wafer surface. The transfer occurs when etching removes or electroplating adds the portion of the top layers of semiconductor wafer not covered by the photoresist. The chemistry of photoresists is such that the photoresist remains substantially intact and resists removal by chemical etching solutions while the portion of the top layers of the semiconductor wafer not covered by the photoresist is removed by etching or a layer is added by electroplating. The process of forming, exposing, and removing the photoresist, as well as the process of removing or adding a portion of the semiconductor wafer can be modified according to the particular resist used and the desired results. Negative or positive tones resist can be designed for solvent or base develop solutions.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In negative-acting photoresists, photoresist is exposed to light and is changed from a soluble condition to an insoluble condition in a process known as polymerization. In polymerization, unpolymerized material is exposed to a light or energy source and polymers form a cross-linked material that is etch-resistant. In most negative resists, the polymers are polyisopremes. Removing the soluble portions (i.e. the portions not exposed to light) with chemical solvents or base developers leaves a hole in the resist layer that corresponds to the opaque pattern on the reticle. A mask whose pattern exists in the opaque regions is called a clear-field mask.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In positive-acting photoresists, photoresist is exposed to light and is changed from relatively nonsoluble condition to much more soluble condition in a process known as photosolubilization. In photosolubilization, the relatively insoluble resist is exposed to the proper light energy and is converted to a more soluble state. The photosolubilized part of the resist can be removed by a solvent or a base in the development process. The basic positive photoresist polymer is the phenol-formaldehyde polymer, also called the phenol-formaldehyde novolak resin. Removing the soluble portions (i.e. the portions exposed to light) with chemical solvents or base developers leaves a hole in the resist layer that corresponds to the transparent pattern on the reticle. A mask whose pattern exists in the transparent regions is called a dark-field mask.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">After removal of the top portion of the semiconductor wafer not covered by the photoresist, the remainder of the photoresist is removed, leaving behind a patterned layer. Alternatively, some types of materials are patterned by directly depositing the material into the areas or voids formed by a previous deposition/etch process using techniques such as electroless and electrolytic plating.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Depositing a thin film of material over an existing pattern can exaggerate the underlying pattern and create a non-uniformly flat surface. A uniformly flat surface can be beneficial or required to produce smaller and more densely packed active and passive components. Planarization can be used to remove material from the surface of the wafer and produce a uniformly flat surface. Planarization involves polishing the surface of the wafer with a polishing pad. An abrasive material and corrosive chemical are added to the surface of the wafer during polishing. Alternatively, mechanical abrasion without the use of corrosive chemicals is used for planarization. In some embodiments, purely mechanical abrasion is achieved by using a belt grinding machine, a standard wafer backgrinder, or other similar machine. The combined mechanical action of the abrasive and corrosive action of the chemical removes any irregular topography, resulting in a uniformly flat surface.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Back-end manufacturing refers to cutting or singulating the finished wafer into the individual semiconductor die and then packaging the semiconductor die for structural support and environmental isolation. To singulate the semiconductor die, the wafer can be cut along non-functional regions of the wafer called saw streets or scribes. The wafer is singulated using a laser cutting tool, laser silicon lattice disruption process, dry etch plasma dicing process, or saw blade. After singulation, the individual semiconductor die are mounted to a package substrate that includes pins or contact pads for interconnection with other system components. Contact pads formed over the semiconductor die are then connected to contact pads within the package. The electrical connections can be made with solder bumps, stud bumps, conductive paste, redistribution layers, or wirebonds. An encapsulant or other molding material is deposited over the package to provide physical support and electrical isolation. The finished package is then inserted into an electrical system and the functionality of the semiconductor device is made available to the other system components.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Back-end manufacturing as disclosed herein also does more than merely packaging an embedded device or the semiconductor die for structural support and environmental isolation. The packaging described herein further provides non-monolithic electrical interconnection of die for increased functionality &#x26; performance. Previously, nearly all advanced semiconductor die were monolithic systems on chips (SoCs) where all electrical interconnect occurred on the silicon wafer during front-end processing. Now, however, work that was traditionally the domain of front-end domain work may be handled or moved to the back-end manufacturing, allowing many semiconductor die (chiplets) to be connected with packaging technology to form a chiplet-based SoC (which is non monolithic) and provides a composite package with greater functionality. The chiplet approach may also decrease waste from defects, increase production efficiency, reliability, and performance. The chiplet approach also allows for heterogeneous integration, where devices built by different front-end processes can be integrated into a composite package.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The electrical system can be a stand-alone system that uses the semiconductor device to perform one or more electrical functions. Alternatively, the electrical system can be a subcomponent of a larger system. For example, the electrical system can be part of a cellular phone, personal digital assistant (PDA), digital video camera (DVC), or other electronic communication device. Alternatively, the electrical system can be a graphics card, network interface card, or other signal processing card that can be inserted into a computer. The semiconductor package can include microprocessors, memories, application specific integrated circuits (ASIC), logic circuits, analog circuits, RF circuits, discrete devices, or other semiconductor die or electrical components. Miniaturization and weight reduction can be beneficial or essential for the products to be accepted by the market. The distance between semiconductor devices must be decreased to achieve higher density.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> shows a plan view of a semiconductor wafer or native wafer <b>10</b> with a base substrate material <b>12</b>, such as, without limitation, silicon, germanium, gallium arsenide, gallium nitride, indium phosphide, or silicon carbide, for structural support.

The bringing together of TSVs in an embedded device defies convention, breaks existing beliefs and paradigms, by bringing together different packaging processes into a new method, device, system, structure, and form. The current method and design broadens the idea that TSVS are strictly an integrated circuit (IC) technology, and challenges the notion that encapsulant or mold compound would not be used (as shown herein) in a wafer fab. To the contrary, the current semiconductor device is produced by fabrication inside the molded material or encapsulant, to provide an extension to the embedded device (chip). The new method and device advantageously provides relaxed pitch, such as for a BGA with a pitch &#x3e;90 &#x3bc;m, so as to allow mass reflow and lower a cost for substrates.

An offset or vertical distance between the large semiconductor die <b>50</b> and the embedded device <b>14</b> can also be reduced by having the large semiconductor die <b>50</b> fully molded by encapsulant <b>60</b> or base layer <b>60</b><i>a </i>of encapsulant, with only the thin build-up interconnect structure <b>70</b> disposed between them, (such as without an interposer or additional stand-offs, posts, columns, bumps, or vertical interconnects.
