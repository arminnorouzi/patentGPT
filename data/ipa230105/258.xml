Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Hospital pillow speakers are useful entertainment and communication devices for patients during a stay at a hospital. Moreover, the hospital pillow speaker is found in virtually all hospital settings as they often enable patients to access a nurse call button, the television, sound systems, lights, and/or various other devices within a hospital room.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Unfortunately, the pillow speakers have a high tendency of falling under a hospital bed, on a floor, and/or between a bed rail during use, which requires the patient to either physically move to retrieve the pillow speakers and/or to call someone for assistance. For some patients, movement can be painful and/or impossible.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, there is a need for a speaker receptacle for a bed rail that prevents the pillow speaker from falling off the bed.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present general inventive concept provides a speaker receptacle for a bed rail.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Additional features and utilities of the present general inventive concept will be set forth in part in the description which follows and, in part, will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the general inventive concept.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The foregoing and/or other features and utilities of the present general inventive concept may be achieved by providing a speaker receptacle, including a main body to receive at least one item therein, a plurality of protruding edges disposed on at least one of a first edge and a second edge of the main body opposite with respect to the first edge, each of the plurality of protruding edges to protrude away from the first edge and the second edge of the main body, and a rail fastener disposed on at least a portion of the main body to detachably connect the main body to a bed rail.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The main body may include a front surface concavely disposed on a first side of the main body, and a second surface convexly disposed on a second side of the main body opposite with respect to the first side.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The front surface may adhesively connect to the at least one item therein.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Each of the plurality of protruding edges may be disposed at a distance away from the first end of the main body.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The rail fastener may include a plurality of fastener receiving apertures disposed on at least a portion of the main body, and a strap fastener removably connected through each of the plurality of fastener receiving apertures to connect each end of the strap fastener.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The speaker receptacle may further include a cord receiving groove disposed on at least a portion of a second end of the main body to receive a cord of the at least one item therethrough.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">These and/or other features and utilities of the present generally inventive concept will become apparent and more readily appreciated from the following description of the embodiments, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings of which:</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> illustrates a front perspective view of a speaker receptacle for a bed rail, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present general inventive concept;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrates a rear perspective view of the speaker receptacle for the bed rail, according to an exemplary embodiment of the present general inventive concept;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> illustrates a front perspective view of a speaker receptacle for a bed rail, according to another exemplary embodiment of the present general inventive concept;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> illustrates a rear perspective view of the speaker receptacle for the bed rail, according to another exemplary embodiment of the present general inventive concept;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> illustrates a front perspective view of a speaker receptacle for a bed rail, according to another exemplary embodiment of the present general inventive concept; and</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> illustrates a rear perspective view of the speaker receptacle for the bed rail, according to another exemplary embodiment of the present general inventive concept.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Various example embodiments (a.k.a., exemplary embodiments) will now be described more fully with reference to the accompanying drawings in which some example embodiments are illustrated.
