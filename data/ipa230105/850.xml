The compounds have potential therapeutic applications in the treatment of a variety of disorders, including proliferative, viral, immune and inflammatory disorders.</p><heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0002">ERAP1 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Aminopeptidase 1; also referred to as APPILS or ARTS1) is an aminopeptidase important in the generation of a proportion of antigens and neoantigens as part of the antigen presentation pathway<sup>1</sup>. The antigen presentation pathway starts with the breakdown of proteins by the proteasome into peptides. These peptides are transported into the endoplasmic reticulum where a proportion are processed by ERAP1 before binding to the Major Histocompatibility Complex Class I (MHC Class I)<sup>1</sup>. Antigens bound to MHC Class I are then transported to the surface of a cell and presented to CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells and recognised as either self or non-self. Neoantigens are antigens that are specific to cancer and can be recognised as foreign by the immune system leading to destruction of cancer cells. Neoantigens are created either as a direct result of somatic mutations in the DNA of cancer cells, leading to the generation of mutated proteins, or through the indirect consequences of somatic mutations on protein processing and expression. Those cancers with higher rates of mutation and correspondingly higher levels of neoantigens have much greater response rates to the checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapies anti-PD-1 (e.g. pembrolizumab, nivolumab), anti-PD-L1 (e.g. atezolizumab, avelumab, durvalumab) and anti-CTLA4 antibodies (e.g. ipilimumab, tremelimumab) compared with cancers harbouring lower numbers of neoantigens<sup>2, 3</sup>.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0003">The role of ERAP1 in the antigen presentation pathway is to trim a proportion of peptides, via its aminopeptidase activity, to create antigens and neoantigens of the optimal length for binding to MHC Class I. ERAP1 also over-trims some neoantigens, preventing their binding to MHC Class I and presentation at the cell surface<sup>4</sup>. Ablation of ERAP1 activity has been shown to change the antigen and neoantigen repertoire, leading to an increase in presentation of certain antigens/neoantigens and the presentation of entirely novel antigens/neoantigens<sup>5</sup>. In addition, ERAP1 ablation causes CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell dependent tumour rejection in mouse cancer models<sup>4</sup>. Accordingly, modulators of ERAP1 activity may be useful for cancer treatment, either used alone or in combination with current cancer immunotherapy agents, including checkpoint inhibitors, because they change the antigens and neoantigens presented on the surface of cancer cells and make them more visible to the immune system, leading to tumour attack and destruction.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0004">Knockdown of ERAP1 is also shown to reduce the levels of regulatory-like T cells and enhance the killing of cancer cells by natural killer cells<sup>6, 7</sup>. This suggests that modulators of ERAP1 activity might be effective cancer treatments by both modulating cancer cell visibility and creating a more anti-tumourogenic immune response. ERAP1's peptide processing role in antigen presentation is also applicable in infectious viral disease.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0005">The present invention seeks to provide compounds that are capable of modulating ERAP1. Such compounds have potential therapeutic applications in the treatment of a variety of disorders, including proliferative disorders, immune disorders and inflammatory disorders.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">Statement of Invention</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0006">A first aspect of the invention relates to a compound of formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or hydrate thereof,</p><p id="p-0009" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-C00002" he="36.24mm" wi="63.25mm" file="US20230000851A1-20230105-C00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0010" num="0000">wherein:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0007">Z is a group of formula:</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0011" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00003" num="00003"><img id="EMI-C00003" he="16.26mm" wi="16.00mm" file="US20230000851A1-20230105-C00003.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry><ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0008">wherein P and Q are each independently CR<sub>12</sub>R<sub>13</sub>;

Approximately 50% of this change is an upregulation in the presentation of certain antigens and neoantigens, whilst the other 50% is the presentation of entirely novel antigens and neoantigens. Both changes lead to an increase in the visibility of the tumour to the immune system, leading to measurable changes in the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell repertoire and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation status.

The antigen-presenting cells may be produced ex vivo to present neo-antigens, such as those generated by a compound according to the present invention. The compound may be used in a method for producing ex vivo an antigen-presenting cell which presents a neo-antigen, and wherein the cell may be used as a vaccine against cancer.</p><p id="p-0263" num="0248">The antigen presenting cell such as a dendritic cell may be pulsed or loaded with the neo-antigen or genetically modified (via DNA or RNA transfer) to express one, two or more neo-antigens.

The neo-antigen may be generated from the subject's normal tissue in which ERAP1 is modulated with a compound according to the invention. Sources of normal tissue may be fibroblasts or B cells, for example, that can be readily expanded in vitro.</p><p id="p-0264" num="0249">Alternatively, RNA from the cancer, total or mRNA enriched poly A+RNA may be used. Poly A+RNA can be also amplified to generate sufficient antigen for DC loading and thereby limit the ex vivo culture step.</p><p id="p-0265" num="0250">In one embodiment a dendritic cell which has been treated with the compound as described above may be used to treat a subject. The dendritic cell may be contacted with the compound ex vivo, and then the dendritic cell may be administered to the subject. The compound may therefore be used in vitro or in vivo, for example either for in situ treatment or for ex vivo treatment followed by the administration of the treated cells to the subject.</p><p id="p-0266" num="0251">Another aspect of the invention relates to a compound as described above for use in treating an immune disorder. In one preferred embodiment, the immune disorder is an autoimmune disorder.</p><p id="p-0267" num="0252">Examples of the autoimmune disorders include, but are not limited to: rheumatoid arthritis (RA), myasthenia gravis (MG), multiple sclerosis (MS), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's thyroiditis), Graves' disease, inflammatory bowel disease, autoimmune uveoretinitis, polymyositis and certain types of diabetes, systemic vasculitis, polymyositis-dermatomyositis, systemic sclerosis (scleroderma), Sjogren's Syndrome, ankylosing spondylitis and related spondyloarthropathies, rheumatic fever, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, inorganic dust pneumoconiosis, sarcoidosis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, immunological platelet disorders, cryopathies such as cryofibrinogenemia, psoriasis, Beh&#xe7;et's disease, birdshot chorioretinopathy and autoimmune polyendocrinopathies.</p><p id="p-0268" num="0253">Polymorphisms in the ERAP1 gene that impact ERAP1 enzymatic activity are strongly associated with an increased risk of autoimmunity, including the diseases ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, Beh&#xe7;et's disease and birdshot chorioretinopathy<sup>11</sup>. Variants of ERAP1 that reduce ERAP1 enzymatic activity are protective against disease, whilst those that reportedly elevate activity are associated with increased disease risk<sup>12</sup>. This suggests that modulation of ERAP1 activity could be an effective treatment for autoimmune diseases.</p><p id="p-0269" num="0254">Thus, in one preferred embodiment, the immune disorder is selected from ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, Beh&#xe7;et's disease and birdshot chorioretinopathy.</p><p id="p-0270" num="0255">In one preferred embodiment, the immune disorder is ankylosing spondylitis. Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a type of arthritis in which there is long term inflammation of the joints of the spine. Typically, the joints where the spine joins the pelvis are also affected. Occasionally other joints such as the shoulders or hips are involved. Between 0.1% and 1.8% of people are affected and onset is typically in young adults. Although the cause of ankylosing spondylitis is unknown, it involves a combination of genetic and environmental factors. More than 90% of those affected have a specific human leukocyte antigen known as the HLA-B27 antigen.<sup>13 </sup>In addition, certain variants of ERAP1, in conjunction with HLA-B27, are clearly associated with either an elevated or reduced risk of disease, providing evidence of a clear role for modulated antigen presentation in disease.<sup>18 </sup>There is no cure for ankylosing spondylitis and current treatments serve only to improve symptoms and prevent worsening. Medications used to date include NSAIDs, steroids, DMARDs such as sulfasalazine, and biologic agents such as infliximab.</p><p id="p-0271" num="0256">In one preferred embodiment, the immune disorder is Beh&#xe7;et's disease (BD). Beh&#xe7;et's disease (BD) is a type of inflammatory disorder which affects multiple parts of the body. The most common symptoms include painful mouth sores, genital sores, inflammation of parts of the eye, and arthritis. The cause is not well-defined, and whilst environmental factors play a role, genetic studies have shown an increased risk of disease in patients carrying HLA-B51 in conjunction with specific variants of ERAP1.<sup>19 </sup>The disease is primarily characterized by auto-inflammation of the blood vessels, hence it is sometimes characterised as an auto-inflammatory disease. There is currently no cure for Beh&#xe7;et's disease, but the symptoms can be controlled with medicines that reduce inflammation in the affected parts of the body, for example, with corticosteroids, immunosuppressants or biological therapies that target the biological processes involved in the process of inflammation. In one preferred embodiment, the immune disorder is birdshot chorioretinopathy. Birdshot chorioretinopathy, also known as Birdshot Uveitis or HLA-A29 Uveitis, is a rare form of bilateral posterior uveitis affecting the eye. It causes severe, progressive inflammation of both the choroid and retina. Symptoms include floaters, blurred vision, photopsia (flashing lights in eyes), loss of color vision and nyctalopia. Birdshot chorioretinopathy is thought to be an autoimmune disease. The disease has strong association with the Human leukocyte antigen haplotype (HLA)-A29. This indicates a role for T-lymphocytes in the pathogenesis. Birdshot chorioretinopathy is associated with IL-17, a hallmark cytokine of TH17 cells that play an important role in autoimmunity.<sup>15, 16 </sup>A genome-wide association study has ascertained HLA-A29:02 as the primary risk factor and identified that both ERAP1 and ERAP2 are associated with birdshot chorioretinopathy.<sup>17, 20 </sup>Genetic variants within the ERAP1 and ERAP2 loci modulate enzyme activity and also mRNA and protein expression. ERAP2 is an aminopeptidase that, together with ERAP1, trims peptides in the endoplasmic reticulum and loads these peptides on HLA molecules for presentation to T cells of the immune system.</p><p id="p-0272" num="0257">In one preferred embodiment, the immune disorder is psoriasis. Psoriasis is a chronic skin disease in which skin cells rapidly build up on the surface of the skin forming scales and red patches that are itchy and sometimes painful. The cause is not well-defined but includes both environmental and genetic factors. HLA-C06 strongly associates with risk of disease and variants in ERAP1, possibly in conjunction with HLA-C06, are also strongly associated with disease.<sup>21 </sup>There is no cure for psoriasis and current treatments serve only to improve symptoms and prevent worsening. Medications used in therapy include steroids, methotrexate, sulfasalazine, and biologic agents such as etanercept.</p><p id="p-0273" num="0258">Another aspect of the invention relates to a compound as described above for use in treating or preventing a viral disorder. Modulators of ERAP1 such as the compounds described herein are capable of changing the antigen repertoire of multiple viruses, which leads to the recognition and destruction of viral infected cells. Accordingly, ERAP1 modulators have potential therapeutic applications in the treatment of viral infection and diseases. ERAP1 modulates certain viral antigens, including those from human papilloma virus (HPV), human cytomegalovirus (CMV) hepatitis C (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)<sup>8, 9, 10</sup>.

An isotopic variation of a compound of the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is defined as one in which at least one atom is replaced by an atom having the same atomic number but an atomic mass different from the atomic mass usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into the agent and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulphur, fluorine and chlorine such as <sup>2</sup>H, <sup>3</sup>H, <sup>13</sup>C, <sup>14</sup>C, <sup>15</sup>N, <sup>17</sup>O, <sup>18</sup>O, <sup>31</sup>P, <sup>32</sup>P, <sup>35</sup>S, <sup>18</sup>F and <sup>36</sup>Cl, respectively. Certain isotopic variations of the agent and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, for example, those in which a radioactive isotope such as <sup>3</sup>H or <sup>14</sup>C is incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution studies. Tritiated, i.e., <sup>3</sup>H, and carbon-14, i.e., <sup>14</sup>C, isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., <sup>2</sup>H, may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example, increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. For example, the invention includes compounds of general formula (I) where any hydrogen atom has been replaced by a deuterium atom. Isotopic variations of the agent of the present invention and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof of this invention can generally be prepared by conventional procedures using appropriate isotopic variations of suitable reagents.</p><p id="p-0337" num="0322">Atropisomers</p><p id="p-0338" num="0323">Some of the compounds of the invention may exist as atropisomers.

Such prodrugs are generally compounds of the invention wherein one or more appropriate groups have been modified such that the modification may be reversed upon administration to a human or mammalian subject. Reversion is usually performed by an enzyme naturally present in such subject, though it is possible for a second agent to be administered together with such a prodrug in order to perform the reversion in vivo.

For example, the active ingredient can be incorporated into a cream consisting of an aqueous emulsion of polyethylene glycols or liquid paraffin. The active ingredient can also be incorporated, at a concentration of between 1 and 10% by weight, into an ointment consisting of a white wax or white soft paraffin base together with such stabilisers and preservatives as may be required.</p><p id="p-0354" num="0339">Dosage</p><p id="p-0355" num="0340">A person of ordinary skill in the art can easily determine an appropriate dose of one of the instant compositions to administer to a subject without undue experimentation. Typically, a physician will determine the actual dosage which will be most suitable for an individual patient and it will depend on a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the metabolic stability and length of action of that compound, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, mode and time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the severity of the particular condition, and the individual undergoing therapy. The dosages disclosed herein are exemplary of the average case. There can of course be individual instances where higher or lower dosage ranges are merited, and such are within the scope of this invention.</p><p id="p-0356" num="0341">The dosage amount will further be modified according to the mode of administration of the compound. For example, to achieve an &#x201c;effective amount&#x201d; for acute therapy, parenteral administration of a compound is typically preferred. An intravenous infusion of the compound in 5% dextrose in water or normal saline, or a similar formulation with suitable excipients, is most effective, although an intramuscular bolus injection is also useful. Typically, the parenteral dose will be about 0.01 to about 100 mg/kg; preferably between 0.1 and 20 mg/kg, in a manner to maintain the concentration of drug in the plasma at a concentration effective to modulate ERAP1. The compounds may be administered one to four times daily at a level to achieve a total daily dose of about 0.4 to about 400 mg/kg/day. The precise amount of an inventive compound which is therapeutically effective, and the route by which such compound is best administered, is readily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art by comparing the blood level of the agent to the concentration required to have a therapeutic effect.</p><p id="p-0357" num="0342">The compounds of this invention may also be administered orally to the patient, in a manner such that the concentration of drug is sufficient to achieve one or more of the therapeutic indications disclosed herein. Typically, a pharmaceutical composition containing the compound is administered at an oral dose of between about 0.1 to about 50 mg/kg in a manner consistent with the condition of the patient. Preferably the oral dose would be about 0.5 to about 20 mg/kg.</p><p id="p-0358" num="0343">No unacceptable toxicological effects are expected when compounds of the present invention are administered in accordance with the present invention. The compounds of this invention, which may have good bioavailability, may be tested in one of several biological assays to determine the concentration of a compound which is required to have a given pharmacological effect.</p><p id="p-0359" num="0344">Combinations</p><p id="p-0360" num="0345">A further aspect of the invention relates to a combination comprising a compound as described herein and one or more additional active agents.

In such cases, the compounds of the invention may be administered consecutively, simultaneously or sequentially with the one or more other active agents.</p><p id="p-0361" num="0346">Drugs in general are more effective when used in combination. In particular, combination therapy is desirable in order to avoid an overlap of major toxicities, mechanism of action and resistance mechanism(s). Furthermore, it is also desirable to administer most drugs at their maximum tolerated doses with minimum time intervals between such doses. The major advantages of combining chemotherapeutic drugs are that it may promote additive or possible synergistic effects through biochemical interactions and also may decrease the emergence of resistance.</p><p id="p-0362" num="0347">Beneficial combinations may be suggested by studying the activity of the test compounds with agents known or suspected of being valuable in the treatment of a particular disorder. This procedure can also be used to determine the order of administration of the agents, i.e. before, simultaneously, or after delivery.
