The entire contents of this application are hereby incorporated herein by reference.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0003" level="1">1. Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to surface acoustic wave devices, and more particularly, to a surface acoustic wave device having a wafer level package (WLP) structure.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Surface acoustic wave devices are used as band pass filters in wireless sections, such as radio-frequency (RF) stages and intermediate-frequency (IF) stages, of mobile communication terminals. In recent years, wireless sections in personal digital assistants (PDAs), such as cellular phones and smartphones, have been modularized, and accordingly, there has been a need for a reduction in the size and height of surface acoustic wave devices. Thus, packaging technologies for surface acoustic wave devices have been improved, and a WLP technology has been proposed in which a chip of a surface acoustic wave device is directly used as a package. In a surface acoustic wave device, interdigital transducer (IDT) electrodes are provided on a piezoelectric substrate, and the surface acoustic wave device is packaged so that a hollow space is provided above the IDT electrodes. In a WLP-type surface acoustic wave device, a piezoelectric substrate is directly used as a package that includes a hollow space.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In modularization of wireless sections in PDAs, such as cellular phones and smartphones, there is a need to modularize such wireless sections by sealing them with a resin in order to protect them against external stress and moisture. When an entire module is sealed with a resin (e.g., transfer molding), high pressure is applied to individual components that are sealed with the resin, and accordingly, there is a need for a method for allowing a surface acoustic wave device having a hollow space inside thereof to be capable of withstanding such high pressure and to be capable of withstanding a mold resin that tries to enter the surface acoustic wave device (i.e., a method for allowing the surface acoustic wave device to have mold resistance or pressure resistance and to have a lamination property or a sealing property).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the related art, as a technology that ensures the mold resistance and the lamination property of a surface acoustic wave device, a technology for providing a partition-support layer (inner support layer), which functions as a spacer, in a hollow space has been proposed (see, for example, Japanese Patent No. 5141852). In Japanese Patent No. 5141852, the mold resistance of a surface acoustic wave device is ensured by disposing a partition-support layer, which is made of a resin, at a center portion of a hollow space so as to be vertically arranged between a piezoelectric substrate and a cover layer that define the hollow space.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Here, in order to further improve the mold resistance, providing a partition-support layer, which extends in the lateral and longitudinal directions when the piezoelectric substrate is viewed in plan, in the hollow space may be considered. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a layout view of a hollow space of a surface acoustic wave device according to a reference example (a diagram when a piezoelectric substrate is viewed in plan). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates a piezoelectric substrate <b>11</b>, on which IDT electrodes (not illustrated) have been provided, outer-periphery-frame support layers <b>20</b><i>a </i>to <b>20</b><i>d </i>which cover the periphery of the piezoelectric substrate <b>11</b>, partition-support layers <b>22</b><i>a </i>to <b>22</b><i>c, </i>which are disposed so as to partition the hollow space, and columnar electrodes <b>17</b><i>a </i>to <b>17</b><i>h. </i>Each of the partition-support layers <b>22</b><i>a </i>to <b>22</b><i>c </i>is vertically arranged on the piezoelectric substrate <b>11</b> in a region in which the IDT electrodes are not disposed, and the partition-support layers <b>22</b><i>a </i>to <b>22</b><i>c </i>support, together with the outer-periphery-frame support layers <b>20</b><i>a </i>to <b>20</b><i>d, </i>a cover layer (not illustrated) that defines a ceiling of the hollow space. When the piezoelectric substrate <b>11</b> is viewed in plan, the partition-support layer <b>22</b><i>c </i>has a substantially crank shape extending so as to partition the hollow space in the longitudinal and lateral directions. As a result, reinforcement strength with respect to the cover layer may be enhanced, and the mold resistance of the surface acoustic wave device may be improved, whereas if all the partition-support layers <b>22</b><i>a </i>to <b>22</b><i>c </i>extend in only one direction, the reinforcement strength with respect to the cover layer would not be enhanced, and the mold resistance of the surface acoustic wave device would not be improved.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, in the case where the partition-support layer <b>22</b><i>c </i>having a substantially crank shape, such as that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is provided, when the cover layer, which is made of a resin, is attached to the outer-periphery-frame support layers <b>20</b><i>a </i>to <b>20</b><i>d </i>and the partition-support layers <b>22</b><i>a </i>to <b>22</b><i>c </i>from above, wrinkles are generated in a portion of the cover layer that is brought into contact with a crank portion of the partition-support layer <b>22</b><i>c, </i>and the partition-support layer <b>22</b><i>c </i>is embedded into the cover layer. As a result, the portion of the cover layer in contact with the crank portion of the partition-support layer <b>22</b><i>c, </i>is crushed. For example, when attaching a cover layer, which has been rolled, to the partition-support layer <b>22</b><i>a, </i>the partition-support layer <b>22</b><i>b, </i>and the partition-support layer <b>22</b><i>c </i>in this order while stretching the cover layer, when the cover layer is attached to the partition-support layer <b>22</b><i>c, </i>wrinkles are generated in the cover layer, and the cover layer is crushed. As a result, problems occur in that a portion having a reduced thickness is locally provided in the cover layer, or breakage occurs locally in the cover layer, so that the mold resistance and the lamination property of the surface acoustic wave device will not be ensured, and the reliability of the surface acoustic wave device will not be ensured as a result of the wrinkles, which have been generated in the cover layer, being in contact with the IDT electrodes or wiring electrodes.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Preferred embodiments of the present invention provide a surface acoustic wave device having a wafer level package (WLP) structure whose mold resistance, lamination property, and reliability are improved and ensured.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A surface acoustic wave device according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention includes a piezoelectric substrate including a main surface, at least one interdigital transducer electrode on the main surface, a cover over the piezoelectric substrate and the at least one interdigital transducer electrode, and a plurality of hollow spaces between the at least one interdigital transducer electrode and the cover.
