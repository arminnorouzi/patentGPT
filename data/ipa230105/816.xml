cytochrome P450 in the lungs and liver, respectively. Cannabinoid formulations that minimize or avoid cytochrome P450 mediated oxidation are desirable.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Various aspects of this patent document relate to cannabinoid ions that are dissolved in glycerol and that convert into cannabinoid molecules at neutral pH. The cannabinoid ions are anions that carry net negative charges that repel each other to maximize their surface area. The cannabinoid ions are not carboxylates because carboxylates generally do not convert to molecules at neutral pH.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The administration of cannabinoid ions that are dissolved in glycerol to a human or an animal results in the pH-dependent conversion of the cannabinoid ions into cannabinoid molecules, which are generally insoluble in both glycerol and bodily fluids. The cannabinoid molecules then rapidly partition out of the glycerol and adhere to the epithelium where they absorb into the blood (during oral administration) or the skin and underlying tissue (during topical administration). Absorption through the epithelium of the mouth and throat avoids first-pass metabolism, which minimizes cytochrome P450 mediated oxidation and improves pharmacokinetics.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Various aspects of this patent document relate to a composition, comprising a liquid phase that comprises a solute and a solvent, wherein the solute is a cannabinoid ion; the cannabinoid ion is an anion that has a net charge of &#x2212;1; the cannabinoid ion lacks a carboxylate group; the solvent is glycerol; and the cannabinoid ion is dissolved in the glycerol. &#x201c;Comprising&#x201d; and &#x201c;comprise(s)&#x201d; refer to open-ended sets such that a liquid phase that comprises a solute and a solvent can also comprise, for example, a metal cation. &#x201c;Carboxylate group&#x201d; refers to &#x2014;(C&#x2550;O)O<sup>&#x2212;</sup>. &#x201c;Glycerol&#x201d; is synonymous with glycerin, glycerine, and propane-1,2,3-triol. &#x201c;Dissolved&#x201d; refers to a solute that is solvated in a liquid phase by either (i) a solvent, (ii) a cosolvent, or (iii) both a solvent and a cosolvent; a chemical species that is present within a phase that is dispersed within a liquid phase, such as the dispersed phase of an emulsion, is not dissolved in the liquid phase; a chemical species that is non-covalently bound to any chemical species that is a solid in the absence of a solvent, such as a cyclodextrin, is not dissolved in a solvent.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat.
