level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">Disclosed are devices, systems, and methods that facilitate bone healing.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Fracture is the most common kind of bone disease, which usually requires expensive surgical treatment. According to the audit report issued by the International Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF) in 2013, high fracture rates with major increases in Asia is predicted by 2050 as the aging population, widespread vitamin D deficiency and low calcium intake.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Open reduction and implant fixation are considered as the standard treatment for fractures that are impossible to reduce manipulatively. A lot of implants have been developed and used widely in the fracture fixation, including dynamic compression plate (DCP), locking compression plate (LCP), intramedullary nail and external fixator. DCP, which provides absolute stability by achieving compression across the fracture line, can result in primary fracture healing without callus formation. LCP and intramedullary nail, however, provide relative stability that is good for secondly bone healing with massive bone callus formation. As the primary fracture healing requires longer time and has a higher re-fracture rate, the secondly bone healing induced by the relative stability is considered to be a better option for fracture fixation.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The relative stable implants can induce micromotion at the fracture site, which promotes callus formation and therefore accelerate the fracture healing. This theory has been proven by clinical observations and animal experiments. What is more, a series of micromotional implants have been designed to take advantage of this theory, such as the active plate, and dynamic locking screw. Even with good clinical results, the number of clinical reported fracture nonunion and delayed union with the relative stability fixation method is still high. It is reported that the overall rate of nonunion is up to 18.5% in the tibia diaphysis and the nonunion rate in the femoral shaft after reamed nailing is 1.7%. The effective range of strain that can promote fracture healing remains unclear. That could be the reason why the currently used relative stable implants showed inconsistent clinical results.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The following presents a simplified summary of the disclosure in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the disclosure. This summary is not an extensive overview of the disclosure. It is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of the disclosure nor delineate the scope of the disclosure. Rather, the sole purpose of this summary is to present some concepts of the disclosure in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented hereinafter.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The subject disclosure provides devices, systems, and methods that involve micromotion with the appropriate model (including displacement range and frequency) that improves the callus formation along the fracture. A series of micromotional fixators accelerate fracture healing. Conventional &#x2018;dynamic fixators&#x2019; rely on the bearing weight of the patient to produce the micromotion across the fracture line, which makes the micromotion uncontrollable. To produce controllable and accuracy micromotion at the fracture site, an electronic linear servo motor actuator and micromotional unit are designed to transform electric energy into reciprocating displacement between two fracture fragments. The electronic controller actuates micromotional unit to produce micromotion with per-set parameters and makes necessary compensation based on measured results of the displacement sensor. The micromotional unit can be removed after use. This orthopedic fixator can be used to treat fracture in various locations of patient in need thereof.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Essentially, a motor machine transforms electric energy into a reciprocating displacement between two components to apply controllable micromotion to the fracture site, which can be precisely adjusted by an electronic controller.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">One aspect of the disclosure relates to external fixator for treating bone fractures, comprising a holder attached to bone at two locations, the two locations on opposite sides of a fracture site; a micromotional unit removably coupled to the holder, the micromotional unit configured to produce reciprocating displacement between two components to apply controllable micromotion to the fracture site; and a controller coupled to the micromotional unit, the controller for controlling the micromotional unit to produce reciprocating displacement.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The external fixator for treating bone fractures comprises: a holder attached to bone at two fracture fragments, the two fracture fragments respectively on opposite sides of a fracture site; a micromotional unit removably coupled to the holder, the micromotional unit configured to produce a reciprocating displacement between the two fracture fragments to apply a controllable micromotion to the fracture site; and a controller coupled to the micromotional unit, the controller configured for controlling the micromotional unit to produce the reciprocating displacement between the two fracture fragments.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another aspect of the disclosure relates to method of treating bone fractures, involving attaching a holder attached to bone at two locations, the two locations on opposite sides of a fracture site; producing reciprocating displacement between two components a micromotional unit removably coupled to the holder thereby applying controllable micromotion to the fracture site; and controlling the reciprocating displacement to facilitate fracture healing at the fracture site.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The method of treating bone fractures comprises: attaching a holder to bone at two fracture fragments, the two fracture fragments respectively on opposite sides of a fracture site; producing reciprocating displacement between the two fracture fragments by a micromotional unit removably coupled to the holder, thereby applying a controllable micromotion to the fracture site; and controlling the reciprocating displacement between the two fracture fragments by a controller to facilitate fracture healing at the fracture site.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Still another aspect of the disclosure relates to a micromotional unit comprising: an outer tube, an inner tube, a motor, and a gear drive. At least a portion of the inner tube is inserted inside the outer tube; the motor and the gear drive are configured to transform an electrical signal into a relative axial displacement between the outer tube and the inner tube along an axial direction of the inner tube and the outer tube; and the outer tube and the inner tube are respectively connected with the two fracture fragments, so that the relative displacement between the outer tube and the inner tube produces the reciprocating displacement between the two fracture fragments.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the disclosure comprises the features hereinafter fully described and particularly pointed out in the claims.

Consequently, a series of &#x2018;dynamic fixators&#x2019;, including external fixators and plates, have been designed to produce micromotion at the fracture site. All of the currently used &#x2018;dynamic fixators&#x2019; rely on the bearing weight of the patient to produce the micromotion across the fracture line, which makes the micromotion uncontrollable. A problem is that improper micromotion parameters exert a negative impact on bone healing. For example, premature start or laggard end of micromotion application can delay the fracture repairing, and excessive displacement causes nonunion. Therefore, one significant limitation of currently used &#x2018;dynamic fixators&#x2019; is the lack of feasible means to adjust the parameters of micromotion, such as range, frequency, duration and timing of micromotion, to produce proper micromotion to accelerate bone healing.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">To produce controllable and proper micromotion for facilitating fracture healing, described herein is an external fixator. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, an electronic linear servo motor actuator <b>610</b> is designed to transform electric energy into reciprocating displacement between two fracture fragments <b>1</b>. For example, a core component is a micromotional unit <b>6</b>. For example, the micromotional unit <b>6</b> has four parts, an outer tube <b>61</b>, an inner tube <b>67</b>, a motor <b>610</b>, and a gear drive. In terms of the working principle, for example, the motor <b>610</b> and the gear drive are configured to transform the electrical signal from an electronic controller <b>9</b> into the relative displacement between the outer tube <b>61</b> and the inner tube <b>67</b>. For example, the outer tube <b>61</b> and the inner tube <b>67</b> are fixed at the proximal and distal fracture fragment respectively so that the reciprocating of the motor machine device <b>610</b> produces micromotion to patient's fracture site in a manner that facilitates and/or promotes fracture healing, especially compared to similar situations where the described external fixator is not employed.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">As a product of orthopedic fixator to accelerate fracture healing, the advantages of the disclosure can be summarized at least in four keywords:</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Autonomous&#x2014;The external fixator can autonomously apply micromotion to patient's fracture site, instead of the relay on the patient's manual action or bearing weight, which makes the micromotion more effective than most conventional &#x2018;dynamic fixators&#x2019;.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Programmable&#x2014;The progress of the micromotional application, such as applied duration and timing, is programmable. According to the patient's healing status, the micromotional function can be turned on or off&#x2014;that is, tailored to each circumstance.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Accuracy&#x2014;The mechanical parameters, such as range and frequency, of each micromotional cycle are accurately controlled and compensated by a closed-loop controller based on a displacement sensor in micromotional unit.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Demountable&#x2014;The micromotional unit of the external fixator is designed to be demountable at the end of each micromotional application to lighten the patient's burden.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">This disclosure is about an external fixator to apply micromotion to patient's fracture site to improve bone healing. The external fixator comprises a micromotional unit <b>6</b>, an electronic controller <b>9</b>, and a holder. For example, two fracture fragments <b>1</b> of the patient are fixed on the main body <b>7</b> and slide block <b>4</b> of the holder respectively. For example, the main body <b>7</b> and slide block <b>4</b> are jointed with the inner tube <b>67</b> and the outer tube <b>61</b> of the micromotional unit <b>6</b> through two connective rods <b>8</b>. For example, the micromotional unit <b>6</b> is configured to transfer the electric signal form the electronic controller <b>9</b> into circulatory displacement between the inner tube <b>67</b> and the outer tube <b>61</b>. For example, a sensor <b>69</b> in the micromotional unit <b>6</b> is configured to measure the actual displacement and the electronic controller <b>9</b> is configured to make compensation based on this measured value. For example, the micromotional unit <b>6</b> is dismountable after use to release the patient's burden. This disclosure for example is used as an orthopedic fixator to treat fracture in various locations.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an illustration in accordance with an embodiment is shown. The disclosure comprises a micromotional unit <b>6</b>, an electronic controller <b>9</b>, and a holder. For example, the micromotional unit <b>6</b> produces micromotion under the control of the electronic controller <b>9</b>. For example, the holder is designed to provide stability to the patient's fracture site FS. For example, the main body <b>7</b> of the holder and the slide block <b>4</b> of the holder are fixed with the patient's proximal fragment and distal fracture fragment through three or so K wires <b>2</b> respectively. For example, the outer tube <b>61</b> and the inner tube <b>67</b> are inserted at the main body <b>7</b> of the holder and the slide block <b>4</b> of the holder through two or more connecting rods <b>8</b> respectively. For example, the micromotional unit is demountable, which is removed from holder after use.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> presents a drawing of the micromotional unit. For example, the micromotional unit comprises four parts, an outer tube <b>61</b>, an inner tube <b>67</b>, a motor <b>610</b>, and a gear drive. For example, the motor <b>610</b> and the gear drive in the micromotional unit <b>6</b> are configured to transform the electrical signal from the electronic controller <b>9</b> into the relative displacement between the outer tube <b>61</b> and the inner tube <b>67</b>. For example, a large-torque coreless motor <b>610</b> is rigidly fixed inside a purpose-designed space of the inner tube <b>67</b>. The reasons for choosing coreless motor <b>610</b> as the prime mover are its advantages on high efficiency, quick response, tiny volume, and the like. For example, the coreless motor is a key technology to achieve an axial displacement of the micromotional unit <b>6</b>. For example, an output shaft of the motor <b>610</b> is connected with a strain wave generator <b>64</b>. For example, the strain wave generator <b>64</b> presses an elliptical gear <b>63</b> from its inside and forces the elliptical gear <b>63</b> mesh with a circular ring gear <b>611</b> in one end of the inner tube <b>67</b>. For example, the strain wave generator <b>64</b>, the elliptical gear <b>63</b>, and the circular ring gear <b>611</b> constitute a harmonic gear drive to lower the rotational speed and increase the torque of the coreless motor <b>610</b>. For example, the harmonic gear drive is an important component to complete the micromotion of the micromotional unit <b>6</b>. For example, its characteristic on &#x2018;no backlash&#x2019; is helpful to achieve the reciprocating motion of micromotional unit <b>6</b>. For example, this drive can provide a high drive ratio (a ratio from 30:1 up to 300:1 is possible in the same space in which planetary gears typically only produce a 10:1 ratio) in a small volume, which saves precious space in the micromotional unit. For example, a drive screw <b>62</b> is coaxially connected with elliptical gear <b>63</b> through an output shaft, which converts the rotation into axial displacement. For example, a guide rail <b>612</b>, such as four guide rails <b>612</b>, provided between the inner tube <b>67</b> and outer tube <b>61</b> restrict the skewing or spin. For example, a limiting screw, such as four limiting screws, impose a restriction on the maximum displacement, though anywhere from two to <b>20</b> screws may be employed. For example, a sealing ring <b>65</b>, such as three sealing rings, are set between the inner tube <b>67</b> and the outer tube <b>61</b> to keep the waterproof and sealing of the micromotional unit <b>6</b>. For example, a displacement sensor <b>69</b>, such as a magnetic grid, is placed in the sealing space as to export displacement signals to the closed-loop controller <b>9</b> through a wire <b>66</b>, and the micromotion signal and the compensating signal from the controller <b>9</b> are transmitted to motor <b>610</b> through the same wire <b>66</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">For example, to facilitate the accurateness and controllability of the micromotional application, a closed-loop controller <b>9</b> to regulate the operation of the micromotional unit <b>6</b> is provided. For example, the controller <b>9</b> is a commercial SCM (single chip microcomputer) with I/O (input/output) model and PMW output (pulse width modulation) model. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows an exemplary control logic diagram of the electronic controller <b>9</b>, although others may be employed. For example, in the beginning, the user sets parameters of micromotion (such as range, frequency, duration, and timing), then the controller <b>9</b> produces a DC pulse signal (micromotion signal) to conduct the motor <b>610</b> in the micromotional unit <b>6</b> reciprocating motion. Meanwhile, the magnetic grid <b>69</b> detects the relative displacement of the micromotional unit <b>6</b>, and then transform the displacement into a &#x2018;displacement signal&#x2019;. For example, the controller <b>9</b> compares the received signal with user-entered parameters and adds an additional &#x2018;compensating signal&#x2019; on the motor <b>610</b> to fix the error of displacement.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">For example, a Micromotion Unit (MMU) <b>6</b> as described herein comprises components: a motor <b>610</b> such as a coreless motor; a gear drive such as a harmonic gear drive; and a displacement sensor such as a magnetic grid.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">For example, to produce controllable and proper micromotion for fracture healing, inventors developed a motor-driven fixator. In this disclosure, for example, an electrical actuator such as a motor <b>610</b> is designed to transform electric energy into reciprocating displacement between two fracture fragments <b>1</b>. For example, the core component is a micromotion unit (MMU) <b>6</b> which comprises four parts, an outer tube <b>61</b>, an inner tube <b>67</b>, a motor <b>610</b>, and a gear drive. In terms of the working principle, for example, the motor <b>610</b> and the gear drive are configured to transform the electrical signal from an external controller <b>9</b> into the relative displacement between the outer tube <b>61</b> and the inner tube <b>67</b>. For example, the outer tube <b>61</b> and the inner tube <b>67</b> are fixed at the proximal and distal fracture fragment respectively so that the reciprocating of motor machine device <b>610</b> produces micromotion to patient's fracture site FS.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">For example, a large-torque coreless motor <b>610</b> is rigidly fixed inside a purpose-designed space of the inner tube <b>67</b>. For example, the reasons for choosing coreless motor <b>610</b> as the prime mover are its advantages on high efficiency, quick response, tiny volume and the like. For example, the coreless motor <b>610</b> is a feature to facilitate achieving axial displacement of the MMU <b>6</b>. For example, the output shaft of the motor <b>610</b> is connected with a strain wave generator <b>64</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">For example, the strain wave generator <b>64</b> presses an elliptical gear <b>63</b> from its inside and forces the elliptical gear <b>63</b> mesh with a circular ring gear <b>611</b> in one end of inner tube <b>67</b>. For example, the strain wave generator <b>64</b>, the elliptical gear <b>63</b>, and the circular ring gear <b>611</b> constitute a harmonic gear drive to lower the rotational speed and increase the torque of the coreless motor <b>610</b>. For example, the harmonic gear drive is a notable component to complete the micromotion of the MMU <b>6</b>&#x2014;its characteristic of &#x2018;no backlash&#x2019; is helpful to facilitate achieving the reciprocating motion of the MMU <b>6</b>. For example, the drive provides a high drive ratio (a ratio from 30:1 up to 300:1 is possible in the same space) in a small volume. For example, the drive provides a high drive ratio (a ratio from 50:1 up to 250:1 in the same space) in a small volume. For example, a drive screw <b>62</b> is coaxially connected with elliptical gear <b>63</b> through an output shaft, which converts the rotation into axial displacement. For example, a guide rail <b>612</b>, such as four guide rails <b>612</b>, provided between the inner tube <b>67</b> and the outer tube <b>61</b> restrict the skewing or spin. For example, a limiting screw <b>68</b>, such as four limiting screws <b>68</b>, impose a restriction on the maximum displacement. For example, a sealing ring <b>65</b>, such as three sealing rings <b>65</b>, are set between the inner tube <b>67</b> and the outer tube <b>61</b> to keep the waterproof and sealing of MMU <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">For example, a displacement sensor <b>69</b>, such as the magnetic grid, is placed in the sealing space to export displacement signals to the closed-loop controller <b>9</b> through a wire <b>66</b>, and the micromotion signal and the compensating signal from the controller <b>9</b> are transmitted to motor <b>610</b> through the same wire <b>610</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates the measured displacement-time curve of the micromotional unit; that is, calculation of frequency (f) and range (R) using an MMU in accordance with the description herein. For example, the micromotional unit <b>6</b> was set to produce micromotion at the range of 2 mm in the frequency of 0.2 Hz. The displacement-time curve proves the compensation function has been realized by the electronic controller.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates the measured displacement-time curve of a conventional device; that is, calculation of frequency (f) and range (R) using the Orthofix&#xae; external fixator.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> lists a comparison between an MMU/an external fixator in accordance with an embodiment and a commercially available Orthofix&#xae; external fixator on micromotion accuracy. The external fixator in accordance with this disclosure shows a significant advantage in the accuracy of micromotional range and micromotional frequency compared to the commercially available Orthofix&#xae; external fixator. As demonstrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the MMU in accordance with an embodiment can provide a more uniform and stable micromotion than the Orthofix's product (with a smaller standard deviation in both range (R) and frequency (f)).</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows application of MMU on fracture site FS after two week's postoperative recovery. Although not specifically tied to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, an exemplary range for the application is 0.246&#xb1;0.020 mm and an exemplary frequency is 0.644&#xb1;0.032 Hz.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> depicts X-ray images of a control group without using an MMU and the micromotion group using MMU in accordance with this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">For example, there are numerous applications of the MMU <b>6</b> in accordance with this disclosure. The MMU <b>6</b> is the core component, which produces reciprocating displacement alone its axial direction. For example, the closed-loop controller <b>9</b> supplies power to the MMU <b>6</b> and controls the MMU <b>6</b> via the changing of the electrical signal. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the MMU for example is configured as one of various forms of orthopedic fixators to satisfy different requirements of fracture classifications on fixation, for example, for fracture reduction, limb lengthening and scoliosis correction. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows a micromotional external fixator.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Having regular frequencies and ranges of micromotion is important in clinical treatment. It has been noticed that the micromotion within a certain range can promote bone healing, however, below or above this optimal range can lead to the delayed union or the nonunion. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> shows the relationship between bone formation and interfragmentary strain (IFS). If the IFS higher than Point C or lower than Point A, the delayed union or the nonunion would happen. According to current bone healing theory, the optimal range of micromotion makes IFS remain between Point A and Point C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the bone healing theoretically is enhanced by the improvement of callus formation along with the fracture site FS. And the rate of delayed union and non-union is decreased. As a result, irregular micromotion may cause invalid stimulate even brings a negative effect to fracture healing.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Meanwhile, the Ortohfix&#xae; fixator can only limit the maximum displacement by a stop block. However, in some extreme cases, the delayed union and the non-union still occur since interfragmentary strain is too low.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">For example, the external fixator described herein is designed to solve this problem by monitoring the actual range and frequency and make necessary compensation. And the micromotional range can be accuracy controlled in the optimal range, which is a significant advance in the art.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">For example, the external fixator described herein operates in a range with a frequency that facilitates fracture healing with a relatively low standard deviation. For example, the external fixator operates in a range from 0.01 mm to 5 mm. For example, the external fixator operates in a range from 0.1 mm to 3 mm. For example, the external fixator operates in a given range with a standard deviation from &#xb1;0.001 mm to 0.1 mm. For example, the external fixator operates in a given range with a standard deviation from &#xb1;0.01 mm to 0.075 mm. For example, the external fixator operates at a frequency from 0.05 Hz to 5 Hz. For example, the external fixator operates at a frequency from 0.1 Hz to 2.5 Hz. For example, the external fixator operates at a given frequency with a standard deviation from 0.001 Hz to 0.1 Hz. For example, the external fixator operates at a given frequency with a standard deviation from 0.01 Hz to 0.05 Hz.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">For example, the external fixator described herein can provide real-time feedback to surgeons and help them timely adjust the micromotional parameters. It is an important therapeutic reference to surgeons because both exaggerate micromotion and inadequate micromotion cause detrimentally the delayed union or the nonunion.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">For example, the electric controller <b>9</b> described herein reduces the workload of patents. For example, according to the Orthofix&#xae;'s protocol, the patient should shake a handle on one side of fixator for 10 minutes daily, and produce cycle micromotion for 2-3 weeks, then the patient should produce progressive loading for 2-3 weeks more by the same method. These complicated operations and repetitive work are advantageously executed by the electric controller <b>9</b> as described herein, which highly shortens the learning curve.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">For example, the external fixator described herein shows significant advantages on the integrated design, the modular construction and the compatibility compared with current commercial fixator. For example, the integrated design enables all movable parts of the micromotional unit to be packaged into one tubular shell. This integrated design minimizes the risk of failure due to foreign matter (such as water, ash, and fiber) entering the mechanical part and brings great benefit to the reliability of micromotional fixator.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">For example, the modular construction enables the connections among the micromotional unit <b>6</b>, the electronic controller <b>9</b>, and the holder to be dismountable. For example, the micromotional unit <b>6</b> and the electronic controller <b>9</b> are removed from the holder at the end of each micromotional application to lighten the patient's burden.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">For example, the external fixator described herein has compatibility with a commercial fixator in that the connector on the micromotional unit <b>6</b> is designed to be compatible with the commercial fixator. For example, the micromotional unit can take place of the manual adaptor on Orthofix&#xae;'s product to furnish it with the ability of autonomous working.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">According to our results on rat model, a 20% strain of micromotional range showed the most significant improvement on fracture healing, but strains from 2% to 40% can be employed. For example, strains from 15% to 25% are employed. For example, strains from 10% to 20% are employed.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">For example, the displacement sensor <b>69</b> and the electric controller <b>9</b> make the MMU <b>6</b> controllable. Also, the harmonic gear drive facilitates the characteristic on &#x2018;no backlash&#x2019; to achieve the reciprocating motion of MMU <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">For example, the MMU needs reciprocating motion in a high speed, and the mechanical parts make quick response to the signal form the electronic controller <b>9</b>. For example, the selection of motor <b>610</b> and gear drive fulfills this requirement. For example, for the cordless motor <b>610</b>, the rotating part on this kind of motor <b>610</b> is lighter than step motor and other common motor. For example, this motor achieves the action of &#x2018;rotation-stop-reverse rotation&#x2019; in a high speed. For example, the step motor is more likely to achieve a high accuracy action. And the extremely high transmission ratio of harmonic gear drive undercuts the advantage of step motor in accuracy.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">With respect to any figure or numerical range for a given characteristic, a figure or a parameter from one range may be combined with another figure or a parameter from a different range for the same characteristic to generate a numerical range.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">For example, an external fixator for treating bone fractures is provided.
