According to the configuration of the present disclosure, the resilient contact piece does not interfere with the inserting end part of the circuit board in the process of moving the connection terminal from the retraction position to the connection position. In this way, the resilient contact piece is not plastically deformed or damaged due to interference with the inserting end part of the circuit board, wherefore a reduction in the connection reliability of the circuit board and the resilient contact piece can be prevented.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">(2) Preferably, the interference preventing portion is bent to make a resilient deformation amount of the resilient contact piece at the retraction position less than that of the resilient contact piece at the connection position. According to this configuration, even if a state where the connection terminal is at the retraction position remains for a long period of time, the settling of the resilient contact piece can be avoided.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">(3) In (2), preferably, the interference preventing portion has a guide surface inclined with respect to a moving direction of the connection terminal, and the resilient contact piece slides in contact with the guide surface in the process of moving the connection terminal from the retraction position to the protection position. As the connection terminal is moved from the retraction position to the connection position, the resilient deformation amount of the resilient contact piece increases. Since the resilient contact piece slides in contact with the guide surface inclined with respect to the moving direction of the connection terminal during this time, the resilient contact piece is smoothly resiliently deformed.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">(4) Preferably, the interference preventing portion holds the connection terminal so that the connection terminal does not move to the connection position by the resilient contact piece contacting the interference preventing portion. According to this configuration, since the interference preventing portion has both a function of preventing the interference of the resilient contact piece and the circuit board and a function of holding the connection terminal at the protection position, a dedicated part or member for holding the connection terminal at the protection position is unnecessary.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">(5) Preferably, a tubular member is provided which is mountable into and removable from the housing and is attached to the connection terminal, the connection terminal is relatively movable with respect to the tubular member between a position where the resilient contact piece is accommodated in the tubular member and a position where the resilient contact piece is exposed to outside of the tubular member, and the interference preventing portion is formed in the tubular member. According to this configuration, the resilient contact piece can be protected from the interference of external matters by the tubular member even if the connection terminal and the tubular member are removed from the housing.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">Details of Embodiment of Present Disclosure</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">One specific embodiment of a card edge connector C and terminal fittings T of the present disclosure is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>7</b></figref>.

The terminal fitting T inserted into the cavity <b>21</b> is held in a retained state by the locking engagement of the locking lance <b>22</b> with the retaining hole <b>56</b>. An inserting direction of the terminal fitting T into the cavity <b>21</b> is a direction parallel to the inserting direction of the circuit board <b>71</b> into the board accommodation space <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">With the terminal fitting T inserted in the cavity <b>21</b>, the front end side region <b>54</b>F of the bottom wall portion <b>54</b> of the protection terminal <b>50</b> is located to face the board accommodation space <b>20</b>. Since the connection hole <b>59</b> is also facing the board accommodation space <b>20</b>, the protection space <b>55</b> of the protection terminal <b>50</b> communicates with the board accommodation space <b>20</b> via the connection hole <b>59</b>. After the terminal fitting T is mounted into the housing <b>10</b>, the inserting end part <b>72</b> of the circuit board <b>71</b> is inserted into the board accommodation space <b>20</b>. At this time, since the resilient contact piece <b>36</b> of the terminal fitting T is not located in the board accommodation space <b>20</b>, the inserting end part <b>72</b> of the circuit board <b>71</b> does not interfere with the resilient contact piece <b>36</b>.

A height difference between the second guide surface <b>65</b> and the connection surface <b>73</b> is only the plate thickness of the second interfering portion.

At this time, the edge <b>74</b> of the inserting end part <b>72</b> of the circuit board <b>71</b> does not push the contact portion <b>38</b> against a resilient restoring force of the arm portion <b>37</b>, but the contact portion <b>38</b> only slides in contact with the edge <b>74</b> retracted forward of the housing <b>10</b> due to the resilient restoring force of the arm portion <b>37</b>.
