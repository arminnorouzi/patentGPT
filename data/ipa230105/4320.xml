The storage device outputs the stored data to provide a storage service to a user or another electronic apparatus. The storage device manages the stored data to perform various internal management operations such as improving data reliability, a security level, operation efficiency, and the like.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Processing and outputting a large amount of data rapidly at the storage device is advantageous to improve quality of service and user satisfaction. Accordingly, techniques for processing data requested by a user or another electronic system with high performance are required.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Example embodiments of the inventive concept provide a storage device and method that rapidly respond to a request for a memory operation (e.g., a read operation for outputting data stored in a storage device) of a high priority. The example embodiments enable the storage device to throttle or adjust an amount of communicated data depending on a suspension frequency of the operation.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to example embodiments, the storage device may include a memory and a controller.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to example embodiments, the controller may control the memory device such that, in response to a request for a first read operation on the memory while a first write operation is performed on the memory, the first write operation is suspended, and the first read operation is performed, the suspended first write operation is resumed after the first read operation is completed, and second write operation subsequent to the first write operation is performed on the memory after the resumed first write operation is completed. The controller may throttle an amount of data communicated to the memory device for the second write operation or for a second read operation subsequent to the first read operation, based on a frequency that the first write operation is suspended.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to example embodiments, the controller may communicate first data with the memory during a first time period, and communicate second data with the memory during a second time period after the first time period. The controller may adjust, based on a frequency that communication of the first data with the memory is suspended, an amount of the second data communicated with the memory per unit time.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to example embodiments, the controller may control the memory such that, while first operations are performed on the memory, in response to receiving requests for second operations on the memory, the first operations are suspended and the second operations are completed earlier than the first operations. The controller may adjust, based on a frequency that each of preceding first operations among the first operations is suspended, a manner of communicating data with the memory to perform following first operations, among the first operations, subsequent to respective ones of the preceding first operations. As the controller adjusts the manner of communicating the data with the memory device, suspensions of the first operations may be distributed over a time period of the whole first operations.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to example embodiments, the controller may control the memory such that, while a first operation is performed on the memory, when a second operation on the memory is requested, the first operation is suspended and the second operation is completed earlier than the first operation. The controller may monitor a frequency that the first operation is suspended. The controller may control the memory such that, based on the monitored frequency, data for a third operation subsequent to the first operation is communicated with the memory as much as a data amount or a bandwidth determined based on the monitored frequency.
