Advanced vehicle systems can perform such tasks as detecting and correcting a loss of traction on an icy road, self-parking, or detecting an imminent collision or unsafe driving condition and automatically making evasive maneuvers. Additionally, vehicles can include autonomous or semi-autonomous driving systems that assume all or part of real-time driving functions to operate the vehicle without real-time input.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Growth in autonomous or semi-autonomous car adoption is expected to accelerate significantly in the coming years and insurers will need to adapt quickly to the changes. Therefore, there is a benefit in the art for an enhanced method and device for calculating risks associated with vehicles operating in autonomous or semi-autonomous modes to determine insurance related costs, determine liabilities, mitigate risks, and provide drivers with proper insurance coverage.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The following presents a simplified summary in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the disclosure.

In response to a determination of an upcoming unsafe autonomous or semi-autonomous driving zone, the driver or system may take appropriate actions in response to the early notification.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Another aspect of the disclosure provides a method and device for calculating risks associated with vehicles operating in autonomous or semi-autonomous modes to determine insurance related costs, determine liabilities, mitigate risks, and provide drivers with proper insurance coverage is disclosed. Aspects of the disclosure further disclose determining a property of an insurance policy for coverage of a semi-autonomous vehicle. The property of the insurance policy may include a premium, deductible, coverage amount, or coverage term. The property of the insurance policy may take into account a level of autonomous vehicle control capability and an ability to switch back and forth between different control modes such as a non-autonomous mode, a semi-autonomous control mode, and a fully autonomous control mode.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In another aspect of the disclosure, insurance rates for a vehicle may change on a mile by mile basis. For example, usage based insurance rates may vary from mile to mile (or fraction thereof) depending on who is controlling the vehicle, where the vehicle is operated and under what conditions the vehicle is being driven. In an embodiment, usage based insurance may be subsidized by an OEM in case of autonomous or semi-autonomous mode of vehicle operation.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In accordance with an aspect of the disclosure, a computing system may determine for various route segments whether a driver should be in control of the vehicle or whether autonomous vehicle control is recommended. In an embodiment, compliance or non-compliance with the recommendation may determine insurance rate adjustments to policy premiums or pay per mile rates. In an embodiment, compliance may be determined based on a predetermined transition time period in which a driver needs to switch control of the vehicle after issuance of a change of control recommendation.

The system may receive various types of information, including but not limited to, accident information, geographic information, and vehicle operation information during all segments of a trip or on various segments of a trip. In an embodiment, the information may be used to determine liabilities at the time of an accident.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In an alternate embodiment in accordance with aspects of the disclosure, a personal navigation device, mobile device, personal computing device, and/or vehicle autonomous or semi-autonomous driving system may communicate with the database of risk values.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The devices may receive information about a travel route and use that information to retrieve risk values for road segments in the travel route. The aggregate of the risk values is sent for display on a screen of the device or for recording in the memory of the device. The contents of memory may also be uploaded to a data store for use by, e.g., insurance companies, to determine whether to adjust a quote for insurance coverage or one or more aspects of current insurance coverage such as premium, specific coverages, specific exclusions, rewards, special terms, etc.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In yet another embodiment, in accordance with aspects of the disclosure, a personal navigation device, mobile device, personal computing device, and/or vehicle autonomous or semi-autonomous driving system may access the database of risk values to assist in identifying and presenting alternate low-risk travel routes. The driver, operator, or autonomous driving system may select among the various travel routes presented, taking into account risk tolerance and/or cost of insurance. Depending on the route selection, the vehicle's insurance policy may be adjusted accordingly, for either the current insurance policy or a future insurance policy.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In certain embodiments, vehicle sensors, vehicle OBD, and/or vehicle communication systems, route risk determination systems disclosed herein, may collect, transmit, and/or receive data pertaining to autonomous driving of the vehicles. In autonomous driving, the vehicle fulfills all or part of the driving without being piloted by a driver. An autonomous car can be also referred to as a driverless car, self-driving car, or robot car. For example, in autonomous driving, a vehicle control computer may be configured to operate all or some aspects of the vehicle driving, including but not limited to acceleration, deceleration, steering, and/or route navigation. A vehicle with an autonomous driving capability may sense its surroundings using the vehicle sensors and/or receive inputs regarding control of the vehicle from the vehicle communications systems, including but not limited to short range communication systems, telematics, or other vehicle communication systems.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In certain embodiments, a vehicle may be driven in a semi-autonomous driving mode. A semi-autonomous driving mode may include an assist mode, a partial automation mode, a conditional automation mode, or a high automation mode.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In assist mode, a vehicle's computer-operated system may assist in emergency situations. The system takes over either steering or acceleration in specific modes using information about the driving environment. The driver may do everything else. Exemplary autonomous features in the assisted mode may include lane keeping automation, cruise control, electronic stability control, and automatic braking.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In partial automation mode, the automation system may take control of steering and acceleration in specific driving modes using information about the driving environment. The driver may do everything else. This mode may be beneficial in low speed environments, if there are no (or very few) intersections, and the driver is alert. Exemplary autonomous features in the partial automation mode may include traffic jam assist and adaptive cruise control, in addition to, or instead of, the autonomous features in the assisted mode.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In conditional automation, the system may perform all (or most) aspects of the dynamic driving task in specific driving modes. The driver may be available to respond to a request by the autonomous system to intervene. For example, the driver may be present in the driver's seat but would not have to stay alert to the driving environment. Exemplary autonomous features in the conditional automation mode may include a traffic jam autopilot system, in addition to, or instead of, the autonomous features in the partial automation mode.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In high automation mode, the system may perform all aspects of the dynamic driving task in specific driving modes, even if the driver does not respond appropriately to a request to intervene. For example, a full freeway autopilot system may be used. The driver, in some circumstances, may input a desired destination but might not be expected to take an active role in driving the vehicle. Exemplary autonomous features in the high automation mode may include a full freeway autopilot system, in addition to, or instead of, the autonomous features in the conditional automation mode.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">An example of a suitable operating environment in which various aspects of the disclosure may be implemented is shown in the architectural diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.

For example, in an embodiment, accident information categories can include an accident type, cause of accident, and/or probable cause of accident. For example, a cause of accident can include loss of control of vehicle and collision with wildlife. For example, a cause of accident or probable cause of accident can include excess speed and lack vehicle traction on the road.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Accident information associated with vehicle accidents may be stored in a database format and may be compiled per road or route segment. One skilled in the art will understand that the term segment may be interchangeably used to describe a road or route segment, including but not limited to an intersection, round about, bridge, tunnel, ramp, parking lot, railroad crossing, or other feature that a vehicle may encounter along a route.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Some examples of geographic information include, but are not limited to, location information and attribute information. Examples of attribute information include, but are not limited to, information about characteristics of a corresponding location described by some location information: posted speed limit, construction area indicator (i.e., whether location has construction), topography type (e.g., flat, rolling hills, steep hills, etc.), road type (e.g., residential, interstate, 4-lane separated highway, city street, country road, parking lot, etc.), road feature (e.g., intersection, gentle curve, blind curve, bridge, tunnel), number of intersections, whether a roundabout is present, number of railroad crossings, whether a passing zone is present, whether a merge is present, number of lanes, width of road/lanes, population density, condition of road (e.g., new, worn, severely damaged with sink-holes, severely damaged with erosion, road damage with potholes, gravel, dirt, paved, etc.), wildlife area, state, county, and/or municipality. Geographic information may also include other attribute information about road segments, intersections, bridges, tunnels, railroad crossings, and other roadway features.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Location information for an intersection may include the latitude and longitude (e.g., geographic coordinates) of the geometric center of the intersection. The location may be described in other embodiments using a closest address to the actual desired location or intersection. The intersection (i.e., location information) may also include information that describes the geographic boundaries, for example, of the intersection which includes all information that is associated within a circular area defined by the coordinates of the center of the intersection and points within a specified radius of the center. In another example of location information, a road segment may be defined by the latitude and longitude of its endpoints and/or an area defined by the road shape and a predetermined offset that forms a polygon. Segments may comprise intersections, bridges, tunnels, rail road crossings or other roadway types and features. Those skilled in the art will recognize that segments can be defined in many ways without departing from the spirit of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Some examples of vehicle information include, but are not limited to, information that describes vehicles that are associated with incidents (e.g., vehicle accidents, etc.) at a particular location (e.g., a location corresponding to location information describing a segment, intersection, etc.) Vehicle information may include vehicle make, vehicle model, vehicle year, and age. Vehicle information may also include information collected through one or more in-vehicle devices or systems such as an event data recorder (EDR), onboard diagnostic system, global positioning satellite (GPS) device, vehicle autonomous driving system; examples of this information include speed at impact, brakes applied, throttle position, direction at impact, whether the vehicle is engaged in manual or autonomous driving.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In addition, driver behavior information may also be collected and utilized. Driver behavior information may include information about the driver of a vehicle being driven at the time of an incident. Other examples of driver information may include age, gender, marital status, occupation, alcohol level in blood, credit score, distance from home, cell phone usage (i.e., whether the driver was using a cell phone at the time of the incident), number of occupants.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In one embodiment in accordance with aspects of the disclosure, a data source <b>104</b> may provide the computing device <b>102</b> with accident information that is used to generate values (e.g., create new values and/or update existing values). The computing device <b>102</b> may use at least part of the received accident information to calculate a value, associate the value with a road segment (or other location information), and store the value in a database format. One skilled in the art will appreciate, after thorough review of the entirety of the disclosure herein, that there may be other types of information that may be useful in generating a database of values for use in, among other things, calculating an estimated route risk.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">For example, in accordance with aspects of the disclosure, a data source <b>104</b> may provide the computing device <b>102</b> with geographic information that is used to generate new roadway feature risk values in a database of risk values and/or update existing risk values; where the roadway feature may comprise intersections, road segments, tunnels, bridges, or railroad crossings. Attributes associated with roadways may also be used in part to generate risk values. The computing device <b>102</b> may use at least part of the received geographic information to calculate a value, associate the value with a road segment (or other location information), and store the value in a database format. Numerous examples of geographic information were provided above. For example, a computing device <b>102</b> may receive geographic information corresponding to a road segment comprising accident information and roadway feature information and then calculate a risk value. Therefore, when calculating a risk value, the system may use, in one example, the geographic information and the accident information (if any accident information is provided). In alternative embodiments in accordance with aspects of the disclosure, the computing device may use accident information, geographic information, vehicle information, and/or other information, either alone or in combination, in calculating risk values in a database format.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The values generated by the computing device <b>102</b> may be associated with a road segment containing the accident location and stored in a data store. Similar to a point of interest (POI) stored in GPS systems, a point of risk (POR) is a road segment or point on a map that has risk information associated with it. Points of risk may arise because incidents (e.g., accidents) have occurred at these points before. In accordance with aspects of the disclosure, the road segment may be a predetermined length (e.g., &#xbc; mile) on a stretch of road. Alternatively, road segments may be points (i.e., where the predetermined length is minimal) on a road. Furthermore, in some embodiments, road segment may include one or more different roads that are no farther than a predetermined radius from a road segment identifier. Such an embodiment may be beneficial in a location, for example, where an unusually large number of streets intersect, and it may be impractical to designate a single road for a road segment.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, in accordance with aspects of the disclosure, a computing device <b>102</b> may receive accident information (in step <b>202</b>), geographic information (in step <b>204</b>), and/or vehicle information (in step <b>206</b>). The computing device <b>102</b> may calculate (in step <b>212</b>) the risk value for a road segment (or point of risk) by applying actuarial techniques to the information that may be received from data sources <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>. In one embodiment, the computing device <b>102</b> receives and stores the accident information in a data store with the latitude/longitude and time of the incident. The accident data is associated with a location and combined with other accident data associated with the same location (in step <b>210</b>). Applying actuarial and/or statistical modeling techniques involving multiple predictors, such as generalized linear models and non-linear models, a risk value may be calculated (<b>212</b>), and the calculated risk value may be recorded in memory (<b>116</b>) (in step <b>214</b>). The multiple predictors involved in the statistical model used to calculate a risk value may include accident information, geographic information, and vehicle information, including whether the vehicle was operating autonomously or manually at the time of the accident. Associating the risk value (in step <b>208</b>) with a line segment and/or point which best pinpoints the area of the road in which the incident(s) occurred may be accomplished by using established GIS locating technology (e.g., GPS ascertaining a geographically determinable address, and assigning the data file to a segment's or intersection's formal address determined by the system). For example, two or more accidents located in an intersection or road segment may have slightly different addresses depending on where within the intersection or segment the accident location was determined to be. Therefore, the system may identify a location based on business rules. In another example, business rules may identify an incident location using the address of the nearest intersection. In yet another example, the system may identify the location of an incident on a highway using segments based on mileage markers or the lengths may be dynamically determined by creating segment lengths based on relatively equal normalized risk values. Therefore, roadways that have stretches with higher numbers of accidents may have shorter segments than stretches that have fewer accidents. In another example, if the incident occurred in a parking lot, the entire parking lot may be associated with a formal address that includes all accidents located within a determined area. One skilled in the art will appreciate after review of the entirety of the disclosure that road segment includes a segment of road, a point on a road, and other designations of a location (e.g., an entire parking lot).</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">For example, an insurance claim-handling processor may collect data about numerous incidents such as collision, theft, weather damage, and other events that cause any one of (or combination of) personal injury, vehicle damage, and damage to other vehicles or property. Information about the accident may be collected through artifacts such as first notice of loss (FNOL) reports and claim adjuster reports and may be stored in one or more data stores used by the insurer. Other data may also be collected at the point and time when the incident occurred, and this information (e.g., weather conditions, traffic conditions, vehicle speed, etc.) may be stored with the other accident information. The information in these data stores may be distributed by data sources <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> in accordance with aspects of the disclosure. In addition, some information may also be recorded in third-party data sources that may be accessible to one or more insurance companies. For example, traffic information (e.g., traffic volume) and weather information may be retrieved in real-time (or near real-time) from their respective data sources.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, in accordance with aspects of the disclosure, the computing device <b>102</b> may send (in step <b>312</b>) the risk value corresponding to a road segment when it receives location information (in step <b>302</b>) requesting the risk associated with a particular location. The particular location information may be in the form of longitude/latitude coordinates, street address, intersection, closest address, or other form of information. Furthermore, in an alternative embodiment, the accuracy of the risk value may be improved by submitting the direction that a vehicle travels (or may travel) through a road segment. The computing device <b>102</b> may receive (in step <b>304</b>) the vehicle direction and use it to determine the risk value associated with the vehicle route. For example, a dangerous intersection demonstrates high risk to a vehicle/driver that passes through it. However, actuarial analysis (e.g., of data showing many recorded accidents at the location) may show that it is more dangerous if the driver is traveling northbound on the road segment and turns left. Therefore, the vehicle direction may also be considered when retrieving the appropriate risk value (in step <b>310</b>).</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Likewise, the computing device <b>102</b> may also receive (in step <b>308</b>) other information to enhance the accuracy of the risk value associated with a travel route. For example, the computing device <b>102</b> may receive (in step <b>306</b>) the time of day when the driver is driving (or plans to drive) through a particular travel route. This information may improve the accuracy of the risk value retrieved (in step <b>310</b>) for the travel route. For example, a particular segment of road through a wilderness area may have a higher rate of accidents involving deer during the night hours, but no accidents during the daylight hours. Therefore, the time of day may also be considered when retrieving the appropriate risk value (in step <b>310</b>). In addition, the computing device may receive (in step <b>308</b>) other information to improve the accuracy of the risk value retrieved (in step <b>310</b>) for a travel route. Some examples of this other information include, but are not limited to, the vehicle's speed (e.g., a vehicle without a sport suspension attempting to take a dangerous curve at a high speed), vehicle's speed compared to the posted speed limit, etc.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In accordance with aspects of the disclosure, a computer-readable medium storing computer-executable instructions for performing the steps depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref> and/or described in the present disclosure is contemplated. The computer-executable instructions may be configured for execution by a processor (e.g., processor <b>114</b> in computing device <b>102</b>) and stored in a memory (e.g., memory <b>116</b> in computing device <b>102</b>). Furthermore, as explained earlier, the computer-readable medium may be embodied in a non-volatile memory (e.g., in a memory in personal navigation device <b>110</b>) or portable media (e.g., CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, USB flash, etc. connected to personal computing device <b>108</b>).</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In accordance with aspects of the disclosure, a personal navigation device <b>110</b> may calculate a route risk value for a travel route of a vehicle. The personal navigation device <b>110</b> may be located, for example, in a driver's vehicle, as a component of an autonomous driving system, or in a mobile device <b>112</b> with location tracking capabilities. Alternatively, a personal computing device <b>108</b> may be used to calculate the route risk value for a travel route of a vehicle.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a personal navigation device <b>110</b> may receive (in step <b>402</b>) travel route information. The travel route information may include, but is not limited to, a start location, end location, road-by-road directions, and/or turn-by-turn directions. The personal navigation device <b>110</b> may use the travel route information and mapping software to determine the road segment upon which the vehicle will travel, and retrieve (in step <b>404</b>) the risk value for that road segment. For each subsequent road segment remaining in the travel route (see step <b>406</b>), the personal navigation device <b>110</b> may access the database of risk values to retrieve (in step <b>404</b>) the risk value for that road segment. As explained earlier, the database of risk values may be stored locally to the personal navigation device <b>110</b>, or may be stored remotely and accessed through a wired/wireless link to the data store.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The risk values retrieved (in step <b>404</b>) for the travel route may be aggregated (in step <b>408</b>) and a total risk value for the travel route may be sent (in step <b>410</b>). In an alternate embodiment, the computing device <b>102</b> may count the number of each type of road risk along the travel route based on the values stored in the database. This number may then be multiplied by a risk-rating factor for the respective risk type. A risk type may comprise intersections, locations of past accidents along a route, railroad crossings, merges, roadway class (residential, local, commercial, rural, highways, limited access highways). Other risk types may include proximity to businesses that sell alcohol, churches or bingo parlors.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The sum of this product over all risk types may, in this alternate embodiment, equal the total route risk value. The total route risk value may be divided by the distance traveled to determine the route risk category for the travel route. For example, a route risk category may be assigned based on a set of route risk value ranges for low, medium, and high risk routes.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">After being aggregated, the total risk value may be sent (in step <b>410</b>) to a viewable display on the personal navigation device <b>110</b>. Alternatively, the total risk value may be sent (in step <b>410</b>) to a local/remote memory where it may be recorded and/or monitored. For example, it may be desirable for a safe driver to have her total risk value for all travel routes traveled over a time period to be uploaded to an insurance company's data store.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In step <b>411</b>, personal navigation device <b>110</b> or other device may determine whether the vehicle is currently being driven in autonomous, semi-autonomous mode, or non-autonomous mode.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The insurance company may then identify the driver as a lower-risk driver (e.g., a driver that travels on statistically lower-risk routes in the recommended driving mode during lower-risk times) and provide the driver/vehicle with a discount and/or credit (in step <b>412</b>) on an existing insurance policy (or towards a future insurance policy). At least one benefit of the aforementioned is that safe drivers and/or operators having safe autonomous driving systems are rewarded appropriately, while high-risk drivers and operators of autonomous vehicles are treated accordingly.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In some embodiments in accordance with aspects of the disclosure, the route risk value sent (in step <b>410</b>) may be in the form of a number rating the risk of the travel route (e.g., a rating of 1 to 100 where 1 is very low risk and 100 is very high risk). Alternatively, the route risk value may be in the form of a predetermined category (e.g., low risk, medium risk, and high risk). At least one benefit of displaying the route risk value in this form is the simplicity of the resulting display for the driver. For example, an enhanced GPS unit may display a route (or segment of a route) in a red color to designate a high risk route, and a route may be displayed in a green color to designate a lower risk route. At least one benefit of a predetermined category for the route risk value is that it may be used as the means for comparing the amount of risk associated with each travel route when providing alternate routes. In addition, the enhanced GPS unit may alert the driver of a high risk road segment and offer the driver an incentive (e.g., monetary incentive, points, etc.) for avoiding that segment.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In accordance with aspects of the disclosure, a computer-readable medium storing computer-executable instructions for performing the steps depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b></figref> and/or described in the present disclosure is contemplated. The computer-executable instructions may be configured for execution by a processor (e.g., a processor in personal navigation device <b>110</b>) and stored in a memory (e.g., flash memory in device <b>110</b>).</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In accordance with aspects of the disclosure, a computing device <b>102</b> may receive real-time accident information, geographic information, and/or vehicle information and determine liability for the accident. In an embodiment, liability for the accident may be assigned to a single party such as the driver or may be shared among multiple parties.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">For example, in an autonomous vehicle setting where the autonomous vehicle was in control of driving, the OEM of the equipment may be liable if the autonomous vehicle equipment fails and an accident is caused due to the failure of the OEM equipment. In another embodiment, a government agency or private entity may be liable if the accident was caused by negligence on the part of a government agency or private entity (i.e. road surface not properly maintained).</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In another embodiment, computing device <b>102</b> may determine based on received data that a driver failed to take control of the vehicle when required or failed to react to early warning signs of route risk. In such a scenario, computing device <b>102</b> based on all received data may determine that the driver is liable for an accident.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In another embodiment, computing device <b>102</b> may determine that liability is to be shared among multiple different entities along a sliding scale. For instance, computing device <b>102</b> may determine that liability for damage should be shared among several entities depending upon autonomous level of the vehicle at and before the accident.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, in accordance with aspects of the disclosure, the computing device <b>102</b> may receive (in step <b>502</b>) information regarding who is in control of the vehicle at a given point of time during a trip segment. For example, computing device <b>102</b> may receive autonomous level information corresponding to which mode of control is utilized (non-autonomous control mode, semi-autonomous control mode, or fully autonomous control mode.) during various segments of a trip. In another embodiment involving a multi-vehicle accident, computing device <b>102</b> may receive information from all or some of the vehicles involved, the information may include autonomous level information for each of the involved vehicles.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The computing device <b>102</b> may receive (in step <b>504</b>) the time of day when the driver is driving through a particular travel route. This information may be used in the determination of liability. For example, driving at night without lights would increase chances of having an accident due to decreased visibility of the road.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The computing device <b>102</b> may receive (in step <b>506</b>) location information regarding the vehicle associated with an accident. The particular location information may be in the form of longitude/latitude coordinates, street address, intersection, closest address, or other form of information. In an embodiment, the location information may also include vehicle direction of travel just prior to any accident.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The computing device <b>102</b> may also receive (in step <b>508</b>) vehicle information and/or driver behavior information. Some examples of vehicle information include, but are not limited to, vehicle make, vehicle model, vehicle year, and age. Vehicle information may also include information collected through one or more in-vehicle devices or systems such as an event data recorder (EDR), onboard diagnostic system, vehicle autonomous driving system; examples of this information include speed at impact, brakes applied, throttle position, direction at impact, whether the vehicle is engaged in manual or autonomous driving.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Driver behavior information may include information about the driver of a vehicle being driven at the time of an incident. Other examples of driver information may include age, gender, marital status, occupation, alcohol level in blood, credit score, distance from home, cell phone usage (i.e., whether the driver was using a cell phone at the time of the incident), number of occupants. In another embodiment involving a multi-vehicle accident, computing device <b>102</b> may receive information from all or some of the vehicles involved, the information may include vehicle information associated with each of the involved vehicles.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In addition, computing device <b>102</b> may receive (in step <b>510</b>) other information to improve the accuracy of any determined liability. Some examples of this other information include, but are not limited to, the vehicle's speed (e.g., a vehicle without a sport suspension attempting to take a dangerous curve at a high speed), vehicle's speed compared to the posted speed limit, etc. Other examples of other information that may be received include the determination of risk values and accident information.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Computing device <b>102</b> may (in step <b>512</b>) determine liability for an accident. The determination of liability may be allocated to more than one party in various percentages. For example, liability may be allocated among multiple parties, including (1) the driver, (2) other driver or drivers, (3) owner of vehicle, (4) pedestrians, (5) manufacturers (or servicers) of malfunctioning autonomous features (e.g., malfunctioning autonomous steering, braking, and/or speed control), (6) manufacturers (or servicers) of malfunctioning roadway infrastructure and/or (7) third parties that illegally accesses (e.g., hack) the vehicle's autonomous driving system.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Computing device <b>102</b> may (in step <b>514</b>) communicate liability for an accident to all interested parties. The liability information may be used to determine or update usage based insurance premiums or policies for semi-autonomous vehicles.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In some aspects, a driver may be primarily liable if the driver overrides the autonomous system or automated system warnings and causes an accident by initiating manual driving features. The manufacturer of an autonomous feature (e.g., autonomous steering) may be liable if the autonomous feature malfunctions and causes an accident. No-fault coverage may be used if an &#x201c;Act of God,&#x201d; such as severe weather or other interference, confuses the sensors in the vehicle, causing an accident during autonomous driving mode.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">When retrieving risk values, in accordance with aspects of the disclosure, one or more techniques, either alone or in combination, may be used for identifying and calculating the appropriate risk value for road segments. For example, under an accident cost severity rating (ACSR) approach, each point of risk has a value which measures how severe the average accident is for each point of risk. The value may be normalized and/or scaled by adjusting the range of the values. For example, under an ACSR approach using a range of values from 1 to 10: considering all accidents that occur in a predetermined area (e.g., road segment, state, zip code, municipality, etc.), the accidents in the top ten percentile of expensive accidents in that territory would get a 10 value and the lowest 10 percentile of costly accidents in that region would get a 1 value. The actual loss cost may be calculated by summing the various itemized loss costs (e.g., bodily injury, property damage, medical/personal injury protection, collision, comprehensive, uninsured/underinsured motorist, rental reimbursement, towing, etc.).</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In an alternate embodiment, the ACSR approach may attribute varying weights to the different types of loss costs summed to calculate the actual loss cost. For example, after analyzing the information, certain portions of a loss cost (e.g., medical cost) may indicate risk more accurately than others. The importance of these portions may be weighted more heavily in the final loss cost calculation. Actuarial methods may be used to adjust loss cost data for a segment where a fluke accident may cause the calculated risk value to far exceed the risk value based on all the other data.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Under the accidents per year (APYR) approach, in accordance with aspects of the disclosure, each point of risk has a risk value that may reflect the average number of accidents a year for that individual point of risk. Under a modified APYR approach, the risk value for a point of risk continues to reflect the average number of accidents a year, but attributes a lesser weight to accidents that occurred a longer time ago, similar to time relevancy validation (e.g., it gives emphasis to recent accident occurrences over older occurrences).</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Under the risk severity (RSR) approach, in accordance with aspects of the disclosure, each point of risk has a risk value that may reflect the severity of risk for that individual point of risk. For example, an intersection that is a frequent site of vehicle accident related deaths may warrant a very high risk value under the RSR approach. In one embodiment, risk severity rating may be based on accident frequency at intersections or in segments over a determined period of time. In another embodiment, the rating may be based on loss costs associated to intersections and segments. Yet another embodiment may combine accident frequency and severity to form a rating for a segment or intersection. One skilled in the art can recognize that risk severity ratings may be based on one or a combination of factors associated with intersections or segments.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Under the Environmental Risk Variable (ERV) approach, in accordance with aspects of the disclosure, each point of risk has a risk value that may reflect any or all information that is not derived from recorded accidents and/or claims, but that may be the (direct or indirect) cause of an accident. In one embodiment, the risk value under the ERV approach may be derived from vehicle information transmitted by a data source <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In an alternate embodiment, the EVR approach may use compound variables based on the presence or absence of multiple risk considerations which are known to frequently, or severely, cause accidents. A compound variable is one that accounts for the interactions of multiple risk considerations, whether environmental or derived from recorded accidents and/or claims. For example, driving through a wildlife crossing zone at dusk would generate a greater risk value than driving through this same area at noon. The interaction of time of day and location would be the compound variable. Another example may consider current weather conditions, time of day, day of the year, and topography of the road. A compound variable may be the type of infrequent situation which warrants presenting a verbal warning to a driver (e.g., using a speaker system in a personal navigation device <b>110</b> mounted in a vehicle) of a high risk route (e.g., a high risk road segments).</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Another possible approach may be to calculate the route risk value using one or more of the approaches described above divided by the length of the route traveled. This may provide an average route risk value for use in conjunction with a mileage rating plan. In one embodiment, the system combines route risk and conventional mileage data to calculate risk per mile rating.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In one embodiment, a device in a vehicle (e.g., personal navigation device <b>110</b>, mobile device <b>112</b>, etc.) may record and locally store the route and/or the route and time during which a route was traveled. This travel route information may be uploaded via wireless/wired means (e.g., cell phones, manually using a computer port, etc.). This travel route information may be used to automatically query a data source <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> for route rating information and calculate a total risk value.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Some accident data may be recorded and locally stored on a device (e.g., personal navigation device <b>110</b>, mobile device <b>112</b>, etc.) that provides incident location and a timestamp that can be used to synchronize other data located in data sources <b>104</b> and <b>106</b>. The captured information may be periodically uploaded to computing device <b>102</b> for further processing of accident data for updating the road segment database in memory <b>116</b>. In some embodiments, the other data may include local weather conditions, vehicle density on the roadway, and traffic signal status. Additional information comprising data from an in-vehicle monitoring system (e.g., event data recorder or onboard diagnostic system) may record operational status of the vehicle at the time of the incident. Alternatively, if the vehicle did not have a location tracking device, an insurance claims reporter may enter the address and other information into the data source manually. If the vehicle was configured with an in-vehicle monitoring system that has IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi capabilities (or any other wireless communication capabilities), the travel route information may be periodically uploaded or uploaded in real-time (or near real-time) via a computer and/or router. The in-vehicle monitoring system may be configured to automatically upload travel route information (and other information) through a home wireless router to a computer. In some advanced monitoring systems, weather and traffic data (and other useful information) may be downloaded (in real-time or near real-time) to the vehicle. In some embodiments, it may be desirable to use mobile devices <b>112</b> (with the requisite capabilities) to transmit the information, provide GPS coordinates, and stream in data from other sources.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The risk types described above may be variables in a multivariate model of insurance losses, frequencies, severities, and/or pure premiums. Interactions of the variables would also be considered. The coefficient the model produces for each variable (along with the coefficient for any interaction terms) would be the value to apply to each risk type. The personal navigation device <b>110</b> may initially provide the quickest/shortest route from a start location A to an end location B, and then determine the route risk value by determining either the sum product of the number of each risk type and the value for that risk type or the overall product of the number of each risk type and the value for that risk type. (Traffic and weather conditions could either be included or excluded from the determination of the route risk value for comparison of routes. If not included, an adjustment may be made to the route risk value once the route has been traveled). The driver may be presented with an alternate route which is less risky than the initial route calculated. The personal navigation device <b>110</b> may display the difference in risk between the alternate routes and permit the driver to select the preferred route. In some embodiments in accordance with the disclosure, a driver/vehicle may be provided a monetary benefit (e.g., a credit towards a future insurance policy) for selecting a less risky route.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In one example in accordance with aspects of the disclosure, a driver may enter a starting location and an end location into a personal navigation device <b>110</b>, including a personal navigation device of an autonomous driving system. The personal navigation device <b>110</b> may present the driver with an illustrative 2-mile route that travels on a residential road near the following risks: 5 intersections, 3 past accident sites, 1 railroad crossing, and 1 lane merging site.

For example, the personal navigation device <b>110</b> (or other device) may record the route taken, as well as the time of day/month/year, weather conditions, traffic conditions, and the actual speed driven compared to the posted speed limit. The current weather and traffic conditions may be recorded from a data source <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>. Weather conditions and traffic conditions may be categorized to determine the risk type to apply. The posted speed limits may be included in the geographic information. For each segment of road with a different posted speed limit, the actual speed driven may be compared to the posted speed limit. The difference may be averaged over the entire distance of the route. In addition, various techniques may be used to handle the amount of time stopped in traffic, at traffic lights, etc. One illustrative technique may be to only count the amount of time spent driving over the speed limit and determine the average speed over the speed limit during that time. Another illustrative method may be to exclude from the total amount of time the portion where the vehicle is not moving. Then, upon completion of the trip, the route risk value may be calculated and stored in memory along with the other information related to the route risk score and mileage traveled. This information may later be transmitted to an insurance company's data store, as was described above.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0089">In another embodiment in accordance with aspects of the disclosure, real time data may be used to dynamically assign risk values to each point of risk. For example, some road segments may have a higher risk value when a vehicle travels through at a time when, e.g., snowfall is heavy. In such situations, a dynamic risk value may be applied to the road segment to determine the appropriate route risk value to assign to the route.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0090">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, in accordance with aspects of the disclosure, a method of selling a vehicular insurance policy is illustrated. A vehicle owner or driver may be provided (in step <b>602</b>) with an insurance policy with a total risk score. The total risk score (e.g., 500) indicates the quantity of risk the vehicle is permitted to travel through before the insurance policy must be renewed or becomes terminated. For example, as the vehicle is driven over various travel routes, the route risk values for the road segments traveled are deducted (in step <b>604</b>) from the total risk score of the insurance policy. The vehicle owner and/or driver may be provided (in step <b>606</b>) an option to renew the insurance policy (e.g., to purchase additional risk points to apply towards the total risk score of the insurance policy). Once the total risk score falls to zero or under (see step <b>608</b>), the vehicle owner and/or driver (or any other person/entity authorized to renew the policy) is provided (in step <b>610</b>) with a final option to renew the insurance policy before the insurance policy terminates (in step <b>612</b>). It will be apparent to one skilled in the art after review of the entirety of the disclosure that the embodiment illustrated above may benefit from a personal navigation device <b>110</b> (or similar device) to monitor and record the route traveled by a vehicle. At least one benefit of the insurance policy illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is the ability to pay per quantity of risk consumed instead of paying only a fixed premium.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0091">In another embodiment in accordance with aspects of the disclosure, route-dependent pricing uses route risk values to adjust insurance pricing based on where a vehicle is driven. Contrary to the embodiment above where the vehicle's insurance policy terminated dependent on the quantity of risk consumed by the vehicle's travel route, in this embodiment, an insurance company (or its representatives, e.g., agent) may adjust the price quoted/charged for an insurance policy based on risk consumed. In this embodiment, a vehicle/driver may be categorized into a risk class (e.g., low-risk, medium-risk, high risk, etc.) and charged for insurance accordingly. For example, the vehicle/driver may be provided with notification of a credit/debit if the vehicle consumed less/more, respectively, of risk at the end of a policy term than was initially purchased.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0092">In another embodiment: the insurance policy is sold and priced in part based on where a customer falls within a three sigma distribution of risk units consumed by all insured per a typical policy period. The policy pricing may be based on an initial assumption of risk to be consumed in the prospective policy period or may be based on risk consumed in a preceding policy period. In a case where the number of risk units consumed is greater than estimated, the customer may be billed for the overage at the end of (or during) the policy period. In yet another embodiment, the system may be provided as a pay-as-you-drive coverage where the customer is charged in part based on the actual risk units consumed in the billing cycle. The system may include a telematics device that monitors, records, and periodically transmits the consumption of risk units to processor <b>114</b> that may automatically bill or deduct the cost from an account.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0093">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, in another embodiment, an analysis of historical accident information can be performed to determine whether autonomous or manual driving over a travel route provides less risk of accident. In an embodiment, a travel route for an autonomous vehicle is received by the system (step <b>702</b>). An analysis of historical accident information is performed for the travel route. The analysis includes identifying accident information for vehicles engaged in autonomous driving over the travel route and accident information for vehicles engaged in manual driving over the travel route. An autonomous route risk value for the travel route is determined using historical accident information of autonomous vehicles engaged in autonomous driving over the travel route (step <b>704</b>). A manual route risk value for the travel route is determined using historical accident information for vehicles engaged in manual driving over the travel route (step <b>706</b>). The autonomous route risk value and the manual route risk value is compared to determine whether autonomous driving or manual driving provides less risk of accident over the travel route (step <b>708</b>). The determination for the travel route can be stored in a database (step <b>710</b>) for use in, for example, future risk assessments of the travel route, making driving determinations for an autonomous vehicle over the travel route, and/or making manual driving decisions over the travel route. For example, in an embodiment, the determination of whether autonomous or manual driving provides less risk of accident over the travel route can be sent in a notification to the driver/operator of the autonomous vehicle (step <b>712</b>).</p><p id="p-0097" num="0094">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, in an embodiment, historical accident information can be used to adjust driving actions of an autonomous vehicle over a travel route in order to avoid accidents which have occurred over the travel route. In an embodiment, a travel route for an autonomous vehicle can be received or identified (step <b>802</b>). Historical accident information for the travel route can be analyzed (step <b>804</b>) to, for example, determine accident types which occurred over the travel route. The analysis can identify accidents which occurred while driving manually or autonomously (step <b>806</b>) over the travel route. The analysis can include determining causes and/or probable causes of the accident types which occur over the travel route (step <b>808</b>). In response to determining accident types and causes/probable causes of the accident types over the travel route, adjustments can be made to the driving actions planned for the autonomous vehicle over the travel route (step <b>810</b>). The adjustments can be made based on the causes/probable causes of the accident types in order to avoid the accident types during travel over the travel route. For example, when a cause/probable cause of an accident type over a travel route is determined to be excess speed, the adjustment of driving actions planned for the autonomous vehicle can include a reduction of speed of travel of the autonomous vehicle over the travel route. In addition, for example, when a cause/probable cause of an accident type over a travel route is determined to be lack of vehicle traction on the road, the adjustment of driving actions planned for the autonomous vehicle can include engagement of an all-wheel-drive function of the autonomous vehicle over the travel route. In addition, for example, when a cause/probable cause of an accident type over a travel route is determined to be a wildlife crossing, the adjustment of driving actions planned for the autonomous vehicle can include reduction of a speed of travel and preparations for sudden braking and/or evasive maneuvers over the travel route.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0095">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, in an embodiment, historical accident information can be used to analyze available travel routes and select a route which presents less risk of accident than others. In an embodiment, at least two travel routes can be received by a risk analysis system (step <b>902</b>). A route risk value can be determined for each of the travel routes (step <b>904</b>). The route risk values for each travel route can be compared to determine which route provides less risk of accident over another (step <b>906</b>). A driver or autonomous driving system can select a travel route on the basis that it provides less risk of accident than another travel route (step <b>908</b>).</p><p id="p-0099" num="0096">In another aspect of the disclosure, based on the determined route risk values for road segments along a route to be traveled, a determination of non-autonomous driving areas may be generated and displayed to the driver. In an embodiment, a notification may be given to a driver that a non-autonomous area of driving is approaching. An early indication that a recommended switch to a non-autonomous mode of driving is approaching may give the driver sufficient time to react and take over manual control in unsafe zones and vice-versa let the vehicle operate in autonomous or semi-autonomous mode in safe zones.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0097">In an aspect of the disclosure, unsafe driving conditions may be determined by real time vehicle-to-vehicle, vehicle-to-infrastructure information reporting and/or historical information. These safety management services may be delivered to each vehicle specifically within the area of operation. This may ensure that each vehicle, enabled with this technology and operating within a designated driver mode required zone, is under control of the driver alerted to the change in driving mode. In an embodiment, important safety sensors may remain active while the driver takes over control of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0098">In an aspect of the disclosure, an autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicle may also use its vehicle sensors and information from third parties along with the determined route risk values to determine that it is approaching a road segment where autonomous mode is not advised. In an embodiment, the vehicle may notify the driver in a variety of ways such as through an audio notification in the vehicle, a visual cue or flashing lights inside the vehicle, vehicle horn, an application running on the driver's mobile device and in numerous other ways. For example, a driver may hear a warning message such as &#x201c;Safe/unsafe autonomous/non-autonomous driving zone starting in one mile ahead and continuing for the next ten miles thereafter, recommend switching control mode.&#x201d; In an embodiment, a driver may take over control of the vehicle and notify the vehicle that they have taken control. A driver notification to the vehicle that the driver has taken control may be through some sort of physical act such as by moving the steering wheel or applying pressure to the gas or brake pedal, activating a button on the dashboard, or through a mobile device application or some other affirmative response.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0099">In an embodiment, safe/unsafe autonomous driving zones may be polygonal, linear, or point based features. For example, a polygonal feature may represent a flood area that contains high water on the roadway, a linear feature may represent a section of road that has high pedestrian activity such as a sporting event that has finished, and a point feature may represent an intersection that has lost power with police directing traffic. In an embodiment, a vehicle may reroute around determined unsafe zones to avoid unsafe road segments. For instance, the vehicle may avoid road segments determined to be experiencing flooding or other hazards conditions. In another embodiment, the vehicle may take action to place itself and its driver into a safe autonomous mode should the driver fail to respond and take over control of the vehicle within a predetermined time frame.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0100">In an aspect of the disclosure, a driver may choose to preset preferences for how the vehicle should respond if the driver fails to respond to the early warning notification. In one example, the vehicle may perform a safe stop ahead of a manual driving area if the driver fails to take control of the vehicle. Other examples of how the vehicle may react if a driver fails to take control of the vehicle include but are not limited to: (1) taking a different route, (2) slowing down but not stopping, (3) taking actions to get the vehicle into a safe autonomous mode, (4) pretension vehicle seat-belts or brakes in case the vehicle needs to stop suddenly, (5) pass control of the vehicle to another driver remotely (e.g. (a) vehicle becomes a drone and follows the vehicle directly in front of it, (b) gives control to another person in the vehicle who gives verbal instructions to the vehicle), (6) engage in additional heighted analysis (use other vehicles) to analyze road segments and environment more closely (the heightened analysis may come from information collected by other vehicles or infrastructure and received by the vehicles onboard computer systems, (7) the vehicle may have preset preferences based on a driver's characteristics or preference to take different actions depending on the circumstances, (8) lock doors in high crime areas, and (8) pull over or slow down for emergency vehicles.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0101">In another embodiment, preset preferences may also be used to determine (a) when to use or not use autonomous mode, (b) how to preset safety features in the vehicle (tension seat belts). In an embodiment, sensor failure or sensor degradation may cause the vehicle to need to be placed into a non-autonomous mode. If a driver ignores or consistently ignores non-autonomous mode early notification signals, insurance rates may change along with policy coverages. In some cases, only a certain percentage of vehicles in a given area need to be non-autonomous (e.g., 80% or more non-autonomous). For cars that remain in autonomous mode, the driver may pay a higher rate.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0102">In an aspect of the disclosure, preset preferences may be used to have a vehicle behave in a certain manner when encountering or approaching certain predefined areas such as school zones, railroad crossing, or in areas with nearby stadiums during scheduled performances. In an embodiment during a driving event, a driver may be notified of the approaching school zones, rail road crossing, or stadium proximities.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0103">In an aspect of the disclosure, a driver may fail to take control of a vehicle when requested for a number of reasons including a medical emergency such as a heart attack or stroke. In an embodiment, a vehicle upon determining the cause for the lack of driver response (via sensors described above) may proceed to stop the vehicle and contact emergency responders.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0104">In another aspect of the disclosure, a vehicle may notify third parties such as other drivers that the vehicle is in autonomous mode when it should be in a non-autonomous mode. In an embodiment, to notify third parties, the vehicle may begin honking its horn and/or flashing its lights, may set off an alarm system, or may take some other action to notify third parties.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0105">In another aspect of the disclosure, a third party may act to protect a vehicle in autonomous mode that should be in non-autonomous mode. In an embodiment, a third party may act as master controller and control the vehicle similar to a user controlling a drone to ensure the vehicle drives safely and does not cause an accident. For instance, the third party may provide information to the droned vehicle so that it may drive safely. The information may come from sensors on the third-party vehicles or infrastructure which may extend the field of view of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0106">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, a travel route for an autonomous vehicle is received by the autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicle. The travel route may include a determination for each road segment as to whether an autonomous or manual driving mode provides less risk of an accident over each of the route segments along a travel route (step <b>1002</b>). The determination of whether autonomous or manual driving provides less risk of an accident over each of the route segments along a travel route may be transmitted to the driver along with the full travel route.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0107">In step <b>1004</b>, the computing device <b>102</b> may alert a driver of an upcoming request for change of vehicle control based on the determination in step <b>1002</b>. In step <b>1006</b>, a predetermined period may be initiated to determine if vehicle control has been transferred.
