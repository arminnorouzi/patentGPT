More particularly, the disclosure herein relates to a system for aiding the positioning of follower aircraft with respect to wake vortices from a leader aircraft during formation flying.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Wake vortices, also called wingtip vortices, are wake turbulence at the ends of the wings of a flying aircraft. Wake vortices may persist for several minutes after an aircraft has passed, and disrupt the trajectory of another aircraft passing nearby in the meantime. Safety distances between flying aircraft are applied by air traffic control (ATC) in order to take into account wake turbulence and avoid any flying difficulties linked to the existence thereof.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In formation, a leader aircraft is followed by one or more follower aircraft, which may experience wake vortices from the leader aircraft. However, by controlling their position with respect to the wake vortices, follower aircraft are able to benefit from a rising airflow phenomenon brought about by the wake vortices, thus reducing drag and fuel consumption. By contrast, if the follower aircraft enter the space between the wake vortices from the leader aircraft, the follower aircraft experience a falling airflow phenomenon that is brought about by the wake vortices and that impairs the performance and the stability of the aircraft. In particular, the proximity of the wake vortices leads to risks for the ongoing operations of the follower aircraft, such as: the follower aircraft may experience turbulence associated with the wake vortices, the engines of the follower aircraft may be exposed to high speed and pressure gradients, and the follower aircraft is more likely to unintentionally enter the space between the wake vortices from the leader aircraft.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to attenuate these risks, it is then desirable to provide a solution that makes it possible to assist a pilot of an aircraft flying in formation in the management of the positioning of his aircraft with respect to wake vortices generated by another aircraft moving in front.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">What is then proposed is a method implemented by a system for aiding formation flying of a follower aircraft with respect to a wake vortex from a leader aircraft, the system for aiding formation flying comprising a controller and at least one accelerometer installed on the follower aircraft, the method comprising the following steps, performed by the controller: receiving acceleration measurements performed by the at least one accelerometer; processing the received measurements so as to obtain therefrom a value representative of vibrations generated by the wake vortex from the leader aircraft; comparing the obtained value with a predetermined threshold representative of excessive vibrations with regard to the location of the at least one accelerometer on the follower aircraft; generating a notification when the comparison shows that the obtained value is greater than the predetermined threshold. It is thus made easier to position the follower aircraft in formation flying, in order to benefit from a rising airflow phenomenon brought about by the wake vortex from the leader aircraft.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Furthermore, the one or more accelerometers of the system for aiding formation flying are dedicated to this system, that is to say that these accelerometers are not intended to be used by another positioning system of the aircraft for formation flying. In other words, the one or more accelerometers of the system for aiding formation flying are independent of other positioning systems of the aircraft for formation flying. The system for aiding formation flying is thus independent of the information sources of a flight command management system, that is to say independent of formation flying control laws.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to one particular embodiment, the controller performs the following steps: receiving acceleration measurements performed by the accelerometer; extracting, from the received acceleration measurements, a peak value over a time window of predefined duration; comparing the extracted peak value with the predetermined threshold; generating the notification when the comparison shows that the extracted peak value is greater than the predetermined threshold.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to one particular embodiment, the controller performs the following steps: receiving acceleration measurements performed by the accelerometer; extracting, from the received acceleration measurements, a variance value over a time window; comparing the extracted variance value with the predetermined threshold; generating the notification when the comparison shows that the extracted variance value is greater than the predetermined threshold.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to one particular embodiment, the controller performs the following steps: receiving first acceleration measurements performed by a first accelerometer located on one wing of the follower aircraft; extracting, from the received first acceleration measurements, a first variance value over a time window; receiving second acceleration measurements performed by a second accelerometer located on the other wing of the follower aircraft; extracting, from the received second acceleration measurements, a second variance value over the time window; determining a difference value between the first and second variance values; comparing the determined difference value with the predetermined threshold or another predetermined threshold; generating the notification when the comparison shows that the determined difference value is greater than the predetermined threshold or, respectively, than the other predetermined threshold.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">And, according to one particular embodiment, each abovementioned variance value is a moving variance value.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to one particular embodiment, the controller obtains information indicating whether the follower aircraft is located to the right or to the left of the leader aircraft.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to one particular embodiment, when multiple accelerometers are installed on the follower aircraft, the controller obtains the information indicating whether the follower aircraft is located to the right or to the left of the leader aircraft by comparing measurements from the accelerometers with one another.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to one particular embodiment, the notification is an order to activate a light-based and/or sound-based signal in the cockpit of the follower aircraft and/or a message sent to a flight command management system of the follower aircraft.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">What is also proposed is a system for aiding formation flying of a follower aircraft with respect to a wake vortex from a leader aircraft, the system for aiding formation flying comprising a controller and at least one accelerometer installed on the follower aircraft, the system comprising electronic circuitry configured so as to: receive acceleration measurements performed by the at least one accelerometer; process the received measurements so as to obtain therefrom a value representative of vibrations generated by the wake vortex from the leader aircraft; compare the obtained value with a predetermined threshold representative of excessive vibrations with regard to the location of the at least one accelerometer on the follower aircraft;

The controller <b>160</b>, and more generally the system <b>120</b>, therefore comprises electronic circuitry designed and configured so as to implement the modular architectures, behaviors, steps and algorithms described here.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> schematically illustrates a position of a follower aircraft <b>302</b> with respect to a leader aircraft <b>301</b> during formation flying. The aircraft <b>301</b> and <b>302</b> are cruising. The movement of the leader aircraft <b>301</b> generates wake vortices (or wingtip vortices) <b>303</b>. If the follower aircraft <b>302</b> stays at a distance D between a minimum threshold Dmin and a maximum threshold Dmax of the wake vortices outside the trajectory of the leader aircraft <b>301</b>, the follower aircraft <b>302</b> benefits from a rising airflow phenomenon brought about by the wake vortices, thus reducing drag and fuel consumption for the follower aircraft <b>302</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The system <b>120</b> helps to keep the distance D above the minimum threshold Dmin during formation flying by analyzing accelerations measured by the one or more accelerometers <b>130</b>. Specifically, the closer the follower aircraft <b>302</b> gets to the wake vortices from the leader aircraft <b>301</b>, the more intense the vibrations, and the higher the acceleration measurements performed by the accelerometers <b>130</b>. In addition, when the follower aircraft <b>302</b> has entered a wake vortex from the leader aircraft <b>301</b>, the vibrations are even more intense, and the acceleration measurements performed by the accelerometers <b>130</b> are higher.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> schematically illustrates possible positions, on the follower aircraft <b>302</b>, of the accelerometers <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">One or more accelerometers <b>130</b> are installed on the follower aircraft <b>302</b>. One or more accelerometers <b>130</b> are preferably installed on one and/or the other of the wings of the follower aircraft <b>302</b> or on an element attached thereto (for example engine pylon). The flexibility of the structure of the wings aids the sensitivity of the accelerometers <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The fastening position of the accelerometer <b>130</b> could be: on the winglet, on the outer structure of the wing, on the rudders, the positions of which are static during cruising, on internal elements of the wing that are fastened to the structure of the follower aircraft <b>302</b> and immobile during flying (beyond vibrations experienced), on the engine pylon, or on the engine or in the nacelle. In one particular embodiment, the accelerometers <b>130</b> are installed on the front of the wings, so as to minimize the impact of turbulence brought about by the follower aircraft <b>302</b> itself.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As described below, installing at least one accelerometer <b>130</b> on each of the wings makes it possible to improve the ability to detect the proximity of a wake vortex.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In one preferred embodiment, a first accelerometer <b>130</b> is installed on one wingtip, and a second accelerometer <b>130</b> is installed on the other wingtip.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> schematically illustrates an algorithm for detecting excessive proximity of a wake vortex based on measurements performed by at least one accelerometer <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In a step <b>501</b>, the controller <b>160</b> obtains acceleration measurements from an accelerometer <b>130</b>. The accelerometer <b>130</b> in question may be one accelerometer from among a plurality of accelerometers <b>130</b> installed on the aircraft. When multiple accelerometers <b>130</b> are installed on the follower aircraft <b>302</b>, the controller <b>160</b> may, as a variant, obtain a combination of measurements, for example using a weighted average, from the accelerometers <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In one particular embodiment, the controller <b>160</b> obtains information indicating whether the follower aircraft <b>302</b> is located to the right or to the left of the leader aircraft <b>301</b>. This information may be provided by the avionics <b>150</b>, for example following a command or an input from instruments in the cockpit of the follower aircraft <b>302</b>. Specifically, given that the vibrations perceived by the accelerometers <b>130</b> differ depending on whether the wake vortex from the leader aircraft <b>301</b> is to the right or to the left of the follower aircraft <b>302</b>, this information makes it possible to adjust the analysis of the measurements from multiple accelerometers <b>130</b> (whether or not they are located on the same wing). Thus, for example, the weights of the abovementioned weighted average are adjusted based on the position of each accelerometer <b>130</b> on the follower aircraft <b>302</b> and based on the position (to the right or to the left) of the follower aircraft <b>302</b> with respect to the leader aircraft <b>301</b> in the formation. It may thus be taken into account that, the further an accelerometer <b>130</b> is from the assumed position of the wake vortices from the leader aircraft <b>301</b>, the less intense the vibrations experienced. Likewise, the closer an accelerometer <b>130</b> is to a wingtip, the more intense the vibrations experienced, since the structure of the wing there is more flexible.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In one particular embodiment in which multiple accelerometers <b>130</b> are installed on the follower aircraft <b>302</b>, the information indicating whether the follower aircraft <b>302</b> is located to the right or to the left of the leader aircraft <b>301</b> is determined automatically by the controller <b>160</b>. Once the avionics <b>150</b> have activated the system <b>120</b>, the controller <b>160</b> compares the measurements from the accelerometers <b>130</b> and deduces, from the location of the accelerometers <b>130</b> on the aircraft <b>302</b>, whether the follower aircraft <b>302</b> is located to the right or to the left of the leader aircraft <b>301</b> (on the side where the vibrations, and therefore the measured accelerations, are greatest).</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In a step <b>502</b>, the controller <b>160</b> processes the measurements received in step <b>501</b> so as to obtain therefrom a value representative of vibrations generated by a wake vortex from the leader aircraft <b>301</b>. In one particular embodiment, the controller <b>160</b> determines a peak absolute value, or an average value, or standard deviation value or variance value, or a power spectral density, over a time window. In one particular embodiment, the controller <b>160</b> applies a filter, for example a noise suppression filter or interference suppression filter, to the measurements received in step <b>501</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In a step <b>503</b>, the controller <b>160</b> compares the value obtained in step <b>502</b> with a predetermined first threshold representative of excessive vibrations with regard to the location of the accelerometers on the follower aircraft <b>302</b>. For example, this first threshold is predefined and fixed in accordance with measurement readings taken during full-scale tests or in simulations. This predetermined first threshold is representative of the fact that the follower aircraft <b>302</b> is approaching the wake vortex from the leader aircraft <b>301</b>, at a distance D less than the threshold Dmax.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">According to one configuration, in a step <b>503</b>, the controller <b>160</b> compares the value obtained in step <b>502</b> with a predetermined second threshold representative of excessive vibrations with regard to the location of the accelerometers on the follower aircraft <b>302</b>.
