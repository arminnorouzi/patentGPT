The nitride semiconductor device may be provided to utilize a field effect of a p-n junction of the channel layer and the channel control layer.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The channel control layer may be located on one side of the channel layer, for example, only on or below the channel layer, or may be located both on a bottom and top of the channel layer, respectively. For example, the nitride semiconductor device according to some example embodiments may be provided to have a stack structure of a channel control layer and a channel layer, or a stack structure of a channel control layer-channel layer-channel control layer. Alternatively or additionally, the nitride semiconductor device may be provided to have a stack structure of a plurality of channels by repeatedly and alternately stacking a channel layer and a channel control layer.

After forming a high-resistance GaN layer on a substrate, GaN layers of p-type and n-type are alternately formed, a gate region is patterned through GaN etching for fin and field effect, and during etching, the etching may be performed up to the lowermost high-resistance GaN layer or the lowermost p-type GaN layer (channel control layer). Then, a gate electrode/source electrode/drain electrode may be formed. The gate electrode may form a contact of an ohmic contact type with the p-type GaN layer, and may form a Schottky contact or, for example, as an insulator of a dielectric material, etc. form an electrically insulated state with the n-type GaN layer (channel layer). The source electrode and the drain electrode may be formed to have an ohmic contact with the n-type GaN layer. Also, the source electrode and the drain electrode may be formed to form a Schottky contact or electrically insulated from the p-type GaN layer. The uppermost p-type GaN layer may be formed only in the gate region.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0171">The nitride semiconductor device according to some example embodiments may be variously modified according to the kind of nitride and the channel type applied thereto. For example, when the nitride semiconductor device according to some example embodiments is formed as a GaN device having a p-channel, the p-type GaN layer forms a channel layer and the n-type GaN layer forms a channel control layer, and accordingly, the p-type GaN layer and the n-type GaN layer may be formed to be electrically connected or insulated from a gate electrode/source electrode/drain electrode. Alternatively or additionally, in the nitride semiconductor device according to some example embodiments, different kinds of nitride semiconductor materials are applied to the channel layer, a Group III-V compound semiconductor material is applied to the channel control layer, and the channel layer may be implemented as a p-type or an n-type.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0172">According to the nitride semiconductor devices according to various example embodiments described above, for example, a depletion type, that is, a normally-on type transistor may be implemented by forming a p-type or n-type GaN channel control layer on upper and lower sides of the n-type or p-type GaN channel formed in a horizontal direction, and also, the nitride semiconductor device may be operated in an enhancement mode, that is, an normally-off type by controlling a thickness or doping concentration of an impurity of the channel layer, and thus, may be implemented as an inverter or the like.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0173">Alternatively or additionally, because the nitride semiconductor devices according to various example embodiments described above use a field effect of a p-n junction, the current density is greater than, for example, a current density of an existing FinFET-type GaN device, and thus, the nitride semiconductor device may be used in a high-power RF amplifier. Alternatively or additionally, the current density may be increased by forming a channel in multiple layers, which may contribute to miniaturization of the size of a device.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0174">In addition, according to the nitride semiconductor device according to various embodiments described above, when the nitride semiconductor device is implemented as a normally-off device, the nitride semiconductor device may be applied to a power conversion (DC to DC conversion) system. For example, when the nitride semiconductor device according to the embodiment is applied as a GaN switch device, a voltage of an output terminal may be lowered by allowing two GaN switches to alternately perform a turn on/off operation. For example, by applying the nitride semiconductor devices as GaN switch devices to a power conversion system, and allowing the two GaN switches to alternately perform a turn on/off operation, a high voltage, for example, of about 400V, may be converted into a low voltage, for example, of about 12V. During a switch on/off operation, a switching loss may occur due to simultaneous application of a high voltage and a high current. When the nitride semiconductor device according to some example embodiments is applied, the switching speed of the device is fast, and thus, the switching loss may be reduced, a switching frequency may be increased, and the size of an overall system may be reduced.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0175">According to the nitride semiconductor device according to some example embodiments, because a field effect of a p-n junction is used, there is no restriction on a channel size for implementing turn-off or switching characteristics, and a channel may be implemented in a desired mode type. In addition, according to the nitride semiconductor device according to some example embodiments, it is possible to increase the size of a pattern compared to an existing Fin-type by using a field effect of a p-n junction, a process difficulty may be reduced, and the current density may be increased by forming a multi-layered channel.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0176">It should be understood that various example embodiments described herein should be considered in a descriptive sense only and not for purposes of limitation.
