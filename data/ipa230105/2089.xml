A variety pack will typically take the form of an assortment of individually packaged foods or beverage items provided by a common manufacturer and packaged into a single pack. With the increase in demand, food and beverage companies have been forced to adapt their demand planning to accommodate the complexities of managing the variety pack business. Current challenges include the following key elements:</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Shortage of Popular SKUs: Variety packs must include the top selling flavors&#x2014;stock-keeping units, or SKUs&#x2014;to drive demand as well as introduce customers to less popular flavors. Businesses are very often faced with shortages associated with over-heated demand for their most popular flavors which must now be sold as single cases as well as in an assortment of variety packs.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Multiple Freight Destinations: Product must be transported, often from multiple locations, to a single assembly location and then transported back to a warehouse center from which it is then distributed. The need for additional transportation can dramatically increase the freight cost per variety pack.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Wasted Packaging: A production line will typically produce a single SKU at a time, usually twenty four (24) units per case but can be any amount of units per case. In order to stack these cases on a pallet for transport, or palletize, the 12-pack groupings must be placed on a corrugate tray or on a pad and then placed in a shrink-wrapping machine. This is done in order ensure that product is not damaged or dumped during transport. Once the product is ready for placement in the new variety pack case, the corrugate tray and shrink wrap is discarded and becomes a complete waste. This process adds significant costs.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Unreliable Labor: Most beverage brands do not have the scale and national production capabilities to introduce efficient scalable variety packing solutions. As such, most of the variety packing industry relies on manual labor which is building the variety packs by hand in a human assembly line. Not only is the variety packing work very difficult, monotonous and prone to human error, but it has become very difficult to find and manage the people necessary to do this work. The variety packing industry is plagued with a lack of labor, frequent no-shows, high attrition rates, and an assortment of disciplinary issues consistent with managing large pools of unskilled labor.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Erratic Planning and Inventory Management: Variety packs can create SKU inflation where several different types of packages are introduced simultaneously&#x2014;30 packs, 24 packs, 18 packs, 12 packs, 6 packs, and 4 packs are typical variety and multi-pack types. It becomes very difficult to keep track of this demand as well as manage the production schedule to support the ongoing sales of popular SKUs. As a result, ingredient shortages, online out of stock notices, and the elimination of expired product are common occurrences that result in significant costs.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Few Scalable Options: Due to the complexity of the variety packaging process and the lack of scale for a majority of the beverage brands, there are few scalable providers of variety packaging services. Those who do offer these services do so at a high cost per pack and often rely on unreliable manual labor which requires long lead times and results in frequent disruptions.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a typical scenario, the eco-system for producing a variety or multi pack involves at least the following steps:</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Step 1: Production of a Single SKU on the Co-Packer Manufacturing Line.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Step 2: Transport of Single SKU to a 3rd Party Logistics (3PL) Center.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Step 3: Transport of Single SKUs from 3PL to Offsite Variety Packing Facility.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Step 4: Transport of Variety Pack Materials (boxes, shrink, tape, CHEP pallets) to Offsite Variety Packing Facility.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Step 5: Manual Assembly of Variety Packs and Storage at Offsite Variety</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Packing Facility.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Step 6: Transport from Offsite Variety Packing Facility back to the 3PL Facility.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Step 7: Transport from the 3PL Facility to the Distributor Facility.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Step 8: Transport from the Distributor Facility to Retail and Online Channels.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Thus, the industry would benefit from a system and method that can eliminate steps in the conventional process, provide flexible and mobile access to variety pack production in unconventional settings, all while improving efficiency, accuracy, packaging waste, freight costs, and carbon emissions.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In one embodiment, a variety pack production system includes multiple frame sections each comprising a rigid frame, multiple casters, multiple leveling legs, and multiple forklift channels; wherein each of the multiple frame sections includes multiple connection points configured to connect with at least one adjacent frame section.

The disclosure herein is directed to all such variations and modifications to such elements and methods known to those skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. Although any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present invention, the preferred methods and materials are described.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As used herein, each of the following terms has the meaning associated with it in this section.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The articles &#x201c;a&#x201d; and &#x201c;an&#x201d; are used herein to refer to one or to more than one (i.e., to at least one) of the grammatical object of the article. By way of example, &#x201c;an element&#x201d; means one element or more than one element.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">&#x201c;About&#x201d; as used herein when referring to a measurable value such as an amount, a temporal duration, and the like, is meant to encompass variations of &#xb1;20%, &#xb1;10%, &#xb1;5%, &#xb1;1%, and &#xb1;0.1% from the specified value, as such variations are appropriate.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Ranges: throughout this disclosure, various aspects of the invention can be presented in a range format. It should be understood that the description in range format is merely for convenience and brevity and should not be construed as an inflexible limitation on the scope of the invention. Where appropriate, the description of a range should be considered to have specifically disclosed all the possible subranges as well as individual numerical values within that range. For example, description of a range such as from 1 to 6 should be considered to have specifically disclosed subranges such as from 1 to 3, from 1 to 4, from 1 to 5, from 2 to 4, from 2 to 6, from 3 to 6 etc., as well as individual numbers within that range, for example, 1, 2, 2.7, 3, 4, 5, 5.3, and 6. This applies regardless of the breadth of the range.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring now in detail to the drawings, in which like reference numerals indicate like parts or elements throughout the several views, in various embodiments, presented herein is a system and method for variety pack production.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Embodiments of the system and method for variety pack production described herein implement various improvements in the art, including improvements related to the machinery (i.e. automated assembly lines that are better at packing than humans), mobility (i.e. automated assembly lines that come to the customer), and modularity (i.e. adapting to packaging input and output demands change regularly) of variety pack production lines.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, a modular frame system <b>10</b> is disclosed according to one embodiment. The modular frame system <b>10</b> includes frame sections that for example include a production frame section <b>12</b>, a storage frame section <b>14</b>, a compressor frame section <b>16</b>, a power supply frame section <b>18</b> and a conveyor or miscellaneous storage section <b>20</b>. The production frame section <b>12</b> can include for example a line of production equipment that automate variety pack production. The production frame section <b>12</b> (with reference also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>) can include a frame perimeter that approximates the footprint of the production equipment. In one embodiment, the frame section forms a non-rectangular perimeter (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>). Approximating the footprint of the production line equipment setup enables workers to easily access the production line without having to step onto the frame, and also allows accessory equipment (such as pallet stands, etc.) to easily position right next to the production lines without interference from the frame.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The production frame section <b>12</b>, similar to other frame sections, includes a rigid frame having leg and caster sets <b>30</b> disposed about the perimeter. The leg and caster sets <b>30</b> each have a caster <b>32</b> for allowing easy movement of the frame over a surface, and a leveling foot <b>34</b> that can transition between a raised position <b>36</b> and a lowered position <b>36</b>&#x2032;. When the bottom of each foot <b>34</b> is in a raised position <b>36</b>, each caster <b>32</b> will engage the floor, allowing users to freely maneuver that frame section. When the bottom of each foot is on a lowered position <b>36</b>&#x2032;, the caster <b>32</b> disengages with the floor and the frame section is stabilized and stationary. The foot can be lowered or raised in finer adjustments while the caster <b>32</b> remains disengaged to adjust the frame section to a level position.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In one embodiment, the production line incorporates a consolidated electric panel. The production line requires multiple components such as air compressor, conveyors, printers, and fans in order to run in an efficient manner. In addition, the locations production locations within a facility often have power located far from that location, which results in additional complexity and cost. Accordingly, embodiments include a modified electrical panel so that it (1) feeds all of the necessary components for production and (2) provides one singular point of connection (a single &#x201c;pigtail connector&#x201d;) with several hundred feet of wire to facilitate an easier installation and disconnect when the system arrives on-site.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the production frame section <b>12</b> includes a storage frame section <b>14</b>, which may for example include tools, supplies, and parts of the production line that are better to remain disconnected during transport. The compressed air frame section <b>16</b> can include for example a compressor that in certain embodiments includes a full or partial acoustic enclosure for sound dampening. The mobile production line requires air to power the machines which often requires expensive material and lengthy installation times by an expensive professional specialist. A commercial grade low-decibel compressor can be utilized in the operation of the line which operates on-site at third party facilities and eliminates the need to run copper piping from various parts of the facility to the mobile production line.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The power supply frame section <b>18</b> can include a portable power source, such as a battery power source. The conveyor and miscellaneous storage frame section <b>20</b> in one embodiment can include a frame that includes the conveyor apparatus and/or miscellaneous system components. In one embodiment, the conveyor/miscellaneous storage frame section <b>20</b> instead represents a void.
