The invention furthermore relates to a method for producing a grinding tool for machining metallic materials as well as the grinding tool produced according to this method.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Different methods for producing abrasive particles are known from the state of the art. For example, in the applicant's EP 3 342 839 A1 a method is disclosed in which abrasive particles with a non-uniform shape and/or size are produced by chipping an extrudate. The objective in this method is to produce abrasive particles with an irregular geometry.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">There, a disadvantage is that only relatively few abrasive particles can be produced in a particular time.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Furthermore, such a method results in a relatively high wear, as the cutting edges used for the chipping are subjected to a high load and thus wear relatively quickly.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The object of the present invention is to specify a method for producing abrasive particles which avoids the above-named problems, the abrasive particles produced therewith, a method for producing a grinding tool for machining metallic materials in which the abrasive particles produced according to the invention are used, as well as a grinding tool produced by means of this method.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a method according to the invention, it is thus provided that the extrudate and/or the intermediate particles is or are subjected to an energy input that is asymmetric with respect to the geometry of the extrudate and/or the intermediate particles.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Because of the asymmetric energy input, an asymmetric heating of the extrudate and/or the intermediate particles occurs. As the extrudate and/or the intermediate particles do not cool evenly because of the asymmetric, thus irregular, heating, stresses occur inside the extrudate and/or the intermediate particles. These stresses lead to a twisting of the extrudate and/or of the intermediate particles and thus to abrasive particles with an irregular geometry.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Compared with methods known from the state of the art, more abrasive particles can be produced in the same amount of time, since several extrudate strands can be provided for example. In addition, the wear is less in a method according to the invention than in the state of the art, as no chipping device is needed.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It may be pointed out that the technique of converting a starting mixture containing at least aluminum hydroxide at least into aluminum oxide by heat treatment has already been known for quite some time. In this connection, reference may be made to the so-called &#x201c;sol-gel process&#x201d;. There, a starting mixture which contains at least aluminum hydroxide is used. Aluminum hydroxide can be present in different modifications. In connection with the present invention, powdered boehmite (&#x3b3;-AlOOH) is preferably used. Further preferably, the boehmite is subsequently converted into a clear sol by the addition of water and the admixture of a peptizer, e.g. nitric acid. Then, through the further addition of an acid, e.g. nitric acid, or a nitrate solution, a reaction to form the gel, i.e. a dehydration and polymerization, is preferably initiated. Because of the gel formation, the boehmite is present in a very homogeneous distribution. In a subsequent work step, water released can be evaporated. In the course of a following heat treatment at a temperature of between 400&#xb0; C. and 1200&#xb0; C., preferably at a temperature of between 800&#xb0; C. and 1000&#xb0; C., the aluminum hydroxide can be converted into an aluminum oxide of the transition phase &#x3b3;-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. In the reaction of boehmite to form aluminum oxide, nitrogen is released as residue of the acid and water. This low-temperature combustion is also called calcination. In a last step, a further heat treatment in the form of, preferably pressureless, sintering can then be carried out. This step is preferably effected at a temperature of between 1200&#xb0; C. and 1800&#xb0; C., particularly preferably at a temperature of between 1200&#xb0; C. and 1500&#xb0; C. Depending on the starting mixture, it can happen that secondary phases, such as e.g. spinel, form in addition to aluminum oxide (typically as alpha-aluminum oxide). Allowance is made for this circumstance by the expression &#x201c;at least into aluminum oxide&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">By &#x201c;extrusion&#x201d; is meant a process technology in which solid to viscous hardenable materials are continuously pressed out of a shaping opening under pressure. In the process, bodies with a cross section of the opening form, called extrudate.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the present case, the cross section of the extrudate depends on a nozzle body used and is preferably rectangular, square, trapezoidal, parallelogram-shaped, triangular, drop-shaped, propeller-shaped or star-shaped and/or has at least one convex side or at least one concave side.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Not only is the method according to the invention for producing abrasive particles characterized by its simplicity and the lower maintenance requirement and wear compared with the state of the art, but it also makes it possible to vary the shape and/or size of the intermediate particles or of the abrasive particles present after the sintering easily and flexibly by replacement of a nozzle body and/or alterations during the separation.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">One possibility for influencing or controlling the dimensions of the abrasive particles is to supply the extrudate to the method step of separation with an alterable infeed speed and/or in an oscillating motion. In the case of an oscillating motion, a particular length of the extrudate to be separated arises.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Furthermore, it can also be provided that the intermediate particles generated by the separation are comminuted before the heat treatment in a further method step, preferably by means of a cutting device. Instead of a cutting device, other comminution devices which, for example, also bring about a breaking and/or chopping of the intermediate particles can also be used.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">A further possibility for influencing the shape and/or size of the abrasive particles is obtained by altering the consistency of the starting mixture. For this, it can be provided that during the provision of the starting mixture and/or during the extrusion of the starting mixture water, a peptizer, preferably nitric acid, and/or additives, for example an acid, which can likewise be nitric acid, and/or cobalt nitrate, are added.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Particularly preferably, the extrudate and/or the intermediate particles have a longitudinal direction, and the asymmetric energy input is effected transverse to the longitudinal direction.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">On the one hand this favors a twisting of the extrudate and/or of the intermediate particles and on the other hand it makes a simple realization of an asymmetric energy input possible.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Advantageous embodiments of the method for producing abrasive particles furthermore consist in that in the course of the heat treatment the intermediate particles generated by the separation are calcined, preferably at a temperature of between 400&#xb0; C. and 1200&#xb0; C., particularly preferably at a temperature of between 800&#xb0; C. and 1000&#xb0; C., and/or are sintered, preferably at a temperature of between 1200&#xb0; C. and 1800&#xb0; C., particularly preferably at a temperature of between 1200&#xb0; C. and 1500&#xb0; C. As a supplement, it can be provided that in the course of the heat treatment the intermediate particles generated by the separation are pre-dried before the calcination and/or sintering, preferably at a temperature of between 50&#xb0; C. and 350&#xb0; C., particularly preferably at a temperature of between 80&#xb0; C. and 100&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">As previously stated, protection is also sought for a method for producing a grinding tool for machining metallic materials, wherein abrasive particles which were produced according to the method according to the invention for producing the abrasive particles are incorporated in a bond, for example in a ceramic bond or in a resinoid bond. A grinding tool with a porosity of from 2 to 50% and/or a density of from 1.5 to 4.5 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>advantageously results thereby.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Further details and advantages of the present invention are explained in more detail below with the aid of the description of the figures with reference to the drawings.
