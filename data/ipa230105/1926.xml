A distance target value is determined using the read in values. The distance target value is transmitted to an acceleration control system. An acceleration setpoint value is calculated in a calculation unit of the acceleration control system using the distance target value and the accelerator pedal angle. The acceleration setpoint value is read in by an activation unit of the acceleration control system. In the activation unit, the acceleration setpoint value is converted into a drive control signal for a drive of the vehicle and/or a brake signal for a braking system of the vehicle.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to the present invention, a method is provided for controlling an approach of a driving vehicle to at least one preceding reference vehicle using an automated distance setting as a function of a setpoint distance between the vehicle and the reference vehicle. In accordance with an example embodiment of the present invention, the automated distance setting during the approach process may thus better correspond to the expectations of the driver. The automated distance setting may take place more reliably, realistically, and comfortably. The automated distance setting may be better adapted to the driving situation. The required free space may be available to the driving vehicle, in particular during merging processes of the vehicle or other vehicles ahead of and behind the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The vehicle may be a motor vehicle, a passenger vehicle, a truck, a two-wheeled vehicle, or a comparable vehicle moving on a roadway. This also applies to the reference vehicle. The reference vehicle may drive ahead of the vehicle on the same lane or on an adjacent lane to the lane of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with an example embodiment of the present invention, the automated distance setting may incorporate an automated setting of the actual distance and/or an automated limiting of the actual distance at least to a minimum distance depending on the setpoint distance. The automated distance setting may be assigned to a driver-oriented assistance function, in particular a dynamic distance assist (DDA). In the automated distance setting, the function of the actuating element, preferably a brake pedal of the vehicle, may be at least partially assumed to set the braking deceleration. The automated distance setting may incorporate a surroundings detection by the vehicle. For example, a distance between the vehicle and the reference vehicle and/or from objects in the immediate surroundings of the vehicle may be measured by a distance sensor, for example, a radar sensor, a camera, and/or a LIDAR sensor. The operating element may be an accelerator pedal of the vehicle. The more strongly the operating element is actuated, the greater is the drive acceleration of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The actuating element may be a brake pedal of a braking device. The braking device may include at least one brake at a vehicle wheel of the vehicle. The brake may be a disk brake. At least when the automated distance setting is deactivated, the braking deceleration of the vehicle is greater the more strongly the actuating element is actuated.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The automated distance setting preferably remains active when the actuating element is actuated. The braking deceleration of the vehicle may be automatically adapted by the automated distance setting. The setpoint distance may be calculated directly as a function of the deflection of the actuating element and/or a time gradient of a deflection of the actuating element. The setpoint distance may be calculated directly as a function of a braking parameter directly influenceable by the actuating position and therefore indirectly as a function of the actuating position. The braking parameter may be a brake pressure of the braking device. The greater the brake pressure, the more strongly may the braking deceleration be carried out via the braking device.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The setpoint distance may furthermore be calculated as a function of an actual velocity of the vehicle, a differential velocity between the vehicle and the reference vehicle, an actual distance between the vehicle and the reference vehicle, and/or an actual distance between the vehicle and a following vehicle driving behind it. Furthermore, a predefined setpoint distance may be taken into consideration, for example, by the driver via a user interface of the vehicle with the driver, in particular a switch and/or a touchscreen.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one preferred example embodiment of the present invention, it is advantageous if the setpoint distance is reduced as a function of the actuating position. The automated distance setting may thus be adapted to the driving situation. In one special embodiment of the present invention, it is advantageous if the setpoint distance is reduced more strongly the more strongly the actuating element is actuated. A more critical driving situation may thus be managed in an appropriate and safe manner in the automated distance setting. The braking device, which is prepared via the actuation of the actuating element or already effectuates a braking deceleration, may provide a possibly requested even stronger brake power faster.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one advantageous example embodiment of the present invention, it is provided that the setpoint distance is reduced more strongly by actuating the actuating element than if the actuating element and/or the operating element is unactuated and/or if the operating element is actuated. The braking torque, which is prepared or already active when actuation of the actuating element has already taken place, may implement a braking deceleration of the vehicle faster. The setpoint distance may thus be reduced more strongly by actuating the actuating element.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">A lesser minimum distance may be predefined between the vehicle and the reference vehicle by actuating the actuating element than a minimum distance if the actuating element and/or the operating element is unactuated and/or if the operating element is actuated.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one preferred example embodiment of the present invention, it is advantageous if the actuating position incorporates a deflection of the actuating element and/or a time gradient of a deflection of the actuating element. The strength and/or speed of the actuation of the actuating element may thus be incorporated in the reduction of the setpoint distance. One preferred embodiment of the present invention is advantageous in which the actuating element is a brake pedal and the actuating position is a brake pedal angle. The brake pedal angle may be greater the more strongly the actuating element is actuated.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The setpoint distance is preferably reduced as a function of the operating position of the operating element. Driving closer to the reference vehicle may thus be effectuated by actuating the accelerator pedal. It may be made possible for the driver to influence the setpoint distance with automated distance setting.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to the present invention, furthermore a distance control system is provided, which is configured to carry out the method including at least one of the above-described features directly or indirectly. The distance control system may be implemented in a control device of the vehicle. The control device may be situated in the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In accordance with an example embodiment of the present invention, in the distance control system or a post-regulator downstream thereof, additional driving properties of the vehicle may be taken into consideration on the input side when negotiating curves. Furthermore, the distance control system or the post-regulator, for example, an acceleration control system, may take into consideration on the input side an actual velocity of the vehicle, a differential velocity between the vehicle and the reference vehicle, and/or an actual distance between the vehicle and the reference vehicle. Furthermore, an actual distance between the vehicle and a following vehicle driving behind same may be taken into consideration. Furthermore, a predefined setpoint distance may be taken into consideration, for example, by the driver via a user interface of the vehicle with the driver, in particular a switch and/or a touchscreen.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to the present invention, furthermore a computer program is provided, which includes machine-readable instructions executable on at least one computer, upon the execution of which the above-described method runs.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to the present invention, furthermore a memory unit is provided, which is machine-readable and is configured to be accessible by at least one computer and on which the above-mentioned computer program is stored.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Further advantages and advantageous embodiments of the present invention result from the description of the figures and the figures.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The present invention is described in detail hereinafter with reference to the figures.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a method for controlling an approach of a vehicle in one special specific example embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a driving situation of a vehicle during an approach to a preceding reference vehicle.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a further driving situation of a vehicle during an approach to a preceding reference vehicle.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a vehicle including a distance control system in one special specific embodiment of the present invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a method for controlling an approach of a vehicle in one special specific embodiment of the present invention. Method <b>10</b> for controlling an approach of a driving vehicle <b>12</b> to at least one preceding reference vehicle <b>14</b> is carried out using an automated distance setting, in which a driver-oriented assistance function is implemented, which as much as possible is to relieve the driver of vehicle <b>12</b> from the actuation of an actuating element <b>16</b> for controlling a braking deceleration of vehicle <b>12</b>, preferably a brake pedal <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">During the automated distance setting, a braking deceleration of vehicle <b>12</b> for complying with an actual distance <b>20</b> between vehicle <b>12</b> and reference vehicle <b>14</b> may take place in an automated manner. For this purpose, a setpoint distance <b>22</b> is calculated, via which the automated distance setting sets actual distance <b>20</b>, for example, by a braking process of vehicle <b>12</b>. A minimum distance <b>24</b> is also calculated, which actual distance <b>20</b> is not to fall below in order to meet the safety requirements, in particular to avoid an impact of vehicle <b>12</b> on reference vehicle <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the automated distance setting, preferably the actuation of an operating element <b>26</b>, which controls a drive of vehicle <b>12</b> for its movement, is detected and an operating position <b>27</b> of operating element <b>26</b>, for example, an accelerator pedal <b>28</b>, is transferred to a distance control system <b>30</b> with further input-side parameters, such as a predefined setpoint distance, for example, by the driver via a user interface of the vehicle with the driver, in particular a switch and/or a touchscreen, an actual velocity <b>32</b> of vehicle <b>12</b>, a differential velocity <b>34</b> between vehicle <b>12</b> and reference vehicle <b>14</b>, and/or actual distance <b>20</b> between vehicle <b>12</b> and reference vehicle <b>14</b>. Actual distance <b>20</b> may be measured by a distance sensor <b>36</b>, for example, a radar sensor, a camera, and/or a LIDAR sensor.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Furthermore, actuating position <b>38</b> of actuating element <b>16</b> is detected and setpoint distance <b>22</b> is calculated by distance control system <b>30</b> as a function of the further input-side parameters and output at an acceleration control system <b>40</b>. Setpoint distance <b>22</b> is reduced as a function of operating position <b>27</b> of operating element <b>26</b> and an actuation of actuating element <b>16</b>, preferably as a function of actuating position <b>38</b> of actuating element <b>16</b>. An influence of the driver on the automated distance setting may thus be implemented in that he/she actuates actuating element <b>16</b> or operating element <b>26</b>. The strength of the reduction of setpoint distance <b>22</b> is preferably a function of actuating position <b>38</b>. For example, setpoint distance <b>22</b> may be reduced more strongly the more strongly actuating element <b>16</b> is actuated.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">A driving situation is shown by way of example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, in which vehicle <b>12</b> merges from one lane to an adjacent lane, on which a reference vehicle <b>14</b> is already located which drives ahead of vehicle <b>12</b>, and a following vehicle <b>39</b>, which drives behind vehicle <b>12</b> on the adjacent lane. The driver of vehicle <b>12</b> intends, for example, to exit from the roadway via the secondary lane and an exit lane extending adjacent thereto. For this purpose, vehicle <b>12</b> merges with activated automated distance setting between reference vehicle <b>14</b> and following vehicle <b>39</b> on the adjacent lane.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">If vehicle <b>12</b> has a higher velocity than reference vehicle <b>14</b>, vehicle <b>12</b> would then be braked more strongly using the automated distance setting to maintain actual distance <b>20</b> to reference vehicle <b>14</b>. If the driver of vehicle <b>12</b> actuates the brake pedal in the meantime while the vehicle merges onto the adjacent lane, the distance control system may then reduce the setpoint distance as a function of the actuating position of the brake pedal as an input-side parameter and avoid an excessively strong braking process of vehicle <b>12</b>, due to which following vehicle <b>39</b> would possibly drive into vehicle <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">A minimum distance <b>24</b>.<b>1</b> between vehicle <b>12</b> and reference vehicle <b>14</b> may also be set lower by actuating the actuating element than if the actuating element remained unactuated, in particular because the braking torque which is prepared or already active when actuation of the actuating element has already taken place may implement a braking deceleration of vehicle <b>12</b> faster. A lower minimum distance <b>24</b>.<b>1</b> between vehicle <b>12</b> and reference vehicle <b>14</b> may thus be predefined by actuating the actuating element than a minimum distance <b>24</b>.<b>2</b> if the actuating element and/or the operating element remained unactuated and/or than if the operating element were actuated.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">A driving situation is shown for comparison in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, in which a reference vehicle <b>14</b> driving ahead of vehicle <b>12</b> merges from an adjacent lane onto the lane on which vehicle <b>12</b> is driving. If the driver of vehicle <b>12</b> recognizes reference vehicle <b>14</b> merging onto his/her lane at lower velocity, a lesser setpoint distance to reference vehicle <b>14</b> is permitted by an actuation of the brake pedal of vehicle <b>12</b> and the setpoint distance reduced via the distance control system than if the brake pedal remained unactuated, but thus possibly prevents driving into a following vehicle <b>39</b> behind vehicle <b>12</b>, since the actual distance between vehicle <b>12</b> and following vehicle <b>39</b> is greater due to the reduced actual distance between vehicle <b>12</b> and reference vehicle <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In particular minimum distance <b>24</b>.<b>1</b> may also be set lower here by actuating the actuating element, thus the brake pedal, than a minimum distance <b>24</b>.<b>2</b> if the actuating element remained unactuated, in particular because the braking torque which is prepared or already active when actuation of the actuating element has already taken place may implement a braking deceleration of vehicle <b>12</b> faster to avoid driving into reference vehicle <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, acceleration control system <b>40</b> also receives on the input side, in addition to setpoint distance <b>22</b> output by distance control system <b>30</b>, actuating position <b>38</b> of actuating element <b>16</b> and operating position <b>27</b> of operating element <b>26</b> and outputs a setpoint acceleration <b>41</b> as a function thereof, which may be negative as a braking deceleration or positive as a drive acceleration and implements the automated distance setting.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a vehicle including a distance control system in a special specific embodiment of the present invention.
