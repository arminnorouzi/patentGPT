Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">To meet the demand for wireless data traffic having increased since deployment of 4G communication systems, efforts have been made to develop an improved 5G or pre-5G communication system. Therefore, the 5G or pre-5G communication system is also called a &#x2018;Beyond 4G Network&#x2019; or a &#x2018;Post LTE System&#x2019;. The 5G communication system is considered to be implemented in higher frequency (mmWave) bands, e.g., 60 GHz bands, so as to accomplish higher data rates. To decrease propagation loss of the radio waves and increase the transmission distance, the beamforming, massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), Full Dimensional MIMO (FD-MIMO), array antenna, an analog beam forming, large scale antenna techniques are discussed in 5G communication systems. In addition, in 5G communication systems, development for system network improvement is under way based on advanced small cells, cloud Radio Access Networks (RANs), ultra-dense networks, device-to-device (D2D) communication, wireless backhaul, moving network, cooperative communication, Coordinated Multi-Points (CoMP), reception-end interference cancellation and the like. In the 5G system, Hybrid FSK and QAM Modulation (FQAM) and sliding window superposition coding (SWSC) as an advanced coding modulation (ACM), and filter bank multi carrier (FBMC), non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), and sparse code multiple access (SCMA) as an advanced access technology have been developed.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The Internet, which is a human centered connectivity network where humans generate and consume information, is now evolving to the Internet of Things (IoT) where distributed entities, such as things, exchange and process information without human intervention. The Internet of Everything (IoE), which is a combination of the IoT technology and the Big Data processing technology through connection with a cloud server, has emerged. As technology elements, such as &#x201c;sensing technology&#x201d;, &#x201c;wired/wireless communication and network infrastructure&#x201d;, &#x201c;service interface technology&#x201d;, and &#x201c;Security technology&#x201d; have been demanded for IoT implementation, a sensor network, a Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication, Machine Type Communication (MTC), and so forth have been recently researched. Such an IoT environment may provide intelligent Internet technology services that create a new value to human life by collecting and analyzing data generated among connected things. IoT may be applied to a variety of fields including smart home, smart building, smart city, smart car or connected cars, smart grid, health care, smart appliances and advanced medical services through convergence and combination between existing Information Technology (IT) and various industrial applications.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In line with this, various attempts have been made to apply 5G communication systems to IoT networks. For example, technologies such as a sensor network, Machine Type Communication (MTC), and Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication may be implemented by beamforming, MIMO, and array antennas. Application of a cloud Radio Access Network (RAN) as the above-described Big Data processing technology may also be considered to be as an example of convergence between the 5G technology and the IoT technology.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Wireless communication is one of the most successful innovations in modern history. Recently, the number of subscribers to wireless communication services exceeded 5 billion, and it continues to grow rapidly. Due to an increasing popularity of smart phones and other mobile data devices (for example, tablet computers, notebook computers, netbooks, e-book readers, and machine-type devices) among consumers and enterprises, demands for wireless data services are growing rapidly. In order to meet the rapid growth of the mobile data services and support new applications and deployments, it is essential to improve the efficiency and coverage of wireless interfaces.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A base station may include a central unit control plane entity of the base station and a central unit user plane entity of the base station.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">When a User Equipment (UE) moves between two base stations, in order to ensure a service continuity, a handover process needs to be defined, including an intra-system handover, such as a handover between gNB and gNB, a handover between gNB and eNB connected to 5GC, and an inter-system handovers, such as a handover between 5G system (5GS) and an evolved packet system (EPS).</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">For data forwarding, there are still problems on how the source base station and the target base station coordinately work.

Other embodiments of the system architecture <b>200</b> may be used without departing from the scope of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0189">A user equipment (UE) <b>201</b> is a terminal device for receiving data. Next Generation Radio Access Network (NG-RAN) <b>202</b> is a radio access network, in which includes base station (gNB or eNB connected to 5G core network (5GC), eNB connected to 5GC is also called ng-gNB) that provide interfaces for UE to access the wireless network.

Alternatively, base stations may be divided into a control plane entity of the base station and a user plane entity of the base station.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0190">The exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure are further described below in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0191">The specification and drawings are provided as examples only to help understand the present disclosure. They should not be construed as limiting the scope of the present disclosure in any way. Although certain embodiments and examples have been provided with reference to the present disclosure, it is obvious to those skilled in the art that various changes in the illustrated embodiments and examples may be made without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0192">A central unit control plane entity of a base station in the embodiments of the present disclosure may also be referred to as a control plane entity of the base station, which refers to a logical entity that includes radio resource control (RRC) and packet data convergence protocol (PDCP) control plane parts in the base station.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0193">A central unit user plane entity of the base station in the embodiments of the present disclosure may also be referred to as a user plane entity of the base station, which refers to a logical entity that includes the user plane function part of the packet data convergence protocol (PDCP) in the base station. The logical entity may also include the functions of service data adaptation protocol (SDAP).</p><p id="p-0195" num="0194">During the handover process, the source base station may send the configuration information of the UE at the source base station to the target base station, and the target base station determines whether to use a full configuration or a delta configuration. The source base station does not know whether the target base station determines the full configuration or the delta configuration. For a data radio bearer (DRB) for which the target base station has received downlink data forwarding, the source base station forwards the data packets sent to the UE but not confirmed by the UE and fresh data packets to the target base station. In the case where the target base station has an architecture where the control plane and the user plane are separated, the central unit control plane entity of the target base station determines whether to use the full configuration or the delta configuration, but the central unit user plane entity of the target base station does not know whether it is the full configuration or the delta configuration for handover. The central unit user plane entity of the target base station may send all the forwarded data packets received from the source base station to the UE. For the full configuration, a PDCP sequence number (SN) status is not saved, it is useless that the central unit user plane entity of the target base station sends to UE the data packets forwarded by the source base station to the UE but not confirmed by the UE, or the SN included in the packet forwarded by the source base station is useless, which wastes air interface resources, and affects data re-ordering at the UE. The present disclosure provides two ways to solve this problem. Including:</p><p id="p-0196" num="0195">Method 1: The central unit control plane entity of the target base station sends an indication information to the central unit user plane entity of the target base station, so that the central unit user plane entity of the target base station sends appropriate data to the UE according to the indication information. The details are as described in the methods in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> to <b>8</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0196">Method 2: The target base station receives a handover request message, and the target base station sends information on whether to use the full configuration or the delta configuration or whether the PDCP SN status is reserved to the source base station, and the source base station forwards the data to the target base station according to the received information. In the case that the source base station has an architecture where the user plane and the control plane are separated, the central unit control plane entity of the source base station sends indication information to the central unit user plane entity of the source base station, and the central unit user plane entity of the source base station forwards the data to the target base station according to the received information. The details are as described in the methods in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>-<b>14</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0197">During the handover process, the source base station may send the configuration information of the UE at the source base station to the target base station, and the configuration information includes the DRB configuration information at the source base station. The configuration information may also include a mapping from quality of service (Qos) flow to DRB. The target base station determines whether to use the same DRB configuration and/or the same QoS flow to DRB mapping as the source base station. If the target base station determines to use a different DRB configuration and/or different QoS flow to DRB mapping from the source base station, in order to ensure data lostless during the handover process, the target base station may also temporarily configure the old DRB and/or and the same QoS flow to DRB mapping of the source base station, which is used to process the data forwarded by the source base station. For the fresh data received from the core network, the target base station uses the new DRB and/or the QoS flow to DRB mapping determined by the target. In the case where the target base station has an architecture where the control plane and the user plane are separated, the central unit control plane entity of the target base station determines the configuration of the DRB and the QoS flow to DRB mapping. The message sent by the central unit control plane entity of the target base station to the central unit user plane entity of the target base station includes the DRB to be established or modified and the Qos flow(s) mapped on the DRB. In the current mechanism, the central unit user plane entity of the target base station only receives a set of information of the QoS flow to DRB mapping, and the central unit user plane entity of the target base station does not know whether the mapping information is a new mapping determined by the target or a mapping from the source. The central unit user plane entity of the target base station will receive the data forwarded from the source base station and the fresh data received from the core network. In the above scenario, processing the forwarded data from the source base station and the fresh data received from the core network using the received information of the Qos Flow(s) mapped on the DRB by the central unit user plane entity of the target base station will cause data loss problems, or processing the fresh data received from the core network without using the QoS flow to DRB mapping on target. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>21</b> and <b>24</b></figref> of the present disclosure show four methods to solve this problem. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref> shows the method of releasing the old DRB configured on the base station distribution unit (gNB-DU) among these methods.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0198">For a case where UE handovers from a 5G system (5GS) to an evolved packet system (EPS), the source NG-RAN node determines the mapping of Qos Flow to DRB when the PDU session is established, and the central unit control plane entity of the source base station sends the DRB to be established and the Qos flow information mapped on the DRB to the central unit user plane entity of the source base station, and the central unit user plane entity of the source base station processes the data received from the core network according to the mapping. For direct data forwarding from the source NG-RAN to the target base station, a tunnel for each Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN) Radio Access Bearer (E-RAB) is established between the source NG-RAN node and the target base station for data forwarding. The target base station assigns a tunnel for each E-RAB and sends it to the source NG-RAN node. The E-RAB mapped by the Qos flow is determined by the core network. If a number of E-RABs to which the Qos flow maps is more than the number of DRBs determined by NG-RAN, the central unit control plane entity of the source base station may not send tunnel information corresponding to each E-RAB to the center unit user plane entity of the source base station through the existing bearer context modification request message.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0199">In addition, for the inter-system handover from 5GS to EPS, the data packet header forwarded by the source base station does not include the SDAP header, while for the intra-system handover of 5GS, the data forwarded on the DRB tunnel may include the SDAP header. Data forwarding is performed by the central unit user plane entity of the source base station to forward data to the target base station. In the prior art, the central unit user plane entity of the source base station does not know when the SDAP header is included in the forwarded data packet and when the SDAP header is not included in the forwarded data packet. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>24</b> to <b>25</b></figref> show two ways to solve the above problems.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0200"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is an exemplary flowchart illustrating a method <b>300</b> for supporting handover according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. The method <b>300</b> may be used for an intra-system handover or an inter-system handover, and may be performed on the central unit user plane entity of the target base station.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0201">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, in the method <b>300</b>, in step S<b>301</b>, a message is received from the central unit control plane entity of the target base station.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0202">In step S<b>302</b>, a data packet is received from the source base station.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0203">In step S<b>303</b>, a packet data convergence protocol (PDCP) service data units (SDU) including PDCP sequence numbers (SNs) in the received data packets are discarded according to the indication of the message.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0204">Alternatively, in step S<b>303</b>, the PDCP SN included in the received data packet is discarded according to the indication of the message. Discarding the PDCP SN included in the received data packet means that the central unit user plane entity of the target base station does not send the PDCP SN received from the source base station to the UE. The data packet may be sent to the UE after processing by the target side after the central unit user plane entity of the target base station removes the PDCP SN in the PDCP SDU.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0205">According to the embodiment of the present disclosure, the message may indicate the discarding of the PDCP SDU including the PDCP SN in the received data packet and the discarding of the PDCP SN included in the received data packet through an explicit indication way or an implicit indication way. The explicit indication may comprise including an indication information in the message, and the implicit indication may comprise no PDCP SN status information included in the message.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0206">Specifically, in an example of the explicit indication way, in step S<b>301</b>, the message received from the central unit control plane entity of the target base station includes the indication information. The indication information may indicate at least one of the following: whether to use a full configuration or a delta configuration; whether the PDCP SN is reserved; whether the PDCP is restarted; discarding the data packet of the PDCP SDU including the PDCP SN; or discarding the PDCP SN included in the received data packet. Restarting PDCP means that the PDCP is deleted and then readded.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0207">The central unit control plane entity of the target base station may send the indication information to the central unit user plane entity of the target base station through a bearer context modification request message. The bearer context modification request message is used for bearer setup or bearer modification.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0208">The central unit user plane entity of the target base station saves the received information.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0209">In an example, in step S<b>302</b>, the central unit user plane entity of the target base station receives the data packet from the source base station or forwarded by the source base station through the core network. If the source base station also supports an architecture where the user plane and the control plane are separated, the data is received from the central unit user plane entity of the source base station.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0210">In an example, in step S<b>303</b>, the central unit user plane entity of the target base station discards the PDCP SDU including the PDCP SN or discards the PDCP SN included in the received data packet when the indication information indicates at least one of the following: full configuration; the PDCP SN is not reserved; the PDCP restarts; and discard the PDCP SDU including the PDCP SN or discard the PDCP SN included in the received data packet.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0211">That is, the central unit user plane entity of the target base station discards the PDCP SDU including the PDCP SN that the source base station attempted to send to the user equipment (UE). The central unit user plane entity of the target base station identifies these data packets and discards them based on the presence of SN in the forwarded general packet radio service (GPRS) Tunneling Protocol (GTP) user plane (GTP-U) data packet.
