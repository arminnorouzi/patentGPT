id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">Various aspects of the present invention relate to a method of treating cancer in a subject having cancer cells, wherein the cancer cells possess at least one growth hormone receptor, and wherein the method includes controlling an action of the growth hormone receptor. In various non-limiting embodiments, controlling an action of the growth hormone receptor may occur via knock down of the growth hormone receptor, or may be caused by inhibiting growth hormone action, such as via the use of antibodies directed against growth hormone or the growth hormone receptor. Methods may also relate to administering an antagonist of the growth hormone receptor, and administering at least one anti-tumor drug in concert with administration of the antagonist. Another aspect may include a method of maintaining an anti-tumor drug in cancer cells of a subject by controlling an action of at least one growth hormone receptor in the cancer cells.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="68.50mm" wi="158.75mm" file="US20230002775A1-20230105-D00000.TIF" alt="embedded image"

This discussion is believed to be helpful in providing the reader with background information to facilitate a better understanding of various aspects of the present invention. Accordingly, it should be understood that these statements are to be read in this light, and not as admissions of prior art.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Melanoma (a word derived from the Greek words&#x2014;melas, &#x201c;dark&#x201d; and oma &#x201c;tumor&#x201d;) is an ancient disease, dating back to 5<sup>th </sup>century BC with the earliest physical evidence found in the 2,400-year-old mummies of the pre-Colombian era. In modern times, melanoma is considered the most aggressive and treatment-resistant form of human skin cancer, with an annual incidence of 73,870 in 2015 with a total of approximately 1,000,000 patients in the USA. The estimated mortality from melanoma in the US in 2015 is 9,970 and includes children, adolescents and adults. Fair skinned people have the highest propensity to acquire melanoma, with males (28.2%) having a higher predisposition than females (16.8%). More than 10,000 men and women in the United States and 60,000 worldwide are expected to die of melanoma in 2016, which globally claims about five lives per hour.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The number of new cases annually has been rising steadily in the last 30 years, during which the five-year survival rate increased from 86% (1985) to 93% (2012), albeit with a poor quality of life. Studies indicate increased UV exposure, use of tanning beds, hormone replacement therapies as well as improved and increased diagnostic screening, as the underlying causes of heightened melanoma incidence. Melanoma usually occurs in the exposed parts of the body&#x2014;face, neck, hands and feet&#x2014;but can also be found in any anatomical site occupied by melanocytes, like the gastrointestinal, genitourinary and respiratory mucosa, and the choroidal layers of the eye.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Chemotherapeutic interventions for melanoma often result in drug resistance that may occur by several cellular mechanisms. The development of a melanoma vaccine has enjoyed limited success. However, in the last five years, a number of highly efficacious immunotherapies, e.g. CTLA-4 antibody, ipilimumab; PD-1/PD-L1 antibody, and pembrolizumab, and targeted therapies, e.g. V600E BRAF inhibitor and vemurafenib, have been approved by the FDA. Several additional therapeutic regimens are in various stages of development. In spite of these promising advancements in melanoma therapy, some areas of concern remain. For instance, effective therapy with one of the most successful melanoma drugs, pembrolizumab, requires pre-existence of active cytotoxic T-cells in the system while resistance to most other known chemotherapies, including ipilimumab and vemurafenib, has been reported.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Indeed, melanoma is unique among other types of cancers in possessing multiple robust mechanisms of chemotherapeutic resistance. This includes abundant expression of a repertoire of drug efflux pumps, melanosomal sequestration of drugs in melanosomes during melanogenesis, as well as upregulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers. However, molecular mechanisms to define melanoma drug-resistance are lacking.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Certain exemplary aspects of the invention are set forth below.

In this aspect of the present invention, the controlling of an action of the growth hormone receptor may include: knock down of the growth hormone receptor; co-administration of an antagonist of the growth hormone receptor with the anti-tumor drug; inhibiting growth hormone action via antibodies directed against growth hormone; or inhibiting growth hormone action via antibodies directed against the growth hormone receptor.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification, illustrate embodiments of the invention and, together with the general description of the invention given above and the detailed description of the embodiments given below, serve to explain the principles of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> includes microphotographs showing siRNA transfection efficiency in SK-MEL-28 cells [plated at 10,000 cells/cm<sup>2 </sup>and treated with either 20 nM GHR-specific siRNA (siRNA-A&#x2014;<b>1</b><i>b</i>, <b>2</b><i>b</i>; siRNA-B&#x2014;<b>1</b><i>c</i>,<b>2</b><i>c</i>; siRNA-C, <b>1</b><i>d</i>, <b>2</b><i>d</i>) or scramble-siRNA (<b>1</b><i>e</i>,<b>2</b><i>e</i>); with untreated cells being treated with only transfection reagent (<b>1</b><i>a</i>, <b>2</b><i>a</i>)].

And, while it is contemplated that the method may be amenable for use with any GHR antagonist (or any of a number of GHR antagonists), in certain embodiments, the antagonist of the growth hormone receptor may be pegvisomant.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Further, and more specifically, one disclosed aspect is a method of attenuating cancer properties of cells by control of GHR action. The cells may be any type of cancer cells, such as melanoma cells, for example. Another aspect is a method of improving a response to chemotherapeutic agents by control of GHR action.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Cancer properties of any cell expressing GHRs may be attenuated in accordance with this invention. GHRs have been implicated in the growth and function of cancer cells associated with breast cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, and melanoma, for example. Any cancer that exhibits increased levels of GHR in the cancer cells may be a target. A biopsy may be used to determine if such increased levels are present in the subject.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">GHR action may be controlled via administration of GHR antagonists, such as pegvisomant. Further, GHR action may be controlled via siRNA mediated GHR-KD or any other means of deactivating or downregulating GHR action. As used herein, the terms &#x201c;growth hormone receptor knock down&#x201d; and &#x201c;GHR-KD&#x201d; mean decreasing the amount and/or action of the growth hormone receptor.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">In one aspect, the effects of the administration of excess hGH or the disruption of GH induced signaling on several GH induced intracellular signaling pathways and downstream proliferative effects in tumor cell growth are used to disrupt cancer progression by taking advantage of GH-GHR interaction. Attenuation of the phosphorylation states of multiple intracellular signaling molecules is attainable by the methods disclosed, as are differential, yet significant changes in RNA levels of GH, prolactin, insulin, IGF1, IGF2, and their cognate receptors, which appear to increase insulin/IGF receptors. Indeed, as used herein GH antagonism may refer not only to a direct action on the GHR but also anything that ultimately lowers serum IGF1. The RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated downregulation of GH action in the melanoma cells translates into a decrease in cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and colony formation on soft agar assays. GH/GHR action in human melanoma cells provides a unique model of GH-regulated multiple critical cellular processes in the tumor. Further, the dependence of the melanoma cells on the GH/GHR interaction validates these interactions as pharmacological targets of intervention in melanoma therapy.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">A comprehensive analysis of GH-GHR action in human melanoma cells exposes a definitive regulation of key intracellular signaling pathways, such as the JAK, STAT (1, 3, and 5), SRC, ERK1/2, AKT, and mTOR, which may be critical mediators of early gene activation and drug resistance in melanoma and other forms of cancer. Observed robust GH-dependent modulation of RNA expressions of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), the HGF-receptor MET, and Erb-B2 tyrosine receptor kinase 3 (ERBB3) in human melanoma cells may indicate a possible involvement of GH on mechanisms of therapy refractoriness in melanoma. Further, melanoma cells may express endogenous GH and the GHR, as well as relatively high levels of receptors of the insulin family (IR, IGF1R and IGF2R). The expression levels of the insulin and IGF receptor family may be modulated by GH action, as described herein.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">GH putatively occupies a central regulatory role in melanoma cell physiology and may be involved in the control of multiple mechanisms of melanoma growth and progression.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">In one aspect, GHR-KD or other downregulation of GHR may be used for the control of four human melanoma cell lines derived from the NCI-60 panel of human cancer cells. The cells were either treated with hGH or had their GHR expression abrogated using GHR-specific siRNA to mimic a transient but acute inhibition of GH action. The subsequent RNA levels and variations of key components of the GH/IGF axis were then examined to determine the efficacy of the treatments. Human melanoma cells have endogenous GH and GHR, with the GH/IGF1 axis affecting expression of multiple genes. Signaling networks in the melanoma cell are GH-dependent and were significantly upregulated in presence of GH and also were severely suppressed following GHR-KD. GHR-KD in melanoma cells significantly suppressed characteristic tumor phenotypes associated with proliferation and metastasis of cancer cells, including melanoma cells.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">In another aspect, treatment of melanoma cells with sub-EC<sub>50 </sub>doses of anti-cancer drugs, in parallel with blocking GHR action, may result in a significant suppression of major pathways and processes associated with drug resistance. This may provide a direct opportunity to reduce the dosage of anti-cancer chemotherapy by several folds while at least maintaining an equivalent level of tumor clearance. In turn, these effects may allow patients and clinicians to better manage costs and side-effects associated with cancer therapy. The suppression of GHR expression using siRNA leads to a marked reduction in RNA- and protein expression of ATP binding cassette transporters (ABC transporters), significant downregulation of key modulators of the melanogenesis pathway, including the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) and its target tyrosinase related protein 1 (TYRP1), and a significant reversal in the RNA and protein levels of markers of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT). Many anti-cancer drugs have been approved for a variety of cancers, but certain anti-tumor agents such as cisplatin, doxorubicin, paclitaxel, and vemurafenib are used against melanoma, while compounds such as oridonin are under study to determine possible therapeutic targets. A large hurdle in treating melanoma is its intrinsic development of resistance to a given therapy fueled largely by the abundant expression of a repertoire of xenobiotic efflux pumps of the ABC transporter family as well as possible mechanisms of drug sequestration in melanosomes. Following GHR-KD, melanoma cells exhibit significantly longer drug retention and increased sensitivity to even sub-EC<sub>50 </sub>doses of anti-cancer drugs. Therefore, GHR reduction or suppression of GH action can be utilized in combination with other US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Union approved chemo-therapies with established and/or novel anti-tumor compounds. Thus, an approach of concomitant GHR antagonism or down regulation with conventional therapies may provide improved therapeutic interventions. This approach may not only lead to a more effective treatment plan for a given cancer, but may reduce the required drug dosages. This in turn may lower any physiological side-effects of the drugs and the associated cost burden.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">In another aspect, a method of treating a human patient for cancer includes controlling the effects of GHR in cancer cells. One manner of controlling the effects of GHR in cancer cells is by administering a GHR antagonist, such as pegvisomant for example. Pegvisomant is a recombinant protein that mimics the interaction of GH with GHR. If pegvisomant is administered as a GHR antagonist, dosages may be varied to cause a physiological effect, e.g., a lowering of serum insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF 1). For instance, the dosage may be 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 25 mg, 30 mg, 35 mg, 40 mg, 45 mg, 50 mg, 55 mg, 60 mg, 65 mg, 70 mg, 75 mg, 80 mg, or even higher. To determine the correct dosage of pegvisomant, the serum concentrations of IGF 1 may be monitored, with dosage adjusted in 5 mg increments to achieve and maintain normal serum IGF1 levels.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In another aspect, a mechanism for preventing cancer in a human patient is described. The effects of active GHR-induced intracellular signaling may be reduced or controlled in a prophylactic manner to prevent the growth and spread of cancer within the human patient. Such a prophylactic treatment may be indicated, for example, where the patient presents with polyps and/or other precancerous symptoms.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">The following examples may provide further explanation of the described subject matter.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Example 1</heading><p id="p-0101" num="0100">In this Example 1, the inventors demonstrated that (1) GHR expression in melanoma cells was abrogated by siRNA; (2) GHR-KD suppresses human melanoma cell migration, invasion, colony formation, and proliferation; (3) GH-GHR action regulates phosphorylation states of intracellular signaling intermediates in human melanoma cells; and (4) targeting GHR remodels RNA expression of members of the IGF family of proteins and suppresses oncogenic receptors on/in human melanoma cells.

The network of Ins, IGF1, and IGF2, as well as their cognate receptors (IR, IGF1R, IGF2R) and binding proteins (IGFBPs), may be involved with melanoma disease progression. Thus, the levels of these species were examined following the perturbation of the GH-GHR axis by either addition of exogenous hGH or GHR-KD. No IGF2 or insulin RNA expression in the melanoma cell lines was observed.

With the exception of SK-MEL-28 cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>B</figref>, panel <b>3</b>), GHR-KD increased IGFBP3 levels by as much as 3-fold (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b>C, <b>19</b>C, and <b>20</b>C</figref>).

The example provided above (Example 1) presents mechanistic details of GH-GHR action in human melanoma cells. Detectable levels of hGH RNA and protein, as well as its cognate GHR, were observed on human melanoma cells. Basal level phosphorylation of GH-regulated intracellular signaling networks, such as JAK2, STATs 1, 3, 5, ERK1/2, SRC, AKT, and mTOR, in absence of externally added GH, suggested the presence of an autocrine ligand-receptor loop existent and critical in these four melanoma cell lines, although there is no intention to be bound by any particular theory. This observation indicates that GH-GHR pair could be an important marker of metastatic melanoma.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0155">Without intending to be bound by any particular theory, endocrine as well as paracrine/autocrine GH appears to directly activate certain intracellular signaling pathways and drive aggressive tumor phenotypes and EMT in human melanoma, as shown above. Further dissecting the autocrine vs. intracrine roles of this ligand-receptor pair using human melanoma as a model might be of substantial interest. Skin is an extra-pituitary site of GH as well as PRL expression and autocrine effect. PRL and expression of PRLR on tumor tissues are implicated in breast and prostate cancers for a considerable time via its mitogenic and angiogenic properties. Low but consistent RNA levels of both PRL and PRLR were observed in the example above, as was a consistent marked rise in PRLR levels following GHR-KD in SK-MEL-28, MALME-3M, and MDA-MB-435 cells. The presence of excess GH potentiated the effect. PRL-PRLR signaling engages intracellular mediators, such as JAK2, PI3K, ERK1/2, and STAT5, which overlaps with GHR signaling pathway.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0156">The siRNA mediated GHR-KD could lead to a compensatory non-canonical binding of GH-PRLR and subsequent downstream signaling. Basal phosphorylation of the ERK1/2 and AKT/mTOR components was observed in all four melanoma cell lines. Without intending to be bound by any theory, a constitutively active RAS, harboring the V600E mutation in these cell lines, is believed to be the cause of this observation. However, on GHR-KD, a decrease in ERK1/2, AKT, and mTOR was observed in all cases, often below the basal levels, irrespective of presence of hGH. Without intending to be bound by any particular theory, this significant downregulation may indicate that suppression of an active autocrine GH-GHR interaction contributes significantly to down regulation of the basal phosphorylation states of these signaling pathways. The residual phosphorylation observed following GHR-KD, although significantly low, could be induced by GH binding and activation of PRLR as well as other shared signaling pathways. Importantly, exogenous GH and GHR-KD had significant enhancing and suppressing effects respectively, on relevant intracellular signaling pathways. Similarly, the effect of increased PRLR from endocrine or paracrine PRL is of continued interest. However, observed RNA levels of PRLR in these melanoma cells were more than 100-fold lower than the observed GHR RNA levels, and no significant variation was observed due to altered autocrine PRL-PRLR level on GHR-KD-induced effects in either the phosphorylation levels of intracellular signaling intermediates or in the tumoral phenotypes of migration, invasion, and proliferation.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0157">The role of IGF axis in human melanoma prompted an analysis of RNA levels of insulin-IGF axis in human melanoma cells during GH-excess and GHR-KD. No endogenous insulin or IGF2 RNA or protein levels were detected in any of the four melanoma cells tested, but RT-qPCR studies revealed the presence of IGF1 RNA. IGF1 &#x26; IGF2 and their cognate receptors are believed to be important regulators of multiple human cancers, including melanoma. High levels of RNA of the corresponding cognate receptors, i.e., IR, IGF1R, and IGF2R, were observed in all four melanoma cells studied in the above example. Significant suppression of IGF2R on all melanoma cells was observed following GHR-KD, but a significant rise in IGF1R and IR RNA levels was observed following GHR-KD, especially when treated with excess GH.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0158">The melanoma cells also appear to be in a state of heightened insulin/IGF sensitivity via abundant expression of IR, IGF1R, and IGF2R, as seen in all four melanoma cells in the above example. Increased levels of IGFBP3 were observed following GHR-KD for the four cell lines, along with a concomitant increase in IGF1 levels. Without intending to be bound by any particular theory, it is speculated that this could possibly be an IGF1 mediated increase in IGFBP3 levels. However, the regulatory role of IGF axis in human melanoma appears to be limited at the early stage of disease progression and not in the case of metastatic malignant melanoma. Additionally, as with PRL and PRLR, the basal RNA levels of IGF1 were 3-fold lower than GH levels, and the GH induced changes in members of the IGF family apparently had no observable variation on intracellular signaling or tumor phenotypes, as described above.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0159">Overall, in most cancer treatments, achieving a therapeutic reduction in endocrine IGF1 levels appears to be favored in halting tumor progression. Moreover, starvation or diet restriction induces a reduction in circulating IGF1 and may preferentially protect normal cells while sensitizing melanoma cells to chemotherapy. Thus, the use of GHR-antagonists or any therapeutic modality which decreases GH induced intracellular signaling, including but not limited to siRNAs, antibodies to GH or the GHR, and inhibitors of JAK, JAK2, STATs, STAT5, SRC, AKT ERK1/2, and mTOR, in melanoma therapy.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0160">Targeting GHR elevates insulin and IGF1 receptors, meaning that GHR antagonism, including with concurrent administration of IGF1R inhibitors, provides a pathway towards melanoma therapy. Reduction in tumor cell proliferation can either be caused by a direct decrease in the levels of GHR, by downstream signaling, or by reducing circulating IGF1 levels by decreasing hepatic and other cellular IGF1 output. Therefore, the above example predicts a mechanistic rationale of combining GHR antagonism with IGF1R inhibition as a logical combination treatment in malignant human melanoma.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0161">Also, the example above shows GH regulation of the autocrine hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and its cognate receptor MET (or c-MET) on the four melanoma cell lines. Although intrinsic RNA levels of HGF were low, there was significant increase when treated with added hGH in SK-MEL-28 and MDA-MB-435 cells, as well as a significant downregulation following GHR-KD. Moreover, high RNA levels of the HGF-receptor MET were observed on all four melanoma cells, which high RNA levels exhibited a dose dependent rise with added hGH. On the other hand, GHR-KD significantly suppressed the same, even in presence of relatively high levels of hGH. This set of results suggest a possible transcriptional control of MET and HGF expression by hGH.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162">Additionally, the ERBB family members, EGFR, ERBB1, ERBB2, and ERBB3 may drive several oncogenic processes in melanoma. RNA levels of ERBB3 were upregulated in response to excess GH in SK-MEL-28 and MDA-MB-435, and a consistent suppression occurred following GHR-KD. Both MET and EGFR may strongly activate the SRC signaling pathway. GH may activate EGFR in liver regeneration. Thus, the results provided in Example 1 indicate a regulatory role of GH on expression of HGF, MET, and ERBB3 in human melanoma cells. Identifying the underlying mechanisms of transcriptional regulation and downstream intracellular targets can add value to the extent of dependence of malignant metastatic melanoma on the GH-GHR axis.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0163">STAT3 activation in melanoma may drive multiple transformations, including EMT, angiogenesis, and inhibition of apoptosis by increasing expressions of intrinsic oncogenic factors, such as microphthalmia associated transcription factor (MITF). STAT3 activation may also cooperatively induce downstream factors, such as c-fos. Robust GH-mediated STAT3 regulation is of further interest, including in melanoma, and commends itself to new studies investigating role of GH in cellular reprogramming and cancer initiating cells. STAT3 is also a converging point in signaling networks for multiple different upstream regulators, e.g. SRC and JAK2, as well as ERBB family members, such as EGF4 and ERBB3. The results obtained in the above example show the presence of constitutive activation of SRC and STAT1, 3, and 5 proteins in melanomal tumors. GH-induced activation of STAT proteins was found to be active in melanoma. A significant decrease of STAT activation was observed below basal levels, even in presence of added GH, with GHR-KD, suggesting (i) attenuation of the autocrine GH-mediated activation, as well as (ii) sensitivity and dependence of the melanoma cells on GH-GHR interaction and activation of either JAK2 or SRC or both. The presence of basal phosphorylation of both JAK2 and SRC kinases, as well as their respective changes with GHR-KD and/or added exogenous GH, as observed in all cell lines, may indicate that both signaling mediators may be highly responsive to GH in melanoma. Upregulation of the basal STAT1 phosphorylation levels suggests GH action as an explanation for observations in recurrent melanoma phenotypes. The STAT5 dependence on GH-GHR induced activation, as noted above, also suggests the role of GH-GHR action in activating STAT5, which is believed to be an oncogenic driver in melanoma and believed to protect the cell against interferon-based immunotherapies. In melanoma cells, STAT5 acts to mediate resistance to apoptosis and may be activated by both JAK2 and SRC kinases. Thus, without intending to be bound by any particular theory, the above results indicating significant basal activation of JAK2, SRC, STATs 1, 3, and 5, in melanoma suggests that these pathways might be under the control of an autocrine GH-GHR system that was affected by GHR-KD. Therefore, along with GHR-KD, these can be evaluated from a new perspective as therapeutic targets in future studies.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0164">In general, the above Example 1 suggests that melanoma cells orchestrate increased proliferation, invasion, and migration directed by GH, and the interaction of GH with the GHR regulates intracellular signaling pathways and also upregulates oncogenic pathways, such as HGF-MET and ERBB3. In summary, this example presents a mechanistic model of GH regulation in human malignant melanoma cells. Without intending to bound by any particular theory, endocrine or paracrine or autocrine GH binds to abundantly expressed GHR on human melanoma and activates JAK2 as well as SRC kinases. This activation leads to phosphorylation of STAT1, STAT3, STAT5, ERK1/2, AKT, and mTOR and further promotes invasion, migration, and proliferation for tumor progression. Together these results identify novel regulatory roles of GH in one of the most aggressive and disease-resistant forms of cancer. Using GHR-KD, the results demonstrate that targeting GHR can be a point of intervention in melanoma therapeutics and may be useful even in the context of continual occurrence of chemotherapy resistance. In the following Example 2, this unique relationship between GHR levels and drug resistance mechanisms in human melanoma is investigated.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Example 2</heading><p id="p-0166" num="0165">In this Example 2, the inventors demonstrated that (1) GHR knock-down significantly suppresses expression of ABC transporter pumps in human melanoma cells; (2) GHR knockdown significantly suppresses RNA levels of melanogenesis regulators in human melanoma cells; and (3) GHR knock-down significantly modulates markers of EMT in human melanoma cells. The results of this Example 2 provide data not only in the context of the effect of GHR-KD on expression of ABC transporters mediating multi-drug resistance in human melanoma, but also identify cell-specific and multiple drug-specific variations of seven different ABC transporters in melanoma. The results reveal a specific expression profile of several ABC transporter pumps in melanoma cells following exposure to specific anti-tumor compounds in the context of decreased GHR, and establish a novel role of regulation of GH in multi-drug resistance in melanoma.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0166">Materials and Methods</p><p id="p-0168" num="0167">Cell Culture</p><p id="p-0169" num="0168">Human melanoma cells SK-MEL-5 (#HTB-70), SK-MEL-28 (#HTB-72), MALME-3M (#HTB-64), and MDA-MB-435S (#HTB-129), as well as normal melanocyte ST-MEL (ATCC #30-2001), were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, Va.) and grown in the recommended media with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS; ATCC #302020) and 1&#xd7; antibiotic-antimycotic (Thermo Fisher Scientific #15240) at 37&#xb0; C. in 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>in a humidified incubator.

ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter pumps in the MDR and MRP family are involved in exclusion of xenobiotics from inside the cells to outside. This reduces the retention time of drugs inside a cell and confers decreased sensitivity to the drug-effects. In this example, the Vybrant multidrug resistance assay kit (Molecular Probes #V13180, Eugene, Oreg.) was used for the drug retention assay. The assay uses the non-fluorescent calcein acetoxymethylester (calcein-AM) as a drug-mimic and a substrate for the melanoma cell efflux pumps. Calcein-AM is highly lipid soluble and permeates the cell membrane where it is converted to a fluorescent calcein by the intracellular esterases. In the absence of (or even decreased) activity of the efflux pumps, the intensely fluorescent calcein is retained and can be measured as an indication of drug retention inside the cell. The assay was performed as per the manufacturer's protocol with some modifications.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0184">Briefly, the siRNA treated cells were trypsinized 48 hours after transfection, counted, and seeded at 50,000 cells/well in a black, clear bottom Costar 96-well plate (Corning #3603, Corning, N.Y.).

Melanoma expresses a number of ABC efflux pumps, the RNA levels of which were specifically investigated for ABCB1, ABCB5, ABCB8, ABCC1, ABCC2, ABCG1, and ABCG2 based on reports of their presence and drug-resistance activity in human melanoma. The results of the investigation of ABC transporters reported above and compiled in Table 1 provides data not only in the context of the effect of GHR-KD on expression of ABC transporters mediating multi-drug resistance in human melanoma, but also identifies cell-specific and multiple drug-specific variations of seven different ABC transporters in melanoma. The results reveal a specific expression profile of several ABC transporter pumps in melanoma cells following exposure to specific anti-tumor compounds in the context of decreased GHR, and establish a novel role and regulation of GH in multi-drug resistance in melanoma.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0207">Recent studies in GHR knock-out (GHRKO) mice identified decreased levels of melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH) compared to their wild-type littermates. Since MSH is a potent regulator of melanogenesis in melanocytes as well as melanoma, it is reasonable to speculate a GH-dependent variation in melanogenesis in these cells. To that end, the levels of two key regulators of melanogenesis, i.e. tyrosinase related protein 1 (TYRP1) and its transcriptional regulator the microphthalmia associated transcription factor (MITF), were investigated. TYRP1 is a rate limiting enzyme in melanin synthesis pathway. A potent downregulation of the phosphorylation states of ERK1/2 and AKT/mTOR pathways with GHR-KD has been observed, as has a dose-dependent increase with additional GH. See Example 1, above. This is especially relevant with respect to MITF regulation, following reports of an ERK1/2 binding domain in the MITF gene. MITF is the principal driver of melanocyte differentiation and development from neural crest cells and occupies a central role as a driver of melanoma to metastasis as well as in the interaction of melanoma with its microenvironment. Therefore, identification of a GH-regulation of MITF could be of substantial importance. The finding of upregulation of MITF and TYRP1 levels with increasing exogenous GH, as well as marked downregulation of the same following GHR-KD, strongly implicates GH action in control of the melanogenesis pathway used in the melanoma cell lines for active sequestration of drugs via ABC transporters present on the cell membrane and the melanosomal boundary.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0208">EMT plays a physiological role in wound-healing, fibrosis, and in the progression of cancer. Melanomas break free from the homeostatic control of keratinocytes by loss in expression of E-cadherin, upregulation of expression of fibroblast interacting cadherins such as N-cadherin, and upregulation of mesenchymal markers such as vimentin. Numerous studies have reviewed the importance of EMT in cancer metastasis. EMT is a regulator of drug resistance in lung cancer. Also, activation of the miRNA-96-182-183 cluster may cause an autocrine GH mediated direct regulation of EMT. The above observations of reappearance or increase of epithelial markers (E-cadherin) and concomitant downregulation of mesenchymal markers, such as N-cadherin and vimentin, following GHR-KD, at both RNA and protein levels thus describe a role of GH as a regulator of EMT and the aggressive phenotypes of melanoma multi-drug resistance and metastasis.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0209">Melanomas have the unique property of resisting drug action by multiple processes involving active drug efflux, increased melanogenesis, and concomitant packaging away of drugs in melanosomes, as well as upregulation of the epithelial-mesenchymal-transition markers as means of decreased keratinocyte control and increased fibroblast interaction. Melanomas were also found to express one of the highest levels of GHR expression among all human cancers in the NCI's panel of human cancer cell lines. These two unique properties of human melanoma were investigated, and distinct regressive effects of GHR KD on critical aspects of all the above drug-evading processes were observed. Significant reduction in expression of multiple different ABC transporter pumps following a decrease in GHR indicates a GH action dependent mechanism regulating drug efflux from melanoma. In fact, the existence of GH-GHR mediated regulation of the mTOR pathway in melanoma cells is shown in Example 1, above, and GH induced activation of the pathway is known to be necessary for rapid activation of protein synthesis, as might be expected to be required in case of expression of transporter pumps in response to exposure to drugs. These observations may be experimentally confirmed in vivo using appropriately designed mouse models of growth hormone transgenic (bGH) or GHR deficient (GHR<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup>) mice. Further, the detailed effects of GHR on induction of apoptotic and/or necrotic cell death, as well as DNA damage, can add significant value to our results.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0210">Described above is a mechanistic model of GH action in mediating multi-drug resistance in human melanoma through possible transcriptional regulation of expression of multiple mediators. Indeed, a significant GH-dependent variation in transcription and protein expression of several intracellular mediators of oncogenic signaling pathways in melanoma was observed (See Example 1), and this observation adds unknown information of the downstream effects of the earlier findings.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0211">Decreased drug efflux machinery, increased drug retention, a reversal in EMT markers and a reduced cell proliferation at low doses of chemotherapy following GHR-KD supports the idea of approaching GH-GHR interaction as a suitable chemotherapeutic target of intervention as a combination therapy for several classes of anti-tumor compounds. Thus, this approach may have several downstream effects in cancer therapy. First, a lower drug dose applied in combination or following pretreatment with GHR antagonists can potentially lower the dose and duration of chemotherapy. This, in effect, may reduce the harsh side-effects associated with chemotherapy. Second, employing GHR inhibition as a means of sensitizing the tumor cells to other chemotherapeutic compounds may be one approach in the area of drug development. Third, a combination of GHR inhibition and chemotherapy can not only improve the efficacy of available anti-melanoma drugs but can also assist the development of candidate compounds under development. Decreased drug retention in tumors is a hurdle in establishing efficacy of thousands of good drug candidates in pharmaceutical research and development. The above Examples directly indicate a breakthrough in this problem by establishing that GH-GHR interaction is a mediator of drug-resistance and that targeting the same can successfully lead to improved drug action.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">Example 3</heading><p id="p-0214" num="0212">In the above Examples 1 and 2, the role of the GH-GHR axis in human melanoma cells, using extensive in vitro studies, was described.

RNA levels were normalized against expression of &#x3b2;-actin and GAPDH as reference genes [*, p&#x3c;0.05, Wilcoxon sign rank test].</p><p id="p-0232" num="0230">Realtime RT-PCR analyses showed significant upregulation of mRNA levels of the mesenchymal transcription factors Zeb1 and Snai1 in both bGH and GHRKO mice, with a concomitant marked decrease in Cdh1 mRNA levels (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>42</b>A-<b>42</b>F</figref>). A more detailed analysis revealed that the above trend was more consistent in both bGH and GHRKO male mice, than in the female counterparts (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>42</b>C-<b>42</b>F</figref>). Also, the upregulation in Zeb1 and Snai1 levels in GHRKO male mice was suppressed in the female GHRKO mice, although the latter had significantly lower Cdh1 levels than their wild-type littermates. Further, a significantly lower protein level expression of the epithelial marker Cdh1 in female GHRKO mice, and a significantly higher ABCG2 level in GHRKO male mice compared to the tumors in their wild-type littermates (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>43</b>A and <b>43</b>B</figref>), was observed.</p><p id="p-0233" num="0231">GH upregulates and GHR-antagonist suppresses the expression of ABC-transporters and markers of EMT in human liver cancer cells in vitro: The inventors earlier showed that in human melanoma cells expressing GHR, exogenous GH drives the expression of known markers of EMT, while blocking the GHR expression using siRNA, inhibits GH induced action and upregulation in EMT marker expressions. And so, the inventors performed a similar experiment with HepG2 and SK-HEP-1 human liver cancer cells, which have been extensively studied and known to express GHR, to verify this observation in human melanoma cells. In vitro, HepG2 cells were treated for 3 days with either 50 ng/mL GH (2.5 nM), or 50 nM GHR-antagonist, or both GH and GHR-antagonist, and their RNA expressions were compared against untreated controls at basal condition (i.e. no drug treatment). In Hep-G2 cells, exogenous GH treatment was found to significantly upregulate the RNA levels of mesenchymal marker vimentin, while downregulating CDH1, the epithelial marker (top panel graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>44</b></figref>). On the other hand, treatment with GHR-antagonist alone or in presence of GH, markedly lowered the levels of mesenchymal markers&#x2014;SNAIL (SNAI1), ZEB1, SLUG, CDH2, and VIM (top panel graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>44</b></figref>). A similar analysis of ABC-transporter RNA expressions showed that exogenous GH markedly upregulated levels of ABCC4 and that of the transcription factor SPI-B, while addition of GHR-antagonist drastically lowered the basal levels of ABCC4, ABCG1, as well as SPI-B, in HepG2 cells (bottom panel graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>44</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0234" num="0232">Blocking GHR attenuates the oncogenic HGF-MET loop in human liver cancer cells: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or human liver cancer has one of the highest cancer morbidity rates in the world, with only one FDA approved chemotherapy (sorafenib) available to patients. The hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and its cognate receptor (MET), both expressed highly on different cancers including melanoma, is known to be an active driver of HCC incidence and progression and have long been implicated as a valuable drug-target [Goyal L, Muzumdar M D, Zhu A X. Targeting the HGF/c-MET Pathway in Hepatocellular Carcinoma. Clin Cancer Res [Internet] 2013; 19: 2310-8. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-2791; Hu C-T, Wu J-R, Cheng C C, Wu W-S.

New generation MET-inhibitors like cabozantinib have had partial success against human HCC, due to cytotoxic effects at high doses in most recent human clinical trials, indicating to unmet needs in countering drug-resistance[Kelley R K, Verslype C, Cohn A L, Yang T-S, Su W-C, Burris H, Braiteh F, Vogelzang N, Spira A, Foster P, Lee Y, Van Cutsem E.

To verify this observation in another GHR expressing human cancer like HCC, the inventors analyzed the effects of GH and GHR-antagonist treatment on the expression of the oncogenic HGF-MET loop in human liver cancer cells. HepG2 and SK-HEP-1 cells were treated for 3 days with either 50 ng/mL GH (2.5 nM), or 50 nM GHR-antagonist, or both, and their RNA expressions were compared against untreated controls at basal levels (i.e. no drug treatment). No additional effect of added GH on the expression levels of HGF or MET in the liver cancer cell lines was observed, except a 2-fold increase in MET levels in SK-HEP-1 cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>39</b></figref>). However, added GHR-antagonist had a drastic effect on the HGF-MET loop in both cell lines. Irrespective of presence of added GH, the antagonist lowered HGF levels by &#x3e;4-fold in Hep-G2 cells and up to 2-fold in SK-HEP-1 cells; while the MET levels were decreased by &#x3e;2-fold in both Hep-G2 and SK-HEP-1 cells compared to the GH treated samples (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>39</b></figref>). This observed nature of the suppressive effect of GHR-antagonist strongly indicates the existence of a autocrine/paracrine GH action in HCC, as the inventors had found stable GH expression in both Hep-G2 and SK-HEP-1 cells.</p><p id="p-0236" num="0234">GH-GHR directly activates JAK2, STA5, STAT3, SRC and ERK1/2 pathways in human liver cancer cells: To trace the intracellular signaling pattern or pathways downstream of GH-GHR interaction in human liver cancer cells, the inventors used a time-lapse analysis of the activation states of known GH-regulated signaling pathways, across time, in Hep-G2 and SK-HEP-1 cells stimulated with 50 ng/mL GH. The inventors observed that within 20 minutes of GH addition in both Hep-G2 and SK-HEP-1 cells, the phosphorylation states of STAT3, STAT5, SRC, and ERK1/2 (p44/42 MAPK) were particularly increased significantly, but not that of p38 MAPK, AKT, mTOR, or S6RP (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>46</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0237" num="0235">Drug-induced autocrine GH-GHR expression drives multiple mechanisms of drug resistance in human melanoma cells: The inventors previously reported the existence of RNA and protein levels of endogenous GH, beside GHR, in human melanoma cells grown in vitro unlike mouse B16F10 cells which express only GHR but no GH. The inventors also reported the existence of a GH-GHR regulated drug resistance mechanism in human melanoma cells. Therefore, the induction of intracellular mechanisms of drug resistance following exposure to chemotherapy in melanoma, could be locally turned on by an autocrine/paracrine GH source, in case of GH-expressing human melanoma cells.</p><p id="p-0238" num="0236">To verify if exposure to chemotherapy alone induces the endogenous levels of GH or GHR, the inventors treated SK-MEL-28 human melanoma cells with 188 nM the chemotherapeutic doxorubicin (=EC<sub>50 </sub>of doxorubicin against SK-MEL-28 cells) and followed the RNA levels of GH and GHR across 2, 6, 12 and 24-hr following drug addition. The inventors parallelly analyzed the changes in transcript levels of known markers of EMT (mesenchymal&#x2014;SNAI1, CDH2/N-cadherin, VIM; epithelial&#x2014;CDH1/E-cadherin) and ABC-type multidrug efflux pumps (ABCB1, ABCB8, ABCC1, ABCC2, ABCC4, ABCG1, ABCG2) with time, following doxorubicin addition. A consistent increase in autocrine GH transcript was observed after 12-hr, with a &#x3e;2-fold rise by 24-hr, with a concomitant rise in GHR levels (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>47</b></figref>). In synchrony to this increased GH response, the transcript levels of CDH2, VIM and SNAI1 increased significantly 12-hr after doxorubicin addition, with &#x3e;2-fold increase in SNAI1 and &#x3e;3.5-fold increase in CDH2 at the end of 24 hr (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>47</b></figref>). There was a &#x3e;8-fold reduction in the epithelial marker CDH1/E-cadherin, at the end of 24 hr after doxorubicin addition (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>47</b></figref>). Similarly, following a consistent upregulation of autocrine GH levels at 12-hr, a 4-fold rise in ABCB1 and an 8-fold rise in ABCG1 (both known transporters of doxorubicin in cancer cells) was observed. At the end of 24 hr, the RNA levels of ABCB1 and ABCG1 were even higher with significantly higher levels of ABCB8, ABCC1 and ABCC4 drug efflux pumps as well (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>48</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0239" num="0237">Discussion of the Above Results</p><p id="p-0240" num="0238">Previously, the inventors found that knocking down GHR attenuated ABC-type multidrug efflux pump gene expression and EMT in multiple human melanoma cell lines. In melanoma, the activation of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) strongly correlates with a transition to aggressive metastases as well as with upregulation of mechanisms of drug resistance. Our observation in the syngeneic mouse model of melanoma was highly consistent with our earlier observation in human melanoma cells. A significantly upregulated RNA level of markers of EMT as well as that of ABC drug efflux pumps, even in the absence of any drug mediated induction, highlight a critical role of GH in possibly ascertaining the intrinsic nature of the tumor. An elegant study by Caramel et al showed how a switch from a Zeb2-dominant phenotype to an EMT-inducing Zeb1-dominant phenotype is a driver of malignancy in melanoma. Recently Zeb1 was also identified as a critical oncogenic regulator in uveal melanoma. In this study, a marked increase in levels of Zeb <b>1</b> in vivo was observed, under both conditions of elevated GH (both bGH and GHRKO mice). This data along with our observations of elevated Snai1 and reduced Cdh1 in our syngeneic mouse model additionally points to a hitherto unidentified role of GH action in driving phenotypic plasticity of cancer cells. The current study provides an excellent support to our earlier in vitro observations of attenuating ABC-type multidrug efflux pumps by GHR knockdown in human melanoma cells. Even in absence of drug treatment, the mRNA levels of Abcb1a, Abcg1 and Abcg2, which are some of the most studied drug transporters in cancer, were elevated concomitantly with an elevated GH exposure in bGH and GHRKO mice, relative to that found in their WT littermates controls. Therefore, melanoma cells on exposure to high GH levels might remain at an elevated state of resistance. This in turn might lead to an aggressively drug-resistant phenotype of melanoma. Further, there were some difference between the patterns of altered expression of ABC-type multidrug efflux pumps and EMT markers in male and female mice with elevated GH. The role of estrogen, pattern of GH release between male and female mice, and a putative role of a differential IGF axis could be some potential confounding modulating factors in the observation. Overall, the data from the unique syngeneic mouse melanoma model with altered GH levels provide a confirmation of our previous in vitro observations and bolsters our understanding of the unique regulatory role of GH-GHR pair in specific drug efflux mechanisms in melanoma cells. It provides further insight into the rapidly unfolding nature of GH regulation of the process of EMT and phenotype switches in cancer cells.</p><p id="p-0241" num="0239">Recently, several studies by Peter Lobie's group, indicated a potentially critical role of autocrine GH expression in cancer cells. His group found that human melanoma cells in in vitro express GH, which is significantly upregulated following drug treatment. Our results strongly support this observation and additionally reveal an intrinsic GH-GHR loop activated within 12 hours of exposure of SK-MEL-28 cells to an anti-cancer drug, which is followed by a marked upregulation of EMT and drug efflux mediators. This is significantly corroborated by our observed effects of GHR-antagonist on EMT markers and ABC-transporters in human liver cancer cells which also have endogenous expression of GH as well as GHR. The data bolsters our proposed model of GH-GHR axis as a regulator of drug resistance in GH-responsive or GHR-expressing human cancers (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>49</b></figref>). The effects of GHR-antagonist in reversing the mechanisms of drug resistance in human liver cancer cells, and the role of autocrine GH-GHR loop in driving drug resistance in human melanoma, supports our claim of sensitizing cancer cells to the effect of anti-cancer therapy in combination with methods of GHR antagonism.</p><p id="p-0242" num="0240">While the present invention was illustrated by the description of one or more embodiments thereof, and while the embodiments have been described in considerable detail, they are not intended to restrict or in any way limit the scope of the appended claims to such detail.
