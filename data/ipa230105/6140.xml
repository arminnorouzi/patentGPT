In the past decades, much research has been focused on developing new polymers and device structures to improve the light conversion efficiency of organic solar cells. As a result, the light conversion efficiency has been reached more than 10%.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, polymers that can exhibit performance suitable for high performance organic solar cells are limited to a few types. In particular, since monomer materials constituting polymers are limited to a few kinds of high-performance monomers known in the art, there is a limitation in terms of diversity of material development.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to achieve high-performance light conversion efficiency in an organic solar cell for the solution process, it is necessary to use a polymer with good properties.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">More specifically, there is a need for developing polymers that exhibit a broad light absorption in the solar spectrum without crystals and aggregation and have high charge mobility, appropriate molecular orientation, and excellent film morphology.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Since the performance of such polymers varies greatly depending on the choice of an electron donor-type or electron acceptor-type repeat unit material used in polymer polymerization, there is a need for developing a polymer for a high-performance organic solar cell through the use of a novel repeat unit material.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">On the other hand, perovskite is a material in which cations, anions, and halides (or oxides) have a specific crystal structure. Research on perovskite solar cells using perovskite as a photo-active layer of solar cells is also in progress. Perovskite solar cells are fabricated by combining inexpensive inorganic and organic materials and have excellent photoelectric conversion efficiencies. Accordingly, they are drawing attention as the next-generation solar cell technology that replaces conventional silicon single crystal solar cells.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Hole transport layer materials that can exhibit performance of a high-performance perovskite solar cell are very limited. Especially, a polymer for a hole transport layer is limited to only a few of the monomers that constitute the polymer for a photo-active layer of a conventional high-performance organic solar cell and thus has a further limitation in terms of diversity in material development.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In order to achieve high-performance light conversion efficiency of the perovskite solar cell, it is necessary to use a polymer for a hole transport layer which has high charge mobility.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Since the characteristics of such polymers vary greatly depending on the choice of an electron donor-type or electron acceptor-type repeat unit material used in polymer polymerization, there is a need for developing a polymer for a high-performance hole transport layer through the use of a novel repeat unit material.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention provides a novel polymer formed with new monomers, a high-efficiency organic solar cell comprising the polymer, and a perovskite solar cell comprising the polymer.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Specifically, the present invention relates to a polymer for a photo-active layer of an organic solar cell having an excellent light absorption rate in a visible light region.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Additionally, the present invention relates to a polymer that has excellent crystallinity, high charge mobility, and an energy level suitable for the use as an electron donor compound in a photo-active layer of an organic solar cell.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Moreover, the present invention provides a perovskite solar cell which uses a novel polymer with high hole mobility as a compound for a hole transport layer and thereby has high efficiency and excellent service life without an additive.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present invention also relates to an organic solar cell comprising the polymer or a perovskite solar cell comprising the polymer, which has the excellent light conversion efficiency.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Solution</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The present invention is devised to solve the above problems and relates to a polymer represented by the following Structural Formula 1.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-C00001" he="44.79mm" wi="76.12mm" file="US20230006141A1-20230105-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0020" num="0018">In Structural Formula 1,</p><p id="p-0021" num="0019">X<sub>1</sub>, X<sub>2</sub>, X<sub>3</sub>, and X<sub>4 </sub>are each independently O, S, Se, NH, or NR&#x2032;,</p><p id="p-0022" num="0020">R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>3</sub>, and R<sub>4 </sub>are each independently an alkyl group having 1 to 50 carbon atoms, an aryl group having 6 to 50 carbon atoms, or &#x2014;COOR&#x2032;,</p><p id="p-0023" num="0021">A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, A<sub>3</sub>, and A<sub>4 </sub>are each independently H, F, CN, or &#x2014;COOR&#x2032;,</p><p id="p-0024" num="0022">R&#x2032;

Specifically, when a benzene ring is added, a band gap is increased because the HOMO level becomes lower and the LUMO level becomes higher. That is, due to the deeper HOMO level, a voltage value Voc of a solar cell device may be increased.</p><p id="p-0255" num="0238">In addition, an element having high electronegativity, for example, fluorine (F) may be substituted in the benzene ring to be introduced. As a result, the HOMO level and the LUMO level may be further lowered, and the voltage value Voc of the solar cell device may be further increased. Also, the introduction of the fluorine may cause an intra-molecular interaction between elemental sulfur of adjacent thiophene and fluorine-sulfur molecules, thereby increasing co-planarity between molecules. Accordingly, &#x3c0;-&#x3c0; interactions between polymer main chains may be enhanced.</p><p id="p-0256" num="0239">Since fluorine is the most electronegative element, it is possible to form a strong dipole. The strong dipole may cause a dipole-dipole interaction, which may enhance an interaction between the main chains of the polymer. The enhanced interaction between the main chains of the polymer may increase the hole mobility of the polymer, and even when the photo-active layer becomes thicker, effective hole movement is possible due to the increased hole mobility. Thus, the maximum light absorption may be achieved due to the thicker thickness of the photo-active layer, thereby improving the efficiency of the organic solar cell to a level of 10%.</p><p id="p-0257" num="0240">Also, according to one embodiment of the present invention, a crystalline coherence length (CCL) of the polymer for a photo-active layer of an organic solar cell which is represented by the above Structural Formula 2 may be in a range from 18 &#x212b; to 30 &#x212b;.

That is, compared to Preparation Example 1, it can be seen that the polymer films of Preparation Examples 2 and 3 have smaller crystal sizes due to &#x3c0;-&#x3c0; stacking.</p><p id="p-0436" num="0406">As a result of analysis of GIWAXS of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>, it can be seen that the polymers of Preparation Examples 1 to 3 have small crystal sizes. The smaller the crystal of polymer included in a photo-active layer, the wider the interface. Holes and electrons are produced at the interface of crystal grains, and as they move, current is generated. The larger the interface, the more current flows. That is, the polymers of Preparation Examples 1 to 3 may generate a large amount of current in the photo-active layer.</p><p id="p-0437" num="0407">As described above, referring to Examples 1 to 3 and Experimental Examples 1 to 9, the polymer represented by Structural Formula 1 or 2 above is used in a photo-active layer of an organic solar cell or in a hole transport layer of a perovskite solar cell, has high charge mobility, and has an energy level suitable for the use as an electron donor in the photo-active layer of the organic solar cell. That is, the solar cell using the novel polymer according to the embodiment of the present invention may have excellent light conversion efficiency.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00001" cdx-file="US20230006141A1-20230105-C00001.CDX" mol-file="US20230006141A1-20230105-C00001.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00002" cdx-file="US20230006141A1-20230105-C00002.CDX" mol-file="US20230006141A1-20230105-C00002.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00003" cdx-file="US20230006141A1-20230105-C00003.CDX" mol-file="US20230006141A1-20230105-C00003.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00004" cdx-file="US20230006141A1-20230105-C00004.CDX" mol-file="US20230006141A1-20230105-C00004.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00005" cdx-file="US20230006141A1-20230105-C00005.CDX" mol-file="US20230006141A1-20230105-C00005.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00006" cdx-file="US20230006141A1-20230105-C00006.CDX" mol-file="US20230006141A1-20230105-C00006.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00007" cdx-file="US20230006141A1-20230105-C00007.CDX" mol-file="US20230006141A1-20230105-C00007.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00008" cdx-file="US20230006141A1-20230105-C00008.CDX" mol-file="US20230006141A1-20230105-C00008.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00009" cdx-file="US20230006141A1-20230105-C00009.CDX" mol-file="US20230006141A1-20230105-C00009.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00010" cdx-file="US20230006141A1-20230105-C00010.CDX" mol-file="US20230006141A1-20230105-C00010.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00011" cdx-file="US20230006141A1-20230105-C00011.CDX" mol-file="US20230006141A1-20230105-C00011.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00012" cdx-file="US20230006141A1-20230105-C00012.CDX" mol-file="US20230006141A1-20230105-C00012.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00013" cdx-file="US20230006141A1-20230105-C00013.CDX" mol-file="US20230006141A1-20230105-C00013.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00014" cdx-file="US20230006141A1-20230105-C00014.CDX" mol-file="US20230006141A1-20230105-C00014.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00015" cdx-file="US20230006141A1-20230105-C00015.CDX" mol-file="US20230006141A1-20230105-C00015.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00016" cdx-file="US20230006141A1-20230105-C00016.CDX" mol-file="US20230006141A1-20230105-C00016.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00017" cdx-file="US20230006141A1-20230105-C00017.CDX" mol-file="US20230006141A1-20230105-C00017.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00018" cdx-file="US20230006141A1-20230105-C00018.CDX" mol-file="US20230006141A1-20230105-C00018.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00019" cdx-file="US20230006141A1-20230105-C00019.CDX" mol-file="US20230006141A1-20230105-C00019.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00020" cdx-file="US20230006141A1-20230105-C00020.CDX" mol-file="US20230006141A1-20230105-C00020.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00021" cdx-file="US20230006141A1-20230105-C00021.CDX" mol-file="US20230006141A1-20230105-C00021.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00022" cdx-file="US20230006141A1-20230105-C00022.CDX" mol-file="US20230006141A1-20230105-C00022.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00023" cdx-file="US20230006141A1-20230105-C00023.CDX" mol-file="US20230006141A1-20230105-C00023.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00024" cdx-file="US20230006141A1-20230105-C00024.CDX" mol-file="US20230006141A1-20230105-C00024.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00025" cdx-file="US20230006141A1-20230105-C00025.CDX" mol-file="US20230006141A1-20230105-C00025.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00026" cdx-file="US20230006141A1-20230105-C00026.CDX" mol-file="US20230006141A1-20230105-C00026.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00027" cdx-file="US20230006141A1-20230105-C00027.CDX" mol-file="US20230006141A1-20230105-C00027.MOL"/><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
