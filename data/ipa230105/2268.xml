The hydrogen-containing layer includes a hydrogen concentration that decreases from a maximum hydrogen concentration of the glass-based article to the depth of layer. In some embodiments, the maximum hydrogen concentration may be located at the surface of the glass-based article. The glass-based articles exhibit a high Vickers indentation cracking threshold (e.g., greater than or equal to 1 kgf), without the use of traditional stengthening methods (for example, ion-exchange of a pair of alkali ions or thermal tempering). The high Vickers indentation cracking thresholds exhibited by the glass-based articles signify a high resistance to damage.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The glass-based articles may be formed by exposing glass-based substrates to environments containing water vapor, thereby allowing hydrogen species to penetrate the glass-based substrates and form the glass-based articles having a hydrogen-containing layer.

The SIMS technique is capable of measuring the hydrogen concentration at a given depth, but is not capable of distinguishing the hydrogen species present in the glass-based article. For this reason, all hydrogen species contribute to the SIMS measured hydrogen concentration. As utilized herein, the depth of layer (DOL) refers to the first depth below the surface of the glass-based article where the hydrogen concentration is equal to the hydrogen concentration at the center of the glass-based article. This definition accounts for the hydrogen concentration of the glass-based substrate prior to treatment, such that the depth of layer refers to the depth of the hydrogen added by the treatment process. As a practical matter, the hydrogen concentration at the center of the glass-based article may be approximated by the hydrogen concentration at the depth from the surface of the glass-based article where the hydrogen concentration becomes substantially constant, as the hydrogen concentration is not expected to change between such a depth and the center of the glass-based article. This approximation allows for the determination of the DOL without measuring the hydrogen concentration throughout the entire depth of the glass-based article.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In some embodiments, the entirety of the thickness of the glass-based article may be part of a hydrogen-containing layer. Such a glass-based article may be produced when the treatment of a glass-based substrate extends for a sufficient time in sufficient conditions for hydrogen species to diffuse to the center of the glass-based article from each exposed surface. In some embodiments, where the surfaces of the glass-based article are exposed to the same treatment conditions a minimum hydrogen concentrationj may be located at half the thickness of the glass-based article, such that the hydrogen-containing layers meet at the center of the glass-based article. In such embodiments, the DOL may be located at half the thickness of the glass-based articles. In some embodiments, the glass-based articles may not include a region that is free of added hydrogen species. In some embodiments, the glass-based articles may be treated in a humid environment such that the concentration of the added hydrogen species equilibriates throughout the glass-based articles, and the hydrogen concentration does not vary with depth below the surface of the glass-based article. The glass-based articles according to such embodiments would not exhibit a DOL as defined herein, as the hydrogen concentration at the center of the glass-based article would be equivalent to the hydrogen concentration at all other depths.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The glass-based articles are highly resistant to Vickers indentation cracking. The high Vickers indentation cracking resistance imparts a high damage resistance to the glass-based articles. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, the water content of the glass-based articles may reduce the local viscosity of the hydrogen-containing layer such that local flow occurs instead of cracking. The Vickers indentation cracking threshold of the glass-based articles is achieved without the use of conventional strengthening techniques, such as the exchange of large alkali ions for smaller alkali ions in the glass, thermal tempering, or lamination of glass layers with a coefficient of thermal expansion mismatch. The glass-based articles exhibit a Vickers indentation cracking threshold of greater than or equal to 1 kgf, such as greater than or equal to 2 kgf, greater than or equal to 3 kgf, greater than or equal to 4 kgf, greater than or equal to 5 kgf, greater than or equal to 6 kgf, greater than or equal to 7 kgf, greater than or equal to 8 kgf, greater than or equal to 9 kgf, greater than or equal to 10 kgf, greater than or equal to 11 kgf, greater than or equal to 12 kgf, greater than or equal to 13 kgf, greater than or equal to 14 kgf, greater than or equal to 15 kgf, greater than or equal to 16 kgf, greater than or equal to 17 kgf, greater than or equal to 18 kgf, greater than or equal to 19 kgf, greater than or equal to 20 kgf, greater than or equal to 21 kgf, greater than or equal to 22 kgf, greater than or equal to 23 kgf, greater than or equal to 24 kgf, greater than or equal to 25 kgf, greater than or equal to 26 kgf, greater than or equal to 27 kgf, greater than or equal to 28 kgf, greater than or equal to 29 kgf, greater than or equal to 30 kgf, or more. In some embodiments, the glass-based articles exhibit a Vickers indentation cracking threshold from greater than or equal to 1 kgf to less than or equal to 30 kgf, such as from greater than or equal to 2 kgf to less than or equal to 29 kgf, from greater than or equal to 3 kgf to less than or equal to 28 kgf, from greater than or equal to 4 kgf to less than or equal to 27 kgf, from greater than or equal to 5 kgf to less than or equal to 26 kgf, from greater than or equal to 6kgf to less than or equal to 25 kgf, from greater than or equal to 7 kgf to less than or equal to 24 kgf, from greater than or equal to 8 kgf to less than or equal to 23 kgf, from greater than or equal to 9 kgf to less than or equal to 22 kgf, from greater than or equal to 10 kgf to less than or equal to 21 kgf, from greater than or equal to 11 kgf to less than or equal to 20 kgf, from greater than or equal to 12 kgf to less than or equal to 19 kgf, from greater than or equal to 13 kgf to less than or equal to 18 kgf, from greater than or equal to 14 kgf to less than or equal to 17 kgf, from greater than or equal to 15 kgf to less than or equal to 16 kgf, or any sub-ranges formed by any of these endpoints.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Vickers crack initiation threshold (or Indentation Fracture Threshold) was measured by a Vickers indenter. Vickers crack initiation threshold is a measure of indentation damage resistance of the glass. The test involved the use of a square-based pyramidal diamond indenter with an angle of 136&#xb0; between faces, referred to as a Vickers indenter. The Vickers indenter was the same as the one used in standard micro hardness testing (as described in ASTM-E384-11). A minimum of five specimens were chosen to represent the glass type and/or sample of interest. For each specimen, multiple sets of five indentations were introduced to the specimen surface. Each set of five indentations was introduced at a given load, with each individual indentation separated by a minimum of 5 mm and no closer than 5 mm to a specimen edge. A rate of indenter loading/unloading of 50 kg/minute was used for test loads&#x2265;2 kg. For test loads&#x3c;2 kg, a rate of 5 kg/minute was used. A dwell (i.e., hold) time of 10 seconds at the target load was utilized. The machine maintained load control during the dwell period. After a period of at least 12 hours, the indentations were inspected under reflected light using a compound microscope at 500&#xd7; magnification. The presence or absence of median/radial cracks (cracks extending from the indentation along a plane perpendicular to the major plane of the article), or specimen fracture, was then noted for each indentation. Note that the formation of lateral cracks (cracks extending along a plane parallel to the major plane of the article) was not considered indicative of exhibiting threshold behavior, since the formation of median/radial cracks was of interest, or specimen fracture, for this test. The specimen threshold value is defined as the midpoint of the lowest consecutive indentation loads which bracket greater than 50% of the individual indentations meeting threshold. For example, if within an individual specimen, 2 of the 5 (40%) indentations induced at a 5 kg load have exceeded threshold, and 3 of the 5 (60%) indentations induced at a 6 kg load have exceeded threshold, then the specimen threshold value would be defined as greater than 5 kg. The range (lowest value to highest value) of all the specimen midpoints may also be reported for each sample. The pre-test, test and post-test environment was controlled to 23&#xb1;2&#xb0; C. and 50&#xb1;5% RH to minimize variation in the fatigue (stress corrosion) behavior of the specimens.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, the hydrogen-containing layer of the glass-based articles may be the result of an interdiffusion of hydrogen species for ions contained in the compositions of the glass-based substrate. Monovalent hydrogen-containing species, such as H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> and/or H<sup>+</sup>, may replace alkali ions contained in the glass-based substrate composition to form the glass-based article. The size of the alkali ions that the hydrogen-containing species replaces contributes to the diffusivity of the hydrogen-containing species in the glass-based substrate, as larger alkali ions produce larger interstitial spaces that facilitate the interdiffusion mechanism. For example, the hydronium ion (H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>) has an ionic radius that is close to the ionic radius of potassium, and much larger than the ionic radius of lithium. It was observed that the diffusivity of the hydrogen-containing species in the glass-based substrate is significantly higher, by two orderes of magnitude, when the glass-based substrate contains potassium than when the glass-based substrate contains lithium.

The ionic radii for the alkali ions and the hydronium ion are reported in Table I below.

The composition of the glass-based substrate may be specifically selected to promote the diffusion of hydrogen-containing species, such that a glass-based article including a hydrogen-containing layer may be formed efficiently. In some embodiments, the glass-based substrates may have a composition that includes SiO<sub>2</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>. In some embodiments, the glass-based substrates may additionally include an alkali metal oxide, such as at least one of Li<sub>2</sub>O, Na<sub>2</sub>O, K<sub>2</sub>O, Rb<sub>2</sub>O, and Cs<sub>2</sub>O. In some embodiments, the glass-based substrates may be substantially free, or free, of at least one of lithium and sodium. In some embodiments, after the diffusion of the hydrogen-containing species into the glass-based substrate, the glass-based article may have a bulk composition that is approximately the same as the composition of the glass-based substrate. In some embodiments, the hydrogen species may not diffuse to the center of the glass-based article. Stated differently, the center of the glass-based article is the area least affected by the water vapor treatment. For this reason, the center of the glass-based article may have a composition that is substantially the same, or the same, as the composition of the glass-based substrate prior to treatment in a water containing environment.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0078">The glass-based substrate may include any appropriate amount of SiO<sub>2</sub>. SiO<sub>2 </sub>is the largest constituent and, as such, SiO<sub>2 </sub>is the primary constituent of the glass network formed from the glass composition. If the concentration of SiO<sub>2 </sub>in the glass composition is too high, the formability of the glass composition may be diminished as higher concentrations of SiO<sub>2 </sub>increase the difficulty of melting the glass, which, in turn, adversely impacts the formability of the glass. In some embodiments, the glass-based substrate may include SiO<sub>2 </sub>in an amount from greater than or equal to 45 mol % to less than or equal to 75 mol %, such as from greater than or equal to 46 mol % to less than or equal to 74 mol %, from greater than or equal to 47 mol % to less than or equal to 73 mol %, from greater than or equal to 48 mol % to less than or equal to 72 mol %, from greater than or equal to 49 mol % to less than or equal to 71 mol %, from greater than or equal to 50 mol % to less than or equal to 70 mol %, from greater than or equal to 51 mol % to less than or equal to 69 mol %, from greater than or equal to 52 mol % to less than or equal to 68 mol %, from greater than or equal to 53 mol % to less than or equal to 67 mol %, from greater than or equal to 54 mol % to less than or equal to 66 mol %, from greater than or equal to 55 mol % to less than or equal to 65 mol %, from greater than or equal to 56 mol % to less than or equal to 64 mol %, from greater than or equal to 57 mol % to less than or equal to 63 mol %, from greater than or equal to 58 mol % to less than or equal to 62 mol %, from greater than or equal to 59 mol % to less than or equal to 61 mol %, 60 mol %, or any sub-ranges formed by any of these endpoints.

Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>may serve as a glass network former, similar to SiO<sub>2</sub>. Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>may increase the viscosity of the glass composition due to its tetrahedral coordination in a glass melt formed from a glass composition, decreasing the formability of the glass composition when the amount of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>is too high. However, when the concentration of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>is balanced against the concentration of SiO<sub>2 </sub>and the concentration of alkali oxides in the glass composition, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>can reduce the liquidus temperature of the glass melt, thereby enhancing the liquidus viscosity and improving the compatibility of the glass composition with certain forming processes, such as the fusion forming process. The inclusion of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>in the glass-based substrate prevents phase separation and reduces the number of non-bridging oxygens (NBOs) in the glass.

A force F is applied by a load cell (not shown) to the surface of the glass-based article by a loading ring <b>430</b> having a diameter D1.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0108">The ratio of diameters of the loading ring and support ring D1/D2 may be in a range from 0.2 to 0.5. In some embodiments, D1/D2 is 0.5. Loading and support rings <b>430</b>, <b>420</b> should be aligned concentrically to within 0.5% of support ring diameter D2. The load cell used for testing should be accurate to within &#xb1;1% at any load within a selected range. Testing is carried out at a temperature of 23&#xb1;2&#xb0; C. and a relative humidity of 40&#xb1;10%.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0109">For fixture design, the radius r of the protruding surface of the loading ring <b>430</b> is in a range of h/2&#x2264;r&#x2264;3h/2, where h is the thickness of glass-based article <b>410</b>. Loading and support rings <b>430</b>, <b>420</b> are made of hardened steel with hardness HRc&#x3e;40. AROR fixtures are commercially available.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0110">The intended failure mechanism for the AROR test is to observe fracture of the glass-based article <b>410</b> originating from the surface <b>430</b> a within the loading ring <b>430</b>. Failures that occur outside of this region&#x2014;i.e., between the loading ring <b>430</b> and support ring <b>420</b>&#x2014;are omitted from data analysis. Due to the thinness and high strength of the glass-based article <b>410</b>, however, large deflections that exceed &#xbd; of the specimen thickness h are sometimes observed. It is therefore not uncommon to observe a high percentage of failures originating from underneath the loading ring <b>430</b>. Stress cannot be accurately calculated without knowledge of stress development both inside and under the ring (collected via strain gauge analysis) and the origin of failure in each specimen. AROR testing therefore focuses on peak load at failure as the measured response.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0111">While typical embodiments have been set forth for the purpose of illustration, the foregoing description should not be deemed to be a limitation on the scope of the disclosure or appended claims.
