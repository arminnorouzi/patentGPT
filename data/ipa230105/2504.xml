INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention concerns the use of anti-HER-1 antibodies to target HER-1 signaling to suppress the growth of therapy-resistant HER-2 positive breast cancer cells.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The growth factor receptor-bound protein 7 (GRB7) gene encodes a multi-domain signal transduction molecule and is part of the core of the HER-2 amplicon. In breast cancer with HER-2 amplification and over-expression, GRB7 is commonly co-amplified and over-expressed. Structure and function relationship study of GRB7 suggests a functional role of GRB7 in breast cancer. The role of GRB7 in HER-2 positive human breast cancer cell lines that are resistant to HER-2 targeted therapy such as trastuzumab and lapatinib remains unexplored however. We speculate that GRB7 facilitates the growth of therapy resistant, HER-2 positive human breast cancer cells and targeting the signaling pathways activated by GRB7 may decrease cancer cell growth and therefore represent a novel therapeutic intervention.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Provided herein is a method of treatment for

GRB7 is commonly co-amplified and overexpressed with HER-2 in human breast cancers. Though previous studies have found a functional role for GRB7 in breast cancer, the role of GRB7 in human HER-2 positive targeted-therapy resistant disease remains unexplored. In his study HER-2 positive, trastuzaumab and lapatinib treatment resistant cell lines were utilized to explore the role of GRB7 signaling in cell proliferation in cell culture and tumor xenographs. We found that GRB7 signaling remains important to cell proliferation even as HER-2 positive cancer cells develop resistant to HER-2 targeted therapy, and that GRB7 signaling is mediated, at least in part by HER-1</p><p id="p-0130" num="0195">HCC-1954, 21MT1 and JimT1 are human HER-2 positive breast cancer cell lines that are resistant to trastuzumab and lapatinib treatment. Transient knock down of GRB7 protein expression was achieved with siRNA transfection and stable knock down with lentiviral vector mediated shRNA over-expression. Cell lines transfected with non-targeting siRNA or shRNA serve as negative controls. GRB7 knock down is verified by Western blotting. The growth of human breast cancer cell lines after GRB7 knock down in vitro is measured with the CellTiter Glo assay as well as the Incucyte live cell imaging. Activation status of specific signaling pathways was examined with phospho-specific antibody by immune-blotting and immune-precipitation. To assess the growth promoting function of GRB7 in human breast cancer cell lines in vivo, polyclonal HCC-1954, 21MT1 and JimT1 cells, with GRB7 knock down or their corresponding negative control, were orthotopically injected into the mammary fat pads of female immune-deficient NSG mice. The growth rates of these tumors, measured serially with caliper, and final tumor weights were compared between GRB7 knock down and the negative control. The proliferation rate and apoptosis of these tumors were studied with ki-67 staining and Tunel assay. The effects of GRB7 knock down on signaling were investigated with a proteome profiler receptor tyrosine kinase kit (R&#x26;D). The role of HER-1 signaling in the growth of parental HCC1954, 21MT1 and JimT1 cells are examined by transient knock down of HER-1 expression with siRNA transfection and treatment with a humanized anti-antibody, panitumumab.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0196">Results&#x2014;GRB7 knock down decreases the growth of HCC-1954, 21MT1 and JimT1 cells in vitro. GRB7 knock down also reduces the growth of tumor xenograft in animal models. When assayed by ki67 staining and Tunel assay, the mechanism of reduced tumor xenograft growth appears to be distinct among all three cellular contexts. Reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis were seen in 21MT1 cells, while only reduced proliferation was seen in HCC-1954 cells and only increased apoptosis was seen in JimT1 cells, respectively. Profiling found HER-1 tyrosine phosphorylation was down with GRB7 knock down in JimT1 cells. Immuno-blotting and immuno-precipitation experiments found HER-1 phosphorylation was reduced with GRB7 knock down in all three cell lines, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>(<i>a</i>), <b>4</b>(<i>b</i>), and <b>4</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref>.

GRB7 knock down has pleiotropic effects on signaling in various cellular contexts. The growth promoting effect of GRB7 is mediated in part by HER-1 activation; blocking HER-1 function therefore represents a novel therapeutic strategy in the treatment of therapy resistant HER-2 positive breast cancer.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00001" cdx-file="US20230002505A1-20230105-C00001.CDX" mol-file="US20230002505A1-20230105-C00001.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00002" cdx-file="US20230002505A1-20230105-C00002.CDX" mol-file="US20230002505A1-20230105-C00002.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00003" cdx-file="US20230002505A1-20230105-C00003.CDX" mol-file="US20230002505A1-20230105-C00003.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00004" cdx-file="US20230002505A1-20230105-C00004.CDX" mol-file="US20230002505A1-20230105-C00004.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00005" cdx-file="US20230002505A1-20230105-C00005.CDX" mol-file="US20230002505A1-20230105-C00005.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00006" cdx-file="US20230002505A1-20230105-C00006.CDX" mol-file="US20230002505A1-20230105-C00006.MOL"/><us-claim-statement>What is claimed:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
