More particularly, the invention relates to a simplified double-motion circuit breaker having a non-linear motion linkage mechanism. The invention also relates to a method of disconnecting a circuit breaker.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">PRIOR ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Non-linear double-motion high-voltage (HV) circuit breakers are well-known. U.S. Pat. No. 9,543,081 B2 discloses such a circuit breaker. It comprises two movable contacts that move in opposite directions to break the circuit. The primary movable contact comprises a tulip, a nozzle and contact cylinder attached together, while the secondary movable contact comprises a pin and a counter-contact cylinder attached together. A non-linear motion linkage mechanism transforms the movement of the primary movable contact in one direction into non-linear movement of the secondary movable contact in the opposite direction. In this way, the circuit breaker is able to break a circuit.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, moving the various components of the circuit breaker consumes a lot of energy, as they are heavy, yet need sufficient acceleration and speed for the disconnection. On top of that, this circuit breaker has numerous moving parts, which makes it more susceptible in general to mechanical failure. Finally, it is also expensive, as certain components such as the contact cylinder and counter-contact cylinder, have to be coated in silver, so as to possess the required hardness and conductivity in order to assure proper functioning.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As such, there is clearly a need for a circuit breaker which is able to operate quicker, more reliable and is also cheaper.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention relates to a non-linear double-motion circuit breaker comprising a primary movable contact and a secondary movable contact slidingly mounted within a primary holder and a secondary holder respectively, wherein the primary movable contact comprises a tulip and a contact cylinder attached thereto, and the secondary movable contact comprises a pin having a pin tip, the circuit breaker further comprising a linkage mechanism arranged to allow non-linear movement of the secondary movable contact in an opposite direction to the movement of the primary movable contact, wherein the secondary holder has a fixed dielectric shield at an end opposing the primary holder, and wherein the secondary movable contact does not comprise a counter-contact for engaging the contact cylinder.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention also relates to a method of disconnecting a non-linear double-motion circuit breaker comprising mounting a primary movable contact and a secondary movable contact slidingly within a primary holder and a secondary holder respectively, providing the primary movable contact with a tulip and an attached contact cylinder, and providing the secondary movable contact with a pin having a pin tip, providing a linkage mechanism allowing non-linear movement of the secondary movable contact in an opposite direction to the movement of the primary movable contact, and retracting the pin from the primary movable contact, without moving a counter-contact for engaging the contact cylinder, until the pin tip is within a fixed dielectric shield provided at an end of the secondary holder opposing the primary holder.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Preferable features of the invention are defined in the appendant claims.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The invention will be better understood when reading the following detailed description and non-limiting examples, as well as studying the figures, wherein:</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a cross-section view of a circuit breaker according to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the circuit breaker being in the closed position,</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a cross-section view of the same circuit breaker in the open position,</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a close-up cross-section view of the same circuit breaker, showing in particular its linkage mechanism at an intermediate position of the circuit breaker, and</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a graph comparing the stroke of the secondary movable contact stroke (y-axis) against the stroke of the primary movable contact (x-axis).</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In all of these figures, identical references can designate identical or similar elements.

The circuit breaker <b>10</b> comprises a primary (contact) holder <b>20</b> and a secondary (contact) holder <b>50</b>, within which the primary movable contact <b>25</b> and the secondary movable contact respectively <b>55</b> are slidingly mounted. The linkage mechanism <b>80</b> transforms the movement of the primary movable contact <b>25</b> in one direction along a principal axis into non-linear movement of the secondary movable contact <b>55</b> in the opposite direction along the principal axis. In this preferred embodiment, the circuit breaker <b>10</b> is of the self-blast type and is also part of a switchgear <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The primary movable contact <b>25</b> comprises a tulip <b>26</b>, a nozzle <b>27</b> and a contact cylinder <b>28</b> attached together and arranged to move as a single unit. It is shown extending out of the primary holder <b>20</b> as the circuit breaker <b>10</b> is in the closed position. It is however able to move back into the primary holder <b>20</b>, as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, which shows the open position of the circuit breaker <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Meanwhile, the secondary movable contact <b>55</b> comprises a pin <b>56</b>. It is shown extending out of the secondary holder <b>50</b> as the circuit breaker <b>10</b> is in the closed position, engaged with the primary movable contact <b>25</b>. More precisely, the pin <b>56</b> extends through the nozzle <b>27</b> of the primary movable contact <b>25</b>, and is engaged with the tulip <b>26</b> thereof. It is able to move back into the secondary holder <b>20</b>, as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> which shows the open position of the circuit breaker <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">However, unlike the prior art, we observe that the secondary movable contact <b>55</b> does not comprise a counter-contact cylinder attached to the pin <b>56</b>. This is an important aspect of the invention. As there is no counter-contact (cylinder or otherwise) attached to the pin, the linkage mechanism <b>80</b> does not have to move the combined mass of the pin <b>56</b> and counter-contact. Rather, it only has to move the much lighter pin <b>56</b>. This crucially reduces the weight of the secondary movable contact <b>55</b>, and as a consequence, the energy required to operate the circuit breaker <b>10</b> is also reduced. The absence of a counter-contact that needs to be moved on the circuit breaker <b>10</b> implies that disconnection can be achieved quickly.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The secondary holder <b>50</b> comprises a bridge <b>60</b> for slidingly supporting the pin <b>56</b>. The bridge <b>60</b> has a sleeve <b>61</b> in which the pin <b>56</b> is located, to slide along the principal axis. In this embodiment, the secondary movable contact <b>55</b> has a maximum stroke which is around a third of that of the primary movable contact <b>25</b>. The bridge <b>60</b> is ideally furnished with spokes <b>62</b> which support the sleeve <b>61</b> such that it is held centrally within the secondary holder <b>50</b>. The sleeve <b>61</b> of the bridge <b>60</b> has contact points <b>63</b> on its interior which allow current to flow between the secondary holder <b>50</b> and the pin <b>56</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Instead of contact points, flexible connections may be provided extending from the secondary holder <b>50</b> to the pin <b>56</b> to allow current to flow.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The circuit breaker <b>10</b> also comprises dielectric shields <b>36</b>, <b>66</b> on the primary holder <b>20</b> and the secondary holder <b>50</b>. They are fixed at the opposing ends of the primary holder <b>20</b> and secondary holder <b>50</b>, surrounding effectively the primary movable contact <b>25</b> and secondary movable contact <b>55</b> and thus the principal axis too. These dielectric shields <b>36</b>, <b>66</b> are designed for improving the dielectric resistance and reduce the possibility of flash-over during operation of the circuit breaker <b>10</b>. Whereas the counter-contact cylinder of the prior art also served as a dielectric shield for the pin, this function is now provided for pin <b>56</b> by the dielectric shield <b>66</b> on the secondary holder <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">With there being no counter-contact on the secondary movable contact <b>55</b>, the contact cylinder <b>28</b> of the circuit breaker <b>10</b> of the invention is arranged to directly engage the secondary holder <b>20</b>. When in the closed position, the contact cylinder <b>28</b> of the primary movable contact <b>25</b> engages the fixed dielectric shield <b>66</b> of the secondary holder <b>50</b>. The inner circumference of the fixed dielectric shields <b>36</b>, <b>66</b> are provided with contact points <b>37</b>, <b>67</b>, to improve the electrical continuity with the contact cylinder <b>28</b>. When the contact cylinder <b>28</b> is in the open position, it is located essentially within the fixed dielectric shield <b>36</b>, which help prevent flash-over. Likewise, for the pin <b>56</b>, when the circuit breaker <b>10</b> is in the open position, the pin tip <b>56</b>A will be within the fixed dielectric shield <b>66</b> of the secondary holder <b>50</b>, which helps prevent flash-over.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Another novel aspect of this invention is the kinematics of the primary movable contact <b>25</b> and the secondary movable contact <b>55</b>, which brings us to an interesting feature of the invention, namely the linkage mechanism <b>80</b>. The linkage mechanism <b>80</b> of the circuit breaker <b>10</b> comprises a driving lever <b>81</b> and a driven lever <b>91</b>. Both levers <b>81</b>, <b>91</b> are mounted on pivots <b>82</b>, <b>92</b> attached to the secondary holder <b>50</b>. The axes of these pivots <b>82</b>, <b>92</b> are parallel, and perpendicular to the principal axis, i.e. the direction of movement of the pin <b>56</b> and tulip <b>26</b>. The driving lever <b>81</b> is connected by a driving rod <b>88</b> to the tulip <b>26</b>/primary movable contact <b>25</b>. This driving rod <b>88</b> extends between the spokes <b>62</b> of the bridge holding the pin <b>56</b>. Meanwhile, the driven lever <b>91</b> is connected by a driven rod <b>98</b> to the pin <b>56</b>/secondary movable contact <b>55</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The driving and driven levers <b>81</b>, <b>91</b> are connected together by a pin and slot connection <b>83</b>. The driving lever <b>81</b> has two legs, one being attached to the driving rod <b>88</b>, while the other comprises a follower pin <b>84</b>. Meanwhile, the driven lever <b>91</b> also has two legs, one being attached to the driven rod <b>98</b>, while the other comprises a slot <b>94</b>. This pin and slot connection <b>83</b> allows the movement of the driving lever <b>81</b> to control the movement of the driven lever <b>91</b>, and is essentially located between pivot <b>82</b> of the driving lever <b>81</b> and the pivot <b>92</b> of the driven lever <b>91</b>, able to move from one side of a notional line joining the pivots <b>82</b>, <b>92</b> of the levers <b>81</b>, <b>91</b> to the opposite side. The rotation of the driving and driven levers <b>81</b>, <b>91</b> are in general opposite to each other, although this does not apply for the full extent of their motion.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The slot <b>94</b> has a short section <b>95</b> located closer to the pivot <b>92</b> of the driven lever <b>91</b> and an adjoining long section <b>96</b> located further away. The short section <b>95</b> is straight, while the long section <b>96</b> is curved, having the same radius as the follower pin <b>84</b> from its pivot <b>82</b>. The curvature of the long section <b>96</b> of the slot <b>94</b> is generally inverted to the curvilinear trajectory of the follower pin <b>84</b> when on one side of the notional line between the pivots <b>82</b>, <b>92</b>, whereas it corresponds to the curvilinear trajectory of the follower pin <b>84</b> when on the other side.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The linkage mechanism <b>80</b> is arranged such that during the initial stage of disconnection, rotation of the driving lever <b>81</b> acts substantially on the driven lever <b>91</b>, rotating it rather quickly, retracting the pin tip <b>56</b>A to within the fixed dielectric shield <b>66</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The pin <b>56</b> is actually withdrawn more than the tulip <b>26</b> during this stage, proportionally to their maximum stroke, reaching, or very nearly reaching, the end of its stroke, while the tulip <b>26</b> is only about halfway into its stroke.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">During the later stage of disconnection however, the driving lever <b>81</b> does not act, or acts very little, to rotate the driven lever <b>91</b>. Consequently, the pin <b>56</b> moves little or not at all during this stage, and is always maintained within the fixed dielectric shield <b>66</b>, resulting in the tulip <b>26</b> being withdrawn more than the pin <b>56</b>, proportionally to its maximum stroke. We will note that the total mass of movable contacts is reduced to only that of primary movable contact <b>25</b>, meaning that the energy for the disconnection of the circuit breaker goes entirely towards moving the primary movable contact <b>25</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The disconnection of the circuit breaker <b>10</b> can thus be viewed as having a first stage between the closed and an intermediate position where the pin tip <b>56</b>A is within the fixed dielectric shield <b>66</b> and has stopped retracting, and a second stage between the intermediate and open position. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows the linkage mechanism <b>80</b> at the intermediate position of the circuit breaker <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">This operation of the linkage mechanism <b>80</b> is achieved, in part, by the pin and slot connection <b>83</b> between the levers <b>81</b>, <b>91</b>, which is configured such that, between the closed and the intermediate position, rotation of the driving lever <b>81</b> causes the follower pin <b>84</b> to travel in the slot <b>94</b> such that it rotates substantially the driven lever <b>91</b>, whereas between the intermediate and the open position, the follower pin <b>84</b> travels in the slot <b>94</b> such that it does not rotate, or rotates very little, the driven lever <b>91</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Furthermore, the pin and slot mechanism <b>83</b> is configured such that, on one side of the notional line, the follower pin <b>84</b> moves in one direction in the slot <b>94</b>, and on the other side of the notional line, the follower pin <b>84</b> moves in the opposite direction in the slot <b>94</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">For the avoidance of doubt, it is being stated here that the tulip <b>26</b> typically moves faster than the pin <b>56</b> throughout the operation of the circuit breaker <b>10</b>. However, proportionally to their maximum strokes, the pin <b>56</b> moves more than the tulip <b>26</b>. In other words, the pin <b>56</b> achieves its maximum stroke quicker than the tulip <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">To facilitate understanding of the invention, the disconnection of the circuit breaker <b>10</b> from the closed position to the open position, will be briefly discussed, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref> showing the circuit breaker <b>10</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> which shows a graph of the stroke of the pin <b>56</b> (y-axis) against the stroke of the tulip <b>26</b> (x-axis).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The circuit breaker <b>10</b> is initially in the closed position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and has current flowing across it. During disconnection, a force is applied to the primary movable contact <b>25</b> to move it away from the secondary movable contact <b>55</b>. The movement of the primary movable contact <b>25</b> in one direction is transformed to non-linear movement of the secondary movable contact <b>55</b> in the opposite direction. More specifically, the primary movable contact <b>25</b> will pull on the driving rod <b>88</b>, which in turn will rotate the driving lever <b>81</b> about its pivot <b>82</b> (anticlockwise in the present view). The driving lever <b>81</b> then acts on the driven lever <b>91</b> through the pin and slot mechanism <b>83</b>, rotating it about its pivot <b>92</b> (clockwise in the present view).</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The follower pin <b>84</b> initially travels along the long section <b>96</b> of the slot (which in its current position is inverted to the curvilinear trajectory of the follower pin <b>84</b>) and into the short section <b>95</b> of the slot <b>94</b>. Due to the position and the shape of the slot <b>94</b> relative to the follower pin <b>84</b>, the pin <b>56</b> is retracted right from the start of disconnection, and also retracted more than the tulip <b>26</b> proportionally to their maximum strokes.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The retraction of the pin <b>56</b> and tulip <b>26</b> continues at essentially the same rate as above with the rotation of the driving lever <b>81</b>. The follower pin <b>84</b> keeps travelling in the slot <b>94</b> until it reaches the notional line between the pivots <b>82</b>, <b>92</b>(and its closest point to the pivot <b>92</b> of the driven lever <b>91</b>), where it then starts to moves in the opposite direction along the slot <b>94</b>. The pin <b>56</b> is now at three-quarter of its maximum stroke. Retraction of the pin <b>56</b> and tulip <b>26</b> continues, until the follower pin <b>84</b> leaves the short straight section <b>95</b> of slot <b>94</b> and begins travelling in the long curved section <b>96</b>. This can be said to be the intermediate position of the circuit breaker <b>10</b>. For completeness, it will be mentioned that it takes about few millisecond for the pin <b>56</b> to reach this position.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows the position of the pin <b>56</b>, and also the linkage mechanism <b>80</b>, at the intermediate position of the circuit breaker <b>10</b>. At this point onwards, the rotational movement of the driving lever <b>81</b> however has very little or no effect on the movement of the pin. This is because the driven lever <b>91</b> in its current position is located such that the long section <b>96</b> of the slot <b>94</b> corresponds with the curvilinear trajectory of the follower pin <b>84</b>. The result is that the tulip <b>26</b> continues retracting, whereas the pin <b>56</b> retracts very little or not at all, with the pin tip <b>56</b>A remaining within the fixed dielectric shield <b>66</b>, i.e. generally between the front and rear of the (annular) fixed dielectric shield <b>66</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The relatively short stroke of the pin <b>56</b> compared to those of known circuit breakers helps ensures that it retracts quickly to within the fixed dielectric shield <b>66</b>, so that the pin <b>56</b> and fixed dielectric shield <b>66</b> together reduce any dielectric risk and prevent dielectric flash-over. Once the pin <b>56</b> is essentially at its maximum stroke, only the tulip <b>26</b> continues moving towards it maximum stroke. This then completes the disconnection of the circuit breaker <b>10</b>, the open position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The circuit breaker <b>10</b> of the present invention can as such be viewed as having simplified double-motion, as the secondary movable contact <b>55</b> has a pin <b>56</b> but no counter-contact. For reconnection of the circuit breaker <b>10</b>, the skilled person will appreciate that essentially the reverse of the above takes place.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The circuit breaker <b>10</b> of the invention represents a significant improvement over the prior art as it allows disconnection to occur rapidly while using less energy. By omitting a component, namely the counter-contact, the lighter pin <b>56</b> can be moved more easily and quickly, while consuming less energy. The reduced part-count of the secondary movable contact <b>55</b> also implies that the circuit breaker <b>10</b> is cheaper to produce, and also cheaper to operate as it consumes less energy. Furthermore, the pin and slot connection <b>83</b> of the linkage mechanism <b>80</b> is configured to allow for the pin <b>56</b> to begin retraction from the start of disconnection, and to quickly retract the pin tip <b>56</b>A to within the safety of the fixed dielectric shield <b>66</b>, significantly reducing the dielectric risk and flash-over. The shortened stroke of the pin <b>56</b> is also advantageous as it means at the pin <b>56</b> needs to be moved less to be in the required position.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In contrast to the prior art, this allows disconnection to happen much quicker, and with less energy and movement involved. Whereas the skilled person would put more energy to achieve faster disconnection, the invention presents a novel and inventive approach to achieve this.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Although the secondary movable contact is described as comprising a tulip (for receiving the pin), this may possible not always be the case, and should therefore be understood in the broader sense of a pin-receiver. While the primary embodiment discusses the invention in the context of a double-motion HV circuit breakers using self-blast technology in a switchgear, the invention is not to be thus limited, and it will be apparent that it will be applicable to various types of switchgears, and whether or not they employ self-blast technology.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">With the tulip being part of the primary movable member, and the pin being part of the secondary movable member, for reasons of brevity, the primary movable contact and secondary movable contact may have at times been simply referred to, respectively, as the tulip and pin.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-01-15" num="01-15"><claim-text><b>1</b>-<b>15</b>.
