Chemoautotrophic bacteria are capable of capturing and metabolizing carbon from inorganic sources, such as CO<sub>2</sub>, CO, CH<sub>4</sub>, as well as, in some cases, hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) or methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) as a primary or additional source of energy. By converting inorganic carbon to organic carbon via metabolic carbon fixation, these microbes can serve as primary producers in natural environments. Many of these chemoautotrophic species can be cultured on gas feedstocks in bioreactors for commercial production of biomass, which can be processed into nutritional products such as animal feed, companion animal feed, or even food for humans, and chemicals.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A microbial consortium is defined as two or more microbial species living symbiotically. Microbial co-cultures. For the consortia described as part of the present invention, chemoautotrophic microbes are employed in a system where the primary source of carbon and energy are both supplied as gases, such that the primary producers support a defined consortium of bacterial species via mutualistic interactions. The consortium of various defined species in the present invention, when harvested, can be used as a nutritional product. In order to make more ideal nutritional products, it is desirable to grow multiple different species together, each of which provides different nutritional properties. The use of multiple microbes allows controlled modification and customization of the nutritional composition of the final product. It is also possible to include one or more genetically modified strains which produce a key component, such as astaxanthin, a carotenoid which is a key ingredient for aquaculture.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A formulation of bacteria that could increase the amounts of desirable fatty acids and amino acids in the final biomass product would therefore be highly desirable.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An advantage of the present invention is that the dried biomass can be blended into an aquafeed or other nutritional product to replace the fishmeal that is normally harvested and used for feeding farmed fish and seafood, such as salmon, trout, tilapia, and shrimp. This will make a major impact on reducing the stress on the world's fisheries (Pitcher &#x26; Cheung, 2013), which will not be able to keep up with the projected demand for fishmeal.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another advantage of the present invention is that the composition of the consortium can be adjusted to fine-tune the nutritional composition of the biomass product. This ability to make adjustments is advantageous because, for example, recent studies have shown that adapting the amino acid composition of feed given to laboratory mice based on the animal's own overall amino acid composition not only reduces the amount of feed needed, but also improves the health of the. Also, aquaculture and other animal feeds and feed additives are altered by selecting the amounts of various ingredients added to achieve desired amino acid profiles. By adjusting the consortia, a number of application specific nutritional products can be derived including for use by humans. Special consortia may even be created for aid in treating medical conditions, dietary deficiencies or to match growth stages of proposed consuming organism.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Nevertheless, bacteria comprising the genera <i>Bacillus, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium </i>and others, which are known to be of nutritional, and/or medicinal and/or probiotic benefit are not capable of growing on gas substrates, such as CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>, CO and CH<sub>4</sub>.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, certain strains of chemoautotrophic microbes from the genera <i>Cupriavidus, Rhodobacter, Methylobacterium, Methylococcus, Rhodospirillum </i>and <i>Rhodopseudomonas</i>, are known to grow on gaseous substrates, such as CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>, CO and CH<sub>4</sub>.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Photoautotrophic microbes are bacteria, cyanobacteria and algae that can fix carbon from CO<sub>2 </sub>by utilizing light energy. However, certain species of photoautotrophic bacteria also exhibit chemoautotrophic metabolism, in that they are able to utilize hydrogen as an energy source to drive the fixation of CO<sub>2 </sub>without light. Examples of these are the genera <i>Rhodobacter, Rhodospirillum </i>and <i>Rhodopseudomonas</i>. Many other such species are known in the literature. <i>C. necator </i>has been shown to grow faster and more efficiently on CO2/H2 than typical acetogens that are used in some anaerobic gas fermentation.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Bacteria grown under chemoautotrophic conditions express different amounts (and in some cases, different types) of proteins, enzymes, transporters, fats, oils, vitamins, co-factors and other biochemicals, than do those grown in traditional fermentation. Examples of this would be cytochromes, quinones (e.g., coenzyme Q), RuBisCO (Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase), as well as having overall different levels and ratios of amino acids. Because of this, bacteria grown chemoautotrophically have different nutritional profiles than the same bacteria grown heterotrophically. These growth differences can be advantages for providing additional vitamins, minerals, cofactors, etc. to the biomass product.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Bacteria grown chemoautrophically also have different secretory activity, which affects the content of the fermentation mix. Chemoautotrophic bacteria (and photoautotrophic bacteria grown chemoautotrophically) release chemicals into the growth medium, such as glycolates, polysaccharides, proteins, amino acids, fats, oils, hydrocarbons, nucleic acids, organic acids, polyhydroxyalkanoates, phasins, carotenoids, vitamins, gene transfer agents (GTA) and other biomolecules that can then be utilized by non-autotrophic bacteria and other heterotrophic microorganisms as growth substrates and growth regulators.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In an alternative embodiment, one or more of the strains in the consortium may naturally, or be genetically modified in order to, produce a valuable small molecule (e.g., a specific fatty acid) or a protein product (e.g., an enzyme, therapeutic protein, antibiotic, hormone, vitamin, precursor, antibody or vaccine). The present invention provides a means to produce such molecules using cheap gas feedstocks even if the host organism(s) cannot grow solely on gas.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In this application we describe an invention wherein a food or feed product with characteristics that provide nutritional, medical, and/or dietary benefits, and that comprises a consortium of chemoautotrophic microbes, photoautotrophic and non-chemoautotrophic microbes, is produced by cultivating these microbes on gaseous substrates. The consortium creates an ecosystem in which the chemoautotrophic microbes form the base of a food chain on which the non-autotrophic microbes are capable of growing. The goal of the gas-based fermentation process described herein is to generate a biomass product that has enhanced nutritional value compared to the biomass that the same chemoautotrophic microbes would produce if grown alone. A further economic benefit of this invention is to facilitate the growth of desired or beneficial microbes that otherwise could not utilize the inexpensive CO<sub>2 </sub>or other C1 feedstocks as a primary carbon source, and/or the hydrogen (or other inorganic or C1 compounds) for energy.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">A number of species of microbe are known to nutritionally beneficial, or to produce beneficial substances, or have probiotic properties which can be significant components of a product which can be produced by this method.

For production of feed, food, nutraceuticals, biologicals, and the like, an industrial source of waste CO<sub>2 </sub>that is free of toxic elemental contaminants (e.g., mercury) is preferred. Examples of such sources include CO<sub>2 </sub>from breweries and bioethanol plants. Hydrogen can be supplied as part of the gas composition of pyrolysis gas, syngas, as an industrial side product from activities such as propylene manufacture, as a component of a mixed gas stream from an oil refinery, or in gas created by steam methane reformation (SMR) process), from compressed gas, or from electrolysis of water. Oxygen can be obtained from atmospheric gas, as a product of electrolysis, or as a component of industrial by-product gas such as cement flue-gas. Embodiments of the invention include methods for collecting and compressing flue gas at an industrial site into transportable pressurized cylinders so that substantial quantities of flue gas can be carried back to the laboratory for analysis and fermentation of the microorganisms. In the laboratory, the CO<sub>2 </sub>and O<sub>2 </sub>(derived from either lab gas or flue gas) are further diluted approximately 5-fold with H<sub>2 </sub>to supply the bacteria with a feedstock mixture that is optimized for growth. For a commercial-scale operation, the fermentation plant can be located near the gas production site, or the gas can be transported by vehicle or pipeline to the biomass production site.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">For injection into the fermenter, the gas supply was filtered through 0.2 &#x3bc;m filters to remove particles and microorganisms. For small-scale experiments, compressed H<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2 </sub>and O<sub>2 </sub>were each regulated to 20 psi. The gases were delivered to a flow proportioner, which sets the relative fraction of the gases, and a variable area flow meter to control the mixture and flow rate into the fermenter. Gas flow was adjusted to between 0.2-1.2 VVM to supply adequate nutrients at each stage of the fermentation. The agitation rate was adjusted between 150-300 rpm to provide thorough mixing.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Nutrient monitoring. The composition of the input and output gas can be measured and monitored to determine the gas uptake rates, the mass balances and the mass transfer efficiency for dissolution of the gas into the solution and the biomass. Key nutrients (such as NH<sub>4</sub>, PO<sub>4 </sub>&#x26; SO<sub>4</sub>), can also be monitored and replenished to prevent nutrient limitations that might restrict bacterial growth.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Microbial inocula. The inocula for fermenter runs can be prepared in many ways; each microbial strain may be grown separately, or two or more may be grouped together in a single fermentation. Heterotrophic species are always grown up from pure cultures on heterotrophic medium that is suitable for propagating the particular species (or group of species) being grown. Chemoautotrophic species can be grown on gases, or, in some cases, on heterotrophic media. Photoautotrophic species may be grown using light or heterotrophic media. Some photoautotrophic species are also chemoautotrophic, and thus may be grown on gaseous substrates. Inoculating the bioreactor involves sterile addition of a culture containing one or more of the species into the bioreactor.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, all of the cultures for the consortium are added to the bioreactor, in a short period of time, at the beginning of the fermentation procedure or run.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, chemoautotrophic microbes are added to the bioreactor at the beginning of the fermentation, and the inoculum cultures containing other species are added at later points.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some embodiments, the timing of the addition, amount and density of culture additions, and method of preparing inocula can be altered to affect the qualities, composition, and/or value of the final product.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some embodiments, additional inoculations of one or more strains used in the consortia can be added at later times.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In embodiments of the invention, cultures were prepared by growing <i>C. necator </i>and the other chemoautotrophic species on H2/CO2/O2 to an OD<sub>620</sub><sup>&#x2dc;</sup>1 in small bottles of media equipped with gas fittings. Non-chemoautotrophic species were grown in liquid yeast-tryptone medium (YT medium), a well-known and commercially available medium. The bioreactor was inoculated to OD<sup>&#x2dc;</sup>0.1. A ca. 5% inoculum is ideal. The pH is controlled with 2N NH<sub>4</sub>OH. The fermentation is run for up to several days, resulting in OD<sub>620 </sub>of 1-100 or greater. The recovered biomass was analyzed for protein and lipid content and the composition of each product. Proprietary strains, of some embodiments of the invention, of <i>C. necator </i>and/or <i>R. capsulatus</i>, or other proprietary strains of microbe, were sometimes used in addition to type strains. Embodiments of the invention include several strains of chemoautotrophic species that are adapted to flue gas and therefore tolerant to various toxic gas components, which can be included in the mix if complex industrial flue gas is used as the feedstock. In some cases, additional inoculations with one or more consortia strains were carried out a later time points.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Microbe species commonly used in various embodiments for enablement include those shown in Table 1: The micrograph in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is from a fermentation of all of these except B-3226.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="140pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="98pt" align="left"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Strain </entry><entry>Species</entry><entry>Source</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>B-3226 </entry><entry><i>Rhodospirillum rubrum</i>, </entry><entry>(ARS NRRLType Strain)</entry></row><row><entry>B-1727 </entry><entry><i>Rhodobacter sphaeroides</i>, </entry><entry>(ARS NRRLType Strain)</entry></row><row><entry>B-4276 </entry><entry><i>Rhodopseudomonas palustris</i>, </entry><entry>(ARS NRRLType Strain)</entry></row><row><entry>B-14308 </entry><entry><i>Bacillus megaterium</i>, </entry><entry>(ARS NRRLType Strain)</entry></row><row><entry>B-356 </entry><entry><i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, </entry><entry>(ARS NRRLType Strain)</entry></row><row><entry>B-354 </entry><entry><i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, </entry><entry>(ARS NRRLType Strain)</entry></row><row><entry>B-14200 </entry><entry><i>Bacillus subtilis</i> subspecies <i>subtilis</i>, </entry><entry>(ARS NRRLType Strain)</entry></row><row><entry>B-41406 </entry><entry><i>Bifidobacterium animalis</i> subspecies <i>animalis</i>,</entry><entry>(ARS NRRLType Strain)</entry></row><row><entry>B-4495 </entry><entry><i>Lactobacillus acidophilus</i>, </entry><entry>(ARS NRRLType Strain)</entry></row><row><entry>B-1922 </entry><entry><i>Lactobacillus casei</i> subspecies <i>casei</i>,</entry><entry>(ARS NRRLType Strain)</entry></row><row><entry>B-4383 </entry><entry><i>Cupriavidus necator</i>,</entry><entry>(ARS NRRLType Strain)</entry></row><row><entry>B-14690 </entry><entry><i>Cupriavidus necator</i>,</entry><entry>(ARS NRRLType Strain)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry><i>Cupriavidus necator</i> strain H16 </entry><entry>(ATCC Type Strain)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry><i>Rhodobacter capsulatus</i> strain SB-1003</entry><entry>(ATCC Type Strain)</entry></row><row><entry>OB213 </entry><entry><i>Rhodobacter capsulatus</i>,</entry><entry>Oakbio, Inc.

A bioreactor for chemoautotrophic synthesis is used for enablement of this invention. Many types and designs of bioreactor are suitable. The critical parts of a bioreactor for cultivation of the product discussed in this application are that there be a vessel which is at least partially filled with liquid medium, in which the microbes are dispersed. The liquid comprises chemicals required for growth of the microbes, examples of which are described below. At least one port exists for introducing the gaseous substrates into the liquid in the bioreactor. The vessel may have a headspace into which gases collect after traversing the fluid in the vessel. An exhaust port allows gases to exit the vessel. Additional ports are present as needed for sensors, addition of liquids or chemicals and removal of product, liquids, or samples for testing, as would be expected to be found on common bioreactors, which are well known in the field of fermentation, cell culture and microbe cultivation. A minimal design bioreactor is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. In various embodiments, the invention has been enabled in custom-built 250 ml, 1 L, and 4 L glass flask based bioreactors and in a commercially manufactured New Brunswick Scientific Bio Flo 4500 with the 4-gas handling option. Additional bioreactor designs that can be used in conjunction with the present invention can be found in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/204,649 filed on Aug. 6, 2011 and entitled &#x201c;Chemoautotrophic Bioreactor Systems and Methods of Use&#x201d; which is incorporated herein by reference. Bioreactors for embodiment of this invention can comprise one or more vessels and/or towers or piping arrangements, and can comprise, for example, a Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR), an Immobilized Cell Reactor (ICR), a Trickle Bed Reactor (TBR), a Bubble Column, a Gas Lift Fermenter, a Static Mixer, a Fluidized Bed, an Up-flow or Down-flow, a continuous, batch or loop reactor, or any other vessel or device suitable for maintaining suitable gas-liquid contact. In some embodiments, the bioreactor may comprise a first growth vessel and a second chemoautotrophic synthesis vessel, while in other embodiments a single vessel is used throughout both of the growth and synthesis stages.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0036">In some embodiments, a gas recirculation system can be used to improve the conversion efficiency, particularly during a continuous process, in order to reduce the total gas requirement. Continuous harvesting of the cell mass is advantageous for a commercial production process, and can be implemented through the continuous removal of cell broth and the continuous replenishing of medium, in order to maintain the culture volume and cell density. Fermentations were run at a constant or varied temperatures between 15 and 70 C, but the preferred temperature is 30 C.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0037">Monitoring cell growth and species diversity. To monitor the progress of cell growth and verify the species diversity of the culture, samples can be periodically removed for analysis, or the bioreactor system can comprise analytic equipment. In enabling the technology in some embodiments, characterization included microscopy of cell morphology, an example of which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> (from the completion of a run), which shows that the species diversity was maintained. Wet mounts of the culture were observed using brightfield microscopy with an Olympus BX research microscope equipped with an Amscope CCD camera. Micrographs were generated using the Amscope software for imaging and data storage. Species diversity can also be monitored and quantitated using methods well known in the art, such as analysis of 16S rRNA genes, 23S rRNA genes, or other genetic markers and phenotypic indicators (Jove) et al., 2016). Growth behavior was characterized by optical density (OD) measurements at 620 nm using an ICN TiterTek 96-well plate reader. Aliquots of each fermenter sample (200 ul) were measured in duplicate to plot the growth curves.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0038">Carbon capture. Carbon capture from a new source of flue gas can be verified by performing headspace gas analysis, as well as growth experiments that use the flue gas as the sole carbon source for bacterial biomass production. The dry weight of each culture can also be determined by centrifuging the culture, washing the pellet, drying the cells in a lyophilizer, and weighing the lyophilized cells.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0039">Gas mixing. For hydrogen fermentations typically, the CO2 feedstock or raw flue gas was diluted with pure hydrogen with ratios of about 8:1 to 1:1 (H2:CO2, v/v), resulting in a final CO2 concentration of about 50%-1% or less. The O2 concentration is ideally 3-12%. For methane fermentations, typically the methane concentration is between 80% to 5%, CO2 is between 40%-1%, and oxygen is 50% to 5%. In either system, CO can be up to 10%, and a variety of other gases may be present, including sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, hydrogen sulfide, molecular nitrogen or other gases found in the gas source.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0040">Culture medium. Many different mineral media recipes can be used, and varying the media is one of the ways the characteristics of the final product can be influenced. In various embodiments, typically a mineral salts medium (modified from Repaske &#x26; Mayer, 1976) was used that contained no organic carbon or complex nutrients: Na2HPO4.2H2O 4.5 g/L, KH2PO4 1.5 g/L, NH4Cl 1.8 g/L, MgSO4.7H2O 0.11 g/L, NaHCO3 0.2 g/L, FeSO4.7H2O 12 mg/L, CaCl2.2H2O 10 mg/L, ZnSO4.7H2O 100 &#x3bc;g/L, MnCl2.4 H2O 30 &#x3bc;g/L, H3BO3 300 &#x3bc;g/L, CoCl2.6H2O 200 &#x3bc;g/L, CuCl2.2H2O 10 &#x3bc;g/L, NiCl2.6H2O 20 &#x3bc;g/L, Na2MoO4.2H2O 30 &#x3bc;g/L.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0041">Concentration and harvesting. Biomass product can be harvested through many methods, such as filtration, gravity separation, or other method, of which many are industrially practiced. Drying can be by spray drying, freeze drying, thermal drying, desiccation or many other methods, many of which are currently practiced industrially.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0042">Brief heat treatment is useful if the cells must be made non-viable prior to further processing. Due to the fact that lyophilization is more energy-intensive, it is more suitable for processing very high-value products that require gentle processing. The dried material can be easily blended with other ingredients to form a nutritious fish feed that can replace aquafeed products that typically rely on fishmeal for protein, fatty acids, and other nutrients. The amino acid composition of the dried material from a 30 L batch of cultivated consortium (Table 2) compares favorably to that of fishmeal (IAFMM Report, 1970)</p><p id="p-0045" num="0043">In the below referenced demonstration, cell suspensions were removed from the fermenter via the sterile exit port. The supernatant can then be removed by centrifugation in a standard or process centrifuge at ca. 4,000&#xd7;g or greater to form a cell pellet. The cells are then washed in a low-salt buffer solution, and then re-pelleted. The final cell paste was then freeze dried to a powder using a commercial MTS lyophilizer.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00002" num="00002"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 2</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>An example of the amino acid composition of a consortium.
