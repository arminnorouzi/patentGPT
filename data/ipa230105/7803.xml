The cabinet <b>100</b> includes a housing <b>10</b>, at least one tray <b>20</b>, an elastic piece <b>30</b>, and a limiting piece <b>40</b>. The housing <b>10</b> is substantially a cuboid box defining a chamber with an opening on a side. The cabinet <b>100</b> includes two trays <b>20</b> arranged horizontally in parallel. Each of the two trays <b>20</b> may independently extend out of the chamber or retract into the chamber. Each of the two trays <b>20</b> is configured to hold a plurality of electronic components <b>200</b>. The elastic piece <b>30</b> is fixedly connected to a side of the housing <b>10</b> close to the opening and arranged between the two trays <b>20</b>. The limiting piece <b>40</b> is connected to the elastic piece <b>30</b> and arranged between the two trays <b>20</b>. Each of the two trays <b>20</b> defines a hole <b>21</b> corresponding to the limiting piece <b>40</b>, each of the two trays <b>20</b> includes a protrusion <b>22</b> protruding into the interior of the chamber.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In at least one embodiment, the self-locking method of the cabinet <b>100</b> is that after one of the trays <b>20</b> slides out of the opening to a maximum extent, the protrusion <b>22</b> may slide to the limiting piece <b>40</b> and pushes the limiting piece <b>40</b> into the hole <b>21</b> of the other tray <b>20</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>), so as to limit a movement of the other tray <b>20</b>. Thereby, the other tray <b>20</b> is locked in place. After the tray <b>20</b> is retracted back in the housing <b>10</b>, the protrusion <b>22</b> separates from the limiting piece <b>40</b>, the elastic piece <b>30</b> elastically recovers the limiting piece <b>40</b>, so the limiting piece <b>40</b> is separated from the hole <b>21</b>, unlocking the other tray <b>20</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). Thus, when any one of the trays <b>20</b> is pulled out of the housing <b>10</b>, the other tray <b>20</b> is locked, so as to prevent top-heavy accidents. In at least one embodiment, the electronic components <b>200</b> may be hard disks.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in at least one embodiment, the housing <b>10</b> includes at least one separator <b>11</b>, two separators <b>11</b> being preferred. The two separators <b>11</b> are vertically arranged between the two trays <b>20</b> and parallel to the sliding direction of the trays <b>20</b>. The two separators <b>11</b> form a gap <b>11</b><i>a </i>therebetween. The gap <b>11</b><i>a </i>is configured to receive the elastic piece <b>30</b> and the limiting piece <b>40</b>. Each of the two separators <b>11</b> defines a through hole (not shown). Opposite ends of the limiting piece <b>40</b> are inserted into the vias, respectively, so the opposite ends of the limiting piece <b>40</b> are further inserted into the holes <b>21</b>. In at least one embodiment, the limiting piece <b>40</b> may be a bolt.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, in at least one embodiment, the protrusion <b>22</b> includes a bevel <b>22</b><i>a </i>and a plane <b>22</b><i>b </i>connected to the bevel <b>22</b><i>a</i>. The protrusion <b>22</b> may be vertically arranged to a side of the tray <b>20</b>. The bevel <b>22</b><i>a </i>faces the limiting piece <b>40</b>. The plane <b>22</b><i>b </i>extends along the sliding direction of the trays <b>20</b>. When the trays <b>20</b> slide out of the opening, the bevel <b>22</b><i>a </i>firstly contacts an end of the limiting piece <b>40</b>, and pushes the limiting piece <b>40</b> so that the other end of the limiting piece <b>40</b> is inserted into the hole <b>21</b>, until the tray <b>20</b> slides out of the opening to the maximum extent. At this time, the limiting piece <b>40</b> resists the plane <b>22</b><i>b</i>, the plane <b>22</b><i>b </i>is configured to retain the position of the limiting piece <b>40</b> and retain the other end of the limiting piece <b>40</b> in the hole <b>21</b>. When the tray <b>20</b> is retracted in the opening, the plane <b>22</b><i>b </i>and the bevel <b>22</b><i>a </i>gradually move away from the limiting piece <b>40</b>, and the elastic piece <b>30</b> pushes the limiting piece <b>40</b> to recover. In at least one embodiment, the bevel <b>22</b><i>a </i>is configured to provide a portion for the protrusion <b>22</b> pushing the limiting piece <b>40</b> and preventing any jamming.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Furthermore, in at least one embodiment, a section of the limiting piece <b>40</b> may be circular, each of the opposite ends can include a rounded corner or a chamfer decreasing a friction between the limiting piece <b>40</b> and the bevel <b>22</b><i>a</i>, the plane <b>22</b><i>b </i>and preventing jamming.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, in at least one embodiment, when the tray <b>20</b> is retracted in the opening, the two trays <b>20</b> and the limiting piece <b>40</b> are in mirror symmetry relative to a central section of the limiting piece <b>40</b>. A distance between an end of the limiting piece <b>40</b> and the tray <b>20</b> is L1, that is L1 is also the distance between the end of the limiting piece <b>40</b> and the hole <b>21</b>. A maximum height of the protrusion <b>22</b> is L2. When L1&#x3c;L2, the protrusion <b>22</b> will resist and push the limiting piece <b>40</b>, otherwise the protrusion <b>22</b> may be unable to reach the limiting piece <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Furthermore, along an axis direction of the limiting piece <b>40</b>, a distance between the end of the limiting piece <b>40</b> and the maximum height of the protrusion <b>22</b> is L3. L3=L2-L1. When L3&#x3e;L1, the protrusion <b>22</b> will resist the limiting piece <b>40</b> and be inserted into the hole <b>21</b>, otherwise the protrusion <b>22</b> may not reach the hole <b>21</b>. Since L3=L2-L1&#x3e;L1, L2/2&#x3e;L1, that is L1 is smaller than one half of L2.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in at least one embodiment, there are two limiting pieces <b>40</b> and two holes <b>21</b> arranged symmetrically, meanwhile, there are two protrusions <b>22</b> for improving a stability of the trays <b>20</b>.

The plate <b>42</b> is connected to a middle of the column <b>41</b> and arranged between the two separators <b>11</b>. The two elastic pieces <b>30</b> are arranged between one of the separators <b>11</b> and the plate <b>42</b>, that is, opposite sides of the plate <b>42</b> contain one elastic piece <b>30</b>. Opposite ends of the column <b>41</b> are configured to be inserted into the holes <b>21</b>. The two elastic pieces <b>30</b> push the plate <b>42</b> to elastically recover the column <b>41</b> so as to separate from the hole <b>21</b>.
