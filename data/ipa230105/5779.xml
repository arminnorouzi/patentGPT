An electrostatic chuck may be used to produce a clamping action against the substrate to maintain planarity across the substrate and contact between the substrate and the substrate support. The substrate support may perform multiple functions during plasma processing. For example, in addition to chucking the wafer against the substrate support, the substrate support may include one or more embedded heaters for controlling a temperature of the substrate during processing. Additionally, the substrate support may operate as one of the electrodes for a capacitively-coupled plasma produced within a substrate processing region of the semiconductor processing chamber.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">An electrode within the substrate support, as well as an opposing faceplate or showerhead, may operate as two opposing capacitively-coupled electrodes during plasma processing. This may produce a plasma between the components, which may ionize delivered precursors and produce reactants that may deposit materials on the substrate. While the chamber body may be grounded and operate as a ground path in some embodiments, this ground path may cause challenges during processing. The ground path from a hot electrode within the pedestal to the chamber walls may not be symmetric with gap regions around the substrate support and below the substrate support, and electrical fields may create areas of higher distribution, which may ignite stray plasma in regions around the substrate support. To improve issues with asymmetrical grounding, many substrate supports will additionally include a ground electrode within the substrate support itself. The ground electrode within the substrate support may be separated from the plasma-generating electrode within the platen portion of the substrate support, or the electrostatic chuck body. As many substrate supports are a ceramic or dielectric material, shorting between these electrodes may not occur, although electrical losses may be generated through the dielectric body from the hot electrode to the ground electrode.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">While improving the symmetry of the ground path and incorporating a ground electrode within the electrostatic chuck body may reduce stray plasma issues, many conventional technologies must accept the electrical losses from the incorporation of a ground electrode within the substrate support. One solution to reduce these losses may include increasing a thickness of the dielectric material, and thus a corresponding distance between the hot electrode and ground electrode, which may reduce the capacitive losses between these two components. However, due to space constraints within the processing chamber, many substrate supports are constrained vertically, which may limit the ability to sufficiently increase the chuck body thickness. The present technology may overcome these issues by manipulating the electrical properties of the ceramic of the ground plate. By including an amount of air or fluid space within the substrate support, an effective capacitance between the hot and ground electrodes may be reduced, while maintaining a specified thickness of the substrate support.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Although the remaining disclosure will routinely identify specific deposition processes and chambers utilizing the disclosed technology, it will be readily understood that the systems and methods are equally applicable to other deposition, etch, and cleaning chambers, as well as processes as may occur in the described chambers. Accordingly, the technology should not be considered to be so limited as for use with these specific deposition processes or chambers alone.

Where the electronic controllers <b>134</b>, <b>140</b> are variable capacitors, the capacitance range of each of the variable capacitors, and the inductances of the first inductor <b>132</b>A and the second inductor <b>132</b>B, may be chosen to provide an impedance range. This range may depend on the frequency and voltage characteristics of the plasma, which may have a minimum in the capacitance range of each variable capacitor. Hence, when the capacitance of the first electronic controller <b>134</b> is at a minimum or maximum, impedance of the first tuning circuit <b>128</b> may be high, resulting in a plasma shape that has a minimum aerial or lateral coverage over the substrate support. When the capacitance of the first electronic controller <b>134</b> approaches a value that minimizes the impedance of the first tuning circuit <b>128</b>, the aerial coverage of the plasma may grow to a maximum, effectively covering the entire working area of the substrate support <b>104</b>. As the capacitance of the first electronic controller <b>134</b> deviates from the minimum impedance setting, the plasma shape may shrink from the chamber walls and aerial coverage of the substrate support may decline. The second electronic controller <b>140</b> may have a similar effect, increasing and decreasing aerial coverage of the plasma over the substrate support as the capacitance of the second electronic controller <b>140</b> may be changed.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The electronic sensors <b>130</b>, <b>138</b> may be used to tune the respective circuits <b>128</b>, <b>136</b> in a closed loop.

Consequently, a plasma shape may be selected and dynamically controlled during processing. It is to be understood that, while the foregoing discussion is based on electronic controllers <b>134</b>, <b>140</b>, which may be variable capacitors, any electronic component with adjustable characteristic may be used to provide tuning circuits <b>128</b> and <b>136</b> with adjustable impedance.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a schematic partial cross-sectional view of an exemplary substrate support <b>200</b> according to some embodiments of the present technology.

It is to be understood that substrate support <b>200</b> is not illustrated to any particular scale, and is included merely to illustrate aspects of the present technology. Substrate support <b>200</b> may be included within a chamber as previously described, as well as any other processing chamber, which may define a substrate processing region, such as with one or more walls of a chamber body, or other components positioned within the processing chamber. Substrate support <b>200</b> may show a partial view of components and couplings within an exemplary semiconductor processing system, and may not include all of the components, such as the chamber components and characteristics previously described, which are understood to be incorporated in some embodiments about and with substrate support <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Substrate support <b>200</b> may include a number of components bonded, welded, joined, sintered, formed, or otherwise coupled with one another. The substrate support assembly may include an electrostatic chuck body <b>205</b>, which may include one or more components embedded or disposed within the body. The components incorporated within the top puck may not be exposed to processing materials in some embodiments, and may be fully retained within the chuck body <b>205</b>. Electrostatic chuck body <b>205</b> may define a substrate support surface <b>207</b>, and may be characterized by a thickness and length or diameter depending on the specific geometry of the chuck body. In some embodiments the chuck body may be elliptical, and may be characterized by one or more radial dimensions from a central axis through the chuck body. It is to be understood that the top puck may be any geometry, and when radial dimensions are discussed, they may define any length from a central position of the chuck body.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Electrostatic chuck body <b>205</b> may be coupled with a stem <b>210</b>, which may support the chuck body and may include channels for delivering and receiving electrical and/or fluid lines that may couple with internal components of the chuck body <b>205</b>. Chuck body <b>205</b> may include associated channels or components to operate as an electrostatic chuck, although in some embodiments the assembly may operate as or include components for a vacuum chuck, or any other type of chucking system. Stem <b>210</b> may be coupled with the chuck body on a second surface of the chuck body opposite the substrate support surface. The electrostatic chuck body <b>205</b> may include an electrode <b>215</b> embedded within the chuck body proximate the substrate support surface. Electrode <b>215</b> may be electrically coupled with a power source for operating as a plasma-generating electrode alone or with another component, such as with a faceplate or other chamber component for producing a capacitively-coupled plasma above the wafer. The power source may be configured to provide energy or voltage to the electrically conductive chuck electrode <b>215</b>, which may also operate as a chucking electrode in some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some embodiments the electrostatic chuck body <b>205</b> and/or the stem <b>210</b> may be insulative or dielectric materials. For example, oxides, nitrides, carbides, and other materials may be used to form the components, as well as a range of polymeric materials, including polystyrene or other materials, including cross-linked materials. Exemplary materials may include ceramics, including aluminum oxide, aluminum nitride, silicon carbide, tungsten carbide, and any other metal or transition metal oxide, nitride, carbide, boride, or titanate, as well as combinations of these materials and other insulative or dielectric materials. Different grades of ceramic materials may be used to provide composites configured to operate at particular temperature ranges, and thus different ceramic grades of similar materials may be used for the top puck and stem in some embodiments. Dopants may be incorporated in some embodiments to adjust electrical properties or other characteristics of the components. Exemplary dopant materials may include yttrium, magnesium, silicon, iron, calcium, chromium, sodium, nickel, copper, zinc, or any number of other elements known to be incorporated within a ceramic or dielectric material.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The chuck body may include a ground electrode <b>220</b>, which may be disposed proximate the backside of the chuck body, such as proximate the surface with which the stem is coupled. Additionally, a heater <b>225</b> may be incorporated within the chuck body, such as between the electrode <b>215</b> and the ground electrode <b>220</b>. Electrical couplings for the heater and electrode may extend through the stem and substrate support to electrically couple the components with power supplies.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some embodiments, the electrostatic chuck body may also include or define one or more channels within the electrostatic chuck body between the electrode <b>215</b> and the ground electrode <b>220</b>. As explained previously, electrical losses may occur from the electrode <b>215</b> to the ground electrode <b>220</b> through the electrostatic chuck body <b>205</b>. In some embodiments a thickness of the chuck body may be fixed, and thus reducing the electrical losses by increasing a distance between the electrodes may not be feasible. Accordingly, in some embodiments the electrical properties of the chuck body may be modified by incorporating gaps, which may include air or some other fluid or gas pumped into the channels.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In addition to increasing the chuck body thickness to further separate the electrodes, increasing air pockets or porosity may reduce the effective capacitance between the two electrodes within the chuck body. To effectively reduce the capacitance, however, a sufficient volume of air or fluid may be included. By increasing porosity throughout the substrate support, however, leakage may occur. For example, the substrate support may be included within a processing chamber that may be operated under vacuum during semiconductor processing. Channels formed within the stem and top puck for delivering fluids or electrical connections may be maintained at atmospheric conditions. When the chuck body is sufficiently porous, the pressure differential between the atmospheric components and the vacuum conditions within the chamber may cause air to leak through the porous body into the processing chamber. Consequently, simply increasing the porosity of the puck body may not allow a sufficient volume of air to be incorporated to effectively reduce capacitance without compromising the operation of the substrate support with respect to processing.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Accordingly, the present technology may include a number of channels formed within the electrostatic chuck body to increase a volume percentage of air or other fluid within the puck between the two electrodes, which may reduce the effective capacitance between the electrodes. The channels may be distributed to limit structural impact on the substrate support. For example, because the electrostatic chuck body may be formed by a high temperature and pressure sintering process, and then operated under potentially high vacuum conditions, forming a single volume within the electrostatic chuck body may cause the structure to collapse during formation or operation. Additionally, heat transfer through the electrostatic chuck body may be greatly impeded with such a volume, which may affect uniformity of heating of a substrate. Consequently, some embodiments of the present technology may include one or more channels within the substrate support distributed to limit mechanical and thermal impact on operation of the substrate support, while improving electrical characteristics of the substrate support.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As illustrated, the electrostatic chuck body may be a monolithic body of a ceramic material incorporating each of the hot electrode, the ground electrode, the heater, and the channels. As will be described further below, the monolith may be formed by sintering or otherwise joining a number of plates, such as green bodies, which may define the one or more channels that in some embodiments may be a plurality of channels. Each channel included may be accessible through the stem, which may allow fluid access, and which may prevent the channels from being sealed volumes within the electrostatic chuck body, for example. A first channel <b>230</b> may be formed within the electrostatic chuck body <b>205</b> between the electrode <b>215</b> and the heater <b>225</b>. A second channel <b>235</b> may be formed within the electrostatic chuck body between the electrode <b>215</b> and the heater <b>225</b>, and may be formed within the chuck body between the first channel <b>230</b> and the heater <b>225</b>. The second channel may be vertically offset within the electrostatic chuck body from the first channel as illustrated.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some embodiments a third channel <b>240</b> may be formed within the electrostatic chuck body between the heater <b>225</b> and the ground electrode <b>220</b>. As will be explained further below, each channel may include or be comprised of a set of interconnected channels, which may all be fluidly coupled to produce a single distributed channel. In embodiments some or all of the channels may be included in substrate support assemblies, although not all channels may be included. For example, in some embodiments only one of the channels may be included, or any two of the channels may be included. In one non-limiting embodiment only the first and third channel may be included, in which case the third channel may constitute a second channel, for example. Any number of inclusions or exclusions is similarly encompassed by embodiments of the present technology.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Each of the channels included may be distributed along a respective plane through the electrostatic chuck body. For example, the first channel may extend along a first plane through the electrostatic chuck body, the second channel may extend along a second plane through the electrostatic chuck body, and the third channel may extend along a third plane through the electrostatic chuck body. Channels may be distributed along the plane to maintain structural support and sufficient heat transfer through the layers of the substrate support. For example, when both first channel <b>230</b> and second channel <b>235</b> are included, the channels may be offset from one another. As illustrated, in some embodiments second channel <b>235</b> may be offset from associated portions of the first channel <b>230</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Third channel <b>240</b> is illustrated as being aligned with first channel <b>230</b>, although in other embodiments third channel <b>240</b> may be aligned with second channel <b>235</b>, or may be offset from both first channel <b>230</b> and second channel <b>235</b>. In line with third channel <b>240</b> may be an additional access <b>245</b>, which may provide a space for a thermocouple or additional sensor. Additionally, to limit leakage from any of the channels into the chamber environment, which may be a vacuum environment, in some embodiments a radial outermost portion of any channel may be maintained at least about 1 mm from an exterior edge of the substrate support, and may be maintained greater than or about 2 mm from the exterior edge, greater than or about 3 mm, greater than or about 4 mm, greater than or about 5 mm, greater than or about 6 mm, greater than or about 7 mm, greater than or about 8 mm, greater than or about 9 mm, greater than or about 10 mm, or more.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">As noted previously, electrostatic chuck body <b>205</b> may be formed by joining a number of plates that may define the one or more channels.

Although chuck bodies may be characterized by any thickness in embodiments of the present technology, in some embodiments the electrostatic chuck body may maintain a distance between a hot electrode and a ground electrode of less than or about 30 mm, and may maintain a distance between the electrodes of less than or about 25 mm, less than or about 20 mm, less than or about 18 mm, less than or about 16 mm, less than or about 14 mm, less than or about 12 mm, less than or about 10 mm, or less. As the distance between the electrodes decreases, the effective capacitance between them may increase, causing losses within the system.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">However, by incorporating channels which may produce fluid or air volume within the chuck body, the effective capacitance may be reduced. Hence, with electrode spacing within any of the noted ranges, an effective capacitance through the chuck body may be less than or about 1,000 pF, and may be less than or about 980 pF, less than or about 960 pF, less than or about 950 pF, less than or about 940 pF, less than or about 930 pF, less than or about 920 pF, less than or about 910 pF, less than or about 900 pF, less than or about 890 pF, less than or about 880 pF, less than or about 870 pF, less than or about 860 pF, less than or about 850 pF, less than or about 840 pF, less than or about 830 pF, less than or about 820 pF, less than or about 810 pF, less than or about 800 pF, less than or about 790 pF, or less. This may occur by increasing the volume percentage of air within the chuck body by incorporating channels as previously described. For example, in some embodiments, the volume percentage of air within the electrostatic chuck body may be greater than or about 2%, and may be greater than or about 4%, greater than or about 6%, greater than or about 8%, greater than or about 10%, greater than or about 12%, greater than or about 14%, greater than or about 16%, greater than or about 18%, greater than or about 20%, or more. As previously described, this volume percentage may not be the result of increased porosity, which at these ranges may produce air leaks through the chuck body. Consequently, electrostatic chuck bodies according to embodiments of the present technology may be characterized by an effective capacitance similar to a chuck body with electrode spacing that may be up to twice the distance or more.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows a schematic plan view of a portion of an exemplary electrostatic chuck body <b>700</b> according to some embodiments of the present technology.

Electrostatic chuck body <b>700</b> may include a set of channels <b>705</b> within a single layer through the chuck body to produce a percentage air volume as discussed above. The channels <b>705</b> may be fluidly accessible from a central aperture as previously described, and may be formed between a heater and hot electrode as discussed above.
