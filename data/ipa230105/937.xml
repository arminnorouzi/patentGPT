In particular, the present invention relates to a versatile food product that can be used not only as a beverage but also as a health-promoting functional food to improve immunity, skincare, and beauty for users. More specifically, the present invention relates to a composition of nutritional powder from germinated dragon fruit seeds and process of manufacturing the same.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Dragon fruit is classified in the group of 12 key fruit trees, also one of Vietnam's 9 specialty crops with competitive advantages in the world market. The area of dragon fruit growing in Vietnam is currently about 37,000 ha; wherein Binh Thuan province is considered Vietnam's dragon fruit &#x201c;capital&#x201d; with an area of up to 27,000 hectares, the annual output reaches more than 600,000 tons (accounting for 80% of the country's dragon fruit production). According to the Department of Industry and Trade, Binh Thuan' dragon fruit is consumed on the market mainly in the form of fresh dragon fruit and a few are processed products such as dragon fruit juice, dragon fruit wine, drying dragon fruit, freeze-drying dragon fruit, etc. However, due to the fact that fresh dragon fruit cannot be preserved for a long time, the consumption of dragon fruit is still the weakest stage, the domestic market only consumes about 15% of the output, and the remaining 85% is for export. Of these, the amount of fresh dragon fruit for official export accounts for a very low proportion (about 2-3%), the rest is consumed by cross-border trade with Chinese traders or sold to businesses outside the province which directly export. In order to stabilize the output of dragon fruit in line with the current rapidly increasing output, it is necessary to accelerate development, expand and diversify consumption markets both at home and abroad. That is one of the basic reasons for forming the idea of the process of manufacturing a composition of nutritional powder from germinated dragon fruit seeds, which contributes to increasing the economic value of dragon fruit.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">According to actual data, despite the high nutritional content, dragon fruit seeds have not been fully utilized, specifically, dragon fruit seeds having 1.3%-1.5% by weight of the dragon fruit. Although, dragon fruit seeds account for a very low percentage compared to the flesh of the dragon fruit. The seeds have great nutritional value. Dragon fruit seeds contain many nutrients, which are important essential fatty acids such as linoleic acid (C18:2) and linolenic acid (C18:3) with concentrations ranging from 50% to 51%.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Several nutritional studies have explained the process of germinating seeds breaking down some starches, resulting in a higher nutrient ratio. It also breaks down phytate, a form of phytic acid that normally reduces the absorption of vitamins and minerals in the body. So, germinated seeds have more nutrients than regular grains. Research shows that sprouting reduces phytic acid content by up to 81%. Protease inhibitors were also reduced by 76%. This helps increase the absorption of proteins and important minerals for the body; such as iron, zinc, calcium, magnesium, and manganese. Besides, sprouted nuts are also low in starch; and easier to digest than regular grains.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to patent application No. CN105011050, the present invention relates to preparation method of nutrient pitaya seed powder and products of nutrient pitaya seed powder. More specifically, the method comprises the following steps: 1) taking surplus pitaya seed and pulp residues after the preparation of fruit juice through homogenizing and filtering, adding 5-10 parts of water, adding pectinase and cellulase, and slowly stirring and treating the surplus pitaya seed, the pulp residues, the water, the pectinase and the cellulase for 12-72 hours; 2) performing filtration so as to obtain pitaya seed, and drying the obtained pitaya seed; 3) crushing the dried pitaya seed, and screening the crushed pitaya seed so as to obtain pitaya seed powder; and 4) disinfecting the pitaya seed powder, and subpackaging the disinfected pitaya seed powder so as to obtain finished products.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to PH patent application PH22018000824, the present invention relates to a process of producing dragon fruit powder comprising the steps of: pureeing a predetermined quantity of peeled dragon fruit; mixing maltodextrin powder as a food additive with the puree; filtering the puree and maltodextrin powder mixture through a fine mesh filter to trap undissolved materials; pumping the mixture into a spray drying machine to convert the mixture in its liquid form to a powder; sieving the powder through a 40-mesh screen sifter; passing the powder through magnetic metal bars to trap metal contaminant; and packing a desired amount of the powder into a sealed container.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to CN patent application No. CN104872566, the present invention relates to a health nutrition powder containing peanut, apricot kernels and dragon fruit, and a preparation method of the health nutrition powder. The health nutrition powder is prepared from the following raw materials in parts by weight: 25-30 parts of peanut powder, 20-25 parts of apricot kernel powder, 10-15 parts of dragon fruit powder, 10-15 parts of glutinous rice flour, 15-25 parts of traditional Chinese medicine powder and 5-8 parts of seasoning powder.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The above inventions meet the specific purposes and requirements of a technical solution. However, the disclosure of the main ingredients of nutritional powder from dragon fruit of all three inventions mentioned above does not disclose that the main ingredient is germinated dragon fruit seeds.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, it is necessary to create a composition of nutritional powder from germinated dragon fruit seeds that contains many good fatty acids for the body, such as omega-3 and omega-6 to help reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, vitamin B3 has the effect of lowering harmful cholesterol (LDL) and increase good cholesterol (HDL).</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Furthermore, it is necessary to provide a method of creating the composition of nutritional powder from germinated dragon fruit seeds having the addition of a noni powder to increase the nutritional, vitamin, and mineral values of the nutritional powder product from germinated dragon fruit seeds.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Finally, what is needed to provide a method of creating the composition of nutritional powder from germinated dragon fruit seeds includes simple steps, take advantage of the by-products of dragon fruit juice processing to diversify output products for dragon fruit, reduce waste to the environment and create a new source of raw materials &#x201c;germinated dragon fruit seeds&#x201d; for providing the production process.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">This invention provides solutions to achieve the above goals.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Accordingly, an objective of the present invention is to provide a composition of nutritional powder from germinated dragon fruit seeds comprising a germinated dragon fruit seeds ingredient having a first percentage (%) by weight; a noni powder ingredient having a second percentage (%) by weight; a dragon fruit powder ingredient having a third percentage (%) by weight; and other ingredients having a fourth percentage (%) by weight; wherein the sum of said percentage (%) by weight of ingredients from the first percentage (%) to the fourth percentage (%) adds up to 100% by weight of said the composition of nutritional powder from germinated dragon fruit seeds.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Another objective of the present invention is to provide a method stimulating germinated fresh dragon fruit seeds or dried dragon fruit seeds using enzyme preparation including a cellulose enzyme ingredient and a pectin enzyme ingredient, having the effect of shortening the germination time.
