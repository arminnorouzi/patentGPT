These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention, and it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and that structural, logical and electrical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. The following description of example embodiments is, therefore, not to be taken in a limited sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block flow diagram illustrating a system <b>100</b> for manufacturing a reflective strip for use on a board of a barricade, such as a type III barricade. Such barricades generally have alternating which and yellow reflective portions supported by a board.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">System <b>100</b> may utilize a first roll <b>110</b> of white reflective material. A first strip <b>115</b> is shown being pulled from the first roll <b>110</b> and being die cut via a blade <b>120</b> to form first pieces <b>125</b>. The first pieces <b>125</b> are shown first in a side view, with a top view shown below each side view piece. The first strip <b>125</b> may be an elongated reflective strip that may have a width, D, of six inches in one example, The width, D, may vary as desired. The cut may be made at a <b>45</b>-degree angle to create the first pieces <b>125</b> having a trapezoid shape.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">A second roll <b>130</b> of orange reflective material is also utilized. A second strip <b>135</b> is shown being pulled from the second roll <b>130</b> and being die cut via a blade <b>140</b> to form second pieces <b>145</b>. The second pieces <b>145</b> are shown first in a side view, with a top view shown below each side view piece. The second strip <b>135</b> may be an elongated reflective strip that may have a width, D, of six inches in one example. The width, D, may vary as desired. The cut may be made at a 45-degree angle to create the second pieces <b>145</b> having a trapezoid shape.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">A third roll <b>150</b> comprises a premask tape or liner <b>155</b> to which alternating first and second pieces are attached as shown. The pieces may be laid end to end, forming the appearance of a continuous reflective strip of alternating colors. The tape or liner <b>155</b> may also have a same width, D, and may also include an adhesive or other means of coupling the pieces to the liner <b>155</b>. Broken lines <b>155</b>, <b>156</b>, <b>157</b>, <b>158</b>, <b>159</b>, and <b>160</b> are illustrated to show the placement of the pieces in one example. In further examples, the first and second pieces may be selected from respective piles and need not line up exactly in the order they are cut from their respective rolls.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The liner <b>155</b> is then used to couple the strip of alternating colored pieces to a board <b>170</b>. The pieces may be laminated to the board in one example. Other means of coupling the pieces may be used in further examples, such as via the use of adhesive. The liner may be removed such that the reflective side of each piece is opposite the board as shown in a top view of the board with pieces at <b>175</b>.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The board may have the same width D and have a length that may be varied as desired. Typical board lengths vary from 2 to 10 feet in some examples, with one example being a 6 foot board. The width, D, may typically vary as well, with common widths being 4 to 8 inches. In one example, D is 6 inches. The boards may be formed of wood, metal, or plastic, or other suitable material which can support the reflective pieces and endure environmental conditions that barriers are typically subjected to.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Note that in some examples, the various reflective materials and liners may be in a sheet form, and may be cut as desired, either before coupling to the board, or after.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The reflective materials may be in sheet form in one example, such as 3M brand DG3, also referred to as DG3 fluorescent orange 4094 and white 4090 for the respective second and first pieces.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In one example, the sheets may be die cut 45 degree (left and right) into 6 inch-wide stripes that are assembled and held together by the use of pre-mask tape and a liner.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective view of a barrier <b>200</b> according to an example embodiment. Barrier <b>200</b> includes a board <b>210</b> having alternating colored reflective pieces <b>215</b>, <b>220</b> that have been applied to the board as described above to give the appearance of a continuous reflective strip with alternating colors. The board <b>210</b> is supported by two a-frame supports <b>225</b> and <b>230</b> having respective slots <b>235</b>, <b>240</b> formed to support the board above the ground at each end of the board.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a perspective view of a type <b>3</b> barrier <b>300</b> having three generally parallel and spaced apart boards <b>310</b>, <b>315</b>, <b>320</b> supported by inverted &#x201c;T&#x201d; shaped portions <b>325</b>, <b>330</b>. Boards <b>310</b>, <b>315</b>, and <b>320</b> have alternating colored reflective pieces that have been applied to the boards as described above to give the appearance of a continuous reflective strip with alternating colors.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a view of a swing arm barrier <b>400</b> having a board <b>410</b> rotatably coupled to a support <b>420</b>.

Method <b>500</b> begins at <b>510</b> by cutting first pieces from an elongated first reflective strip having a first color, the first reflective strip having a width D. Second pieces are cut at <b>520</b> from an elongated second reflective strip having a second color, the elongated second strip having a width D. At <b>530</b>, the first and second pieces are coupled to a substrate or liner having a width of at least D to form first and second color alternating portions. The substrate with the pieces is then coupled or applied via lamination to a cross piece of a barrier at <b>540</b>. The substrate may be removed at <b>550</b> leaving the pieces coupled to the cross piece.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In one example, the first color is white and the second color is orange. The reflective strips may be fluorescent and have trapezoid shapes that are placed end to end to form the appearance of a continuous reflective strip on the substrate despite being discrete and separate pieces.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In one example, cutting the first and second pieces comprises applying a sharp edge to the first and second strips sufficient to separate the pieces from the respective strips. A die cut machine may be used to cut the pieces. The substrate or liner may include an adhesive for coupling the first and second pieces. The first and second pieces have lengths equal to the alternating portions.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The barricade may be a type <b>3</b> barricade, a swing arm type barricade, or other type of barricade that utilizes cross pieces, such as boards.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The first elongated strips may be formed a first sheet of reflective material of the first color, and the second elongated strip may be formed from a second sheet of reflected material of the second color.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In one example, the cross piece has a width D and the first and second pieces each have a same length, L.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Although a few embodiments have been described in detail above, other modifications are possible. For example, the logic flows depicted in the figures do not require the particular order shown, or sequential order, to achieve desirable results.
