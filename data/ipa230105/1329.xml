The water is frequently extracted along with hydrocarbon. Hydrocarbon cannot be transported or refined with water, so the hydrocarbon is separated from the water. Often, the water is finely dispersed in the oil phase to form an emulsion that takes time to settle naturally. Measures are thus typically employed to speed the separation.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Electric fields are typically employed to speed separation of oil and water. The water typically has some amount of salt that increases its conductivity and its reaction to the effect of an electric field relative to oil. Electrodes are immersed in the oil water mixture, and power is applied to the electrodes to enhance separation of the phases. Typically, electrostatic separators operate continuously, with a stream of material coming out of a producing hydrocarbon reservoir and being charged to the separator, and streams of separated oil and water coming out of the separator. The stream coming out of the producing hydrocarbon reservoir is often variable and unpredictable, so controlling the separator to avoid breakthroughs of water in the oil, or oil in the water, due to excursions in the properties and composition of the material charged to the separator, is desirable. There is a need for improved methods of controlling electrostatic separators.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Embodiments described herein provide a method of tuning an electrical liquid separator, comprising providing a liquid mixture to a separator; electrically coupling a power unit to the liquid mixture inside the separator; applying a time-varying voltage from the power unit to the liquid mixture; increasing a voltage applied to the liquid mixture from the power unit from a first voltage to a second voltage; detecting an inflection point in a current from the power unit; setting a voltage output range of the power unit to encompass a voltage at which the inflection point was detected; adjusting a modulation frequency of the time-varying voltage to minimize current flow through the liquid mixture; and adjusting a base frequency of the time-varying voltage to minimize current flow through the liquid mixture.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Other embodiments described herein provide a method of separating a liquid mixture, comprising providing a liquid mixture to a separator; electrically coupling a power circuit comprising a powered electrode to the liquid mixture inside the separator; applying a time-varying voltage to the powered electrode; separating the liquid mixture in the separator into a first effluent and a second effluent; determining a voltage range that maximizes effect of voltage change on current flow through the power circuit; determining a first base frequency that minimizes current flow through the power circuit; determining a first modulation frequency that minimizes current flow through the power circuit; seeking a second base frequency that improves composition of the first effluent or the second effluent; and seeking a second modulation frequency that improves composition of the first effluent or the second effluent.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Other embodiments described herein provide a method of tuning an electrical liquid separator, comprising providing a liquid mixture to a separator; electrically coupling a power unit to the liquid mixture inside the separator; applying a time-varying voltage from the power unit to the liquid mixture; separating the liquid mixture into a first effluent and a second effluent; increasing a voltage applied to the liquid mixture from the power unit from a first voltage to a second voltage; defining an inflection point voltage at which current in the power circuit stops increasing and begins decreasing; setting a voltage output range of the power unit to encompass a voltage at which the inflection point was detected; and setting base frequency and modulation frequency of the power unit to minimize current in the power circuit at a voltage within the voltage output range.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">So that the manner in which the above recited features of the present disclosure can be understood in detail, a more particular description of the disclosure, briefly summarized above, may be had by reference to embodiments, some of which are illustrated in the appended drawings.

The separation apparatus <b>100</b> includes a vessel <b>10</b> having an inlet <b>12</b>, a heavy component outlet <b>14</b> and a lighter component outlet <b>16</b>. The heavy component outlet <b>14</b> is usually in a lower part of the vessel <b>10</b>, and may be at the bottom of the vessel <b>10</b>. The lighter component outlet <b>16</b> is in an upper part of the vessel <b>10</b> and may be at the top of the vessel <b>10</b>. A mixture of heavy and light liquids, which may also include some gas, is provided to the inlet <b>12</b>, and electrical means are employed in the apparatus <b>100</b> to enhance separation of the heavy and light components of the mixture into two phases. The liquid mixture is typically charged to the vessel <b>10</b> using a distributor, which may be positioned at any convenient location within the vessel <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The electrical means used to enhance separation of the liquid phases is an electric field applied to the liquid mixture inside the vessel <b>10</b>. An electrode is immersed in the liquid mixture to apply the electric field, thus creating a voltage within the liquid mixture that enhances the speed with which the liquid phases separate based on the different electrical characteristics of the liquid phases. One electrode may be powered to apply voltage to the liquid mixture. Alternately, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a plurality of electrodes may be used. The plurality of electrodes may be arranged in one or more pairs, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Thus, for a given electrode pair, one electrode may be powered while the other is electrically coupled to a reference potential. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a plurality of powered electrodes <b>28</b> are here paired with a plurality of respective reference electrodes <b>30</b>, where in each pair, the powered electrode <b>28</b> is coupled to power and the respective reference electrode <b>30</b> is coupled to a reference potential, which may be the same or different in each case. In a single-electrode case, a reference potential may be coupled to the liquid mixture in the vessel <b>10</b> using a conductor electrically coupled to the liquid mixture, either as an electrode immersed in the liquid mixture, coupled to the vessel <b>10</b>, or coupled to one or more of the power sources.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">One or more power units <b>106</b> apply power to the liquid mixture to create the voltage. Here, one power unit <b>106</b> is shown coupled to two powered electrodes <b>28</b> in parallel, but more than one power unit can be used. For example, each of the powered electrodes <b>28</b> can have a dedicated power unit <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In a case where a single power unit <b>106</b> is used, the power unit may be coupled to a single electrode or to multiple electrodes immersed in the liquid mixture. The power units <b>106</b> here each include a rectifier <b>102</b>, a modulator <b>103</b>, a chopper <b>104</b>, and a transformer <b>111</b>. Power leads <b>105</b> supply primary power to the rectifier <b>102</b> via rectifier leads <b>105</b>, which connect a primary power supply <b>101</b> to the rectifier <b>102</b>. Modulator leads <b>107</b> connect the rectifier <b>102</b> to the modulator <b>103</b>. Chopper leads <b>108</b> connect the modulator <b>103</b> to the chopper <b>104</b>. Transformer primary leads <b>113</b> connect the chopper <b>104</b> to the transformer <b>111</b>. A power conduit <b>109</b> supplies power from the transformer <b>111</b> to the power electrodes <b>28</b>. A return conduit <b>110</b> connects the reference electrode <b>30</b> back to the transformer <b>111</b> to complete the power circuit. The rectifier <b>102</b>, modulator <b>103</b>, and chopper <b>104</b> shape the temporal profile of the voltage applied to the transformer primary leads <b>113</b>. The transformer <b>111</b> steps up the voltage to a level effective to enhance phase separation in the vessel <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The powered electrodes <b>28</b> acquire an electric potential from the power conduit <b>109</b> and energize an electric field within the liquid mixture inside the vessel <b>10</b>. In this case, each powered electrode <b>28</b> is adjacent to a portion of a reference electrode <b>30</b>. As mentioned above, reference electrodes <b>30</b> immersed in the liquid mixture are optional. Also as mentioned above, any number of power electrodes <b>28</b> and reference electrodes <b>30</b> can be used. Moreover, a different number of powered electrodes <b>28</b> can be used from the number of reference electrodes <b>30</b>, and the powered electrodes <b>28</b> can be configured the same as, or differently from, the reference electrodes <b>30</b>. For example, the powered electrodes <b>28</b> and reference electrodes <b>30</b> are configured as assemblies of parallel plates extending vertically and into the page in the view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The powered electrodes <b>28</b> and reference electrodes <b>30</b> could be oriented horizontally, or angled between horizontal and vertical. Finally, the electrode orientation can be different for powered electrodes <b>28</b> and reference electrodes <b>30</b>. The methods described herein can be used with any electrode orientation, and even using the vessel <b>10</b> as the reference electrode.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In one embodiment, two electrodes of an electrode pair are connected to the transformer <b>113</b> to receive the alternate half-cycles of the time-varying voltage. The half-cycles may be rectified such that the electrodes receive essentially the same voltage with the same polarity in alternating half-cycles, or the voltage may be full-cycle such that the electrodes receive opposite polarity voltages. The vessel <b>10</b> can function as ground in such arrangements. In other AC voltage arrangements, an electrode pair likd the power electrode <b>28</b> and the reference electrode <b>30</b> is used.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The power unit <b>106</b> applies voltage to the electrodes <b>28</b> using a power supply <b>101</b> to shape the pattern of the voltage. The voltage may be substantially constant or may be time-varying. When a time-varying voltage is applied to a power lead <b>105</b> of the transformer <b>102</b> by the power supply <b>101</b>, the corresponding secondary circuit (not shown) acquires a time-varying voltage, which propagates to a rectifier lead <b>107</b>. The rectifier <b>103</b> rectifies the voltage, applying a rectified voltage to a chopper lead <b>108</b>. The chopper <b>104</b> modulates application of voltage to the power conduit <b>109</b>, providing an independent source of time variation, so that base frequency applied to the power lead <b>105</b> can be adjusted and modulation frequency applied by the chopper <b>104</b> can be independently adjusted.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">A waveform can be applied to the power supplied to the power lead <b>105</b> by the power supply <b>101</b>. Waveforms such as sine waves, square waves, sawtooth waves, trapezoidal wave, triangular-shaped waves, exponential waves, logarithmic waves, semi-circular waves, inverse semi-circular waves, or other symmetrical or non-symmetrical shaped waves can be used, with any convenient variation and/or modulation of amplitude, frequency, and waveform, to produce a time-varying voltage. Two electrodes can be powered using time-varying voltages having different waveforms, different frequencies, different amplitudes, and/or different modulations.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">It should be noted that multiple power units <b>106</b> can be used for one vessel <b>10</b>. The power units <b>106</b> can be independently controlled according to voltage, base frequency, waveform, and modulation frequency.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">A current sensor <b>114</b> is coupled to the return conduit <b>110</b> to sense current flowing in the low energy portion of the power circuit. The current sensor <b>114</b> senses current flowing in the power circuit as the electric field established in the fluid inside the vessel <b>10</b> works to accelerate separation of the phases. A controller <b>112</b> is operatively coupled to the current sensor <b>114</b> to receive signals from the current sensor <b>114</b> representing current flowing in the return conduit <b>110</b>. The controller <b>112</b> is also operatively coupled to the power unit <b>106</b> to control application of power to the electrodes <b>28</b>. Instead, or additionally, a current sensor can be coupled to the power conduit <b>109</b> and operatively coupled to the controller <b>112</b>. The controller <b>112</b> can receive signals from one or both of the current sensors <b>114</b> and <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The controller <b>112</b> here is configured to seek optimal process windows for operating the separator <b>100</b>. Specifically, the controller <b>112</b> is configured to perform methods described herein for establishing effective and efficient operating windows for voltage, base frequency, and modulation frequency by monitoring current flow in the power circuit as the parameters are changed.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Tuning and optimizing such separators is currently done manually by guess work. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a flow diagram summarizing a method <b>200</b> according to one embodiment. The method is a method of operating an electrical separator, such as the electrical separator <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The methods described herein take advantage of the response from the separator when characteristics of the applied voltage are changed. In general, current flowing through the power conduits to the electrodes or the return conduits from the electrodes to the power unit can be monitored to register the process response to the applied voltage. At <b>202</b>, the voltage applied to the separator by the power unit is changed. The voltage change is applied across a range of voltages thought to encompass an effective and efficient operating window. The voltage may be increased through the range or decreased through the range.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In one version, the voltage is increased, either from a minimum voltage, or from the current voltage set point, to a maximum voltage. The maximum voltage would be either a maximum voltage of a process window or a maximum operable voltage of the power unit. The voltage can be increased steadily, for example linearly according to a programmed rate, such as 1 kV/hour, or the voltage can be increased in steps. The method <b>200</b> is geared toward identifying a maximally effective and efficient operating window for the separator. To that end, if prior knowledge suggests a likely range for the operating window, the voltage can be increased from a lower limit of the likely range to an upper limit of the likely range. In other embodiments, the voltage can be increased from a minimum to a maximum at a first rate outside the likely range and a second rate within the likely range, where the second rate is less than the first rate. In other embodiments, the voltage can be increased from a minimum to a maximum in steps with a first step size outside the likely range and a second step size within the likely range, where the second step size is less than the first step size.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Although the operations of the method <b>200</b> are generally described in the context of increasing voltage through a test range, the methods can be performed equally well using increasing voltage or decreasing voltage.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">At <b>204</b>, current flowing through the power circuit is monitored as the voltage is changed. The current can be monitored using a current sensor coupled to a conduit delivering power from the power unit to the electrodes in the separator, or the current sensor can be coupled to a return conduit from the electrodes to the power unit. Current flow in either conduit indicates the fluid in the separator is consuming power from the electric field created by applying a time-varying voltage to the electrodes. The current sensors are operatively coupled to a controller, usually including or implemented in a digital processing system. The current sensors send signals to the controller representing the current detected. The controller receives the signals and converts them to digital values of current sensed in the power circuit.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">At <b>206</b>, the current sensed in the power circuit is analyzed by the controller to find an inflection point. Typically, current will increase with applied voltage. Thus, as the voltage applied to the electrodes in the separator increases, the current detected in the power circuit, as described above, increases. The rate of increase with voltage indicates how much power the fluid in the separator is consuming. If a change in voltage produces a small change in current, a low degree of power coupling to the fluid, and thus power consumption by the fluid, is indicated. If a change in voltage produces a large change in current, substantial power consumption by the fluid is indicated, which means the electric field is working to accelerate fluid separation in the separator. The controller can determine a rate of change of the current with the voltage, essentially a derivative of the process response to voltage, by computing a first difference between successive current readings and a second difference between the corresponding voltages, and then computing the ratio of the first difference to the second difference. In most cases, as the voltage applied to the electrodes is increased, this ratio will increase as the electric field couples to the fluid and does increasing work to accelerate separation of the fluid, up to a point. Beyond that point, the ratio declines. The inflection point is the point at which the ratio begins to decline after increasing.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">This point is also the point at which the second derivative of current with respect to voltage goes from positive to negative. To compute the second derivative, a third difference between successive ratios computed above can be computed, and a second ratio of the third difference to the first difference, between corresponding voltages, can be computed. The controller can be configured to determine whether, in two successive second ratios, one is above zero and the other is below zero. The inflection point can be found when one second ratio is above zero and a successive second ratio is below zero. The controller can also be configured to compare successive first ratios, and the inflection point can be found if a first ratio is lower than a preceding first ratio.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The controller can also be configured to eliminate or mitigate the effect of noise in the signals representing current and/or voltage. Any convenient method of mitigating noise can be used. For example, averaging successive values can be used to reduce noise. Successive values of sensor readings can be averaged. Successive values of ratios can also be averaged. Outlier data values can be statistically excluded or excluded by limits.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">At <b>208</b>, when the inflection point is identified, a voltage of the inflection point is identified. Any of the voltages used to identify the inflection point can be identified as the voltage of the inflection point. For example, if two first ratios are compared, a minimum among the four voltages used to define the first ratios can be identified as the voltage of the inflection point. Alternately, an average of the four voltages can be used. Noisy voltages can also be excluded from this calculation, as described above. The voltage identified with the inflection point is a favorable operating voltage for the separator because small changes to the voltage have a maximum impact on performance of the separator, as defined by the current response at the inflection point.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">At <b>210</b>, a separator operating window is defined based on the inflection point voltage. The separator operating window is defined by a minimum window voltage below the inflection point voltage and a maximum window voltage above the inflection point voltage. The minimum and maximum window voltage can be defined by a fixed distance from the inflection point voltage, for example &#xb1;3 kV from the inflection point voltage, and the fixed distance of the minimum window voltage can be different from the fixed distance of the maximum window voltage. For example, the minimum window voltage can be 3 kV below the inflection point voltage and the maximum window voltage can be 2 kV above the inflection point voltage. The minimum and maximum window voltages can also be defined to encompass a separator operating window that is a predetermined fraction of the operating window of the power unit. For example, if the power unit has an operating window of 10 kV to 60 kV, the minimum and maximum window voltages can be set to encompass 10% of the power unit operating window, which is a range of 5 kV in this case. In any case, the separator operating window can be defined such that the inflection point voltage is centered in the separator operating window, or the separator operating window can be offset such that the inflection point voltage is not centered in the separator operating window. For example, a lower range of the separator operating window between the minimum window voltage and the inflection point voltage can be larger than an upper range of the separator operating window between the maximum window voltage and the inflection point voltage. Alternately, the lower range can be smaller than the upper range. In this way, a separator operating window is defined that provides maximum effectiveness of voltage changes on separator performance.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In one embodiment, the voltage range may be defined by a range of voltages that produce a significant effect on current in the power circuit. The inflection point can be found as described above. A lower limit of the range can be defined by a voltage at which current deviates from a reference current value by a limit value. The reference current value can be predefined, or can be computed from a series of current readings, for example by averaging five readings, or any suitable number of readings. As voltage is increased, current will start to rise when the electric field begins coupling to the fluid in the vessel. When the current rises by a certain amount, as described above, that voltage can be defined as the lower limit. Likewise, an upper limit to the voltage window can be defined when current change drops below a limit, indicating that further increases in voltage have diminishing effect on the separation process.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic process diagram of a separation apparatus <b>300</b> according to another embodiment. The apparatus <b>300</b> is similar to the apparatus <b>100</b>, with the addition of a composition sensor <b>302</b> coupled to the lighter component outlet <b>16</b> and a second composition sensor <b>304</b> coupled to the heavier component outlet <b>14</b>. The composition sensors <b>302</b> and <b>304</b> send signals representing quality of the phase separation achieved in the apparatus <b>300</b>. The composition sensor <b>302</b> senses quantity of the heavier component in the lighter component outlet stream <b>16</b>, and the composition sensor <b>304</b> senses quantity of the lighter component in the heavier component outlet stream <b>14</b>. Each sensor may be electrical, optical, or density sensors. Electrical sensors may be capacitance or conductivity sensors. An optical sensor may be a haze sensor or a turbidity sensor. Density sensors are typically Coriolis type meters or piezoelectric sensors. The sensors are operatively coupled to the controller <b>112</b> to send signals to the controller representing the detected composition of the heavier and lighter component outlets <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In this case, the controller <b>112</b> is configured to practice methods that additionally analyze response of separation quality, as detected by the composition sensors <b>302</b> and <b>304</b>, to changing voltage, base frequency, and modulation frequency. The controller <b>112</b> is configured to automatically activate seek algorithms that adjust the parameters according to any convenient pattern, either within an operating window or seeking a new operating window, to find efficient and effective operating windows for the separation apparatus <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Generally the methods described herein, implemented using the apparatus <b>100</b> or <b>300</b>, find the voltage window that where process response to changing voltage is maximum. Such voltage window provides maximum control over separation quality achieved by the electrical separator. Additionally, some methods described herein also find process windows for base frequency and/or modulation frequency that minimize power usage for maximum energy efficiency. When a voltage window is found that maximizes process response, base frequency is varied to find a minimum current, and then modulate frequency is also varied to find a minimum current. Operating windows can be established around these parameters. Finally, voltage, base frequency, and modulation frequency can be varied within the established process windows to improve separation quality as detected by the composition detectors.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a flow diagram summarizing a method <b>400</b> according to another embodiment. The method <b>400</b> is a method of operating an electrical separation apparatus such as the apparatus <b>100</b> or <b>300</b>. At <b>402</b>, an operating window is defined for voltage using the method <b>200</b>. At <b>404</b>, the base frequency of the time-varying voltage applied to the electrodes is changed. The change may be an increase in frequency or a decrease in frequency. The magnitude of the change may be predetermined, or may be random. The magnitude of the change may be selected to have an effect that is at least measurable. The magnitude of the change may be randomly chosen within a predetermined range, such as &#xb1;10%.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">At <b>406</b>, a change in current is detected. The change is validated as an effect of the change in base frequency. A threshold may be applied such that any change below the threshold is not identified as a change resulting from the change of base frequency. Noise in the current data may be compensated in any useful way. If no change meeting predefined criteria is detected, the change in base frequency may be repeated or increased.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">At <b>408</b>, a condition of the detected change in current is tested. If the current is found to increase as a result of the base frequency change, the base frequency change is reversed. Operation <b>404</b> is then repeated using a base frequency change opposite in sign from the prior change. For example, if the prior change in base frequency was an increase, and current was observed to increase, the increase is reversed and then the base frequency is decreased. An objective of the method <b>400</b> is to find a frequency that minimizes current flowing in the power circuit, and thus minimize energy consumption. Thus, the operations <b>404</b> and <b>406</b> are practiced until a direction of base frequency changes that decrease current flow is defined.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Operations <b>404</b>, <b>406</b> and <b>408</b> are repeated until no further decrease in current is observed after a number of base frequency changes. For example, if after three base frequency changes, or after three base frequency changes both upward and downward, no decrease in current is found, a base frequency operating window is established at <b>410</b>. The last base frequency set in operation <b>404</b> can be used as the basis for defining the base frequency operating window, which can be defined as a range above and below the final base frequency. The range can be defined as a fraction of the operable frequency range of the power unit, or may be a magnitude based on the final base frequency. The final base frequency may be centered with the operating window, or not centered.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">At <b>412</b>, modulation frequency is changed in a manner similar to how base frequency was changed. At <b>414</b>, if current is observed to increase as a result of the modulation frequency change, the change is reversed, as was done with the base frequency to define a direction of modulation frequency changes that reduce current flow. Operations <b>412</b> and <b>414</b> are repeated until an increase in current flow is detected. When no change results in a decrease in current, a modulation frequency operating window is defined encompassing the final modulation frequency. In this way, the method <b>400</b> defines operating windows for voltage, base frequency, and modulation frequency that results in maximum separation effectiveness and efficiency by determining a voltage process window that maximizes effect on separation performance, and by determining base frequency and modulation frequency ranges that minimize current in the power circuit, and therefore energy consumption.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a flow diagram summarizing a method <b>500</b>, according to another embodiment. The method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a method of improving separation performance of an electrical separator such as the separation apparatus <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. At <b>502</b>, a voltage operating window is defined for the electrical separator, using for example the method <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. At <b>504</b>, after achieving substantially steady operation in the voltage operating window, change the voltage applied to the power unit. The change is of magnitude selected to produce an observable change in separation performance. The change can be an increase or a decrease in voltage, but is within the voltage operating window.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">At <b>506</b>, the separator effluent is analyzed to detect whether the change in voltage produced a change in separation performance. Either effluent stream, the less dense stream or the more dense stream, or both, can be analyzed. A sensor, such as any of the sensors described above, can be used to detect a composition change, or samples can be taken for direct analysis. A wait time is typically imposed before determining that a change in effluent composition is an effect of a voltage change. Typically, at least one residence time, and sometimes two or three residence times, of the separator vessel are used as a wait time.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Once a change has been detected, as a result of the voltage change, a determination is made at <b>508</b> whether the separation performance has improved or degraded. If no change is detected, the voltage change of <b>504</b> can be increased to observe an effect. If the detected change is a degradation of separation performance, the voltage change is reversed to cancel the deleterious effect of the prior change. Then, a similar voltage change can be made in the opposite direction, expecting improvement in separation performance. The operations <b>504</b>, <b>506</b>, and <b>508</b> can be repeated as desired to seek a voltage that results in the most improvement in separation performance.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">At <b>510</b>, a similar process can then be followed to find a base frequency of the time-varying voltage that improves separation performance the most. A change is made in base frequency applied to the power unit. The change is again selected to result in an observable change in separation performance. A wait time is imposed for the change to propagate through the vessel. Then, at <b>512</b>, a change is detected in effluent stream composition, as described above in connection with operation <b>506</b>. At <b>514</b>, if the change in effluent stream composition is negative, meaning separation performance has degraded, the change can be reversed, and a change to base frequency in the opposite direction applied at operation <b>510</b>. The operations <b>510</b>, <b>512</b>, and <b>514</b> can be repeated as desired to seek a base frequency that results in the most improvement to separation performance.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">At <b>516</b>, a similar process is followed to find a modulation frequency that improves separation performance the most. Modulation frequency is changed and a change in separator effluent composition is detected, similar to the operations above. At <b>518</b>, if the change in separator effluent composition is deleterious, the change to modulation frequency can be reversed and a similar change made in the opposite direction at <b>516</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The method <b>500</b> can be automatically implemented by a controller. The controller can be configured to perform the method <b>500</b> at a scheduled time, or after a certain duration since the last time the method <b>500</b> was performed, and can be configured to begin the method <b>500</b> only if the separator is in steady operation. The various change sizes and wait times can be configured as constants, or may be configured to depend on process parameters such as flow rate, temperature, or feed composition. The controller can be configured to start the changes in the upward direction or the downward direction.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The controller can also be configured to perform one change to voltage that results in positive change to separator effluent, followed by one change to base frequency and one change to modulation frequency, and then repeat the process until one of voltage, base frequency, or modulation frequency does not result in a positive change. Then, the method <b>500</b> can be repeated with single changes, omitting the parameter that did not result in improvement until a second parameter, and then finally the third parameter, reaches a point where no further improvement is detected.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Alternately, the controller can be configured to perform the method <b>500</b> by repeating the voltage change process until voltage changes no longer improve performance, and then moving to base frequency changes until no further improvement is observed, and finally moving to modulation frequency until no further improvement is observed. The controller can also be configured to perform the method <b>500</b> to completion twice, the first instance being performed by making single positive changes to voltage, base frequency, and modulation frequency in turn, and the second instance being performed by changing voltage until no further improvement is observed, changing base frequency until no further improvement is observed, and then changing modulation frequency until no further improvement is observed.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">When composition of both effluent streams from the separator is detected, a change in composition can be registered when a significant change is detected in one effluent stream, or in both effluent streams. A detected change in composition of the less dense stream or the more dense stream can define a composition change for purposes of the methods <b>400</b> and <b>500</b>. Alternately, a detected change in composition of only one stream can be ignored until such time as a change in both effluent streams is detected.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">As noted above, determining that a significant change has occurred may be based on magnitude of the change or based on reaching a limit. For example, readings may be analyzed to compute a magnitude of the change, and the computed magnitude compared to a standard to determine whether the change is significant. The magnitude can be computed by computing a reference value before the process change, analyzing a short-term trend, such as five, or any suitable number, of consecutive readings, to determine whether a new steady state has been reached, determining a new value from the steady state, and the computing a difference between the reference value and the new value. In another method, a significant change can be registered if, after the wait time has elapsed, any single reading exceeds a limit, such as a deviation from a reference value before the process change. The reference value can be an average of readings, or may be the last single reading prior to the process change. The deviation may be predetermined, or may be based on process conditions, for example a percentage change.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">For separators like the separation apparatus <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, with both current sensors and composition sensors, current and composition readings can be defined to determine that a significant change has occurred. For example, if current, low density effluent composition, and high density effluent composition are all detected, a significant change can be registered when a significant change is detected in one, two, or all three parameters. Alternately, a significant change can be registered when current, along with one effluent composition, exhibits significant change. Alternately, a significant change can be registered when both effluent streams register a significant change, where the current reading has not changed significantly.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">During performance of any of the tuning methods described herein, a controller can be configured to abort the tuning method if any sensor registers a reading that is outside a tolerance range. The controller can be configured to reset power unit parameters to the last known settings that produced good sensor readings if a process excursion is registered during tuning. The controller can also be configured to resume the tuning method at the point of the process excursion, at the stage of the tuning method where the controller aborted the method, when the sensor readings indicate the excursion has abated.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In some cases, the controller may be configured to increase frequency of sensor readings when a tuning method is commenced. For example, during steady operation, sampling of current and/or composition may be set by the controller at a first sampling frequency, and when a tuning method is started, sampling of current and/or composition may be increased to a second sampling frequency higher than the first sampling frequency. More frequent sampling can help efficiently find process windows that improve separation performance.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">While the foregoing is directed to embodiments of the present invention, other and further embodiments of the present disclosure may be devised without departing from the basic scope thereof, and the scope thereof is determined by the claims that follow.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
