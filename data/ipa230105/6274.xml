First, the battery module <b>100</b> includes at least one cell module assembly (CMA) having a plurality of battery cells received in an individual housing <b>110</b> and module plates <b>120</b> configured to cover the front and the rear of the cell module assembly, at which electrode leads protrude from the battery cells in the cell module assembly. In addition, the battery module <b>100</b> further includes a busbar unit <b>130</b> provided between the cell module assembly and each of the module plates, the busbar unit being configured to electrically connect the electrode leads to each other. Also, in the battery module <b>100</b>, a space portion <b>140</b> is formed between adjacent individual housings <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Each of the battery cells used in the battery module <b>100</b> according to the present invention may be constituted by a secondary battery. Based on the kind and shape of a sheathing member, the secondary battery may be generally classified as a pouch-shaped secondary battery, a cylindrical secondary battery, or a prismatic secondary battery. Preferably, a pouch-shaped secondary battery may be used as the battery cell according to the present invention.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The pouch-shaped secondary battery may include an electrode assembly, a battery case configured to receive the electrode assembly, and a pair of electrode leads protruding forwards and rearwards from the battery case.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The individual housing <b>110</b> will be described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. The individual housing <b>110</b> includes an upper plate <b>111</b>, a lower plate <b>112</b>, and side plates <b>113</b> located at the upper part, the lower part, and the side surfaces of the cell module assembly, respectively. Each of the plates <b>111</b>, <b>112</b>, and <b>113</b> is provided with a fastening portion <b>114</b> for coupling with the other plates. Fastening between the plates <b>111</b>, <b>112</b>, and <b>113</b> is achieved through the fastening portions <b>114</b>. Any of various conventional methods, such as mechanical fastening using bolts or welding, may be used as a fastening method.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Also, in the battery module <b>100</b> according to the present invention, the fastening portions <b>114</b> formed at the side plates <b>113</b> of adjacent individual housings <b>110</b> so as to correspond to each other are fastened to each other using the mechanical fastening or welding method, whereby the individual housings <b>110</b> are connected to each other. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the space portion <b>140</b> is formed between the side plates of the individual housings <b>110</b> connected to each other, as described above. The space portion itself may serve to inhibit heat transfer between the individual housings <b>110</b>.

A distal end portion <b>113</b><i>a </i>of each of the side plates <b>113</b> configured to abut a corresponding one of the upper plate <b>111</b> and the lower plate <b>112</b> at the time of fastening is bent so as to overlap a distal end portion of the corresponding one of the upper plate <b>111</b> and the lower plate <b>112</b>, whereby sealability of the individual housing <b>110</b> after fastening is improved. In the case in which venting gas is generated from one or more battery cells in a specific cell module assembly, therefore, it is possible to guide the venting gas to the front and the rear of the individual housing <b>110</b>, at which the plates <b>111</b>, <b>112</b>, and <b>113</b> are not located, since sealability of the individual housing <b>110</b> is improved, as described above. As a result, even though venting gas is generated in a specific cell module assembly, a cell module assembly adjacent thereto is not affected, whereby it is possible to improve reliability of the battery module.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Meanwhile, the module plate <b>120</b> will be described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. The module plate <b>120</b> includes an assembly portion <b>121</b> for assembly with the individual housing <b>110</b> and a venting portion <b>122</b> configured to discharge venting gas, and has a size that covers the entire front and the entire rear of the cell module assemblies located in the battery module. The module plate <b>120</b> and the individual housing <b>110</b> may be assembled by mechanical coupling between the assembly portion <b>121</b> of the module plate <b>120</b> and the fastening portion <b>114</b> of the individual housing <b>110</b> using bolts. The module plate <b>120</b>, assembled as described above, may also serve to additionally fix the individual housings <b>110</b>. Since assembly is achieved by mechanical coupling, rather than welding, it is possible to prevent the battery cells in the cell module assembly from being damaged by heat generated at the time of welding. Furthermore, even in the case in which a specific cell module assembly malfunctions, the module plate <b>120</b> may be easily separated from the individual housing coupled thereto in order to repair or remove the defective cell module assembly.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The busbar unit <b>130</b> will be described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. The busbar unit <b>130</b> includes a busbar body <b>131</b> and a busbar frame <b>132</b>.
