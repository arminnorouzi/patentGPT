Indeed, TAVR may become the preferred therapy for all patients irrespective of surgical risk. However, transcatheter heart valves (TVH) may fail in the future and repeat intervention may be required. So-called redo-transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) or TAVR may lead to risks of coronary obstruction due to the leaflet of the failed THV being pushed up by the new THV and leading to obstruction of blood flow to the coronary arteries.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">TAVR in failed surgical bioprostheses is common. However, TAVR in failed transcatheter bioprostheses (i.e. transcatheter heart valve-in-transcatheter heart valve) will also become increasingly common. In both situations there is a risk of coronary obstruction. The risk of coronary obstruction can be predicted with the use of cardiac computed tomography. If the predicted risk of coronary occlusion is high, then percutaneous valve-in-valve intervention may be prohibitive. In some cases, the cause of the coronary obstruction is related to the leaflets of the failed surgical or transcatheter heart valve that are pushed up and prevent flow of blood to the coronary arteries. To overcome this challenge, one approach is implementing the bioprosthetic aortic scallop intentional laceration to prevent iatrogenic coronary artery obstruction procedure, or &#x201c;BASILICA.&#x201d; The BASILICA procedure uses catheter electrosurgery to split the offending bioprosthetic leaflet, creating a triangular space that facilitates blood flow to the coronary artery. The BASILICA technique relies on electrification of a wire. This technique is complex with prolonged procedure times, often taking several hours versus the 20-30 mins. for a standard transfemoral valve in valve procedure. The BASILICA technique also requires a number of steps in order to achieve successful splitting of the valve leaflet. Currently only a few specialized centers perform the BASILICA procedure and it is unlikely to become a routine due to its complexity.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">There is a need for improved systems, devices and procedures for leaflet laceration in failed transcatheter heart valves.

The inner catheter may be sized and configured to slide within the first channel with the distal end <b>29</b> configured to exit through the port. The catheter assembly also includes a cutting assembly configured to move within the second channel. The cutting assembly has a cutting element that is configured to lacerate a leaflet. The cutting assembly is configured to transition from a retracted configuration, where the cutting element is contained within the second channel, into an extended configuration, where the cutting element extends out of the distal end <b>29</b> of the inner catheter to facilitate laceration of a leaflet.

Such embodiment as described herein simplify the process of aortic leaflet laceration. In an embodiment, a catheter assembly may be used to achieve bioprosthetic valve laceration. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, an implanted valve V may be implanted in an aorta A. The valve V may include a F and typically three leaflets L that form the valve structure. The valve V is typically positioned proximate a coronary ostia O<b>1</b>,O<b>2</b>. However, the frame F may or may not obstruct the coronary ostia O<b>1</b>,O<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>4</b></figref>, the catheter assembly <b>10</b> may include a catheter <b>20</b> and cutting assembly <b>40</b>. One or more actuators (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A, <b>11</b>B</figref>) may be included to control operation of the catheter assembly <b>10</b>. The cutting assembly <b>40</b> may be part of the catheter <b>20</b> or it may be a separate component that is inserted through the catheter <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Continuing with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>4</b></figref>, the catheter <b>20</b> may include a hub <b>22</b> at its proximal end <b>23</b> and an elongated body <b>25</b> coupled to the hub <b>22</b>. The elongated body <b>25</b> includes a shaft portion, a secondary curve, a primary curve, one or more radiopaque markers R, and a distal tip <b>28</b>. The primary and secondary curves are not illustrated in the drawings. The distal tip <b>28</b> defines the distal end <b>29</b> of the catheter <b>20</b>. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the catheter <b>20</b> includes an inner channel <b>24</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) that extends from the proximal end <b>23</b> to the distal end <b>29</b> of the elongated body <b>25</b>. The inner channel <b>24</b> is sized to contain or receive therethrough all or portions of the cutting assembly <b>40</b>. The inner channel <b>24</b> is also sized to receive other surgical devices therethrough. For example, the catheter <b>20</b> can receive a guidewire such that an over-the-wire technique may be used. In cross-section, catheter <b>20</b> may include an inner liner, a middle reinforcing layer (e.g. a braid), and an outer layer or outer jacket. In another embodiment, the catheter <b>20</b> would also be able to accommodate different shaped inner catheters to achieve a suitable relationship of the distal catheter tip <b>28</b> to the leaflet. For example, this configuration may provide for functionality similar to the use of a 5 F/6 F 120 mm IM catheter inside an AL type catheter, i.e. a mother and daughter technique. The catheter <b>20</b> may be configured to transition in response to operator input to assume different degrees of flexion of the distal tip <b>28</b> to account for different patient anatomy.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The longitudinal shape of the catheter can vary as needed. For instance, the catheter <b>20</b> can have a shape according to the Amplatz Guide that includes, but is not limited to AL-1, AL-2, AL-3, AL-4, etc. Other common shapes are possible as well. In one example, the catheter may have an outer cross-sectional dimension sized for insertion into the aorta. For instance, the catheter may be either 7 French or 8 French, e.g. between 1.98 mm and 2.30 mm inner diameter. However, larger or smaller sized catheters may be used in certain instances. The catheter tip <b>28</b> may be deflectable or bendable as needed. The catheter <b>20</b> may also be configured to accommodate different shaped inner catheters.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>6</b></figref>, the distal end <b>29</b> of the catheter <b>20</b> is configured to permit positioning of the distal tip <b>28</b> proximate to and in contact with the base B of the valve leaflet L (base and leaflet not shown). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the catheter <b>20</b> may include a plurality of positioning elements <b>26</b><i>a, </i><b>26</b><i>b </i>that extend outwardly with respect to the elongated body <b>25</b> of the catheter <b>20</b>. The positioning elements <b>26</b><i>a, </i><b>26</b><i>b </i>may be flexible wires that are configured to expand outwardly upon actuation. Alternatively, the positioning elements <b>26</b><i>a, </i><b>26</b><i>b </i>have a natural state that extends outwardly as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, and a compressed state whereby the positioning members are compressed against the outer surface of the catheter <b>20</b> (not shown). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref> illustrate alternative embodiments of positioning elements. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates an alternative catheter <b>20</b> with curved positioning elements <b>126</b><i>a, </i><b>126</b><i>b </i>that curve away from the elongated body <b>25</b>. Terminal ends <b>132</b><i>a, </i><b>132</b><i>b </i>of each element <b>126</b><i>a, </i><b>126</b><i>b </i>are spaced away from the body <b>25</b> of the catheter <b>20</b> such that the concave sides of each positioning element face a proximal direction P. The proximal direction P is generally in a direction toward the user and a distal direction D is generally in a direction toward the distal end <b>29</b>. Each curved positioning element <b>126</b><i>a, </i><b>126</b><i>b </i>is configured to guide the catheter <b>20</b> in position in the aorta. In another example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, an alternative catheter <b>20</b> has angled positioning elements <b>226</b><i>a, </i><b>226</b><i>b </i>that project away from elongated body <b>25</b> of catheter in angled orientation. Terminal ends <b>232</b><i>a, </i><b>232</b><i>b </i>of each element <b>226</b><i>a, </i><b>226</b><i>b </i>are spaced away from the distal tip <b>28</b> and guide the catheter <b>20</b> in position. In each embodiment described herein, the positioning elements <b>226</b><i>a, </i><b>226</b><i>b </i>help orientate the catheter to the base of the leaflet. The positioning elements may also help allow anchoring and positioning of the catheter when leaflet puncture is being performed. Additionally, one embodiment would be configured to allow the catheter to orientate down to the base of the cusp so that the base of the leaflet can be lacerated. Furthermore, another embodiment would be deployable anchors that also would allow orientation to the base of the leaflet.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref>, the cutting assembly <b>40</b> includes a cutting element <b>60</b> configured to lacerate the valve. The cutting element <b>60</b> include a sharp tip <b>62</b> and a cutting edge <b>64</b> that extends from the sharp tip <b>62</b> in a proximal direction P. The sharp tip <b>62</b> of the cutting element <b>60</b> is configured to puncture the base B of the bioprosthetic leaflet L. The cutting element <b>60</b> may also include a flexible cutting body <b>66</b> that defines the sharp tip <b>62</b> and the cutting edge <b>64</b>. The flexible cutting body <b>66</b> is configured to transition into a curved shape, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, to lacerate the valve leaflet. In one example, in the curved shape, the flexible cutting body <b>66</b> curves about an axis A<b>2</b> that is perpendicular to an axis A<b>1</b> of the cutting element <b>60</b>. In this manner, the curve configuration helps minimize damage to the valve or other tissue during laceration. In alternative embodiments, the cutting element may comprise multiple components to facilitate transition of the cutting element <b>60</b> into a curved shape during use. The curved configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> may be referred to as pigtail configuration. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates cutting element <b>60</b> curved toward the proximal direction P. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the distal tip <b>62</b> of the cutting element <b>60</b> is not curved toward itself, unlike that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In one example, the catheter <b>20</b> includes at least one actuator <b>30</b> (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A and <b>11</b>B</figref>) coupled to the cutting element <b>60</b>. In such an example, the actuator <b>30</b> is configured to transition the cutting assembly <b>40</b> through: 1) a first actuation phase where the cutting assembly <b>40</b> transitions from a retracted configuration into an extended linear configuration wherein the cutting element <b>60</b> projects from the distal end <b>29</b> of the elongated body <b>25</b>; 2) a second actuation phase where the flexible cutting body <b>25</b> transitions from the extended linear configuration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>), where the distal tip <b>62</b> is positioned to puncture the valve leaflet, into the curved configuration, where the cutting edge <b>64</b> is curved into the curved shape (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref>); and 3) a third actuation phase where the cutting element <b>60</b> is configured to transition from the curved configuration back into the retracted configuration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). Accordingly, the cutting element <b>60</b> in the curved configuration allows the operator to pull the catheter in an antegrade direction relative to the flow of blood and permit the cutting edge <b>64</b> to lacerate the leaflet. When the laceration is complete, the cutting element <b>60</b> can transition back into the retracted configuration and the catheter <b>20</b> can be removed or other devices can be used to access the coronary artery as needed.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-<b>10</b>C</figref>, an alternative embodiment of a cutting element <b>360</b> is illustrated. In accordance with the illustrated embodiment, the catheter assembly <b>340</b> and/or the catheter <b>20</b> includes one or more positioning elements <b>326</b><i>a, </i><b>326</b><i>b </i>which extend outward from the catheter <b>20</b>, a cutting element <b>360</b>, and one or more actuators <b>330</b> to control operation of the positioning elements <b>326</b><i>a, </i><b>326</b><i>b </i>and the cutting element <b>360</b>. The positioning elements <b>326</b><i>a, </i><b>326</b><i>b </i>can extend out from elongated slots <b>334</b> in the catheter body <b>25</b> and are actuated by one or more actuators <b>330</b> proximate the handle (not shown). The positioning elements <b>326</b><i>a, </i><b>326</b><i>b </i>may be formed from nitinol wires as needed. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>C</figref>, the cutting element <b>360</b> includes a shaft <b>366</b>, a distal tip <b>362</b> or apex at the end of the shaft <b>366</b>, and an angled leg <b>368</b> that extends generally in an angular direction relative to the shaft <b>366</b>. The leg <b>368</b> and shaft <b>366</b> define an angle &#x3d5;. Angle &#x3d5; may be range between 30 degrees and 60 degrees. In one example, angle &#x3d5; is about 45 degrees. The cutting element <b>360</b> may include a first sharped region <b>370</b> defined at the apex <b>362</b> and a second sharpened region <b>372</b> is defined inside the apex where the shaft <b>366</b> and leg <b>368</b> meet. The second sharpened region <b>372</b> is configured to lacerate the leaflet when the catheter assembly <b>340</b> is pulled antegrade relative to the flow of blood. In some instances, antegrade relative to the flow of blood may be the same as a proximal direction P (relative to the instrument). The cutting element <b>360</b> may be referred to as a cutting blade with a sharp outer region and inner region. In addition, the cutting element <b>360</b> may include a guard element that covers the first outer region to prevent any further damage to surrounding structures. In another embodiment, the cutting element would be able to be delivered through any standard <b>7</b>F guiding catheter, e.g. Pachyderm.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In any particular embodiment of the catheter assembly described herein, the cutting elements and the catheter can be locked together, so that when the leaflet is punctured, the relationship between the catheter and cutting element can be maintained and the operator can pull both to achieve laceration of the leaflet. In such an example, the catheter and/or cutting assembly include a locking element that locks the components together as needed. The locking element may be activated or deactivated as needed.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>-<b>16</b></figref>, in use, the catheter may be inserted trans-femoral or radially and advanced so that its distal end <b>29</b> approaches the aorta A. More specifically, the distal end <b>29</b> of the catheter <b>20</b> is advanced until the distal end <b>29</b> is positioned at the base B of the surgical valve leaflets L. The positioning of the distal end <b>29</b> of the catheter <b>20</b> may be accomplished using standard techniques and fluoroscopic imaging and/or transesophageal imaging. Once the catheter <b>20</b> is positioned in the base of the bioprosthetic leaflet, the cutting element <b>60</b> may be deployed. Many different cutting elements and configurations may be used, as explained herein. For example, any cutting element described herein and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>-<b>16</b></figref> may be used. For ease of illustration, only the cutting element is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>-<b>16</b></figref> which illustrate the method of use. The use of the catheter assembly is not limited strictly to what is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>-<b>16</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Continuing with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>-<b>16</b></figref>, the cutting element <b>60</b>, and in particular its sharp tip <b>62</b>, may be advanced out of the distal end <b>29</b> of the catheter <b>20</b> and can be used to puncture through the bioprosthetic valve leaflet. Once the cutting element <b>60</b> has perforated through the leaflet, the cutting element <b>60</b> can transition into a curved shape, e.g. a pigtail, to prevent damage to the surrounding structure. The inner portion of the cutting element, for instance the cutting edge <b>64</b>, is configured and positioned to lacerate the leaflet. The cutting edge <b>64</b> and pigtail tip <b>66</b> of the cutting element <b>60</b> may be locked into position for laceration of the leaflet. When the catheter <b>20</b> is retracted by the operator, the leaflet may be lacerated from the base to the free edge by the cutting element <b>60</b>, ideally in the middle of the bioprosthetic leaflet creating two equal remaining portions. Once laceration is completed, the cutting element <b>60</b> can be withdrawn back into the catheter <b>20</b> and the catheter <b>20</b> can be removed from the body <b>25</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">An alternative embodiment of a catheter assembly <b>40</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>-<b>31</b></figref>.

The inner catheter <b>480</b> may be referred to as an inner tube or inner tubular member. The inner catheter <b>480</b> may be sized and configured to slide within the first channel <b>428</b> with the distal end <b>482</b> configured to exit through the port <b>438</b>. In an embodiment, the inner catheter <b>480</b> would have a deflectable distal end <b>482</b> that would be controlled from the proximal end <b>422</b> of the catheter assembly <b>410</b>. The inner catheter <b>480</b> will be able to deflect into different shapes to allow passage through the cell of a transcatheter heart valve. The inner catheter <b>480</b> may have different shapes to allow its optimal position proximate the base of the transcatheter heart valve leaflet.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The catheter assembly <b>410</b> also includes a cutting assembly <b>440</b> configured move within the second channel <b>486</b> (not shown). The cutting assembly <b>440</b> includes the cutting element <b>460</b> described herein. More specifically, the cutting assembly <b>440</b> is configured to transition from a retracted configuration, where the cutting element <b>460</b> is contained within the second channel <b>486</b>, into an extended configuration, where the cutting element <b>460</b> extends out of the distal end of the inner catheter <b>480</b> to facilitate laceration of a leaflet.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In an embodiment, the catheter assembly <b>440</b> may include at least one actuator <b>430</b> coupled to the cutting element <b>460</b>. The actuator <b>430</b> is configured to cause the cutting assembly <b>440</b> to transition from the retracted configuration into the extended configuration.

In an alternative example, however, the cutting element can be electrified.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In an embodiment, the cutting element <b>460</b> has a shaft <b>466</b>, a distal tip <b>462</b>, and an angled leg <b>468</b> that extends from and is angled relative to the shaft <b>466</b>. The cutting element <b>460</b> has a first sharp region <b>470</b> defined along the tip <b>462</b> and a second sharp region <b>472</b> is defined where the shaft <b>466</b> and the leg <b>468</b> intersect. The first sharp region <b>470</b> is configured to pierce a leaflet and the second sharp region <b>472</b> is configured to lacerate the leaflet. The cutting element <b>460</b>is separate from the inner catheter but insertable through the second inner channel <b>486</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In an embodiment, the catheter assembly <b>440</b> may include an engagement assembly. The engagement assembly may include at least one engagement member <b>510</b>, <b>610</b> configured to couple the outer catheter <b>420</b> to a frame F of a heart valve V. As illustrated, the engagement assembly has a first engagement member <b>510</b> and a second engagement member <b>610</b> each configured to couple to the frame of the heart valve. The engagement members <b>510</b>, <b>610</b> may be formed from nitinol. The engagement members <b>510</b>, <b>610</b> may be coupled to the outer catheter at or near its distal end <b>29</b>. The engagement members <b>510</b>, <b>610</b> are configured to transition from an insertion configuration, which is generally a collapsed shape, into the engagement configuration, which has an expanded shaped. In the engagement configuration, the engagement members <b>510</b>, <b>610</b> are deployed into a generally circular shape along a plane that is perpendicular to an axis of the outer catheter. The engagement members <b>510</b>, <b>610</b> can be retracted or collapsed when within the outer catheter. When the engagement members <b>510</b>, <b>610</b> are deployed, they transition into a trumpet like shape that has an inner channel through which various devices can pass through.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The engagement members <b>510</b>, <b>610</b> may have a differential distribution allowing more layers of material forming the member at the distal edges. This mass distribution described herein allows for differential strength at the engagement members. In an embodiment the engagement members <b>510</b>, <b>610</b> may be composed of nitinol. In another embodiment the engagement members <b>510</b>, <b>610</b> may be a laser cut metal that will be able to be deployed at the distal edge of the outer catheter.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In an embodiment, a catheter assembly <b>410</b> may be used to lacerate a leaflet of a heart valve, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b>-<b>31</b></figref>. In an exemplary method, the catheter assembly <b>410</b> is advanced to the aortic root and positioned adjacent to the transcatheter heart valve frame above the desired leaflet L. In on example, the engagement member <b>610</b> is deployed just proximal to the distal end <b>429</b> of the catheter and adjacent to the inner part of the transcatheter heart valve frame. This will allow the operator to push forward and use the frame as support when advancing the inner catheter <b>480</b>. An inner catheter <b>480</b> will be advanced from a port <b>438</b> of the outer catheter <b>420</b>. When the inner catheter <b>480</b> is at the desired position, the cutting element <b>460</b> is advanced from a retraction configuration into an extended configuration in order to puncture through the leaflet L. Once the leaflet L is punctured the operator will then pull the entire catheter assembly in a proximal direction to lacerate the leaflet.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>29</b>-<b>31</b></figref>, it can be seen that initially, the cutting element <b>460</b> is generally disposed within the inner catheter <b>480</b> in the retracted configuration but is configured to move independently from and relative to the inner catheter <b>480</b>. For instance, the operator will engage the surface of a leaflet with the inner catheter <b>480</b>. The inner catheter <b>480</b> may be spring loaded so that it will move independent of the cutting element <b>460</b> as the inner catheter <b>480</b> pushes forward against the leaflet. As the operator pushes forward, the cutting element <b>460</b> can pierce the leaflet, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b></figref>. The inner catheter <b>480</b>, however, will remain in the same position as the cutting element <b>460</b> advances through the leaflet L. At this point, the user can retract the assembly to lacerate the leaflet as described above.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">While the disclosure is described herein, using a limited number of embodiments, these specific embodiments are not intended to limit the scope of the disclosure as otherwise described and claimed herein.
