More particularly, the present disclosure relates to methods and systems for interventional catheters such as for carotid artery stenting to treat carotid artery disease.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Carotid artery disease usually consists of deposits of plaque which narrow the internal carotid artery ICA at or near the junction between the common carotid artery and the internal carotid artery. These deposits increase the risk of embolic particles being generated and entering the cerebral vasculature, leading to neurologic consequences such as transient ischemic attacks TIA, ischemic stroke, or death. In addition, should such narrowings become severe, blood flow to the brain is inhibited with serious and sometimes fatal consequences.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Two principal therapies are employed for treating carotid artery disease. The first is carotid endarterectomy CEA, an open surgical procedure which relies on clamping the common, internal and external carotid arteries, surgically opening the carotid artery at the site of the disease (usually the carotid bifurcation where the common carotid artery divides into the internal carotid artery and external carotid artery), dissecting away and removing the plaque, and then closing the carotid artery with a suture. The risk of emboli release into the internal and external arteries is minimized. During the procedure while the artery is opened, all the carotid artery branches are clamped so particles are unable to enter the vasculature. The arteries are debrided and vigorously flushed before closing the vessels and restoring blood flow. Because the clinical consequence of emboli release into the external carotid artery is less significant, the common carotid and external carotid arteries are usually unclamped first, so that any embolic particles which remain in the bifurcation or in the common carotid artery are flushed from the common carotid artery into the external carotid artery. As a last step, the internal carotid artery clamp is opened to restore arterial flow throughout the carotid circulation.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The second procedure, carotid artery stenting CAS, relies on deployment and expansion of a metallic stent across the carotid artery stenosis, typically at or across the branch from the common carotid artery into the internal carotid artery, or entirely in the internal carotid artery, depending on the position of the disease. Usually, a self-expanding stent is introduced through a percutaneous puncture into the femoral artery in the groin and up the aortic arch into the target common carotid artery. If deemed necessary, a balloon dilatation of the stenosis is performed before the stent is inserted, to open the lesion and facilitate the placement of the stent delivery catheter and of other devices. In the majority of instances, a balloon dilatation is performed on the stenosis after the stent is placed, to optimize the luminal diameter of the stented segment. Usually, a guide wire remains in place across the stenosis during the entire intervention of the stenosis to facilitate the exchange of the various devices for pre-dilatation, stent delivery, and post-dilatation. The guide wire remains in place until a final angiogram confirms an acceptable outcome.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In carotid stenting procedures, adjunct embolic protection devices are usually used to at least partially alleviate the risk of emboli. The primary category of embolic protection devices is distal filters. These filters are positioned in the internal carotid artery distal to the region of stenting. The filter is intended to capture the embolic particles to prevent passage into the cerebral vasculature. Such filtering devices, however, carry certain limitations. They must be advanced to the target vessel and cross the stenosis prior to deployment, which exposes the cerebral vascular to embolic showers; they are not always easy to advance, deploy, and remove through a tight stenosis and/or a severely angulated vasculature; and finally, they only filter particles larger than the filter pore size, typically 100 to 120 &#x3bc;m. There is also concern that these devices do not filter 100% of the flow, especially around their perimeter, and furthermore there is a risk of debris escape during filter retrieval.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Alternative methods for reducing embolic risk during CAS procedures have been proposed utilizing the concept of stopping or reversing the flow into the internal carotid artery to prevent embolic debris entering the cerebral vasculature. In a static flow method proposed by Reimers and Coppi, the common carotid artery and external carotid artery are occluded during the intervention using a dual balloon cannula inserted transfemorally to the target carotid artery. The distal balloon is positioned in the external carotid artery and the proximal balloon is positioned in the common carotid artery. An opening in the cannula between the balloons is used to deliver the interventional devices into the target internal carotid artery. During periods of the intervention and at the end of the intervention prior to establishing forward flow in the internal carotid artery, aspiration is performed between the two balloons to remove embolic debris.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In reverse flow protocols, the arterial access cannula is connected to a venous cannula or to a low pressure external receptacle in order to establish a reverse or retrograde flow from the internal carotid artery through the arterial cannula and away from the cerebral vasculature. A reverse flow protocol has been proposed by Parodi using a percutaneous, transfemoral approach. Flow in the common carotid artery is occluded, typically by inflating a balloon on the distal tip of the cannula. Flow into the external carotid artery may also be occluded, typically using a balloon catheter introduced through the cannula. After such reverse or retrograde flow is established, the stenting procedure may be performed with a greatly reduced risk of emboli entering the cerebral vasculature. An alternate reverse flow protocol utilizing a surgical, transcervical approach has been proposed by Criado and Chang. Such an approach eliminates complications associated with gaining transfemoral endovascular access to the common carotid artery, and allows the possibility of much shorter and potentially larger profile interventional devices. In addition, the shorter length reduces the flow resistance and thus increases the level of reverse flow achievable. This increased reverse flow reduces the need to occlude the external carotid artery by reducing the potential flow from the external carotid artery antegrade to the internal carotid artery during common carotid artery occlusion in the case of an external carotid artery to internal carotid artery pressure gradient. The elimination of the external carotid artery occlusion balloon greatly reduces the complexity, risk and potential complications of the procedure.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">During a CAS procedure, there are periods of increased risk of release of embolic debris. These periods have been documented in studies using Transcranial Doppler (TCD) technology to measure the passage of embolic debris in the cerebral arteries during the CAS procedure. One of these periods is when a device, for example a dilatation balloon or stent delivery device, crosses the stenosis. Another example is when the post-stent dilatation balloon is deflated (presumably releasing embolic particles that have been generated during the dilatation). For reverse or static flow protocols where the common carotid artery is occluded, there is also an elevated risk of embolic particles when the common carotid artery is un-occluded. For these reasons, it would be desirable to provide methods and devices which would enable a CAS intervention with a reduction in the number of devices required to cross the stenosis. It would further be desirable to provide methods and devices which could offer augmented protection from embolic events during critical periods of intervention.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">None of the cerebral protection devices and methods described offer protection after the CAS procedure. However, clinical and sub-clinical cerebral ischemia has been measured up to 48 hours post stent procedure. During CEA, flushing at the end of the procedure while blocking flow to the internal carotid artery may help reduce procedural and post-procedural emboli generation. Studies which have compared CAS and CEA procedures have documented a significantly higher level of micro-ischemic events during CAS procedures as measured by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI). This suggests that the methods used to remove embolic debris and prevent embolic generation are more effective in CEA than in CAS procedures. It may be advantageous to provide a means to flush and/or aspirate the treated area during a CAS procedure to similar effect as is done in a CEA procedure, and further to isolate the internal carotid artery during removal of the common carotid artery occlusion so that any potential debris proximal to the common carotid artery occlusion or in the treatment zone is forward flushed via arterial blood flow into the external carotid artery before arterial flow is reestablished into the internal carotid artery.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Methods and systems for inducing static or retrograde blood flow while performing interventional procedures in the carotid arteries are described in U.S. Pat.

The system <b>100</b> interacts with the carotid artery to provide retrograde flow from the carotid artery to a venous return site, such as the internal jugular vein (or to another return site such as another large vein or an external receptacle in alternate embodiments.) The retrograde flow system <b>100</b> includes an arterial access device <b>110</b>, a venous return device <b>115</b>, and a shunt <b>120</b> that provides a passageway for retrograde flow from the arterial access device <b>110</b> to the venous return device <b>115</b>. A flow control assembly <b>125</b> interacts with the shunt <b>120</b>. The flow control assembly <b>125</b> is adapted to regulate and/or monitor the retrograde flow from the common carotid artery to the internal jugular vein, as described in more detail below. The flow control assembly <b>125</b> interacts with the flow pathway through the shunt <b>120</b>, either external to the flow path, inside the flow path, or both. The arterial access device <b>110</b> at least partially inserts into the common carotid artery CCA and the venous return device <b>115</b> at least partially inserts into a venous return site such as the internal jugular vein IJV, as described in more detail below. The arterial access device <b>110</b> and the venous return device <b>115</b> couple to the shunt <b>120</b> at connection locations <b>127</b><i>a </i>and <b>127</b><i>b</i>. When flow through the common carotid artery is blocked, the natural pressure gradient between the internal carotid artery and the venous system causes blood to flow in a retrograde or reverse direction RG (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>) from the cerebral vasculature through the internal carotid artery and through the shunt <b>120</b> into the venous system. The flow control assembly <b>125</b> modulates, augments, assists, monitors, and/or otherwise regulates the retrograde blood flow.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the arterial access device <b>110</b> accesses the common carotid artery CCA via a transcervical approach. Transcervical access provides a short length and non-tortuous pathway from the vascular access point to the target treatment site thereby easing the time and difficulty of the procedure, compared for example to a transfemoral approach. Additionally, this access route reduces the risk of emboli generation from navigation of diseased, angulated, or tortuous aortic arch or common carotid artery anatomy. At least a portion of the venous return device <b>115</b> is placed in the internal jugular vein IJV. In an embodiment, transcervical access to the common carotid artery is achieved percutaneously via an incision or puncture in the skin through which the arterial access device <b>110</b> is inserted. If an incision is used, then the incision can be about 0.5 cm in length. An occlusion element <b>129</b>, such as an expandable balloon, can be used to occlude the common carotid artery CCA at a location proximal of the distal end of the arterial access device <b>110</b>.

The blood is carried from the Circle of Willis by the anterior, middle and posterior cerebral arteries to the brain. This communication between arteries makes collateral circulation through the brain possible. Blood flow through alternate routes is made possible thereby providing a safety mechanism in case of blockage to one or more vessels providing blood to the brain. The brain can continue receiving adequate blood supply in most instances even when there is a blockage somewhere in the arterial system (e.g., when the ICA is ligated as described herein). Flow through the Circle of Willis ensures adequate cerebral blood flow by numerous pathways that redistribute blood to the deprived side.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The collateral potential of the Circle of Willis is believed to be dependent on the presence and size of its component vessels. It should be appreciated that considerable anatomic variation between individuals can exist in these vessels and that many of the involved vessels may be diseased. For example, some people lack one of the communicating arteries. If a blockage develops in such people, collateral circulation is compromised resulting in an ischemic event and potentially brain damage. In addition, an autoregulatory response to decreased perfusion pressure can include enlargement of the collateral arteries, such as the communicating arteries, in the Circle of Willis. An adjustment time is occasionally required for this compensation mechanism before collateral circulation can reach a level that supports normal function. This autoregulatory response can occur over the space of 15 to 30 seconds and can only compensate within a certain range of pressure and flow drop. Thus, it is possible for a transient ischemic attack to occur during the adjustment period. Very high retrograde flow rate for an extended period of time can lead to conditions where the patient's brain is not getting enough blood flow, leading to patient intolerance as exhibited by neurologic symptoms or in some cases a transient ischemic attack.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> depicts a normal cerebral circulation and formation of Circle of Willis CW. The aorta AO gives rise to the brachiocephalic artery BCA, which branches into the left common carotid artery LCCA and left subclavian artery LSCA. The aorta AO further gives rise to the right common carotid artery RCCA and right subclavian artery RSCA. The left and right common carotid arteries CCA gives rise to internal carotid arteries ICA which branch into the middle cerebral arteries MCA, posterior communicating artery PcoA, and anterior cerebral artery ACA. The anterior cerebral arteries ACA deliver blood to some parts of the frontal lobe and the corpus striatum. The middle cerebral arteries MCA are large arteries that have tree-like branches that bring blood to the entire lateral aspect of each hemisphere of the brain. The left and right posterior cerebral arteries PCA arise from the basilar artery BA and deliver blood to the posterior portion of the brain (the occipital lobe).</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Anteriorly, the Circle of Willis is formed by the anterior cerebral arteries ACA and the anterior communicating artery ACoA which connects the two ACAs. The two posterior communicating arteries PCoA connect the Circle of Willis to the two posterior cerebral arteries PCA, which branch from the basilar artery BA and complete the Circle posteriorly.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The common carotid artery CCA also gives rise to external carotid artery ECA, which branches extensively to supply most of the structures of the head except the brain and the contents of the orbit. The ECA also helps supply structures in the neck and face.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Carotid Artery Bifurcation</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows an enlarged view of the relevant vasculature in the patient's neck. The common carotid artery CCA branches at bifurcation B into the internal carotid artery ICA and the external carotid artery ECA. The bifurcation is located at approximately the level of the fourth cervical vertebra. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows plaque P formed at the bifurcation B.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">As discussed above, the arterial access device <b>110</b> can access the common carotid artery CCA via a transcervical approach. Pursuant to the transcervical approach, the arterial access device <b>110</b> is inserted into the common carotid artery CCA at an arterial access location L, which can be, for example, a surgical incision or puncture in the wall of the common carotid artery CCA. There is typically a distance D of around 5 to 7 cm between the arterial access location L and the bifurcation B. When the arterial access device <b>110</b> is inserted into the common carotid artery CCA, it is undesirable for the distal tip of the arterial access device <b>110</b> to contact the bifurcation B as this could disrupt the plaque P and cause generation of embolic particles. In order to minimize the likelihood of the arterial access device <b>110</b> contacting the bifurcation B, in an embodiment only about 2-4 cm of the distal region of the arterial access device is inserted into the common carotid artery CCA during a procedure.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The common carotid arteries are encased on each side in a layer of fascia called the carotid sheath. This sheath also envelops the internal jugular vein and the vagus nerve. Anterior to the sheath is the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Transcervical access to the common carotid artery and internal jugular vein, either percutaneous or surgical, can be made immediately superior to the clavicle, between the two heads of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and through the carotid sheath, with care taken to avoid the vagus nerve.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">At the upper end of this sheath, the common carotid artery bifurcates into the internal and external carotid arteries. The internal carotid artery continues upward without branching until it enters the skull to supply blood to the retina and brain. The external carotid artery branches to supply blood to the scalp, facial, ocular, and other superficial structures. Intertwined both anterior and posterior to the arteries are several facial and cranial nerves. Additional neck muscles may also overlay the bifurcation. These nerve and muscle structures can be dissected and pushed aside to access the carotid bifurcation during a carotid endarterectomy procedure. In some cases the carotid bifurcation is closer to the level of the mandible, where access is more challenging and with less room available to separate it from the various nerves which should be spared. In these instances, the risk of inadvertent nerve injury can increase and an open endarterectomy procedure may not be a good option.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Detailed Description of Retrograde Blood Flow System</heading><p id="p-0079" num="0078">As discussed, the retrograde flow system <b>100</b> includes the arterial access device <b>110</b>, venous return device <b>115</b>, and shunt <b>120</b> which provides a passageway for retrograde flow from the arterial access device <b>110</b> to the venous return device <b>115</b>. The system also includes the flow control assembly <b>125</b>, which interacts with the shunt <b>120</b> to regulate and/or monitor retrograde blood flow through the shunt <b>120</b>. Exemplary embodiments of the components of the retrograde flow system <b>100</b> are described below.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">It should be appreciated that the retrograde flow system can vary. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a prior Criado flow shunt system. The Criado system uses a flow shunt which includes an arterial sheath <b>210</b> and a venous sheath <b>212</b>. Each sheath has a side arm <b>214</b>, terminating in a stopcock <b>216</b>. The two sheaths stopcocks are connected by a connector tubing <b>218</b>, thus completing a reverse flow shunt from the arterial sheath <b>210</b> to the venous sheath <b>212</b>. The arterial sheath is placed in the common carotid artery CCA through an open surgical incision in the neck below the carotid bifurcation. Occlusion of the common carotid artery CCA is accomplished using a temporary vessel ligation, for example using a Rummel tourniquet and umbilical tape or vessel loop. The venous return sheath <b>212</b> is placed into the internal jugular vein IJV, such as via an open surgical incision. Retrograde flow from the internal carotid artery ICA and the external carotid artery ECA may then be established by opening the stopcock <b>216</b>. The Criado protocol is an improvement over the earlier retrograde flow protocols since it eliminates the need for femoral access. While a significant improvement over the femoral access-based retrograde flow protocols, the Criado protocol and flow shunt could still benefit from improvement.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">There is now described an improved retrograde flow system.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Arterial Access Device</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> shows an exemplary embodiment of the arterial access device <b>110</b>, which comprises a distal sheath <b>605</b>, a proximal extension <b>610</b>, a flow line <b>615</b>, an adaptor or Y-connector <b>620</b>, and a hemostasis valve <b>625</b>. The distal sheath <b>605</b> is adapted to be introduced through an incision or puncture in a wall of a common carotid artery, either an open surgical incision or a percutaneous puncture established, for example, using the Seldinger technique. The length of the sheath can be in the range from 5 to 15 cm, usually being from 10 cm to 12 cm. The inner diameter is typically in the range from 7 Fr (1 Fr=0.33 mm), to 10 Fr, usually being 8 Fr. Particularly when the sheath is being introduced through the transcervical approach, above the clavicle but below the carotid bifurcation, it is desirable that the sheath <b>605</b> be highly flexible while retaining hoop strength to resist kinking and buckling. Thus, the distal sheath <b>605</b> can be circumferentially reinforced, such as by braid, helical ribbon, helical wire, or the like. In an alternate embodiment, the distal sheath is adapted to be introduced through a percutaneous puncture into the femoral artery, such as in the groin, and up the aortic arch AA into the target common carotid artery CCA.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The distal sheath <b>605</b> can have a stepped or other configuration having a reduced diameter insertion region or distal region <b>630</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>, which shows an enlarged view of the distal region <b>630</b> of the sheath <b>605</b>. The distal region <b>630</b> of the sheath can be sized for insertion into the carotid artery, typically having an inner diameter in the range from 2.16 mm (0.085 inch) to 2.92 mm (0.115 inch) with the remaining proximal region of the sheath having larger outside and luminal diameters, with the inner diameter typically being in the range from 2.794 mm (0.110 inch) to 3.43 mm (0.135 inch). The larger luminal diameter of the proximal region minimizes the overall flow resistance of the sheath. In an embodiment, the reduced-diameter distal section <b>630</b> has a length of approximately 2 cm to 4 cm. The relatively short length of the reduced-diameter distal section <b>630</b> permits this section to be positioned in the common carotid artery CCA via the transcervical approach with reduced risk that the distal end of the sheath <b>605</b> will contact the bifurcation B. Moreover, the reduced diameter section <b>630</b> also permits a reduction in size of the arteriotomy for introducing the sheath <b>605</b> into the artery while having a minimal impact in the level of flow resistance.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">With reference again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>, the proximal extension <b>610</b> has an inner lumen which is contiguous with an inner lumen of the sheath <b>605</b>. The lumens can be joined by the Y-connector <b>620</b> which also connects a lumen of the flow line <b>615</b> to the sheath. In the assembled system, the flow line <b>615</b> connects to and forms a first leg of the retrograde shunt <b>120</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). The proximal extension <b>610</b> can have a length sufficient to space the hemostasis valve <b>625</b> well away from the Y-connector <b>620</b>, which is adjacent to the percutaneous or surgical insertion site. By spacing the hemostasis valve <b>625</b> away from a percutaneous insertion site, the physician can introduce a stent delivery system or other working catheter into the proximal extension <b>610</b> and sheath <b>605</b> while staying out of the fluoroscopic field when fluoroscopy is being performed.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">A flush line <b>635</b> can be connected to the side of the hemostasis valve <b>625</b> and can have a stopcock <b>640</b> at its proximal or remote end. The flush-line <b>635</b> allows for the introduction of saline, contrast fluid, or the like, during the procedures. The flush line <b>635</b> can also allow pressure monitoring during the procedure. A dilator <b>645</b> having a tapered distal end <b>650</b> can be provided to facilitate introduction of the distal sheath <b>605</b> into the common carotid artery. The dilator <b>645</b> can be introduced through the hemostasis valve <b>625</b> so that the tapered distal end <b>650</b> extends through the distal end of the sheath <b>605</b>, as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>. The dilator <b>645</b> can have a central lumen to accommodate a guide wire. Typically, the guide wire is placed first into the vessel, and the dilator/sheath combination travels over the guide wire as it is being introduced into the vessel.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Optionally, a tube <b>705</b> may be provided which is coaxially received over the exterior of the distal sheath <b>605</b>, also as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>. The tube <b>705</b> has a flared proximal end <b>710</b> which engages the adapter <b>620</b> and a distal end <b>715</b>. Optionally, the distal end <b>715</b> may be beveled, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>. The tube <b>705</b> may serve at least two purposes. First, the length of the tube <b>705</b> limits the introduction of the sheath <b>605</b> to the exposed distal portion of the sheath <b>605</b>, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>. Second, the tube <b>705</b> can engage a pre-deployed puncture closure device disposed in the carotid artery wall, if present, to permit the sheath <b>605</b> to be withdrawn without dislodging the closure device.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In an embodiment, the sheath <b>605</b> includes a retention feature that is adapted to retain the sheath within a blood vessel (such as the common carotid artery) into which the sheath <b>605</b> has been inserted. The retention features reduces the likelihood that the sheath <b>605</b> will be inadvertently pulled out of the blood vessel. In this regard, the retention feature interacts with the blood vessel to resist and/or eliminate undesired pull-out. In addition, the retention feature may also include additional elements that interact with the vessel wall to prevent the sheath from entering too far into the vessel. The retention feature may also include sealing elements which help seal the sheath against arterial blood pressure at the puncture site.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">The distal sheath <b>605</b> can be configured to establish a curved transition from a generally anterior-posterior approach over the common carotid artery to a generally axial luminal direction within the common carotid artery. The transition in direction is particularly useful when a percutaneous access is provided through the common carotid wall. While an open surgical access may allow for some distance in which to angle a straight sheath into the lumen of the common carotid artery, percutaneous access will generally be in a normal or perpendicular direction relative to the access of the lumen, and in such cases, a sheath that can flex or turn at an angle will find great use.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The sheath <b>605</b> can be formed in a variety of ways. For example, the sheath <b>605</b> can be pre-shaped to have a curve or an angle some set distance from the tip, typically 2 to 3 cm. The pre-shaped curve or angle can typically provide for a turn in the range from 20&#xb0; to 90&#xb0;, preferably from 30&#xb0; to 70&#xb0;. For initial introduction, the sheath <b>605</b> can be straightened with an obturator or other straight or shaped instrument such as the dilator <b>645</b> placed into its lumen. After the sheath <b>605</b> has been at least partially introduced through the percutaneous or other arterial wall penetration, the obturator can be withdrawn to allow the sheath <b>605</b> to reassume its pre-shaped configuration into the arterial lumen.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Other sheath configurations include having a deflection mechanism such that the sheath can be placed and the catheter can be deflected in situ to the desired deployment angle. In still other configurations, the catheter has a non-rigid configuration when placed into the lumen of the common carotid artery. Once in place, a pull wire or other stiffening mechanism can be deployed in order to shape and stiffen the sheath into its desired configuration. One particular example of such a mechanism is commonly known as &#x201c;shape-lock&#x201d; mechanisms as well described in medical and patent literature.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Another sheath configuration comprises a curved dilator inserted into a straight but flexible sheath, so that the dilator and sheath are curved during insertion. The sheath is flexible enough to conform to the anatomy after dilator removal.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">In an embodiment, the sheath has built-in puncturing capability and atraumatic tip analogous to a guide wire tip. This eliminates the need for needle and wire exchange currently used for arterial access according to the micropuncture technique, and can thus save time, reduce blood loss, and require less surgeon skill.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> shows another embodiment of the arterial access device <b>110</b>. This embodiment is substantially the same as the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>, except that the distal sheath <b>605</b> includes an occlusion element <b>129</b> for occluding flow through, for example the common carotid artery. If the occluding element <b>129</b> is an inflatable structure such as a balloon or the like, the sheath <b>605</b> can include an inflation lumen that communicates with the occlusion element <b>129</b>. The occlusion element <b>129</b> can be an inflatable balloon, but it could also be an inflatable cuff, a conical or other circumferential element which flares outwardly to engage the interior wall of the common carotid artery to block flow therepast, a membrane-covered braid, a slotted tube that radially enlarges when axially compressed, or similar structure which can be deployed by mechanical means, or the like. In the case of balloon occlusion, the balloon can be compliant, non-compliant, elastomeric, reinforced, or have a variety of other characteristics. In an embodiment, the balloon is an elastomeric balloon which is closely received over the exterior of the distal end of the sheath prior to inflation. When inflated, the elastomeric balloon can expand and conform to the inner wall of the common carotid artery. In an embodiment, the elastomeric balloon is able to expand to a diameter at least twice that of the non-deployed configuration, frequently being able to be deployed to a diameter at least three times that of the undeployed configuration, more preferably being at least four times that of the undeployed configuration, or larger.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>, the distal sheath <b>605</b> with the occlusion element <b>129</b> can have a stepped or other configuration having a reduced diameter distal region <b>630</b>.

The second, proximal sheath can include an inflatable balloon <b>129</b> or other occlusion element, generally as described above. The distal sheath <b>605</b> of the arterial access device <b>110</b> can be then placed into the common carotid artery distal of the second, proximal sheath and generally oriented in a distal direction toward the cerebral vasculature. By using separate occlusion and access sheaths, the size of the arteriotomy needed for introducing the access sheath can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> shows yet another embodiment of a two arterial sheath system, wherein the interventional devices are introduced via an introducer sheath <b>114</b> separate from the distal sheath <b>605</b> of the arterial device <b>110</b>. A second or &#x201c;distal&#x201d; sheath <b>114</b> can be adapted for insertion into the common carotid artery distal to the arterial access device <b>110</b>.

The distal sheath <b>910</b> is adapted to be introduced through an incision or puncture into a venous return location, such as the jugular vein or femoral vein. The distal sheath <b>910</b> and flow line <b>915</b> can be permanently affixed, or can be attached using a conventional luer fitting, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. Optionally, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the sheath <b>910</b> can be joined to the flow line <b>915</b> by a Y-connector <b>1005</b>. The Y-connector <b>1005</b> can include a hemostasis valve <b>1010</b>, permitting insertion of a dilator <b>1015</b> to facilitate introduction of the venous return device into the internal jugular vein or other vein. As with the arterial access dilator <b>645</b>, the venous dilator <b>1015</b> includes a central guide wire lumen so the venous sheath and dilator combination can be placed over a guide wire. Optionally, the venous sheath <b>910</b> can include a flush line <b>1020</b> with a stopcock <b>1025</b> at its proximal or remote end.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">In order to reduce the overall system flow resistance, the arterial access flow line <b>615</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>) and the venous return flow line <b>915</b>, and Y-connectors <b>620</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>) and <b>1005</b>, can each have a relatively large flow lumen inner diameter, typically being in the range from 2.54 mm (0.100 inch) to 5.08 mm (0.200 inch), and a relatively short length, typically being in the range from 10 cm to 20 cm. The low system flow resistance is desirable since it permits the flow to be maximized during portions of a procedure when the risk of emboli is at its greatest. The low system flow resistance also allows the use of a variable flow resistance for controlling flow in the system, as described in more detail below. The dimensions of the venous return sheath <b>910</b> can be generally the same as those described for the arterial access sheath <b>605</b> above. In the venous return sheath, an extension for the hemostasis valve <b>1010</b> is not required.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Retrograde Shunt</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">The shunt <b>120</b> can be formed of a single tube or multiple, connected tubes that provide fluid communication between the arterial access catheter <b>110</b> and the venous return catheter <b>115</b> to provide a pathway for retrograde blood flow therebetween. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the shunt <b>120</b> connects at one end (via connector <b>127</b><i>a</i>) to the flow line <b>615</b> of the arterial access device <b>110</b>, and at an opposite end (via connector <b>127</b><i>b</i>) to the flow line <b>915</b> of the venous return catheter <b>115</b>.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">In an embodiment, the shunt <b>120</b> can be formed of at least one tube that communicates with the flow control assembly <b>125</b>. The shunt <b>120</b> can be any structure that provides a fluid pathway for blood flow. The shunt <b>120</b> can have a single lumen or it can have multiple lumens. The shunt <b>120</b> can be removably attached to the flow control assembly <b>125</b>, arterial access device <b>110</b>, and/or venous return device <b>115</b>. Prior to use, the user can select a shunt <b>120</b> with a length that is most appropriate for use with the arterial access location and venous return location. In an embodiment, the shunt <b>120</b> can include one or more extension tubes that can be used to vary the length of the shunt <b>120</b>. The extension tubes can be modularly attached to the shunt <b>120</b> to achieve a desired length. The modular aspect of the shunt <b>120</b> permits the user to lengthen the shunt <b>120</b> as needed depending on the site of venous return. For example, in some patients, the internal jugular vein IJV is small and/or tortuous. The risk of complications at this site may be higher than at some other locations, due to proximity to other anatomic structures. In addition, hematoma in the neck may lead to airway obstruction and/or cerebral vascular complications. Consequently, for such patients it may be desirable to locate the venous return site at a location other than the internal jugular vein IJV, such as the femoral vein. A femoral vein return site may be accomplished percutaneously, with lower risk of serious complication, and also offers an alternative venous access to the central vein if the internal jugular vein IJV is not available. Furthermore, the femoral venous return changes the layout of the reverse flow shunt such that the shunt controls may be located closer to the &#x201c;working area&#x201d; of the intervention, where the devices are being introduced and the contrast injection port is located.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">In an embodiment, the shunt <b>120</b> has an internal diameter of 4.76 mm ( 3/16 inch) and has a length of 40-70 cm. As mentioned, the length of the shunt can be adjusted.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">Flow Control Assembly&#x2014;Regulation and Monitoring of Retrograde Flow</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">The flow control assembly <b>125</b> interacts with the retrograde shunt <b>120</b> to regulate and/or monitor the retrograde flow rate from the common carotid artery to the venous return site, such as the internal jugular vein, or to the external receptacle <b>130</b>. In this regard, the flow control assembly <b>125</b> enables the user to achieve higher maximum flow rates than existing systems and to also selectively adjust, set, or otherwise modulate the retrograde flow rate. Various mechanisms can be used to regulate the retrograde flow rate, as described more fully below. The flow control assembly <b>125</b> enables the user to configure retrograde blood flow in a manner that is suited for various treatment regimens, as described below.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">In general, the ability to control the continuous retrograde flow rate allows the physician to adjust the protocol for individual patients and stages of the procedure. The retrograde blood flow rate will typically be controlled over a range from a low rate to a high rate. The high rate can be at least two fold higher than the low rate, typically being at least three fold higher than the low rate, and often being at least five fold higher than the low rate, or even higher. In an embodiment, the high rate is at least three fold higher than the low rate and in another embodiment the high rate is at least six fold higher than the low rate. While it is generally desirable to have a high retrograde blood flow rate to maximize the extraction of emboli from the carotid arteries, the ability of patients to tolerate retrograde blood flow will vary. Thus, by having a system and protocol which allows the retrograde blood flow rate to be easily modulated, the treating physician can determine when the flow rate exceeds the tolerable level for that patient and set the reverse flow rate accordingly. For patients who cannot tolerate continuous high reverse flow rates, the physician can chose to turn on high flow only for brief, critical portions of the procedure when the risk of embolic debris is highest. At short intervals, for example between 15 seconds and 1 minute, patient tolerance limitations are usually not a factor.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">In specific embodiments, the continuous retrograde blood flow rate can be controlled at a base line flow rate in the range from 10 ml/min to 200 ml/min, typically from 20 ml/min to 100 ml/min. These flow rates will be tolerable to the majority of patients. Although flow rate is maintained at the base line flow rate during most of the procedure, at times when the risk of emboli release is increased, the flow rate can be increased above the base line for a short duration in order to improve the ability to capture such emboli. For example, the retrograde blood flow rate can be increased above the base line when the stent catheter is being introduced, when the stent is being deployed, pre- and post-dilatation of the stent, removal of the common carotid artery occlusion, and the like.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">The flow rate control system can be cycled between a relatively low flow rate and a relatively high flow rate in order to &#x201c;flush&#x201d; the carotid arteries in the region of the carotid bifurcation prior to reestablishing antegrade flow. Such cycling can be established with a high flow rate which can be approximately two to six fold greater than the low flow rate, typically being about three fold greater. The cycles can typically have a length in the range from 0.5 seconds to 10 seconds, usually from 2 seconds to 5 seconds, with the total duration of the cycling being in the range from 5 seconds to 60 seconds, usually from 10 seconds to 30 seconds.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> shows an example of the system <b>100</b> with a schematic representation of the flow control assembly <b>125</b>, which is positioned along the shunt <b>120</b> such that retrograde blood flow passes through or otherwise communicates with at least a portion of the flow control assembly <b>125</b>. The flow control assembly <b>125</b> can include various controllable mechanisms for regulating and/or monitoring retrograde flow. The mechanisms can include various means of controlling the retrograde flow, including one or more pumps <b>1110</b>, valves <b>1115</b>, syringes <b>1120</b> and/or a variable resistance component <b>1125</b>. The flow control assembly <b>125</b> can be manually controlled by a user and/or automatically controlled via a controller <b>1130</b> to vary the flow through the shunt <b>120</b>. For example, varying the flow resistance, the rate of retrograde blood flow through the shunt <b>120</b> can be controlled. The controller <b>1130</b>, which is described in more detail below, can be integrated into the flow control assembly <b>125</b> or it can be a separate component that communicates with the components of the flow control assembly <b>125</b>.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">In addition, the flow control assembly <b>125</b> can include one or more flow sensors <b>1135</b> and/or anatomical data sensors <b>1140</b> (described in detail below) for sensing one or more aspects of the retrograde flow. A filter <b>1145</b> can be positioned along the shunt <b>120</b> for removing emboli before the blood is returned to the venous return site. When the filter <b>1145</b> is positioned upstream of the controller <b>1130</b>, the filter <b>1145</b> can prevent emboli from entering the controller <b>1145</b> and potentially clogging the variable flow resistance component <b>1125</b>. It should be appreciated that the various components of the flow control assembly <b>125</b> (including the pump <b>1110</b>, valves <b>1115</b>, syringes <b>1120</b>, variable resistance component <b>1125</b>, sensors <b>1135</b>/<b>1140</b>, and filter <b>1145</b>) can be positioned at various locations along the shunt <b>120</b> and at various upstream or downstream locations relative to one another. The components of the flow control assembly <b>125</b> are not limited to the locations shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>. Moreover, the flow control assembly <b>125</b> does not necessarily include all of the components but can rather include various sub-combinations of the components. For example, a syringe could optionally be used within the flow control assembly <b>125</b> for purposes of regulating flow or it could be used outside of the assembly for purposes other than flow regulation, such as to introduce fluid such as radiopaque contrast into the artery in an antegrade direction via the shunt <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Both the variable resistance component <b>1125</b> and the pump <b>1110</b> can be coupled to the shunt <b>120</b> to control the retrograde flow rate. The variable resistance component <b>1125</b> controls the flow resistance, while the pump <b>1110</b> provides for positive displacement of the blood through the shunt <b>120</b>. Thus, the pump can be activated to drive the retrograde flow rather than relying on the perfusion stump pressures of the ECA and ICA and the venous back pressure to drive the retrograde flow. The pump <b>1110</b> can be a peristaltic tube pump or any type of pump including a positive displacement pump. The pump <b>1110</b> can be activated and deactivated (either manually or automatically via the controller <b>1130</b>) to selectively achieve blood displacement through the shunt <b>120</b> and to control the flow rate through the shunt <b>120</b>. Displacement of the blood through the shunt <b>120</b> can also be achieved in other manners including using the aspiration syringe <b>1120</b>, or a suction source such as a vacutainer, vaculock syringe, or wall suction may be used. The pump <b>1110</b> can communicate with the controller <b>1130</b>.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">One or more flow control valves <b>1115</b> can be positioned along the pathway of the shunt. The valve(s) can be manually actuated or automatically actuated (via the controller <b>1130</b>). The flow control valves <b>1115</b> can be, for example one-way valves to prevent flow in the antegrade direction in the shunt <b>120</b>, check valves, or high pressure valves which would close off the shunt <b>120</b>, for example during high-pressure contrast injections (which are intended to enter the arterial vasculature in an antegrade direction).</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">The controller <b>1130</b> communicates with components of the system <b>100</b> including the flow control assembly <b>125</b> to enable manual and/or automatic regulation and/or monitoring of the retrograde flow through the components of the system <b>100</b> (including, for example, the shunt <b>120</b>, the arterial access device <b>110</b>, the venous return device <b>115</b> and the flow control assembly <b>125</b>). For example, a user can actuate one or more actuators on the controller <b>1130</b> to manually control the components of the flow control assembly <b>125</b>. Manual controls can include switches or dials or similar components located directly on the controller <b>1130</b> or components located remote from the controller <b>1130</b> such as a foot pedal or similar device. The controller <b>1130</b> can also automatically control the components of the system <b>100</b> without requiring input from the user. In an embodiment, the user can program software in the controller <b>1130</b> to enable such automatic control. The controller <b>1130</b> can control actuation of the mechanical portions of the flow control assembly <b>125</b>. The controller <b>1130</b> can include circuitry or programming that interprets signals generated by sensors <b>1135</b>/<b>1140</b> such that the controller <b>1130</b> can control actuation of the flow control assembly <b>125</b> in response to such signals generated by the sensors.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">The representation of the controller <b>1130</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is merely exemplary. It should be appreciated that the controller <b>1130</b> can vary in appearance and structure. The controller <b>1130</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> as being integrated in a single housing. This permits the user to control the flow control assembly <b>125</b> from a single location. It should be appreciated that any of the components of the controller <b>1130</b> can be separated into separate housings. Further, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> shows the controller <b>1130</b> and flow control assembly <b>125</b> as separate housings.

An audio indication advantageously reminds the user of a flow state without requiring the user to visually check the flow controller <b>1130</b>. The indicator(s) can include a speaker <b>1150</b> and/or a light <b>1155</b> or any other means for communicating the state of retrograde flow to the user. The controller <b>1130</b> can communicate with one or more sensors of the system to control activation of the indicator. Or, activation of the indicator can be tied directly to the user actuating one of the flow control actuators <b>1165</b>. The indicator need not be a speaker or a light. The indicator could simply be a button or switch that visually indicates the state of the retrograde flow. For example, the button being in a certain state (such as a pressed or down state) may be a visual indication that the retrograde flow is in a high state. Or, a switch or dial pointing toward a particular labeled flow state may be a visual indication that the retrograde flow is in the labeled state.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">The indicator can provide a signal indicative of one or more states of the retrograde flow. In an embodiment, the indicator identifies only two discrete states: a state of &#x201c;high&#x201d; flow rate and a state of &#x201c;low&#x201d; flow rate. In another embodiment, the indicator identifies more than two flow rates, including a &#x201c;high&#x201d; flow rate, a &#x201c;medium&#x201d; flow rate, and a &#x201c;low&#x201d; rate. The indicator can be configured to identify any quantity of discrete states of the retrograde flow or it can identify a graduated signal that corresponds to the state of the retrograde flow. In this regard, the indicator can be a digital or analog meter <b>1160</b> that indicates a value of the retrograde flow rate, such as in ml/min or any other units.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">In an embodiment, the indicator is configured to indicate to the user whether the retrograde flow rate is in a state of &#x201c;high&#x201d; flow rate or a &#x201c;low&#x201d; flow rate. For example, the indicator may illuminate in a first manner (e.g., level of brightness) and/or emit a first audio signal when the flow rate is high and then change to a second manner of illumination and/or emit a second audio signal when the flow rate is low. Or, the indicator may illuminate and/or emit an audio signal only when the flow rate is high, or only when the flow rate is low. Given that some patients may be intolerant of a high flow rate or intolerant of a high flow rate beyond an extended period of time, it can be desirable that the indicator provide notification to the user when the flow rate is in the high state. This would serve as a fail safe feature.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">In another embodiment, the indicator provides a signal (audio and/or visual) when the flow rate changes state, such as when the flow rate changes from high to low and/or vice-versa. In another embodiment, the indicator provides a signal when no retrograde flow is present, such as when the shunt <b>120</b> is blocked or one of the stopcocks in the shunt <b>120</b> is closed.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">Flow Rate Actuators</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">The controller <b>1130</b> can include one or more actuators that the user can press, switch, manipulate, or otherwise actuate to regulate the retrograde flow rate and/or to monitor the flow rate. For example, the controller <b>1130</b> can include a flow control actuator <b>1165</b> (such as one or more buttons, knobs, dials, switches, etc.) that the user can actuate to cause the controller to selectively vary an aspect of the reverse flow. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the flow control actuator <b>1165</b> is a knob that can be turned to various discrete positions each of which corresponds to the controller <b>1130</b> causing the system <b>100</b> to achieve a particular retrograde flow state. The states include, for example, (a) OFF; (b) LO-FLOW; (c) HI-FLOW; and (d) ASPIRATE. It should be appreciated that the foregoing states are merely exemplary and that different states or combinations of states can be used. The controller <b>1130</b> achieves the various retrograde flow states by interacting with one or more components of the system, including the sensor(s), valve(s), variable resistance component, and/or pump(s). It should be appreciated that the controller <b>1130</b> can also include circuitry and software that regulates the retrograde flow rate and/or monitors the flow rate such that the user wouldn't need to actively actuate the controller <b>1130</b>.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">The OFF state corresponds to a state where there is no retrograde blood flow through the shunt <b>120</b>. When the user sets the flow control actuator <b>1165</b> to OFF, the controller <b>1130</b> causes the retrograde flow to cease, such as by shutting off valves or closing a stop cock in the shunt <b>120</b>. The LO-FLOW and HI-FLOW states correspond to a low retrograde flow rate and a high retrograde flow rate, respectively. When the user sets the flow control actuator <b>1165</b> to LO-FLOW or HI-FLOW, the controller <b>1130</b> interacts with components of the flow control regulator <b>125</b> including pump(s) <b>1110</b>, valve(s) <b>1115</b> and/or variable resistance component <b>1125</b> to increase or decrease the flow rate accordingly. Finally, the ASPIRATE state corresponds to opening the circuit to a suction source, for example a vacutainer or suction unit, if active retrograde flow is desired.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">The system can be used to vary the blood flow between various states including an active state, a passive state, an aspiration state, and an off state. The active state corresponds to the system using a means that actively drives retrograde blood flow. Such active means can include, for example, a pump, syringe, vacuum source, etc. The passive state corresponds to when retrograde blood flow is driven by the perfusion stump pressures of the ECA and ICA and possibly the venous pressure. The aspiration state corresponds to the system using a suction source, for example a vacutainer or suction unit, to drive retrograde blood flow. The off state corresponds to the system having zero retrograde blood flow such as the result of closing a stopcock or valve. The low and high flow rates can be either passive or active flow states. In an embodiment, the particular value (such as in ml/min) of either the low flow rate and/or the high flow rate can be predetermined and/or pre-programmed into the controller such that the user does not actually set or input the value. Rather, the user simply selects &#x201c;high flow&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;low flow&#x201d; (such as by pressing an actuator such as a button on the controller <b>1130</b>) and the controller <b>1130</b> interacts with one or more of the components of the flow control assembly <b>125</b> to cause the flow rate to achieve the predetermined high or low flow rate value. In another embodiment, the user sets or inputs a value for low flow rate and/or high flow rate such as into the controller. In another embodiment, the low flow rate and/or high flow rate is not actually set. Rather, external data (such as data from the anatomical data sensor <b>1140</b>) is used as the basis for affects the flow rate.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">The flow control actuator <b>1165</b> can be multiple actuators, for example one actuator, such as a button or switch, to switch state from LO-FLOW to HI-FLOW and another to close the flow loop to OFF, for example during a contrast injection where the contrast is directed antegrade into the carotid artery. In an embodiment, the flow control actuator <b>1165</b> can include multiple actuators. For example, one actuator can be operated to switch flow rate from low to high, another actuator can be operated to temporarily stop flow, and a third actuator (such as a stopcock) can be operated for aspiration using a syringe. In another example, one actuator is operated to switch to LO-FLOW and another actuator is operated to switch to HI-FLOW. Or, the flow control actuator <b>1165</b> can include multiple actuators to switch states from LO-FLOW to HI-FLOW and additional actuators for fine-tuning flow rate within the high flow state and low flow state. Upon switching between LO-FLOW and HI-FLOW, these additional actuators can be used to fine-tune the flow rates within those states. Thus, it should be appreciated that within each state (i.e. high flow state and low flow states) a variety of flow rates can be dialed in and fine-tuned. A wide variety of actuators can be used to achieve control over the state of flow.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">The controller <b>1130</b> or individual components of the controller <b>1130</b> can be located at various positions relative to the patient and/or relative to the other components of the system <b>100</b>. For example, the flow control actuator <b>1165</b> can be located near the hemostasis valve where any interventional tools are introduced into the patient in order to facilitate access to the flow control actuator <b>1165</b> during introduction of the tools. The location may vary, for example, based on whether a transfemoral or a transcervical approach is used, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-C</figref>. The controller <b>1130</b> can have a wireless connection to the remainder of the system <b>100</b> and/or a wired connection of adjustable length to permit remote control of the system <b>100</b>. The controller <b>1130</b> can have a wireless connection with the flow control regulator <b>125</b> and/or a wired connection of adjustable length to permit remote control of the flow control regulator <b>125</b>. The controller <b>1130</b> can also be integrated in the flow control regulator <b>125</b>. Where the controller <b>1130</b> is mechanically connected to the components of the flow control assembly <b>125</b>, a tether with mechanical actuation capabilities can connect the controller <b>1130</b> to one or more of the components. In an embodiment, the controller <b>1130</b> can be positioned a sufficient distance from the system <b>100</b> to permit positioning the controller <b>1130</b> outside of a radiation field when fluoroscopy is in use.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">The controller <b>1130</b> and any of its components can interact with other components of the system (such as the pump(s), sensor(s), shunt, etc) in various manners. For example, any of a variety of mechanical connections can be used to enable communication between the controller <b>1130</b> and the system components. Alternately, the controller <b>1130</b> can communicate electronically or magnetically with the system components. Electro-mechanical connections can also be used. The controller <b>1130</b> can be equipped with control software that enables the controller to implement control functions with the system components. The controller itself can be a mechanical, electrical or electro-mechanical device. The controller can be mechanically, pneumatically, or hydraulically actuated or electromechanically actuated (for example in the case of solenoid actuation of flow control state). The controller <b>1130</b> can include a computer, computer processor, and memory, as well as data storage capabilities.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">Sensor(s)</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">As mentioned, the flow control assembly <b>125</b> can include or interact with one or more sensors, which communicate with the system <b>100</b> and/or communicate with the patient's anatomy. Each of the sensors can be adapted to respond to a physical stimulus (including, for example, heat, light, sound, pressure, magnetism, motion, etc.) and to transmit a resulting signal for measurement or display or for operating the controller <b>1130</b>. In an embodiment, the flow sensor <b>1135</b> interacts with the shunt <b>120</b> to sense an aspect of the flow through the shunt <b>120</b>, such as flow velocity or volumetric rate of blood flow. The flow sensor <b>1135</b> could be directly coupled to a display that directly displays the value of the volumetric flow rate or the flow velocity. Or the flow sensor <b>1135</b> could feed data to the controller <b>1130</b> for display of the volumetric flow rate or the flow velocity.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">The type of flow sensor <b>1135</b> can vary. The flow sensor <b>1135</b> can be a mechanical device, such as a paddle wheel, flapper valve, rolling ball, or any mechanical component that responds to the flow through the shunt <b>120</b>. Movement of the mechanical device in response to flow through the shunt <b>120</b> can serve as a visual indication of fluid flow and can also be calibrated to a scale as a visual indication of fluid flow rate. The mechanical device can be coupled to an electrical component. For example, a paddle wheel can be positioned in the shunt <b>120</b> such that fluid flow causes the paddle wheel to rotate, with greater rate of fluid flow causing a greater speed of rotation of the paddle wheel. The paddle wheel can be coupled magnetically to a Hall-effect sensor to detect the speed of rotation, which is indicative of the fluid flow rate through the shunt <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">In an embodiment, the flow sensor <b>1135</b> is an ultrasonic or electromagnetic flow meter, which allows for blood flow measurement without contacting the blood through the wall of the shunt <b>120</b>. An ultrasonic or electromagnetic flow meter can be configured such that it does not have to contact the internal lumen of the shunt <b>120</b>. In an embodiment, the flow sensor <b>1135</b> at least partially includes a Doppler flow meter, such as a Transonic flow meter, that measures fluid flow through the shunt <b>120</b>. It should be appreciated that any of a wide variety of sensor types can be used including an ultrasound flow meter and transducer. Moreover, the system can include multiple sensors.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">The system <b>100</b> is not limited to using a flow sensor <b>1135</b> that is positioned in the shunt <b>120</b> or a sensor that interacts with the venous return device <b>115</b> or the arterial access device <b>110</b>. For example, an anatomical data sensor <b>1140</b> can communicate with or otherwise interact with the patient's anatomy such as the patient's neurological anatomy. In this manner, the anatomical data sensor <b>1140</b> can sense a measurable anatomical aspect that is directly or indirectly related to the rate of retrograde flow from the carotid artery. For example, the anatomical data sensor <b>1140</b> can measure blood flow conditions in the brain, for example the flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery, and communicate such conditions to a display and/or to the controller <b>1130</b> for adjustment of the retrograde flow rate based on predetermined criteria. In an embodiment, the anatomical data sensor <b>1140</b> comprises a transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD), which is an ultrasound test that uses reflected sound waves to evaluate blood as it flows through the brain. Use of TCD results in a TCD signal that can be communicated to the controller <b>1130</b> for controlling the retrograde flow rate to achieve or maintain a desired TCD profile. The anatomical data sensor <b>1140</b> can be based on any physiological measurement, including reverse flow rate, blood flow through the middle cerebral artery, TCD signals of embolic particles, or other neuromonitoring signals.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">In an embodiment, the system <b>100</b> comprises a closed-loop control system. In the closed-loop control system, one or more of the sensors (such as the flow sensor <b>1135</b> or the anatomical data sensor <b>1140</b>) senses or monitors a predetermined aspect of the system <b>100</b> or the anatomy (such as, for example, reverse flow rate and/or neuromonitoring signal). The sensor(s) feed relevant data to the controller <b>1130</b>, which continuously adjusts an aspect of the system as necessary to maintain a desired retrograde flow rate. The sensors communicate feedback on how the system <b>100</b> is operating to the controller <b>1130</b> so that the controller <b>1130</b> can translate that data and actuate the components of the flow control regulator <b>125</b> to dynamically compensate for disturbances to the retrograde flow rate. For example, the controller <b>1130</b> may include software that causes the controller <b>1130</b> to signal the components of the flow control assembly <b>125</b> to adjust the flow rate such that the flow rate is maintained at a constant state despite differing blood pressures from the patient. In this embodiment, the system <b>100</b> need not rely on the user to determine when, how long, and/or what value to set the reverse flow rate in either a high or low state. Rather, software in the controller <b>1130</b> can govern such factors. In the closed loop system, the controller <b>1130</b> can control the components of the flow control assembly <b>125</b> to establish the level or state of retrograde flow (either analog level or discreet state such as high, low, baseline, medium, etc.) based on the retrograde flow rate sensed by the sensor <b>1135</b>.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">In an embodiment, the anatomical data sensor <b>1140</b> (which measures a physiologic measurement in the patient) communicates a signal to the controller <b>1130</b>, which adjusts the flow rate based on the signal. For example the physiological measurement may be based on flow velocity through the MCA, TCD signal, or some other cerebral vascular signal. In the case of the TCD signal, TCD may be used to monitor cerebral flow changes and to detect microemboli. The controller <b>1130</b> may adjust the flow rate to maintain the TCD signal within a desired profile. For example, the TCD signal may indicate the presence of microemboli (&#x201c;TCD hits&#x201d;) and the controller <b>1130</b> can adjust the retrograde flow rate to maintain the TCD hits below a threshold value of hits. (See, Ribo, et al., &#x201c;Transcranial Doppler Monitoring of Transcervical Carotid Stenting with Flow Reversal Protection: A Novel Carotid Revascularization Technique&#x201d;, <i>Stroke </i>2006, 37, 2846-2849; Shekel, et al., &#x201c;Experience of 500 Cases of Neurophysiological Monitoring in Carotid Endarterectomy&#x201d;, <i>Acta Neurochir, </i>2007, 149:681-689, which are incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">In the case of the MCA flow, the controller <b>1130</b> can set the retrograde flow rate at the &#x201c;maximum&#x201d; flow rate that is tolerated by the patient, as assessed by perfusion to the brain. The controller <b>1130</b> can thus control the reverse flow rate to optimize the level of protection for the patient without relying on the user to intercede. In another embodiment, the feedback is based on a state of the devices in the system <b>100</b> or the interventional tools being used. For example, a sensor may notify the controller <b>1130</b> when the system <b>100</b> is in a high risk state, such as when an interventional catheter is positioned in the sheath <b>605</b>. The controller <b>1130</b> then adjusts the flow rate to compensate for such a state.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">The controller <b>1130</b> can be used to selectively augment the retrograde flow in a variety of manners. For example, it has been observed that greater reverse flow rates may cause a resultant greater drop in blood flow to the brain, most importantly the ipsilateral MCA, which may not be compensated enough with collateral flow from the Circle of Willis. Thus a higher reverse flow rate for an extended period of time may lead to conditions where the patient's brain is not getting enough blood flow, leading to patient intolerance as exhibited by neurologic symptoms. Studies show that MCA blood velocity less than 10 cm/sec is a threshold value below which patient is at risk for neurological blood deficit. There are other markers for monitoring adequate perfusion to the brains, such as EEG signals. However, a high flow rate may be tolerated even up to a complete stoppage of MCA flow for a short period, up to about 15 seconds to 1 minute.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">Thus, the controller <b>1130</b> can optimize embolic debris capture by automatically increasing the reverse flow only during limited time periods which correspond to periods of heightened risk of emboli generation during a procedure. These periods of heightened risk include the period of time while an interventional device (such as a dilatation balloon for pre or post stenting dilatation or a stent delivery device) crosses the plaque P. Another period is during an interventional maneuver such as deployment of the stent or inflation and deflation of the balloon pre- or post-dilatation. A third period is during injection of contrast for angiographic imaging of treatment area. During lower risk periods, the controller can cause the reverse flow rate to revert to a lower, baseline level. This lower level may correspond to a low reverse flow rate in the ICA, or even slight antegrade flow in those patients with a high ECA to ICA perfusion pressure ratio.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">In a flow regulation system where the user manually sets the state of flow, there is risk that the user may not pay attention to the state of retrograde flow (high or low) and accidentally keep the circuit on high flow. This may then lead to adverse patient reactions. In an embodiment, as a safety mechanism, the default flow rate is the low flow rate. This serves as a fail safe measure for patient's that are intolerant of a high flow rate. In this regard, the controller <b>1130</b> can be biased toward the default rate such that the controller causes the system to revert to the low flow rate after passage of a predetermined period of time of high flow rate. The bias toward low flow rate can be achieved via electronics or software, or it can be achieved using mechanical components, or a combination thereof. In an embodiment, the flow control actuator <b>1165</b> of the controller <b>1130</b> and/or valve(s) <b>1115</b> and/or pump(s) <b>1110</b> of the flow control regulator <b>125</b> are spring loaded toward a state that achieves a low flow rate. The controller <b>1130</b> is configured such that the user may over-ride the controller <b>1130</b> such as to manually cause the system to revert to a state of low flow rate if desired.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">In another safety mechanism, the controller <b>1130</b> includes a timer <b>1170</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>) that keeps time with respect to how long the flow rate has been at a high flow rate. The controller <b>1130</b> can be programmed to automatically cause the system <b>100</b> to revert to a low flow rate after a predetermined time period of high flow rate, for example after 15, 30, or 60 seconds or more of high flow rate. After the controller reverts to the low flow rate, the user can initiate another predetermined period of high flow rate as desired. Moreover, the user can override the controller <b>1130</b> to cause the system <b>100</b> to move to the low flow rate (or high flow rate) as desired.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">In an exemplary procedure, embolic debris capture is optimized while not causing patient tolerance issues by initially setting the level of retrograde flow at a low rate, and then switching to a high rate for discreet periods of time during critical stages in the procedure. Alternately, the flow rate is initially set at a high rate, and then verifying patient tolerance to that level before proceeding with the rest of the procedure. If the patient shows signs of intolerance, the retrograde flow rate is lowered. Patient tolerance may be determined automatically by the controller based on feedback from the anatomical data sensor <b>1140</b> or it may be determined by a user based on patient observation. The adjustments to the retrograde flow rate may be performed automatically by the controller or manually by the user. Alternately, the user may monitor the flow velocity through the middle cerebral artery (MCA), for example using TCD, and then to set the maximum level of reverse flow which keeps the MCA flow velocity above the threshold level. In this situation, the entire procedure may be done without modifying the state of flow. Adjustments may be made as needed if the MCA flow velocity changes during the course of the procedure, or the patient exhibits neurologic symptoms.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">Exemplary Mechanisms to Regulate Flow</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">The system <b>100</b> is adapted to regulate retrograde flow in a variety of manners. Any combination of the pump <b>1110</b>, valve <b>1115</b>, syringe <b>1120</b>, and/or variable resistance component <b>1125</b> can be manually controlled by the user or automatically controlled via the controller <b>1130</b> to adjust the retrograde flow rate. Thus, the system <b>100</b> can regulate retrograde flow in various manners, including controlling an active flow component (e.g., pump, syringe, etc.), reducing the flow restriction, switching to an aspiration source (such as a pre-set VacLock syringe, Vacutainer, suction system, or the like), or any combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">In the situation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref> where an external receptacle or reservoir is used, the retrograde flow may be augmented in various manners. The reservoir has a head height comprised of the height of the blood inside the reservoir and the height of the reservoir with respect to the patient. Reverse flow into the reservoir may be modulated by setting the reservoir height to increase or decrease the amount of pressure gradient from the CCA to the reservoir. In an embodiment, the reservoir is raised to increase the reservoir pressure to a pressure that is greater than venous pressure. Or, the reservoir can be positioned below the patient, such as down to a level of the floor, to lower the reservoir pressure to a pressure below venous or atmospheric pressure.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">The variable flow resistance in shunt <b>120</b> may be provided in a wide variety of ways. In this regard, flow resistance component <b>1125</b> can cause a change in the size or shape of the shunt to vary flow conditions and thereby vary the flow rate. Or, the flow resistance component <b>1125</b> can re-route the blood flow through one or more alternate flow pathways in the shunt to vary the flow conditions. Some exemplary embodiments of the flow resistance component <b>1125</b> are now described.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A, <b>12</b>B, <b>12</b>C, and <b>12</b>D</figref>, in an embodiment the shunt <b>120</b> has an inflatable bladder <b>1205</b> formed along a portion of its interior lumen. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A and <b>12</b>C</figref>, when the bladder <b>1205</b> is deflated, the inner lumen of the shunt <b>120</b> remains substantially unrestricted, providing for a low resistance flow. By inflating the bladder <b>1205</b>, however, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>B and <b>12</b>D</figref>, the flow lumen can be greatly restricted, thus greatly increasing the flow resistance and reducing the flow rate of atrial blood to the venous vasculature. The controller <b>1130</b> can control inflation/deflation of the bladder <b>1205</b> or it can be controlled manually by the user.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">Rather than using an inflatable internal bladder, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>D</figref>, the cross-sectional area of the lumen in the shunt <b>120</b> may be decreased by applying an external force, such as flattening the shunt <b>120</b> with a pair of opposed plates <b>1405</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>A-<b>13</b>D</figref>. The opposed plates are adapted to move toward and away from one another with the shunt <b>120</b> positioned between the plates. When the plates <b>1405</b> are spaced apart, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>A and <b>13</b>C</figref>, the lumen of the shunt <b>120</b> remains unrestricted. When the plates <b>1405</b> are closed on the shunt <b>120</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>B and <b>13</b>D</figref>, in contrast, the plates <b>1405</b> constrict the shunt <b>120</b>. In this manner, the lumen remaining in shunt <b>120</b> can be greatly decreased to increase flow resistance through the shunt. The controller <b>1130</b> can control movement of the plates <b>1405</b> or such movement can be controlled manually by the user.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>A and <b>14</b>B</figref>, the available cross-sectional area of the shunt <b>120</b> can also be restricted by axially elongating a portion <b>1505</b> of the shunt <b>120</b>. Prior to axial elongation, the portion <b>1505</b> will be generally unchanged, providing a full luminal flow area in the portion <b>1505</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref>. By elongating the portion <b>1505</b>, however, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>B</figref>, the internal luminal area of the shunt <b>120</b> in the portion <b>1505</b> can be significantly decreased and the length increased, both of which have the effect of increasing the flow resistance. When employing axial elongation to reduce the luminal area of shunt <b>120</b>, it will be advantageous to employ a mesh or braid structure in the shunt at least in the portion <b>1505</b>. The mesh or braid structure provides the shunt <b>120</b> with a pliable feature that facilitates axial elongation without breaking. The controller <b>1130</b> can control elongation of the shunt <b>120</b> or such it can be controlled manually by the user.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b>A-<b>15</b>D</figref>, instead of applying an external force to reduce the cross-sectional area of shunt <b>120</b>, a portion of the shunt <b>120</b> can be made with a small diameter to begin with, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b>A and <b>15</b>C</figref>. The shunt <b>120</b> passes through a chamber <b>1600</b> which is sealed at both ends. A vacuum is applied within the chamber <b>1600</b> exterior of the shunt <b>120</b> to cause a pressure gradient. The pressure gradient cause the shunt <b>120</b> to increase in size within the chamber <b>120</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>B and <b>12</b>D</figref>. The vacuum may be applied in a receptacle <b>1605</b> attached to a vacuum source <b>1610</b>. Conversely, a similar system may be employed with a shunt <b>120</b> whose resting configuration is in the increased size. Pressure may be applied to the chamber to shrink or flatten the shunt to decrease the flow resistance. The controller <b>1130</b> can control the vacuum or it can be controlled manually by the user.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">As yet another alternative, the flow resistance through shunt <b>120</b> may be changed by providing two or more alternative flow paths. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>A</figref>, the flow through shunt <b>120</b> passes through a main lumen <b>1700</b> as well as secondary lumen <b>1705</b>. The secondary lumen <b>1705</b> is longer and/or has a smaller diameter than the main lumen <b>1700</b>. Thus, the secondary lumen <b>1705</b> has higher flow resistance than the main lumen <b>1700</b>. By passing the blood through both these lumens, the flow resistance will be at a minimum. Blood is able to flow through both lumens <b>1700</b> and <b>1705</b> due to the pressure drop created in the main lumen <b>1700</b> across the inlet and outlet of the secondary lumen <b>1705</b>. This has the benefit of preventing stagnant blood. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>B</figref>, by blocking flow through the main lumen <b>1700</b> of shunt <b>120</b>, the flow can be diverted entirely to the secondary lumen <b>1705</b>, thus increasing the flow resistance and reducing the blood flow rate. It will be appreciated that additional flow lumens could also be provided in parallel to allow for a three, four, or more discrete flow resistances. The shunt <b>120</b> may be equipped with a valve <b>1710</b> that controls flow to the main lumen <b>1700</b> and the secondary lumen <b>1705</b> with the valve <b>1710</b> being controlled by the controller <b>1130</b> or being controlled manually by the user. The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b>A and <b>16</b>B</figref> has an advantage in that this embodiment in that it does not require as small of lumen sizes to achieve desired retrograde flow rates as some of the other embodiments of variable flow resistance mechanisms. This is a benefit in blood flow lines in that there is less chance of clogging and causing clots in larger lumen sizes than smaller lumen sizes.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">The shunt <b>120</b> can also be arranged in a variety of coiled configurations which permit external compression to vary the flow resistance in a variety of ways. Arrangement of a portion of the shunt <b>120</b> in a coil contains a long section of the shunt in a relatively small area. This allows compression of a long length of the shunt <b>120</b> over a small space. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>A and <b>17</b>B</figref>, a portion of the shunt <b>120</b> is wound around a dowel <b>1805</b> to form a coiled region. The dowel <b>1805</b> has plates <b>1810</b><i>a </i>and <b>1810</b><i>b </i>which can move toward and away from each other in an axial direction. When plates <b>1810</b><i>a </i>and <b>1810</b><i>b </i>are moved away from each other, the coiled portion of the shunt <b>105</b> is uncompressed and flow resistance is at a minimum. The shunt <b>120</b> is large diameter, so when the shunt is non-compressed, the flow resistance is low, allowing a high-flow state. To down-regulate the flow, the two plates <b>1810</b><i>a </i>and <b>1810</b><i>b </i>are pushed together, compressing the coil of shunt <b>120</b>. By moving the plates <b>1810</b><i>a </i>and <b>1810</b><i>b </i>together, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>B</figref>, the coiled portion of the shunt <b>120</b> is compressed to increase the flow resistance. The controller <b>1130</b> can control the plates or they can be controlled manually by the user.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">A similar compression apparatus is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b>A and <b>18</b>B</figref>. In this configuration, the coiled shunt <b>120</b> is encased between two movable cylinder halves <b>1905</b><i>a </i>and <b>1905</b><i>b</i>. The halves <b>1905</b><i>a </i>and <b>1905</b><i>b </i>can slide along dowel pins <b>1910</b> to move toward and away from one another. When the cylinder halves <b>1905</b> are moved apart, the coiled shunt <b>120</b> is uncompressed and flow resistance is at a minimum. When the cylinder halves <b>1905</b> are brought together, the coiled shunt <b>120</b> is compressed circumferentially to increase flow resistance. The controller <b>1130</b> can control the halves <b>1905</b> or they can be controlled manually by the user.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>19</b>A through <b>19</b>D</figref>, the shunt <b>120</b> may also be wound around an axially split mandrel <b>2010</b> having wedge elements <b>2015</b> on opposed ends. By axially translating wedge elements <b>2015</b> in and out of the split mandrel <b>2010</b>, the split portions of the mandrel are opened and closed relative to one another, causing the coil of tubing to be stretched (when the mandrel portions <b>2010</b> are spread apart, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>C, <b>19</b>D</figref>) or relaxed (when the mandrel portions <b>2010</b> are closed, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>A, <b>19</b>B</figref>.) Thus, when the wedge elements <b>2015</b> are spaced apart, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>19</b>A and <b>19</b>B</figref>, the outward pressure on the shunt <b>120</b> is at a minimum and the flow resistance is also at a minimum. By driving the wedge elements <b>2015</b> inwardly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>19</b>C and <b>19</b>D</figref>, the split mandrel halves <b>2020</b> are forced apart and the coil of shunt <b>120</b> is stretched. This has the dual effect of decreasing the cross sectional area of the shunt and lengthening the shunt in the coiled region, both of which lead to increased flow resistance.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b>A and <b>20</b>B</figref> show an embodiment of the variable resistance component <b>1125</b> that uses a dowel to vary the resistance to flow.

A dowel <b>2040</b> can move into and out of a portion of the internal lumen <b>2035</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>A</figref>, when the dowel <b>2040</b> is inserted into the internal lumen <b>2035</b>, the internal lumen <b>2035</b> is annular with a cross-sectional area that is much smaller than the cross-sectional area of the internal lumen <b>2035</b> when the dowel is not present. Thus, flow resistance increases when the dowel <b>2040</b> is positioned in the internal lumen <b>2035</b>. The annular internal lumen <b>2035</b> has a length S that can be varied by varying the portion of the dowel <b>2040</b> that is inserted into the lumen <b>2035</b>. Thus, as more of the dowel <b>2040</b> is inserted, the length S of the annular lumen <b>2035</b> increases and vice-versa.

When the cap <b>2050</b> is locked or tightened, the cap <b>2050</b> exerts pressure against the O-ring <b>2055</b> to tighten it against the dowel <b>2040</b> in a sealed engagement.

Initially, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b>A</figref>, the distal sheath <b>605</b> of the arterial access device <b>110</b> is introduced into the common carotid artery CCA. As mentioned, entry into the common carotid artery CCA can be via a transcervical or transfemoral approach. After the sheath <b>605</b> of the arterial access device <b>110</b> has been introduced into the common carotid artery CCA, the blood flow will continue in antegrade direction AG with flow from the common carotid artery entering both the internal carotid artery ICA and the external carotid artery ECA, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0156">The venous return device <b>115</b> is then inserted into a venous return site, such as the internal jugular vein IJV (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b>A-<b>21</b>E</figref>). The shunt <b>120</b> is used to connect the flow lines <b>615</b> and <b>915</b> of the arterial access device <b>110</b> and the venous return device <b>115</b>, respectively (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>). In this manner, the shunt <b>120</b> provides a passageway for retrograde flow from the atrial access device <b>110</b> to the venous return device <b>115</b>. In another embodiment, the shunt <b>120</b> connects to an external receptacle <b>130</b> rather than to the venous return device <b>115</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0157">Once all components of the system are in place and connected, flow through the common carotid artery CCA is stopped, typically using the occlusion element <b>129</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b>B</figref>. The occlusion element <b>129</b> is expanded at a location proximal to the distal opening of the sheath <b>605</b> to occlude the CCA. Alternately, the tourniquet <b>2105</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>) or other external vessel occlusion device can be used to occlude the common carotid artery CCA to stop flow therethrough. In an alternative embodiment, the occlusion element <b>129</b> is introduced on second occlusion device <b>112</b> separate from the distal sheath <b>605</b> of the arterial access device <b>110</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>. The ECA may also be occluded with a separate occlusion element, either on the same device <b>110</b> or on a separate occlusion device.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0158">At that point retrograde flow RG from the external carotid artery ECA and internal carotid artery ICA will begin and will flow through the sheath <b>605</b>, the flow line <b>615</b>, the shunt <b>120</b>, and into the venous return device <b>115</b> via the flow line <b>915</b>. The flow control assembly <b>125</b> regulates the retrograde flow as described above. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b>B</figref> shows the occurrence of retrograde flow RG. While the retrograde flow is maintained, a stent delivery catheter <b>2110</b> is introduced into the sheath <b>605</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b>C</figref>. The stent delivery catheter <b>2110</b> is introduced into the sheath <b>605</b> through the hemostasis valve <b>615</b> and the proximal extension <b>610</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b>A-<b>21</b>E</figref>) of the arterial access device <b>110</b>. The stent delivery catheter <b>2110</b> is advanced into the internal carotid artery ICA and a stent <b>2115</b> deployed at the bifurcation B, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b>D</figref>.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0159">The rate of retrograde flow can be increased during periods of higher risk for emboli generation for example while the stent delivery catheter <b>2110</b> is being introduced and optionally while the stent <b>2115</b> is being deployed. The rate of retrograde flow can be increased also during placement and expansion of balloons for dilatation prior to or after stent deployment. An atherectomy can also be performed before stenting under retrograde flow.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0160">Still further optionally, after the stent <b>2115</b> has been expanded, the bifurcation B can be flushed by cycling the retrograde flow between a low flow rate and high flow rate. The region within the carotid arteries where the stent has been deployed or other procedure performed may be flushed with blood prior to reestablishing normal blood flow. In particular, while the common carotid artery remains occluded, a balloon catheter or other occlusion element may be advanced into the internal carotid artery and deployed to fully occlude that artery. The same maneuver may also be used to perform a post-deployment stent dilatation, which is typically done currently in self-expanding stent procedures. Flow from the common carotid artery and into the external carotid artery may then be reestablished by temporarily opening the occluding means present in the artery. The resulting flow will thus be able to flush the common carotid artery which saw slow, turbulent, or stagnant flow during carotid artery occlusion into the external carotid artery. In addition, the same balloon may be positioned distally of the stent during reverse flow and forward flow then established by temporarily relieving occlusion of the common carotid artery and flushing. Thus, the flushing action occurs in the stented area to help remove loose or loosely adhering embolic debris in that region.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0161">Optionally, while flow from the common carotid artery continues and the internal carotid artery remains blocked, measures can be taken to further loosen emboli from the treated region. For example, mechanical elements may be used to clean or remove loose or loosely attached plaque or other potentially embolic debris within the stent, thrombolytic or other fluid delivery catheters may be used to clean the area, or other procedures may be performed. For example, treatment of in-stent restenosis using balloons, atherectomy, or more stents can be performed under retrograde flow. In another example, the occlusion balloon catheter may include flow or aspiration lumens or channels which open proximal to the balloon. Saline, thrombolytics, or other fluids may be infused and/or blood and debris aspirated to or from the treated area without the need for an additional device. While the emboli thus released will flow into the external carotid artery, the external carotid artery is generally less sensitive to emboli release than the internal carotid artery. By prophylactically removing potential emboli which remain, when flow to the internal carotid artery is reestablished, the risk of emboli release is even further reduced. The emboli can also be released under retrograde flow so that the emboli flows through the shunt <b>120</b> to the venous system, a filter in the shunt <b>120</b>, or the receptacle <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162">After the bifurcation has been cleared of emboli, the occlusion element <b>129</b> or alternately the tourniquet <b>2105</b> can be released, reestablishing antegrade flow, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b>E</figref>. The sheath <b>605</b> can then be removed.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0163">A self-closing element may be deployed about the penetration in the wall of the common carotid artery prior to withdrawing the sheath <b>605</b> at the end of the procedure. Usually, the self-closing element will be deployed at or near the beginning of the procedure, but optionally, the self-closing element could be deployed as the sheath is being withdrawn, often being released from a distal end of the sheath onto the wall of the common carotid artery. Use of the self-closing element is advantageous since it affects substantially the rapid closure of the penetration in the common carotid artery as the sheath is being withdrawn. Such rapid closure can reduce or eliminate unintended blood loss either at the end of the procedure or during accidental dislodgement of the sheath. In addition, such a self-closing element may reduce the risk of arterial wall dissection during access. Further, the self-closing element may be configured to exert a frictional or other retention force on the sheath during the procedure. Such a retention force is advantageous and can reduce the chance of accidentally dislodging the sheath during the procedure. A self-closing element eliminates the need for vascular surgical closure of the artery with suture after sheath removal, reducing the need for a large surgical field and greatly reducing the surgical skill required for the procedure.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0164">The disclosed systems and methods may employ a wide variety of self-closing elements, typically being mechanical elements which include an anchor portion and a self-closing portion. The anchor portion may comprise hooks, pins, staples, clips, tine, suture, or the like, which are engaged in the exterior surface of the common carotid artery about the penetration to immobilize the self-closing element when the penetration is fully open. The self-closing element may also include a spring-like or other self-closing portion which, upon removal of the sheath, will close the anchor portion in order to draw the tissue in the arterial wall together to provide closure. Usually, the closure will be sufficient so that no further measures need be taken to close or seal the penetration. Optionally, however, it may be desirable to provide for supplemental sealing of the self-closing element after the sheath is withdrawn. For example, the self-closing element and/or the tissue tract in the region of the element can be treated with hemostatic materials, such as bioabsorbable polymers, collagen plugs, glues, sealants, clotting factors, or other clot-promoting agents. Alternatively, the tissue or self-closing element could be sealed using other sealing protocols, such as electrocautery, suturing, clipping, stapling, or the like. In another method, the self-closing element will be a self-sealing membrane or gasket material which is attached to the outer wall of the vessel with clips, glue, bands, or other means. The self-sealing membrane may have an inner opening such as a slit or cross cut, which would be normally closed against blood pressure. Any of these self-closing elements could be designed to be placed in an open surgical procedure, or deployed percutaneously.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0165">In another embodiment, carotid artery stenting may be performed after the sheath is placed and an occlusion balloon catheter deployed in the external carotid artery. The stent having a side hole or other element intended to not block the ostium of the external carotid artery may be delivered through the sheath with a guidewire or a shaft of an external carotid artery occlusion balloon received through the side hole. Thus, as the stent is advanced, typically by a catheter being introduced over a guidewire which extends into the internal carotid artery, the presence of the catheter shaft in the side hole will ensure that the side hole becomes aligned with the ostium to the external carotid artery as the stent is being advanced. When an occlusion balloon is deployed in the external carotid artery, the side hole prevents trapping the external carotid artery occlusion balloon shaft with the stent which is a disadvantage of the other flow reversal systems. This approach also avoids &#x201c;jailing&#x201d; the external carotid artery, and if the stent is covered with a graft material, avoids blocking flow to the external carotid artery.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0166">In another embodiment, stents are placed which have a shape which substantially conforms to any preexisting angle between the common carotid artery and the internal carotid artery. Due to significant variation in the anatomy among patients, the bifurcation between the internal carotid artery and the external carotid artery may have a wide variety of angles and shapes. By providing a family of stents having differing geometries, or by providing individual stents which may be shaped by the physician prior to deployment, the physician may choose a stent which matches the patient's particular anatomy prior to deployment. The patient's anatomy may be determined using angiography or by other conventional means. As a still further alternative, the stent may have sections of articulation. These stents may be placed first and then articulated in situ in order to match the angle of bifurcation between a common carotid artery and internal carotid artery. Stents may be placed in the carotid arteries, where the stents have a sidewall with different density zones.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0167">In another embodiment, a stent may be placed where the stent is at least partly covered with a graft material at either or both ends. Generally, the stent will be free from graft material and the middle section of the stent which will be deployed adjacent to the ostium to the external carotid artery to allow blood flow from the common carotid artery into the external carotid artery.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0168">In another embodiment, a stent delivery system can be optimized for transcervical access by making them shorter and/or more rigid than systems designed for transfemoral access. These changes will improve the ability to torque and position the stent accurately during deployment. In addition, the stent delivery system can be designed to align the stent with the ostium of the external carotid artery, either by using the external carotid occlusion balloon or a separate guide wire in the external carotid artery, which is especially useful with stents with sideholes or for stents with curves, bends, or angulation where orientation is critical. In an embodiment, a catheter of the stent delivery system has a working length that is particularly configured for insertion into the artery via a transcervical access location in the artery. In an exemplary embodiment, the working length is within the range of approximately 40-60 cm. In another embodiment, the working length is within the range of approximately 40-75 cm.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0169">In certain embodiments, the shunt is fixedly connected to the arterial access sheath and the venous return sheath so that the entire assembly of the replaceable flow assembly and sheaths may be disposable and replaceable as a unit. In other instances, the flow control assembly may be removably attached to either or both of the sheaths.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0170">In an embodiment, the user first determines whether any periods of heightened risk of emboli generation may exist during the procedure. As mentioned, some exemplary periods of heightened risk include (1) during periods when the plaque P is being crossed by a device; (2) during an interventional procedure, such as during delivery of a stent or during inflation or deflation of a balloon catheter or guidewire; (3) during injection or contrast. The foregoing are merely examples of periods of heightened risk. During such periods, the user sets the retrograde flow at a high rate for a discreet period of time. At the end of the high risk period, or if the patient exhibits any intolerance to the high flow rate, then the user reverts the flow state to baseline flow. If the system has a timer, the flow state automatically reverts to baseline flow after a set period of time. In this case, the user may re-set the flow state to high flow if the procedure is still in a period of heightened embolic risk.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0171">In another embodiment, if the patient exhibits an intolerance to the presence of retrograde flow, then retrograde flow is established only during placement of a filter in the ICA distal to the plaque P. Retrograde flow is then ceased while an interventional procedure is performed on the plaque P. Retrograde flow is then re-established while the filter is removed. In another embodiment, a filter is places in the ICA distal of the plaque P and retrograde flow is established while the filter is in place. This embodiment combines the use of a distal filter with retrograde flow.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">Interventional Catheters</heading><p id="p-0173" num="0172"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref> shows a schematic view of an exemplary interventional catheter <b>2205</b>.

In an embodiment, the catheter <b>2205</b> is sized and shaped for insertion into an access sheath of a carotid artery access system. The proximal region of the catheter <b>2205</b> may have one or more mechanical or electro-mechanical control mechanisms <b>2207</b> for controlling different components on or near a distal end of the catheter <b>2205</b>.

For example, the disclosed catheters can be used to reduce the number of device exchanges required to perform a carotid artery stenting (CAS) procedure. The catheters also permit flush, aspiration, and clearing of embolic debris to a higher degree than prior systems. Moreover, the disclosed catheters provide augmented embolic protection through the use of intermittent internal carotid artery occlusion during specific, critical points in a carotid artery treatment procedure. When the catheter is used in a retrograde flow embolic protection system as described above, flow restrictions in the retrograde flow circuit are decreased through use of the disclosed interventional catheters. The retrograde flow regimen can be optimized by communicating the timing of balloon deflation (which is a period of heightened risk for embolic debris release) to a retrograde flow controller. Furthermore, the interventional catheters used here are optimally sized for insertion through a transcervical access into the carotid artery. The length of these catheters may be up to half, or even shorter, than currently available catheters which are designed for a transfemoral access route. This shorter length makes the catheters much easier to manipulate, and makes catheter exchanges simpler and more rapid. In an exemplary embodiment, the working length of the catheter is within the range of approximately 40-60 cm. In another embodiment, the working length is within the range of approximately 40-75 cm.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0174">Although the devices and methods described hereinafter are sometimes described in the context of treatment of the carotid artery (such as carotid artery stenting), it should be appreciated that the devices and methods described herein would also be useful for angioplasty, artherectomy, and any other interventional procedures which might be carried out in the carotid arterial system, particularly at a location near the bifurcation between the internal and external carotid arteries.

Alternately, a separate micro-catheter is positioned proximal to the distal occlusion balloon <b>3115</b> and is used to flush the stented area. If a separate inflatable guide wire with inflatable balloon is used, the annular space between the two balloons can be used for flushing.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0203">In a variation of the dual balloon catheter, a catheter <b>3305</b> has a single balloon <b>3310</b> with a dual diameter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>33</b>A-<b>33</b>C</figref>. The single balloon <b>3310</b> is configured to inflate to two different diameters based on the inflation pressure of the balloon. A distal portion <b>3315</b> of the balloon <b>3310</b> can inflate to a larger diameter than a proximal portion <b>3320</b> of the balloon <b>3310</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b>A</figref>. At a low inflation pressure, the distal portion <b>3315</b> is inflated to a larger diameter and occludes the artery, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b>B</figref>. At higher inflation pressures, the proximal portion <b>3320</b> inflates to a diameter the same as or greater than the distal portion <b>3315</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b>C</figref>. In this manner, the proximal portion <b>3320</b> dilates the &#x201c;waist&#x201d; of the stented segment. The balloon <b>3310</b> may be designed of layered low and high durometer material, or reinforced material in which the reinforcement provides a limit to the expansion dimensions, such that the distal occlusive segment will not over inflate during the higher pressure inflation.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0204">Interventional Catheter with Occlusion Balloon and Flush Capabilities</p><p id="p-0206" num="0205">In another embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>34</b></figref>, an occlusion balloon catheter <b>3405</b> has a distal occlusion balloon <b>3410</b> and an internal flush lumen through which a flush solution can be passed. The flush lumen communicates with side holes <b>3415</b> positioned proximal of the occlusion balloon <b>3410</b>. In use in a carotid artery setting, the balloon catheter <b>3405</b> is positioned in the internal carotid artery such that the occlusion balloon <b>3410</b> can be inflated to block the internal carotid artery. The flush lumen may be used to flush or aspirate the internal carotid artery proximal to the occlusion balloon <b>3410</b>.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0206">In an embodiment, the catheter <b>3405</b> is exchanged over a guide wire under retrograde flow so that the balloon <b>3410</b> is at a position distal to the stented segment. This allows the catheter <b>3405</b> to flush the internal carotid artery stented segment during a period when the common carotid artery occlusion is opened to forward flush arterial flow from the internal carotid artery and common carotid artery into the external carotid artery. The flush lumen can be either integral to the occlusion balloon catheter <b>3410</b>, via a separate elongate member having a lumen, coaxial to the catheter <b>3410</b> via a separate tubing over the outside of the catheter shaft, or via a separate single lumen infusion catheter. In the case of a separate lumen or a coaxial outer member, the flush solution may exit from side holes in the shaft of the catheter.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0207">As described in previous embodiments, the side holes used for flushing may be configured to flush in a variety of directions, to improve the efficiency of the flush solution to clear embolic debris which may be trapped, or loosely attached, in the stented region. In this regard, the side holes can point in a desired direction or can have a shape or size the facilitates directional flow of the flushing solution.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0208">Stent Delivery Catheter with Occlusion Balloon</p><p id="p-0210" num="0209">There are now described stent delivery catheters that are combined with an occlusion balloon. Such systems can be used in a carotid artery retrograde flow system where the retrograde flow rate is insufficient to reverse the flow in the internal carotid artery when the stent delivery catheter is in a delivery sheath. The combined stent delivery catheter and occlusion balloon provides protection against embolic release distal of the stent delivery location. The combined stent delivery catheter and occlusion balloon can also be used with an embolic protection system which uses distal occlusion, as described by Imran.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0210">In an embodiment, the occlusion balloon is an inflatable guide wire with a removable inflation device. The stent delivery catheter can be backloaded onto the inflatable guide wire once the balloon is inflated. That is, the distal end of the stent delivery catheter can be loaded over the proximal end of the guidewire. The inflated balloon occludes the internal carotid artery during positioning of the stent delivery catheter and deployment of the stent. The inflatable guide wire can also be pre-loaded onto the stent delivery catheter such that the stent delivery catheter cannot be removed from the stent delivery catheter. The inflatable guide wire is longer than the stent delivery catheter by a fixed amount (such as around 5-10 cm). Once inflatable guide wire is positioned in the artery and inflated, the stent delivery catheter is moved into place and the stent is deployed. The occlusion balloon can remain inflated during any number of steps which are perceived as higher risk for embolic generation, for example the removal of the stent delivery catheter, flushing, and opening the CCA to arterial flow into the ECA.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0211">In another embodiment, the stent delivery catheter has an internal lumen that receives a low profile balloon catheter. In a first variation of this embodiment, the low profile balloon is a fixed or movable wire catheter. In another embodiment, the low profile balloon is an over the wire or rapid exchange catheter that is placed over a standard PTCA catheter.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0212">In yet another embodiment, an occlusion balloon is built into a central lumen of a stent delivery catheter. The balloon is used for vessel occlusion and is positioned a predetermined distance from the stent. This embodiment would have a low profile but does not permit independent movement between the stent delivery catheter and the occlusion balloon.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0213">Stent Delivery Catheter with Flush or Aspiration Lumen</p><p id="p-0215" num="0214">There are now described stent delivery catheters that are combined with a capability for aspiration at the distal end. Such systems can be used to replace or augment reverse flow embolic protection systems by providing a port for aspiration at the target lesion site. The combined stent delivery and aspiration catheter provides improved protection against embolic release at the site of the stent delivery location. The catheter includes an aspiration lumen that may be connected at a proximal end with a lower pressure receptacle or the venous side of a flow reversal circuit. Alternately, because the aspiration lumen is a relatively high flow resistance lumen, the lumen may be connected to an active aspiration source such as a syringe, suction pump, or the like.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0215">In one embodiment, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>35</b></figref>, the stent delivery catheter <b>3505</b> has an internal coaxial tubing member <b>3510</b> that terminates at the distal tapered tip. The annular space between the tubing <b>3510</b> and the central guidewire lumen comprises an aspiration lumen <b>3515</b>. Side holes <b>3520</b> at the distal tip create entry ports for aspiration of blood and potential capture of embolic debris. The proximal end of the aspiration lumen <b>3515</b> is connection to a passive or active aspiration source.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0216">In another embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>36</b></figref>, the guidewire lumen <b>3515</b> doubles as the aspiration lumen. The distal end of the guidewire lumen <b>3515</b> becomes an entry port <b>3525</b> into the aspiration lumen. Side holes <b>3520</b> in the tapered tip create additional entry ports for augmented aspiration. The guidewire lumen <b>3515</b> is connected to an aspiration port at the proximal end. Typically, the guidewire enters the stent delivery catheter through a hemostasis valve; the aspiration source may be connected to a Y-arm in fluid communication with this hemostasis valve.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0217">In an alternate method of use, the aspiration lumen may be used for flushing solution. In this method of use, the flow solution may increase flow past the lesion in procedures where the stent is being deployed in conjunction with reverse flow embolic protection, to improve the efficiency of the reverse flow hemodynamics to clear embolic debris which may be trapped, or loosely attached, in the stented region.</p><p id="p-0219" num="0218">Low Profile Stent Delivery Catheter</p><p id="p-0220" num="0219">In cases where the arterial access sheath is used as part of a reverse flow embolic protection system, for example as described by Criado or Chang, it would be desirable to minimize the level of flow resistance caused by the presence of the stent delivery catheter in the arterial access sheath. In reverse flow protocols, where the stent delivery catheter adds resistance to reverse flow by taking up cross sectional area in the arterial access sheath, one way of minimizing the flow resistance is to reduce the diameter of the stent delivery catheter. This can be achieved by employing a retractable or removable stent constraint sleeve on the stent delivery catheter. In an embodiment, the stent constraint sleeve can be retracted sufficient to be removed entirely from the remainder of the catheter. Removal of the outer retractable sleeve during stent delivery from the arterial access sheath would reduce the flow restriction and thus increases the level of reverse flow, which in turn may improve the capture of embolic debris. In the case of a transfemoral approach in the reverse flow procedure, the outer sleeve can be nearly or completely removed from the catheter in a peel-away manner. To facilitate this, the outer sleeve may have a slit along its length or is split along its length. Alternately, the outer sleeve can also be a tear-away sleeve which is pre-weakened along the length and is split on removal, or a sleeve which is slit with a blade on removal.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0220">In the case of a transcervical access for a reverse flow procedure in which only the distal-most portion of the stent delivery catheter is in the access sheath, the outer sleeve retraction length does not need to be as great as in the transfemoral approach. In this case, the outer sleeve may only need to retract from this distal portion of the stent delivery catheter, for example about 25 cm, in order to be removed from the reverse flow path. This may still be facilitated by a slit or split sheath on the proximal portion of the sheath. For procedures where the arterial access sheath is stepped in size, for example the distal end which enters the artery is a smaller diameter than the remaining proximal portion of the sheath, the sleeve retraction only needs to be long enough to pull the sleeve back into the proximal section of the arterial access sheath with the larger diameter.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0221">It may be important during initial retraction of the sleeve to preserve precise and/or reversible distal sheath retraction during the actual stent delivery portion of the procedure. After the stent is deployed, however, the retraction of the sleeve can be optimized for rapid removal. For example, a distal portion (such as a 4 cm distal portion) of the sleeve is adapted to be manually retracted by the operator. This permits precise placement of the stent as the sleeve can be moved back and forth during the stent placement process. The remainder of the sheath retraction can be implemented automatically, such as using a spring-loaded retraction system with a trigger or other control mechanism on the proximal end of the stent delivery catheter. Actuation of the control mechanism causes automatic and rapid retraction of the sleeve.</p><p id="p-0223" num="0222">In another embodiment, the stent constraint sleeve is adapted to be able to shrink in size. For example, after the sleeve is pulled back from stent, the sleeve shrinks down from a larger size that fits over the stent to a smaller size that fits over the stent delivery shaft. This may be accomplished by constructing the stent constraint sleeve out of a compressible spring construction such as a braid, or an elastomeric material.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0223">In yet another embodiment, the stent constraint is not a fully circumferential sleeve, but is something of lower profile, such as a rip cord tightly wound around stent, a partial sleeve with at least one lace-up thread that pulls out to open up sleeve, wire(s) intertwined with stent that are pulled for release, or wire(s) engaged with shaft under stent which is pulled to release the stent. The stent can also be constrained using wires which can be released with an electric current or magnetic constraint which can be released by intravascular or external magnet. In another variation, the distal portion of constraint sleeve is a tube but proximal the portion is a rod or rods which can pull back the distal portion of the sleeve.</p><p id="p-0225" num="0224">Balloon Deflation Sensor</p><p id="p-0226" num="0225">In any of the embodiments with an inflation balloon, a sensor device can be coupled to the balloon inflation device wherein the sensor device can sense the moment of balloon deflation and output a signal to the controller <b>1112</b> of the reverse flow system <b>100</b>. The sensor can be located on the balloon inflation device of at some location between the balloon inflation device and the balloon. The signal may automatically instruct the reverse flow system to switch to a higher level of reverse flow, either by reducing the flow restriction, switching to an active flow system, or switching to an aspiration source such as a pre-set VacuLok syringe, Vacutainer, suction system, or the like. This signal may be electronic, such as an electromechanical vacuum sensor, or hydraulic, using the pressure drop to activate a pressure valve or similar hydraulically-controlled flow control component.</p><p id="p-0227" num="0226">Although embodiments of various methods and devices are described herein in detail with reference to certain versions, it should be appreciated that other versions, embodiments, methods of use, and combinations thereof are also possible.
