Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The technical solution of this application may be applied to the designing and manufacturing of the semiconductor memory, for example, a commonly used DRAM semiconductor memory. Usually, a DRAM uses capacitors for the storage of electric charges, and a binary bit value is represented by the storage capacity of the electric charges, that is, one storage unit may be configured to represent a logic state of one bit. Due to phenomena such as leakage current of the transistors, the stored electric charges are liable to be loss, and then the stability of the data storage is affected. Therefore, the DRAM needs to be periodically charged and discharged to refresh the storage data and achieve dynamic storage.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">As two capacitor plates, a dielectric layer and other structures are required, a capacitor structure needs to occupy a greater space size, such that a size of a single storage unit is hard to be reduced, and the overall size of the memory is also limited by this bottleneck. Therefore, the embodiments of this application provide a memory, in which the transfer and storage of electric charges are implemented by storage layers interconnected with the conductive channels of the transistors. In this way, a storage unit structure of 1T0C is achieved without a capacitor, thereby effectively reducing the size of the memory.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The technical solution of this application is further described in details below in combination with the drawings and the embodiments.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">An embodiment of this application provides a memory. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the memory <b>100</b> includes a substrate <b>110</b>, at least one pair of transistors <b>120</b> on a surface of the substrate <b>110</b>, and storage layers <b>130</b>. Conductive channels <b>121</b> of the transistors <b>120</b> extend in a direction perpendicular to the surface of the substrate. The storage layers <b>130</b> are located on one side of the transistors <b>120</b> and are interconnected with the conductive channels <b>121</b> of the transistors <b>120</b>. The pair of transistors <b>120</b> is located between two storage layers <b>130</b> corresponding to the pair of transistors <b>120</b>. The storage layers <b>130</b> are configured to store electric charges and transfer the electric charges between the storage layers and the conductive channels interconnected therewith.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The substrate herein may be a semiconductor substrate formed by a silicon material or other wafer materials. The device structures of the memory may be manufactured and formed on the surface of the substrate through various semiconductor device processes, for example, doping, photoetching, depositing, cleaning and other processes. A layered patterning structure is formed on the surface of the substrate, and further the semiconductor device is formed.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the embodiments of this application, a plurality of transistors are formed on the surface of the substrate, and the transistors are arranged on the surface of the substrate in pairs. Multiple pairs of transistors may be arranged in rows and columns so as to form transistor arrays for forming the memory.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Herein, the conductive channels of the transistors extend in a direction perpendicular to the surface of the substrate, which may occupy less surface area of the substrate, compared with the transistors formed in a direction parallel to the surface of the substrate. Thus, the utilization rate of the substrate area is improved.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the embodiments of the disclosure, the storage of electric charges is implemented through the storage layer interconnected with the conductive channel of each transistor, and the storage layers can transfer electric charges between the storage layers and the conductive channels, so as to change the logic state of the storage unit. The storage layers may be a semiconductor material or a metal material which is capable of storing electrons or holes. The storage layers are interconnected with the conductive channels. When voltage is applied to the transistors, the electric charges accumulates in the conductive channels and potential difference is formed between the conductive channels and the storage layers, so that electric charge transferring occurs between the conductive channels and the storage layers to change the amount of the electric charges in the storage layers.
