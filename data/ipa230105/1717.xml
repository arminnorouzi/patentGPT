The pressure in the recording head is decreased as the ink in the recording head is ejected, thereby charging the ink into the recording head from the ink tank through the tube.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The ink in the tube is acted upon by an inertia force due to acceleration/deceleration when the recording head moves back and forth. In recording an image that requires less ink ejected from the recording head, the pressure in the recording head is not decreased so much by the ejection of the ink. This causes the pressure in the recording head to be gradually increased because of an inertia force due to the movement of the recording head.

also referred to as &#x201c;recording apparatus&#x201d;) according to an embodiment. This ink-jet recording apparatus <b>1</b> is a what-is-called serial-scan recording apparatus, which moves a recording head <b>3</b> in a main scanning direction (Y-direction) crossing the conveying direction (X-direction) of a recording medium P to form an image. In the drawings, the X-direction is the conveying direction of the recording medium P, the Y-direction is the carriage moving direction, and the Z-direction is a vertical direction.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the configuration and operation in recording of the recording apparatus <b>1</b> will be described. First, a conveying motor (not shown) is driven to cause a conveying roller <b>26</b> via a gear to convey the recording medium P to a position facing the recording head <b>3</b>. When the recording medium P is conveyed to the position facing the recording head <b>3</b>, a carriage <b>2</b> is moved along guide rails <b>5</b> extending in the main scanning direction by a carriage motor (not shown). The driving force from the carriage motor to the carriage <b>2</b> is transmitted through a carriage belt <b>6</b>. Instead of the carriage belt <b>6</b>, another driving system may be employed, such as a combination of a lead screw rotationally driven by the carriage motor and extending in the main scanning direction and an engaging portion that is provided at the carriage <b>2</b> and that engages with the groove of the lead screw.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Ink is ejected from the ink ejection port (nozzle) of the recording head <b>3</b>, which is detachably attached to the carriage <b>2</b>, at a timing based on a position signal obtained by an encoder (not shown) while the carriage <b>2</b> is being moved to record an image with a fixed band width corresponding to the range of the nozzle array. The ink ejected from the recording head <b>3</b> is supplied from an ink supply system <b>8</b> through supply tubes <b>4</b>. One band is a recordable area of the recording head <b>3</b> by moving in one direction. In this embodiment, the recording head <b>3</b> moves at a scanning speed of 40 inches per second to eject ink at the timing of 600 dpi (dots/inch). Thereafter, the recording medium P is conveyed, on which recording is performed for the next band width. With this recording apparatus <b>1</b>, the recording medium P corresponding to the band width may be conveyed between the individual scanning operations, or alternatively, the recording medium P may not be conveyed by one band width every scanning operations but may be conveyed after a plurality of scanning operations. Alternatively, multipath recording may be performed in which a plurality of scanning operations using different nozzles for one band and a sheet conveying operation are performed by recording data that is thinned out using a predetermined mask every scanning operations and then performing sheet feeding for about 1/n band and performing scanning again.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The recording head <b>3</b> is fitted with a flexible wiring board for supplying a signal pulse for driving ejection, a head-temperature regulating signal, and so on. The other end of the flexible wiring board connects to a control unit including one or more control circuits that control the recording apparatus <b>1</b> (described later).</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">Configuration of Recording Head</heading><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic perspective view of the recording head <b>3</b> mounted on the carriage <b>2</b> of the recording apparatus <b>1</b> seen from the direction in which ink is ejected.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The recording head <b>3</b> is capable of ejecting different tones (including colors and tints) of ink in the main scanning direction S. In this embodiment, the recording head <b>3</b> can eject black (Bk), gray (Gy), light gray (Lgy), light cyan (Lc), cyan (C), light magenta (Lm), magenta (M), and yellow (Y) inks. A plurality of recording elements corresponding to the individual inks arranged in the X-direction and nozzle arrays <b>101</b> to <b>108</b> corresponding to the individual recording elements are juxtaposed in the Y-direction on two ejecting element substrates <b>100</b>. The individual recording element arrays connect to the ink supply tubes <b>4</b> at connections <b>25</b>. The inks are supplied from the ink supply system <b>8</b> through the connections <b>25</b> to the individual recording element arrays through ink channels in the recording head <b>3</b>. Each supplied ink forms a meniscus on the surface of each nozzle because of surface tension. The inks do not go out of the recording head <b>3</b> unless a pressure change exceeding the withstand pressure of the meniscus occurs. While this embodiment takes the recording head capable of ejecting eight colors of ink as an example, there is no limitation to the colors and the number of colors of the inks in the recording head. Specifically, a recording head that ejects a single black (Bk) ink or a recording head that ejects four-color inks, such as black (Bk), cyan (C), magenta (M), yellow (Y) inks, may be used.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">Block Diagram</heading><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating the configuration of the control system of the ink-jet recording apparatus <b>1</b>.

However, in this section, a diagram of description will be made using a diagram of a one-color ink supply system <b>8</b> and a supply tube <b>4</b> is used for illustration.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the ink supply system <b>8</b> includes a main tank <b>9</b>, a subtank <b>10</b>, a hollow tube <b>11</b> connecting the subtank <b>10</b> and the main tank <b>9</b>, a buffer chamber <b>12</b>, and a communicating tube <b>21</b> connecting the main tank <b>9</b> and the buffer chamber <b>12</b>. The supply tube <b>4</b> is made of a flexible material and connects the subtank <b>10</b> and the recording head <b>3</b> together. The supply tube <b>4</b> connected to the subtank <b>10</b> includes an extending portion parallel to the moving direction of the carriage <b>2</b> and a bent portion at an intermediate position so as to connect to the left of the recording head <b>3</b> in the drawing, creeping around inside the recording apparatus main body. The supply tube <b>4</b> includes a portion parallel to guide rails <b>5</b>. The arrangement of the supply tube <b>4</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is given for illustrative purposes only.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The main tank <b>9</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is detachably attached to the recording apparatus main body. In the ink-jet recording apparatus <b>1</b> of this embodiment, the main tank <b>9</b> contains a larger quantity of ink than the subtank <b>10</b>. The main tank <b>9</b> communicates with the subtank <b>10</b> through the hollow tube <b>11</b> and communicates with the buffer chamber <b>12</b> through the communicating tube <b>21</b>. The main tank <b>9</b> connects to the hollow tube <b>11</b> and the communicating tube <b>21</b> at the bottom of the main tank <b>9</b> in an attached state and is sealed except the connecting portion.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The main tank <b>9</b> discussed herein may be of a detachable cartridge type or in the form of injecting ink from a bottle into the main tank <b>9</b>.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="2">Variations in Pressure</heading><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As described above, the supply tube <b>4</b> connected to the subtank <b>10</b> has the extending portion parallel to the Y-direction in which the carriage <b>2</b> moves and the bent portion at which the supply tube <b>4</b> is folded so as to be connected to the &#x2212;Y side (the left in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) of the recording head <b>3</b> and which creeps around in the recording apparatus main body. The length L from the bent portion to the connection <b>25</b> with the recording head <b>3</b> varies with the reciprocating motion of the carriage <b>2</b>. In this embodiment, the bent portion is located on the left of the apparatus. For this reason, in moving the carriage <b>2</b> on the forward path from the right to the left in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the length L from the bent portion to the connection <b>25</b> with the recording head <b>3</b> decreases with the movement of the supply tube <b>4</b>. In moving the carriage <b>2</b> on the backward path form the left to the right, the length L from the bent portion to the connection <b>25</b> with the recording head <b>3</b> increases with the movement of the supply tube <b>4</b>. When the supply tube <b>4</b> moves following the reciprocating motion of the carriage <b>2</b>, an inertia force acts on the ink <b>7</b> in the portion with the length L from the bent portion to the connection <b>25</b> with the recording head <b>3</b>. This inertia force is generated when the carriage <b>2</b> is accelerated and decelerated to move the ink <b>7</b> in the supply tube <b>4</b> connected to the recording head <b>3</b>, thereby causing a dynamic pressure that changes the internal pressure of the recording head <b>3</b>.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="2">Parameters of Pressure Variations</heading><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Variations in the internal pressure of the recording head <b>3</b> are determined from the length L between the supply tube <b>4</b> and the connection <b>25</b> with the recording head <b>3</b> and the acceleration or deceleration. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of the ink supply system in which a pressure measuring device <b>19</b> is disposed at the supply tube <b>4</b>, illustrating measurement of variations in pressure due to the movement of ink when the carriage <b>2</b> is accelerated. The variations in pressure immediately in front of the connection <b>25</b> with the recording head <b>3</b> when the carriage <b>2</b> is accelerated from the left to the right in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> are measured. At that time, the acceleration of the carriage <b>2</b> and the length L from the bent portion of the supply tube <b>4</b> to the connection <b>25</b> with the recording head <b>3</b> at the start of acceleration of the carriage <b>2</b> are changed. The result of measurement is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. The horizontal axis indicates the product of the acceleration of the carriage <b>2</b> and the length L from the bent portion of the supply tube <b>4</b> to the connection <b>25</b> with the recording head <b>3</b> at the start of acceleration. The vertical axis indicates the pressure variations converted from the output values of the pressure measuring device <b>19</b>. This graph shows they are in a proportional relationship. This shows that pressure variations in the recording head <b>3</b> increase as the acceleration of the carriage <b>2</b> increases and the length L from the bent portion of the supply tube <b>4</b> to the connection <b>25</b> with the recording head <b>3</b> increases.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The relationship with deceleration was measured in the same way. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows the result of measurement as in the measurement at acceleration. The horizontal axis indicates the product of the deceleration of the carriage <b>2</b> and the length L from the bent portion of the supply tube <b>4</b> to the connection <b>25</b> with the recording head <b>3</b> at the start of deceleration, and the vertical axis indicates the pressure variations converted from the output values of the pressure measuring device <b>19</b>. This shows that the values at deceleration are in a proportional relationship, as at acceleration. The proportional relationship does not change although the inclination changes according to the diameter of the supply tube <b>4</b> or the viscosity of the ink.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Next, pressure variations were measured when acceleration and deceleration are repeated, although intermittently. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows the result in which the horizontal axis indicates the time, and the vertical axis indicates the velocity of the carriage <b>2</b> in a dotted line and the measured pressure values in a solid line. First, the carriage <b>2</b> is moved from the state in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> to the left. This causes an inertia force to act on the ink <b>7</b> in the supply tube <b>4</b>, moving the ink <b>7</b> rightward, and as a result, the measured pressure value shifts to positive side. When the carriage <b>2</b> reaches a target velocity, the carriage <b>2</b> moves to a predetermined position at the constant velocity, and at the left end, the velocity reaches zero, so that the carriage <b>2</b> is decelerated. When deceleration is started, the ink <b>7</b> in the supply tube <b>4</b> is acted upon by an inertia force, so that the ink <b>7</b> moves leftward. This causes the measured pressure value to shift to the negative pressure side. When the carriage <b>2</b> moves from the left end toward the right end, the opposite phenomenon to the phenomenon described above occurs. Accordingly, the pressure shifts to the negative side at acceleration, and shifts to the positive side at deceleration at the right end. In other words, in the reciprocating motion of the carriage <b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the acceleration/deceleration when the carriage <b>2</b> is on the right changes to the positive pressure side, and the acceleration/deceleration when the carriage <b>2</b> is on the left changes to the negative pressure side. In this measurement, the carriage <b>2</b> is moved back and forth intermittently, so that the pressure varied up and down with zero as the reference. Variations in the pressure when the carriage <b>2</b> is continuously moved back and force will be described hereinbelow.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="2">Changes in Variation Reference</heading><p id="p-0046" num="0045">To describe decompression due to variations in pressure caused by continuous reciprocating motion and ink ejection, the pressure measuring device <b>19</b> was disposed immediately in front of the recording head <b>3</b> in the recording apparatus <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, and variations in pressure during printing were measured.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A and <b>9</b>B</figref> illustrate image patterns used in this examination. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref> illustrates an image pattern simulating a high discharge rate, 20 ng/600 dpi per unit area. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref> illustrates an image pattern simulating a low discharge rate, 1 ng/600 dpi.

In the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref> in which the printing ink volume is as much as 20 ng/600 dpi, the reference value (a-0) of pressure variations changed vertically while being kept at about 0 mmAq because the pressure in the recording head <b>3</b> decreased because the ink was ejected from the nozzle. In contrast, in the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref> in which the printing ink volume is as small as 1 ng/600 dpi, little ink was ejected, so that the pressure in the recording head <b>3</b> did not decrease. As a result, the reference value (b-0) of pressure variations shifted gradually to the positive pressure side because of the continuous reciprocating motion of the carriage <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The reason why the reference value (b-0) shifts to the positive pressure side will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A and <b>11</b>B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A and <b>11</b>B</figref> are schematic diagrams illustrating how the length L from the bent portion of the supply tube <b>4</b> to the connection <b>25</b> with the recording head <b>3</b> changes with the reciprocating motion of the carriage <b>2</b> in the image forming apparatus used in this examination. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>, when the carriage <b>2</b> is on the right, the length L from the bent portion of the supply tube <b>4</b> to the connection <b>25</b> with the recording head <b>3</b> is large. When the carriage <b>2</b> moves to the left, the length L decreases, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>. Since the inertia force that acts on the ink <b>7</b> in the supply tube <b>4</b> is proportional to the product of the acceleration/deceleration of the carriage <b>2</b> and the length L from the bent portion of the supply tube <b>4</b> to the connection <b>25</b> with the recording head <b>3</b>, as described above, the range of variations to the positive side on the right side is larger than the range of variation to the negative side on the left side. This caused the reference value (b-0) of pressure variations in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>, in which the printing ink quantity is as small as 1 ng/600 dpi, to shift to the positive pressure side.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="2">Controlling Acceleration/Deceleration</heading><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the recording apparatus <b>1</b> of this embodiment, the acceleration/deceleration area of the carriage <b>2</b> is at both right and left ends in the reciprocating scanning operation, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A and <b>11</b>B</figref>. For this reason, the acceleration/deceleration need to be controlled separately for the end at which the pressure is shifted to the positive side (a first area) and for the end at which the pressure is shifted to the negative side (a second area).</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The first area and the second area will be described hereinbelow.</p><heading id="h-0017" level="2">First Area</heading><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The first area in this specification will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>.

Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>, the supply tube <b>4</b> is disposed on the left of the recording head <b>3</b>.

In this case, the first area and the second area are reversed left to right.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The first and second areas depend on, not the positional relationship in the recording apparatus <b>1</b>, but an increase and decrease in the internal pressure of the recording head <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">This embodiment will be described in more detail with reference to examples and comparative examples.

The discharge rate per dot of the recording head <b>3</b> used in this example was about 11.4 ng. For the definition of the average duty cycle, application of two dots of ink to a 1/600 inch (600 dpi) square was defined as 100% duty cycle. Accordingly, if the average duty cycle per band is 100%, the application amount is 22.8 ng/600 dpi. In this example, the average duty cycle per band for black (Bk) was set to 5% (the application amount in this case can be converted to 1.1 ng/600 dpi), and for the other colors, the average duty cycle per band was set to 0%.</p><heading id="h-0021" level="2">First Area and Second Area</heading><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In the embodiments and comparative examples below, the first area is the acceleration/deceleration area shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>, that is, the right of the recording apparatus <b>1</b>, and the second area is the acceleration/deceleration area shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>, that is, the left of the recording apparatus <b>1</b>. The acceleration/deceleration in the individual acceleration/deceleration areas can be controlled independently. The acceleration/deceleration is determined by the CPU <b>401</b>, and the carriage-motor driving circuit <b>414</b> moves the carriage <b>2</b> on the basis of an acceleration control signal sent from the CPU <b>401</b>. In this example, the acceleration in the first area was set to 1.0 m/s/s, and the deceleration in the first area was set to 20.0 m/s/s, and both of the acceleration and the deceleration in the second area were set to 20.0 m/s/s, as shown in Table 4.

A solid image as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref> was input as the image data so that the duty cycle was uniform among the individual bands. If print streaks occur even partially, it is determined that &#x201c;misfiring occurred&#x201d;, and if the image quality was high without print streaks, it was determined that &#x201c;misfiring not occurred&#x201d;. The time taken to print one sheet of A1-size paper was also measured, and it was evaluated as throughput. The results are shown in Table 4.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In Example 1, the absolute value of acceleration at acceleration in the first area was set significantly less than the absolute value of acceleration at acceleration and the absolute value of acceleration at deceleration in the second area. This allows the increase in the reference line of pressure variations to be kept low at about 25 mmAq, causing no print streaks due to misfiring. Thus, the print result was &#x201c;misfiring not occurred&#x201d;. Thus, it was determined that deterioration of images can be prevented as compared with Comparative Example 1 in which all of the acceleration/deceleration was 20.0 m/s/s, and the increase in the reference line of pressure variations was about 75 mmAq, so that misfiring occurred.</p><heading id="h-0023" level="1">Example 2</heading><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In Example 2, the absolute value of acceleration at deceleration in the first area was set to 1.0 m/s/s, and the absolute value of acceleration at acceleration was set to 20.0 m/s/s.

The absolute value of acceleration at deceleration in the first area was set to 22.0 m/s/s greater than 20.0 m/s/s. The result of printing was &#x201c;Misfiring not occurred&#x201d;. The reference line of pressure variations was 40 mmAq, which is slightly greater than those of Example 1 and Example 2. However, no print streaks occurred, in other words, the deterioration of image quality could be prevented, as compared with Comparative Example 1.</p><heading id="h-0025" level="1">Example 4</heading><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In Example 4, the absolute value of acceleration at acceleration in the first area was set to 20.0 m/s/s, and the absolute value of acceleration at deceleration in the first area was set to 1.0 m/s/s. In contrast, the absolute value of acceleration at acceleration in the second area was set to 18 m/s/s, and the absolute value of acceleration at deceleration in the second area was set to 20.0 m/s/s. In other words, the absolute value of acceleration at acceleration in the first area was set greater than the absolute value of acceleration at acceleration in the second area, and the absolute value of acceleration at acceleration and the absolute value of acceleration at deceleration in the second area were set greater than the absolute value of acceleration at deceleration in the first area. The result of printing was &#x201c;Misfiring not occurred&#x201d;, and the reference value of pressure variations was 30 mmAq, which is slightly greater than those of Example 1 and Example 2. This may be caused by the decrease in inertia force that decreases the pressure in the recording head <b>3</b> due to the decrease in the absolute value of acceleration at deceleration in the second area.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The results in Example 3 and Example 4 show that it is effective when at least one of the absolute value of acceleration at acceleration and the absolute value of acceleration at deceleration in the first area is less than the absolute value of acceleration at acceleration or deceleration in the second area.</p><heading id="h-0026" level="1">Example 5</heading><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In Example 5, the absolute values of acceleration at acceleration and deceleration in the first area were set to 3.0 m/s/s, which is less than the absolute value 20.0 m/s/s of acceleration at acceleration and deceleration in the second area. The printing duty cycle was set to 3% which is lower than those of Examples 1 to 4. Under the above conditions, the reference line of pressure variations during printing was about 0 mmAq without variations. As a result, no misfiring occurred, providing a high-quality image. This showed greater effects than those of Examples 1 to 4 in terms of pressure variations, allowing coping with the low duty cycle.</p><heading id="h-0027" level="1">Example 6</heading><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In Example 6, the difference between the absolute values of acceleration/deceleration in the first area and the absolute values of acceleration/deceleration in the second area was set smaller than that in Example 5. Specifically, the absolute values of acceleration/deceleration in the first area were set to 5.0 m/s/s, and the absolute values of acceleration/deceleration in the second area were set to 13.0 m/s/s. As a result, the reference line of pressure variations was increased by about 15 mmAq from that of Example 5, but no misfiring occurred, providing a high-quality image.</p><heading id="h-0028" level="1">Example 7</heading><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In Example 7, a recording head <b>3</b> including the damper shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> was used. The ink supplied to the recording head <b>3</b> passes through an ink communication port <b>17</b> and an ink channel <b>18</b> into an ink chamber <b>22</b>. The ink in the ink chamber <b>22</b> is ejected to the outside of the recording head <b>3</b> through an ejection port <b>16</b> by driving a recording element <b>20</b>. The recording head <b>3</b> includes a damper chamber <b>15</b>. The damper chamber <b>15</b> is made of a flexible member and varies in size according to the pressure. The absolute values of acceleration/deceleration in the first area were set to 18 m/s/s, and the absolute values of acceleration/deceleration in the second area were set to 20 m/s/s. Since the absolute value of acceleration/deceleration in the first area is greater than those of Examples 1 to 6, the ink is acted upon by a large inertia force, and the reference line of pressure variations reached 70 mmAq, which is larger than those of above examples. However, the result of printing caused no print streaks and misfiring. The result of this example showed that the presence of the damper allows withstanding larger pressure variations than Examples 1 to 6.</p><heading id="h-0029" level="1">Example 8</heading><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In this example, the acceleration/deceleration is decreased to the minimum required for the average duty cycle of image data. In addition, for an image partly including a low duty cycle portion, the absolute values of acceleration/deceleration in the first area are decreased only for a band corresponding to that portion, and in the viewpoint of throughput, acceleration/deceleration is not limited for the entire A1-size paper. Accordingly, in Example 8, the recording head <b>3</b> without the damper, used in Examples 1 to 6, was used, and a table in which acceleration/deceleration for each band corresponding to the average duty cycle of the band is set was prepared in the ROM <b>402</b> of the recording apparatus <b>1</b>. In Table 1, the individual bands are numbered for description. The first band at which printing is started is numbered <b>1</b>, and an image corresponding to 78 bands was input in total. The average duty cycle of the image pattern was decreased every 13 bands. The bands whose average duty cycle per band is 88% and 50% eject a large amount of ink, which may reduce a sufficient pressure in the recording head <b>3</b>, so that the absolute value of acceleration/deceleration is not decreased. In other words, when the average duty cycle is half or higher (50% or higher) the maximum value (100%), the absolute value of acceleration/deceleration is nor decreased. In addition, for the bands of No. 66 to 78 in which no print data is present in one band, the absolute value of acceleration/deceleration is not decreased. This is because no ink is ejected, which does not trigger a meniscus break, reducing the tendency to break the meniscus even if the pressure in the recording head <b>3</b> is high to some degree. For the bands of Nos. 27 to 65, the absolute values of acceleration at acceleration/deceleration in the first area were set less than the absolute value 20.0 m/s/s of the acceleration at acceleration/deceleration in the second area according to the respective average duty cycles per band by multiplying proportions set according to the duty cycles per band. For example, for the band of Nos. 27 to 39, the absolute value was set to 20.0&#xd7;0.93=18.6 m/s/s. As a result, no print streaks occurred in all the bands, providing a high-quality image. In addition, the reference line of pressure variations increased by about 30 mmAq at the maximum, which is an increase that can be withstood by the recording head <b>3</b> without a damper. The throughput can be made almost equal to that of Comparative Example 2 in which all of accelerations/decelerations are 20.0 mm/s/s because of a minimum required decrease in acceleration/deceleration, allowing outputting a high-quality image at high speed.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Average Duty Cycle per Band and Acceleration/</entry></row><row><entry>Deceleration Setting Table in EXAMPLE 8</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="70pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="70pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="77pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Average Duty </entry><entry>Ratio of Acceleration </entry><entry/></row><row><entry>Cycle per</entry><entry>to Deceleration First </entry><entry>Corresponding </entry></row><row><entry>Band [%]</entry><entry>Area/Second Area</entry><entry>Band No.</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="70pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="70pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="77pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>88</entry><entry>1 (Not to Be Executed)</entry><entry>&#x2002;1-13</entry></row><row><entry>50</entry><entry>1 (Not to Be Executed)</entry><entry>14-26</entry></row><row><entry>20</entry><entry>0.93</entry><entry>27-39</entry></row><row><entry>10</entry><entry>0.80</entry><entry>40-52</entry></row><row><entry>3</entry><entry>0.73</entry><entry>53-65</entry></row><row><entry>0</entry><entry>1 (Not to Be Executed)</entry><entry>66-78</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><heading id="h-0030" level="1">Example 9</heading><p id="p-0071" num="0069">In Example 9, image data is input also for colors other than black (Bk). Image data that uses cyan (C), magenta (M), and yellow (Y) in addition to black (Bk), as shown in Table 2, was prepared. Table 2 shows an extract of image data of one band in A1-size image data and the ratio of acceleration/deceleration corresponding to the image data. Comparison among the average duty cycles of the individual colors in one band showed that the color with the highest average duty cycle was cyan (C) at 20%. In contrast, the color with the lowest average duty cycle was yellow (Y) at 0%. The higher the average printing duty cycle per band, the more the pressure in the recording head <b>3</b> decreased in pressure, which is advantageous against misfiring, as described in this specification. Accordingly, the most disadvantageous color against misfiring among the colors in Table 2 is yellow (Y) whose average duty cycle per band is 0%. However, if no ink is ejected at all, there is no cause to break the meniscus, allowing withstanding a certain amount of high pressure, as described in Example 8. Thus, the color that is most disadvantageous against misfiring in Table 2 is magenta (M) whose the average duty cycle is 3%. This example employed the ratio of acceleration/deceleration corresponding to magenta (M) with the lowest average duty cycle 3% among the ejected colors and set the absolute value of acceleration at acceleration and deceleration in the first area to 0.62 times the absolute value of acceleration at acceleration and deceleration in the second area.

The printing environmental temperature was increased to 40&#xb0; C. from 25&#xb0; C. in Examples 1 to 9, and the same examination was performed. Ink temperature changes according to the printing environmental temperature. The viscosity decreases as the ink temperature increases, which makes it easier for the ink in the supply tube <b>4</b> to move with an equivalent inertia force. In this example, the viscosity 3.5 mPa&#xb7;s of black (Bk) at 25&#xb0; C. changed to 2.4 mP&#xb7;s when heated to 40&#xb0; C. To prevent the reference value of pressure variations from increasing, Table 3 for the printing environmental temperature was prepared on the basis of the above measurement results and was recorded in the ROM <b>402</b> of the recording apparatus <b>1</b>. The printing environmental temperature was measured using a temperature and humidity sensor <b>23</b> provided in the recording apparatus <b>1</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A and <b>11</b>B</figref>.

In addition, the recording head includes a damper for absorbing dynamic pressure as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>. As a result, misfiring occurred to cause print streaks despite the installation of the damper. A pressure exceeding the capacity broke the meniscus of the nozzle despite of the installation of the damper.</p><heading id="h-0038" level="1">Comparative Example 4</heading><p id="p-0093" num="0085">In Comparative Example 4, the absolute value of acceleration at acceleration and deceleration in the first area was set to 13.0 m/s/s, and the absolute value of acceleration at acceleration and deceleration in the second area was set to 10.0 m/s/s. Although the acceleration/deceleration were decreased as a whole, the absolute value of acceleration/deceleration in the first area was greater than the absolute value of acceleration/deceleration in the second area. As a result, the reference value of pressure variations in the recording head increased significantly, causing misfiring. This shows that the relative relationship between the acceleration/deceleration in the first area and the acceleration/deceleration in the second area has an effect.</p><heading id="h-0039" level="1">Comparative Example 5</heading><p id="p-0094" num="0086">In Comparative Example 5, the image data used in Example 9 was input, and the acceleration and the deceleration in the first area were set to 18.0 m/s/s suited to the average duty cycle per band of black (Bk). As a result, for black (Bk), the average duty cycle was high, forming a high-quality image, but for magenta (M) with the low average duty cycle, print streaks due to misfiring occurred.</p><p
