Background</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Cabin air systems, in currently available aircraft, are designed to provide a safe and comfortable cabin environment at cruising altitudes. These cruising altitudes can reach upwards of 40,000 feet. At these altitudes, the aircraft cabin is pressurized to enable the passengers and crew to breathe normally. Air enters a passenger area from overhead distribution outlets that run the length of the passenger cabin.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">These outlets can be designed to generate circular airflow patterns within the cabin. Air can be exhausted through air returns located in sidewalls near the floor of the cabin. These grills can be located along the length of the cabin and on both sides of the cabin. Air can be supplied and exhausted from the passenger area on a continuous basis. Current personal air distribution nozzles include gaspers located above passenger seats. However, gaspers may provide an uncomfortably high velocity of air flow that can create a draft.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, it would be desirable to have a method and apparatus that ta es into account at least some of the issues discussed above, as well as other possible issues.

The illustrative examples recognize and take into account that current aircraft environmental control systems attempt to minimize passengers from inhaling contaminants by reducing the total number of contaminants in an aircraft cabin. A purity level of the cabin air is commonly defined as a percentage of contaminant free air in a volume of sampled air.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Cabin air purity levels generally increase when the air inside the cabin is replaced by air from outside the cabin. Obtaining more outside air to inject into the cabin has the drawback of increasing aircraft fuel consumption. To reduce aircraft fuel consumption, the aircraft industry has increasingly reduced outside airflow into the cabin. To compensate for the reduced airflow into the cabin, yet maintain allowable cabin air purity levels, the aircraft industry standard has been to add large cabin air recirculation systems that incorporate large high efficiency particulate air filters. Cabin air recirculation systems often include large and powerful fans to draw cabin air through the filters and inject the air back into the cabin. Cabin air recirculation systems can include an air distribution assembly. Current cabin air distribution assemblies tend to inject high velocity non-laminar streams of air into the aircraft cabin.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account that a solution should not undesirably cause concerns for emergency egress, create head strike issues, or provide break away issues when the aircraft is in use. The illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account that integrated personal air delivery could be provided in a new aircraft design, but would require multiple years of design, testing, and production. The illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account that the illustrative embodiments provide a retrofit to current passenger seating. The illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account that the illustrative embodiments can provide the benefits equivalent to integrated air delivery designs without recertification of the passenger seats or aircraft. The illustrative embodiments recognize and take into account that the illustrative embodiments can provide the benefits equivalent to integrated air delivery designs without the time for design, testing, and production.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an illustration of an aircraft cabin in which an illustrative embodiment may be implemented.

Contaminants may include without limitation bacteria or virus elements, as well as dust, mold, and/or other allergens or irritants.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Each fan of number of fan systems <b>312</b> comprises at least one of UV sanitizing equipment, an electric filter, or a mechanical air filter. As depicted, fan system <b>316</b> is one of number of fan systems <b>312</b>. Fan system <b>316</b> includes at least one of electric filter <b>318</b>, mechanical filter <b>320</b>, or UV sanitizing equipment <b>322</b>. In some illustrative examples, mechanical filter <b>320</b> is a high efficiency particulate air filter (HEPA filter).</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Each of number of air distribution assemblies <b>314</b> can provide laminar flow to create a barrier that minimizes mixing with the ambient environment. For number of air distribution assemblies <b>314</b> to deliver purified air, the air supplied to number of air distribution assemblies must be purified. Purified air may be delivered from a purified air source. In this illustrative example, the purified air source is number of fan systems <b>312</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Mechanical filter <b>320</b>, such as High efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, can be used to purify air flow. High efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters use pressurized air to flow through the filter. Filter size and material composition of a filter may dictate a pressure required for adequate flow through the filter.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">A pressurization source, such as without limitation, a fan, is required to generate the pressurization. In passenger cabin <b>302</b>, vibration and noise levels created by a motor running the fan, a movement of the fan, and/or by the flow of the air itself, are factors in the design of number of fan systems. It is desirable to maintain vibration and noise levels to within comfortable levels for each individual passenger at each individual seat. It is also desirable to maintain noise levels of all of the fan systems in plurality of ventilation assemblies <b>306</b> to within comfortable levels in passenger cabin <b>302</b> as a whole. Without limitation, U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration Noise standards (29 CFR 1910.95) require employers to have a hearing conservation program in place if workers are exposed to a time-weighted average (TWA) noise level of 85 decibels (dBA) or higher over an 8-hour work shift. Thus, supplying the purified air may utilize number of fan systems <b>312</b> that does not require filters of a size or density that require fans of a size and/or power, or airflow at a rate, that creates excessive noise. In some illustrative examples, it may be desirable to keep noise levels at near a passenger seat headrest below 65 decibels.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Further, if fans in number of fan systems <b>312</b> are too powerful, they may produce an uncomfortably high velocity of air flow near a passenger. Uncomfortably high velocity of air flow can create a draft. Number of fan systems <b>312</b> and manifold <b>358</b>, when present, can be designed to provide a desired pressure and flow rate of purified air. In some illustrative examples, flow to an air distribution assembly of number of air distribution assemblies is at no more than approximately ten cubic feet per minute.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Additional considerations for number of fan systems <b>312</b> includes the power draw and source for a motor driving the fan. Power availability to run number of fan systems <b>312</b> is a consideration in choosing the size and type of purification system within a fan system, such as fan system <b>316</b>. An aircraft environment may not allow for motor weights or power requirements that may be functional in locations such as inside an automobile or in a home or office space.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Ultraviolet purification does not produce a pressure drop, which can allow for smaller and quieter motors that utilize less power than mechanical filter <b>320</b> or electric filter <b>318</b>. UV sanitizing equipment <b>322</b> may use more time to purify air within fan system <b>316</b>. A purification system uses at least one of electric filter <b>318</b>, mechanical filter <b>320</b>, or UV sanitizing equipment <b>322</b> based on desired pressure and flow rate, available power sources, desired noise threshold, and other considerations.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">As depicted, fan system <b>316</b> is connected to outlet <b>370</b> of passenger seat <b>340</b> to receive power.
