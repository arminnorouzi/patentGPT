EP 1 120 237 A2 discloses a pressing device for short-cut fiber material, for example plastic fibers.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">With regard to utilization of plant material as biomass, it is advantageous to compress the harvested plant material into bales for transport purposes and for storage. For this purpose, pressing devices are known in which the loose or pre-compressed plant material is introduced into a pressing space and compressed therein by means of a pressing element. The bale formed in this way is removed from the pressing space. Several bales can be transported together on a vehicle to the utilization location. In particular, gasification of the plant material with release of the energy content of the plant material is possible as utilization.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Different plants can be suitable for such utilization. However, reed (giant Chinese reed, <i>Miscanthus </i>x <i>giganteus</i>, hereafter simplified as &#x201c;<i>Miscanthus</i>&#x201d;) and corn are particularly noteworthy. However, the present invention is not limited to use with one of these plants.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">With regards to a subdivision of the harvested plant material into transport and energy units that are as similar as possible, WO 2014/067512 A1 proposes compressing the plant material to bales with a substantially constant volume and substantially constant density. As a result, it is possible to provide, to a certain extent, manageable &#x201c;energy units&#x201d; in the form of biomass.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><i>Miscanthus </i>and corn, in particular, have relatively long and thick stems, which is a challenge to overcome in the pressing operation. Compared to other plant material, for example straw, much higher forces are required for the compression operation for this reason, as the long stems are much more difficult to bend and, moreover, intertwine with each other. Higher pressing forces, however, require a greater dimensioning of the pressing device. However, this is contrary to the desire to make the pressing device mobile, if possible, so that the plant material can be compressed at the harvesting site, especially on the agricultural land itself, and does not have to be transported loosely to the pressing site.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Apart from the pressing device described in WO 2014/067512 A1, the pressing devices described in the other publications mentioned are not suitable for compressing long-stemmed plant material, in particular <i>Miscanthus </i>and corn, while achieving a degree of compression sufficient for economic utilization.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">An object underlying the present invention to provide a pressing device which has better compression properties for, in particular, long-stemmed plant material.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">A further object underlying the present invention to provide a pressing system with a pressing device and a method for providing a bale with a pressing device.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In a first aspect of the invention, a pressing device for plant material, in particular long-stemmed plant material for providing a bale made from the plant material, is provided. The pressing device comprises a pressing chamber having a pressing space to which plant material can be supplied by means of a supply apparatus via a supply opening, a pressing element movable from an initial position into an end position and having a drive apparatus for compressing the plant material, and a binding apparatus. The pressing space is laterally delimited by a pressing box, and an abutment delimits the pressing space, against which the plant material is compressible during the movement of the pressing element to form a first partial bale. A first partial bale provided in this way can be transported through a transport opening of the pressing space into a following space. At least one further partial bale can be provided by means of the pressing element by compressing further plant material introduced into the pressing space against at least one abutment arranged on the pressing chamber. The partial bales can be output via an output opening of the pressing chamber. The two or more partial bales are connectable to form a final bale by means of the binding apparatus.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In a further aspect of the invention, a pressing system with such a pressing device is provided.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a further aspect of the invention, a method for providing a bale by means of a pressing device is provided.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The foregoing summary and the following description may be better understood in conjuction with the drawing figures, of which:</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>: shows a schematic illustration of a preferred embodiment of a pressing system in accordance with the invention, comprising a preferred embodiment of the pressing device in accordance with the invention, for carrying out a preferred exemplary embodiment of the method in accordance with the invention;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>: shows a schematic view of the pressing device from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> in a plan view, wherein pre-bales are compressible with the pressing device to form partial bales and the latter are connectable to form a final bale;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> to <b>11</b></figref>: show the pressing device from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> at successive points in time when creating a plurality of partial bales and a final bale;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> shows a view along the line <b>12</b>-<b>12</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b> and <b>14</b></figref>: show a view similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> of a further preferred embodiment of the pressing device in accordance with the invention at successive points in time; and</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b> and <b>16</b></figref>: show a further schematic depiction of a preferred embodiment of the pressing device in accordance with the invention at successive points in time.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Although the invention is illustrated and described herein with reference to specific embodiments, the invention is not intended to be limited to the details shown. Rather, various modifications may be made in the details within the scope and range of the equivalents of the claims and without departing from the invention.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The present invention relates to a pressing device for in particular long-stemmed plant material for providing a bale made from the plant material, comprising a pressing chamber having a pressing space to which plant material can be supplied by means of a supply apparatus via a supply opening, a pressing element, which is movable from an initial position into an end position having a drive apparatus for compressing the plant material, and a binding apparatus, wherein the pressing space is laterally delimited by a pressing box, and an abutment delimits the pressing space against which the plant material is compressible during the movement of the pressing element to form a first partial bale, wherein a first partial bale provided in this way is transportable through a transport opening of the pressing space into a following space, wherein at least one further partial bale is providable by means of the pressing element by compressing further plant material introduced into the pressing space against at least one abutment arranged on the pressing chamber, wherein the partial bales are output via an output opening of the pressing chamber, and wherein the two or more partial bales are connectable to form a final bale by means of the binding apparatus.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the present invention, consideration is given to the fact that the bales which are output by the pressing device&#x2014;in the present case referred to as &#x201c;final bales&#x201d;&#x2014;should have as uniform a size as possible with regard to economic utilization for energy production, wherein at the same time the highest possible compression is desirable for the use of size and/or weight capacities for transport. The present invention accordingly proposes to provide final bales by connecting individual partial bales, each of which is formed by compressing plant material. A first quantity of plant material is compressed in the pressing space to form a first partial bale and the latter is transported through the transport opening into a following space of the pressing chamber. Subsequently, at least one further partial bale is compressed, and the partial bales can be output from the pressing chamber via the output opening. The partial bales are connected to one another by the binding apparatus, wherein the binding apparatus is preferably arranged on the pressing chamber itself, as a result of which the bound final bale can be output from the pressing chamber.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">With regard to the size of the partial bales being as uniform as possible, it is advantageous for the pressing chamber to comprise a pressing box which laterally surrounds the plant material, wherein preferably a rectangular shape is provided. By moving the pressing element from the initial position into the end position against the abutment, it is possible to achieve small tolerances with respect to the extension of the partial bale in the compression direction, so that a respective partial bale can be provided with relatively high compaction with simultaneously predefined dimensions with a small tolerance. Although the possibility could exist of achieving a comparable degree of compression with a relatively large pressing device in the case of large bales. However, the pressing device in accordance with the invention can be kept structurally compact so that it is preferably suitable for mounting on a vehicle with which an agricultural area can be directly driven over.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">By connecting several partial bales into one final bale, a larger final bale is provided in relation to the partial bale. This offers the advantage that fewer (final) bales have to be handled overall during further processing, in comparison with a high number of smaller partial bales. Furthermore, by connecting two or more partial bales, binding material, in particular strapping material, is saved, since individual partial bales would also have to be bound in order to prevent the plant material from falling apart. The costs of individual bales can be reduced by saving binding material. Weight and space, which is obtained by saving binding material, can be converted to increase the final bales in order to utilize transport capacities as optimally as possible.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The pressing device advantageously comprises a transport apparatus, by means of which the partial bales are transportable from the pressing space into at least one following space and, for example, if present, into the further following spaces, up to the output opening of the pressing chamber. The transport apparatus can comprise, for example, a belt conveyor or a chain conveyor.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">It is expedient for the partial bale and at least one further partial bale to be transportable from the pressing space to the output opening in a working direction of the pressing device. The working direction is preferably straight and defined by the pressing box.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">It is advantageous if the abutment for providing the first partial bale and at least one further abutment for providing the at least one further partial bale are abutments which are different from one another, wherein at least one further abutment and the pressing box delimit the following space and the further plant material is compressible against the first partial bale supported on the at least one further abutment to form at least one further partial bale. After the transfer into the following space, the first partial bale can rest against the further abutment and be supported by it. The next partial bale is compressed by compressing the plant material against the first partial bale. This offers the advantage, for example, that the first partial bale is again subjected to a compression force in order to increase its dimensional stability.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">It is expedient for the pressing device to comprise two or more following spaces arranged one behind the other in a working direction of the pressing device, and two or more abutments, wherein a respective abutment thereof delimits the respective following space against on which respective abutment the first partial bale can be supported during the formation of the further partial bales, and wherein the further plant material is compressible in the pressing space against the respective last-formed partial bale. After the formation of the second partial bale, wherein the first partial bale is supported against the abutment of the first following space, the first partial bale can be transported into a further following space and the second partial bale from the pressing space into the following space. The subsequent (third) partial bale can be compressed by compressing the plant material against the preceding partial bales. A respective following space has an abutment against which the first partial bale can rest in order to be supported by it. The respective last-formed partial bale forms, to a certain extent, the &#x201c;abutment&#x201d; for the compression of the subsequent plant material.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The partial bales can in particular rest against one another.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The pressing chamber preferably comprises the pressing space as a pressing chamber section and a respective one of the above-mentioned following spaces as further pressing chamber sections following the pressing space in the working direction, wherein the output opening of the pressing chamber for the partial bales is arranged on the last pressing chamber section in the working direction. In this way, a compact design of the pressing device can be achieved. In particular, the output opening for the final bale, which is already bound from the individual partial bales, is provided.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In a preferred implementation of the pressing device in practice, it can prove advantageous if a total of five following spaces are provided and the final bale comprises six interconnected partial bales.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">It is advantageously provided that the abutment on the pressing space is an intermediate wall between the pressing space and the following space and is transferable by means of a drive apparatus from a closed position, in which the plant material is compressible against the intermediate wall, into an open position, in which the partial bale is transferable into the following space, and vice versa. The intermediate wall can assume a closed position, so that material can be compressed to the first partial bale against the intermediate wall. After the transfer into the open position, the partial bale can be transported into the following space.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">It may be favorable if the abutment between adjacent following spaces is in each case an intermediate wall between the following spaces and is transferable by means of a drive apparatus from a closed position, in which the first partial bale is supportable against the intermediate wall, into an open position, in which the first partial bale is transportable into the next following space, and vice versa. In the closed position, the respective intermediate wall can form the abutment for the first partial bale. In the open position, the partial bale can be transported into the next following space.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">It can be advantageous if the abutment at the last following space in the working direction is a closing apparatus of a rear wall of the pressing chamber and is transferable by means of a drive apparatus from a closed position closing the output opening of the pressing chamber, in which the first partial bale can be supported against the closing apparatus, into an open position releasing the output opening, in which the partial bales are transportable out of the pressing chamber. The last abutment in the working direction is formed by the closing apparatus on the last following space when the closing apparatus assumes the closed position. In the open position, the partial bales can be output from the pressing chamber via the output opening released in this way. Advantageously, the partial bales are previously joined to form the final bale in the pressing chamber.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The intermediate wall and the closing apparatus can, to some extent, be regarded as &#x201c;bulkheads&#x201d; between the pressing space, between the following spaces and the exit of the pressing chamber, after which a respective bale transport is made possible.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Advantageously, the intermediate wall or the closing apparatus is movable out of the pressing box as a whole or in individual, respectively movable segments transversely to the working direction for transfer from the closed position into the open position and vice versa. For example, the intermediate wall or the closing apparatus comprise two segments which can be pushed into the pressing box, and which can be displaced away from one another for releasing the pressing box.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">It is advantageous if the abutment on the pressing space and at least one further abutment of at least one following space are stationary on the pressing device with respect to a movement in the working direction of the pressing device. As a result, a simple structural configuration of the pressing device can be achieved, in which, in particular, only the pressing element is to be moved in the working direction of the pressing device for the compression of plant material.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Preferred embodiments of the pressing device in accordance with the invention have been presented above in which the first partial bale is supported in each case on a different abutment.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In a different preferred embodiment of the invention, the abutment for providing the first partial bale on the pressing space and the at least one abutment for providing at least one further partial bale are identical, wherein each partial bale is formed by compression of the plant material in the pressing space against this abutment and is subsequently transported into the following space. Each partial bale can be compressed in the pressing space and then transferred through the transport opening into the following space. As a result, for example, a relatively simple design of the pressing device can be achieved.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">It can be provided that a predetermined number of partial bales is collected in the following space and subsequently output through the output opening. For example, the partial bales are output as bound final bales through the output opening.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">It may be favorable if the pressing device comprises two or more following spaces arranged one behind the other in a working direction of the pressing device, which are separated from one another by intermediate walls, wherein the next intermediate wall is released after a respective partial bale has been formed and the partial bales are transportable into the next following space. In this embodiment, the plant material can be compressed in each case against the abutment in the pressing space. The partial bales are transported further into a following space, which can be opened step by step by releasing the respective intermediate wall.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">It is advantageous for the pressing box to have an identical or substantially identical cross-sectional area at the pressing space and at the following space, in particular on the two or more following spaces. As a result, the final bale has relatively small dimensional tolerances transverse to the longitudinal extension defined by the direction of the pressing box.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">It is advantageous if the following space, in particular the two or more following spaces, is designed shorter than the pressing space in the working direction of the pressing device. The plant material that is already compressed into the partial bale does not have to be compressed any further. As a result, a compact design of the pressing device can be achieved by shortening the at least one following space in relation to the pressing space.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The partial bales in the pressing space are preferably formed with a predetermined or predeterminable path of the pressing element from the initial position into the end position and consequently preferably have a uniform length along the compression direction.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In particular, the partial bales are formed with a constant volume. For this purpose, as explained above, a constant or substantially constant cross-sectional area is preferably provided at the pressing box.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">It proves advantageous if a length of at least one following space following the pressing space in the working direction, in particular a length of a respective following space, is equal to the length of the partial bales, defined by the range of movement of the pressing element from the initial position into the end position. This proves to be advantageous, for example, in the embodiment described above, in which the first partial bale is supported on the abutment of the following space in each case and is compressed against the last-formed partial bale. A substantially identical range of movement of the pressing element from the initial position into the end position for forming each partial bale can be used, wherein the partial bales simultaneously have a substantially identical length.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Advantageously, two or more following spaces are provided which are of equal length along the working direction of the pressing device, wherein preferably all the following spaces are of equal length.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">It is advantageous if the final bales formed by the pressing device have dimensions which are adapted to standardized cargo devices. It is advantageous if the final bales are formed in such a way that the capacities for example of a standardized container or a cargo device with dimensions of such a container can be utilized as completely as possible.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Accordingly, it is advantageous, for example, if the pressing space in the end position of the pressing element has a length which corresponds to an integer fraction or approximately or substantially an integer fraction of an internal dimension of a container of the ISO standard 668 for container (i.e., internal dimension divided by an integer).</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In a corresponding manner, it is advantageous if the pressing box has a width and/or a height which corresponds to an integer fraction or approximately or substantially an integer fraction of an internal dimension of a container of the ISO standard 668 for containers.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The container of the two last-mentioned embodiments can in particular be a 20-foot container or a 40-foot container of the standard ISO 668.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Ideally, the final bales are formed in the length, width and/or height such that an interior of a container in accordance with the standard ISO 668 can be filled with the plurality of final bales in a positive-locking manner. For this purpose, the pressing device is designed such that a respective integer fraction of the internal dimension in length, width and/or height corresponds to the dimensions or approximately or substantially the dimensions of the partial bales and/or the final bale.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">It proves advantageous if the final bale has a length, a width and/or a height which corresponds to an integer fraction or approximately or substantially an integer fraction of an internal dimension of a container of the ISO standard 668 for containers, wherein the container is in particular a 20-foot container or a 40-foot container of the standard ISO 668.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In a preferred embodiment of the pressing device in accordance with the invention, a final bale of approximately 196 cm in length can be provided, for example, formed from six partial bales each being approximately 33 cm in length (or alternatively, for example, three partial bales each being approximately 65 cm in length). The width of the partial bales and of the final bale can, for example, be approximately 116 cm, the height for example approximately 79 cm. This provides the possibility, for example, to load a 20-foot ISO 668 standard container with three end bales in length, two end bales in width, and three end bales in height, for a total of 18 bales.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">A pressing accuracy of 1% or less in length, with regard to optimal utilization of the transport capacities, proves advantageous.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The drive apparatus for the pressing element can be configured in different ways, for example mechanically, electrically, hydraulically, pneumatically or by a combination of two or more of the aforementioned properties.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">It proves advantageous if the drive apparatus comprises at least one spindle drive, wherein spindles coupled to the pressing element are arranged laterally next to the supply opening. The spindles, which are electrically driven in particular, make it possible to achieve significantly higher compression compared to conventional connecting rod presses. While a density of the plant material of, for example, approximately 200 kg/m<sup>3 </sup>can be achieved in conventional presses, a density of up to approximately 400 kg/m<sup>3 </sup>can preferably be achieved by using spindle drives. In this way, for example, the capacities in terms of weight of commercially available transport apparatuses can be better utilized.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">For example, four spindles can be provided which are coupled to the pressing element next to corner regions of the supply opening. By providing more than one spindle, in particular four spindles, tilting of the movement of the pressing element can be avoided. The spindles can have their own respective drive or be driven together.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">It is advantageous if the pressing chamber comprises a front wall in which the supply opening is formed and which comprises or forms the pressing element, wherein a closing apparatus is provided, which can be transferred by means of a drive apparatus into an open position, for supplying the plant material into the pressing space, and which closes the supply opening in a closed position, and if the front wall is movable by means of the drive apparatus for compressing the plant material. When the closing apparatus is open, the plant material to be compressed can be introduced into the pressing space. If the closing apparatus assumes the closed position, the front wall is moved, and the plant material is compressed in the pressing space. In this way, a structurally simple configuration of the pressing device can be achieved.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The closing apparatus can be movable completely or in individual, respectively movable segments transversely to the working direction for transfer from the closed position into the open position and vice versa. For example, two segments are provided which are movable toward one another for closing the supply opening and which can be moved in directions pointing away from one another for releasing the supply openings.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In a preferred embodiment, the binding apparatus can be a strapping apparatus. In particular, all partial bales can be provided together with a strapping which encircles them.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">It is advantageous if the binding apparatus is arranged at the pressing chamber and if the final bale can be provided in the pressing chamber by binding the partial bales. This makes it possible to connect the partial bales to one another already in the pressing chamber and to output only bound final bales from the pressing device, which can be handled more easily than the partial bales.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The binding apparatus advantageously comprises a first binding unit and a second binding unit which can be inserted into the pressing box from opposite sides. In this case, at least one strand or strap can preferably be provided by each binding unit, and the strands or straps of different binding units are connected to one another encircling the final bales. For example, the strands or straps are inserted transversely to the working direction into the pressing box and placed against one another before they are connected to one another in a force-locking and/or positive-locking manner.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The straps are, for example, metal straps which can be connected to one another in a force-locking and/or positive-locking manner. Possible joining techniques include clinching (&#x201c;tox clinching&#x201d;). The use of metal straps makes it possible to bind the final bales with a higher strength than, for example, with conventional baling twine. A length of the final bales by expansion of the plant material is avoided, as a result of which the final bales have a high dimensional stability.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">It is evident that the pressing device advantageously comprises a control apparatus with which the active components of the pressing device can be controlled. These include in particular the drive apparatus for the pressing element, possible drive apparatuses for the intermediate wall, the intermediate walls or the closing apparatus, for the closing apparatus at the supply opening, the transport apparatus or the supply apparatus. Advantageously, the active components of the pressing systems mentioned below are also controllable by means of the control apparatus.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">As already mentioned, the invention also relates to a pressing system. A pressing system in accordance with the invention, which achieves the object mentioned at the outset, comprises a pressing device of the above-mentioned type and a portioning apparatus upstream of the pressing device in the working direction, by means of which the pressing device can be provided with a pre-portioned amount of plant material for forming a respective partial bale.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The portioning apparatus makes it possible, in particular, to provide an interface between a continuously performable harvest of the plant material and a discontinuously operating pressing device. The plant material is collected and provided in pre-portioned amounts and can be supplied to the pressing space via the supply apparatus to form a respective partial bale.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">It is advantageous if the pre-portioned amount of plant material is specifiable with respect to its volume and/or weight. For example, it can be provided that the pre-portioned amount is dimensioned such that it substantially fills out the pressing space. Alternatively or in addition, provision can be made for an amount of plant material to be determined with respect to its weight to be introduced into the pressing space, for example to form partial bales with identical weight.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">It is advantageous for the portioning apparatus to comprise a compression unit for precompression of the pre-portioned amount of plant material, in particular in the form of a pre-bale. The loose plant material can be pre-compressed into a pre-bale. The pre-bale may for example be sized to fill the pressing space completely or substantially completely prior to compression.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">It is advantageous for the pressing system to comprise at least one sensor apparatus by means of which a mass of the pre-portioned amount of plant material can be determined prior to introduction into the pressing space and in particular before a precompression. For example, a pre-defined mass of plant material is supplied to the compression unit, preferably in order to provide a pre-bale of predefined weight.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The pressing system can comprise at least one sensor apparatus with which a mass of a formed partial bale in the pressing chamber can be determined. In this way, the mass of a respective partial bale can be checked with regard to a process control.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The portioning apparatus is advantageously controllable depending on the determined mass of the partial bale for providing the pre-portioned amount of plant material. This provides, for example, the possibility of achieving a predetermined or predeterminable average density in the final bale. It could thus be that a partial bale has, for example, an excessively high or too low mass. When providing further plant material, the pre-portioned amount can be reduced or increased with respect to its mass, so that the deviation of the mass of the partial bale from the target mass can be compensated and overall an average density of all the final bales can be achieved.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">A different type of pressing system in accordance with the invention, which achieves the above-mentioned object, comprises a pressing device of the above-mentioned type and a vehicle for moving on an agricultural land, wherein the vehicle comprises a support apparatus on which the pressing device is arranged. The features described in connection with the pressing system explained above can also be implemented in this pressing system and vice versa.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The pressing device can be used in a mobile manner on the agricultural land via the vehicle and thus the processing of the plant material can be facilitated.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The vehicle advantageously has a traction drive.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In particular, the vehicle can be configured to be self-propelled and self-steering. The vehicle can autonomously drive on the agricultural land. The plant material contained thereon, loose or pre-portioned, in particular pre-compressed, can be taken up and output to pressed final bales.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The pressing systems in accordance with the invention have those advantages which have already been mentioned in connection with the explanation of the pressing device in accordance with the invention.

The pressing box <b>66</b> is delimited on a bottom side by the transport apparatus <b>48</b>. Laterally, transverse to the working direction <b>50</b> and upward, the pressing box <b>66</b> is delimited by a boundary <b>68</b>. The boundary <b>68</b> can be a wall.

The pressing element <b>84</b> can be moved in the working direction <b>50</b> and in the opposite direction by means of drive apparatuses <b>86</b>. To compress pre-bales <b>32</b>, the pressing element <b>84</b> is moved from an initial position <b>88</b> to an end position <b>90</b>. This reduces the pressing space <b>62</b>. Pre-bales <b>32</b> contained in the pressing space <b>62</b> are compressed to form a partial bale.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0112">In the present case, four drive apparatuses <b>86</b> are provided.

A respective spindle drive <b>94</b> is arranged on a corner region <b>96</b> of the supply opening <b>40</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>). The drive elements <b>92</b> are synchronized with one another in such a way that they can be activated and deactivated together. When the pressing element <b>84</b> is displaced, a tilt-free movement with regard to an optimal compression of the pre-bale <b>32</b> can be achieved in this way. It is understood that the pressing device <b>12</b> for the pressing element <b>84</b> can comprise a guide apparatus which is not shown in the drawing.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0113">With the pressing device <b>12</b>, the use of spindle drives <b>94</b> offers the possibility of achieving a degree of compression for the plant material which considerably exceeds the degree of compression that can be achieved using conventional presses, in particular piston presses. For example, densities of the final bales <b>14</b> of up to approximately 400 kg/m<sup>3 </sup>are conceivable.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0114">In addition, the pressing device <b>12</b> has the advantage that, by means of the configuration of the pressing element <b>84</b> and the use of the spindle drives <b>94</b> and with pressing of the pre-bales <b>32</b>, partial bales <b>98</b> with a pre-defined length can be pressed, which partial bales <b>32</b> have only a small tolerance. In comparison with conventional piston presses, a significantly higher precision can be achieved when pressing bales.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0115">Accordingly, it is advantageous if the initial position <b>88</b> and the end position <b>90</b> are predetermined at the pressing device <b>12</b>, so that partial bales <b>98</b> can be pressed with substantially identical length. Accordingly, final bales <b>14</b> can differ depending on the nature&#x2014;for example moisture&#x2014;of the supplied plant material, for example with regard to its weight and its average density.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0116">In order to ensure that the final bale <b>14</b> comprises the smallest possible dimensional tolerances, the pressing box <b>66</b> has a substantially identical cross section over the entire length. In particular, the cross-sectional area of the pressing space <b>62</b> corresponds to the cross-sectional area of the following spaces <b>64</b>.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0117">The following spaces <b>64</b> are of identical length along the working direction <b>50</b>.
