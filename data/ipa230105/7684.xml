These systems may be capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing the available system resources (e.g., time, frequency, and power). Examples of such multiple-access systems include fourth generation (4G) systems such as Long Term Evolution (LTE) systems, LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) systems, or LTE-A Pro systems, and fifth generation (5G) systems which may be referred to as New Radio (NR) systems. These systems may employ technologies such as code-division multiple access (CDMA), time-division multiple access (TDMA), frequency-division multiple access (FDMA), orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA), or discrete Fourier transform-spread-orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (DFT-s-OFDM). A wireless multiple-access communications system may include a number of base stations or network access nodes, each simultaneously supporting communication for multiple communications devices, which may be otherwise known as user equipment (UE).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Some wireless communications systems may implement low latency wireless communications, such as ultra-reliable, low latency communications (URLLC). URLLC applications may have strict latency and reliability requirements. Downlink control information, such as physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) transmissions, may be a bottleneck for low latency communications. If a base station is unable to acquire the transmission medium in time to transmit downlink control information including a grant, or a UE misses the downlink control information, the wireless communications system may be unable to meet the strict latency and reliability requirements.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Control information for a data transmission may be transmitted in multiple control resource sets, sometimes from multiple transmission and reception points (TRPs). A user equipment (UE) receiving the downlink transmission may be semi-statically configured with information about the number of downlink transmissions and the mapping of control information candidates across the control resource sets, and the UE may combine control information from the control resource sets according to this mapping. If the wireless communications system supports operations in a shared radio frequency spectrum band (such as an unlicensed or other contention-based radio frequency spectrum band), a base station or TRP may perform a listen-before-talk (LBT) procedure to obtain access to a channel of the shared radio frequency spectrum band. If the base station fails to obtain access to the channel via the LBT procedure, the preconfigured control resource sets of the base station may not carry control information. If the receiving UE still attempts to combine the control information from the multiple control resource sets associated with different TRPs, the UE may combine dummy values for the control information with legitimate values for the control information, which may degrade decoding performance.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A UE may identify which control resource sets are valid to prevent the degradation of control information described above. In a first example, the UE may perform a transmission detection procedure on each base station before combining control information. The UE may use demodulation reference signals (DMRS) as a detection mechanism. If the UE detects a DMRS from a base station, the UE may determine that the base station successfully passed LBT, and the UE may then combine control information from the base station and corresponding control resource set. If the UE does not detect DMRS from the base station, the UE may refrain from combining control information from the base station.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another example, base stations that pass LBT may transmit a preamble before transmitting control information. A preamble may carry a preamble sequence, where each preamble sequence may be associated with a specific control resource set. If the UE detects a preamble carrying a preamble sequence specific to a control resource set, the UE may determine that the corresponding control resource set is valid for control information combining. In some cases, to improve preamble detection, a base station which passes LBT may transmit the preamble in the shared radio frequency spectrum band and outside of the shared radio frequency spectrum band. In some examples, the out-of-band preamble may be transmitted by another TRP. The preamble transmitted by the other TRP may include the preamble sequence associated with the control resource set used by the base station.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A method of wireless communications at a UE is described. The method may include performing a DMRS measurement on a shared radio frequency spectrum band for each TRP of a set of TRPs, where each TRP of the set of TRPs is associated with a control resource set of a set of control resource sets for downlink control information, receiving the downlink control information using one or more control resource sets of the set of control resource sets, the one or more control resource sets selected based on the DMRS measurement, and receiving a downlink data transmission based on the downlink control information.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">An apparatus for wireless communications at a UE is described. The apparatus may include a processor, memory in electronic communication with the processor, and instructions stored in the memory.

URLLC applications may have strict latency and reliability requirements. Downlink control information, such as physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) transmissions, may be a bottleneck for low latency communications. If a base station or transmission reception point (TRP) is unable to acquire the transmission medium in time to transmit downlink control information including a grant, or a user equipment (UE) misses the downlink control information, the wireless communications system may be unable to meet the strict latency and reliability requirements. In some cases, to increase reliability of downlink control information to meet the strict latency and reliability requirements of low latency communications, control information for a data transmission to a UE may be transmitted in multiple control resource sets, sometimes from multiple base stations. The receiving UE may be semi-statically configured with information about the number of downlink transmissions and how different candidates are mapped across different control resource sets. The UE may combine PDCCH information from multiple control resource sets associated with different base stations or TRPs to improve performance when decoding the PDCCH information.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">If the wireless communications system supports operations over a shared radio frequency spectrum band, such as an unlicensed or other contention-based access band, a base station or TRP may perform a listen-before-talk (LBT) procedure to obtain access to a channel of the shared radio frequency spectrum band. If the base station or TRP fails to gain access to the channel through the LBT procedure, the preconfigured control resource sets of the base station or TRP may not carry PDCCH information. If the receiving UE still attempts to combine the PDCCH information from the control resource set associated with a TRP that failed to gain access to the channel, the UE may combine dummy values with legitimate values for the PDCCH information, which may degrade decoding performance. Herein are described techniques for a UE to identify which control resource sets are valid to prevent adding dummy values when combining PDCCH.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In a first example, a UE may perform a transmission detection procedure on each base station before combining PDCCH. The UE may use demodulation reference signals (DMRS) as a detection mechanism. If the UE detects a DMRS from a base station or TRP, the UE may determine that the base station or TRP successfully passed LBT. The UE may then combine PDCCH from the base station. If the UE does not detect DMRS from the base station or TRP, the UE may refrain from combining PDCCH from the base station or TRP.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">A base station or TRP may select resource elements (REs) in a control resource set for DMRS transmission based on a cell ID associated with the base station or a type of the receiving UE (e.g., if the UE is a low latency device or mobile broadband (MBB)). In some cases, a base station or TRP may transmit DMRS with a boosted transmission power to improve detection of the DMRS.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In another example, base stations or TRPs that pass LBT may transmit a preamble before PDCCH transmission. The preambles may have a different numerology, such as a larger subcarrier spacing (SCS), than PDCCH. A preamble may carry a preamble sequence, where each preamble sequence may be associated with a specific control resource set. If the UE detects a preamble carrying a preamble sequence specific to a control resource set, the UE may determine that the corresponding control resource set is valid for PDCCH combining. In some cases, the preamble may be similar to a reservation request (RRQ) or a request-to-send (RTS).</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In some cases, to improve preamble detection, a first base station or TRP which passes LBT may transmit the preamble in the shared radio frequency spectrum band and outside of the shared radio frequency spectrum band. Transmitting the preamble in-band and out-of-band may increase the probability that the UE detects the preamble and identifies the preamble sequence. The out-of-band preamble may be transmitted on the same carrier as the in-band, for example in another bandwidth part. In some examples, the out-of-band preamble may be transmitted by a second base station or TRP, such as a millimeter-wave (mmW) base station or TRP backhauled with the base station or TRP which passes LBT. The second base station or TRP may indicate that the first base station or TRP passed LBT based on the preamble sequence transmitted in the preamble. The preamble transmitted by the second base station or TRP may include the preamble sequence associated with the control resource set used by the first base station or TRP.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Aspects of the disclosure are initially described in the context of a wireless communications system.

Each base station <b>105</b> may provide communication coverage for a respective geographic coverage area <b>110</b> via communication links <b>125</b>, and communication links <b>125</b> between a base station <b>105</b> and a UE <b>115</b> may utilize one or more carriers. Communication links <b>125</b> shown in wireless communications system <b>100</b> may include uplink transmissions from a UE <b>115</b> to a base station <b>105</b>, or downlink transmissions from a base station <b>105</b> to a UE <b>115</b>. Downlink transmissions may also be called forward link transmissions while uplink transmissions may also be called reverse link transmissions.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The geographic coverage area <b>110</b> for a base station <b>105</b> may be divided into sectors making up only a portion of the geographic coverage area <b>110</b>, and each sector may be associated with a cell. For example, each base station <b>105</b> may provide communication coverage for a macro cell, a small cell, a hot spot, or other types of cells, or various combinations thereof. In some examples, a base station <b>105</b> may be movable and therefore provide communication coverage for a moving geographic coverage area <b>110</b>. In some examples, different geographic coverage areas <b>110</b> associated with different technologies may overlap, and overlapping geographic coverage areas <b>110</b> associated with different technologies may be supported by the same base station <b>105</b> or by different base stations <b>105</b>. The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may include, for example, a heterogeneous LTE/LTE-A/LTE-A Pro or NR network in which different types of base stations <b>105</b> provide coverage for various geographic coverage areas <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The term &#x201c;cell&#x201d; refers to a logical communication entity used for communication with a base station <b>105</b> (e.g., over a carrier), and may be associated with an identifier for distinguishing neighboring cells (e.g., a physical cell identifier (PCID), a virtual cell identifier (VCID)) operating via the same or a different carrier. In some examples, a carrier may support multiple cells, and different cells may be configured according to different protocol types (e.g., machine-type communication (MTC), narrowband Internet-of-Things (NB-IoT), enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), or others) that may provide access for different types of devices. In some cases, the term &#x201c;cell&#x201d; may refer to a portion of a geographic coverage area <b>110</b> (e.g., a sector) over which the logical entity operates.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">UEs <b>115</b> may be dispersed throughout the wireless communications system <b>100</b>, and each UE <b>115</b> may be stationary or mobile. A UE <b>115</b> may also be referred to as a mobile device, a wireless device, a remote device, a handheld device, or a subscriber device, or some other suitable terminology, where the &#x201c;device&#x201d; may also be referred to as a unit, a station, a terminal, or a client. A UE <b>115</b> may also be a personal electronic device such as a cellular phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a tablet computer, a laptop computer, or a personal computer. In some examples, a UE <b>115</b> may also refer to a wireless local loop (WLL) station, an Internet of Things (IoT) device, an Internet of Everything (IoE) device, or an MTC device, or the like, which may be implemented in various articles such as appliances, vehicles, meters, or the like.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Some UEs <b>115</b>, such as MTC or IoT devices, may be low cost or low complexity devices, and may provide for automated communication between machines (e.g., via Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication). M2M communication or MTC may refer to data communication technologies that allow devices to communicate with one another or a base station <b>105</b> without human intervention. In some examples, M2M communication or MTC may include communications from devices that integrate sensors or meters to measure or capture information and relay that information to a central server or application program that can make use of the information or present the information to humans interacting with the program or application. Some UEs <b>115</b> may be designed to collect information or enable automated behavior of machines. Examples of applications for MTC devices include smart metering, inventory monitoring, water level monitoring, equipment monitoring, healthcare monitoring, wildlife monitoring, weather and geological event monitoring, fleet management and tracking, remote security sensing, physical access control, and transaction-based business charging.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Some UEs <b>115</b> may be configured to employ operating modes that reduce power consumption, such as half-duplex communications (e.g., a mode that supports one-way communication via transmission or reception, but not transmission and reception simultaneously). In some examples half-duplex communications may be performed at a reduced peak rate. Other power conservation techniques for UEs <b>115</b> include entering a power saving &#x201c;deep sleep&#x201d; mode when not engaging in active communications, or operating over a limited bandwidth (e.g., according to narrowband communications). In some cases, UEs <b>115</b> may be designed to support critical functions (e.g., mission critical functions), and a wireless communications system <b>100</b> may be configured to provide ultra-reliable communications for these functions.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In some cases, a UE <b>115</b> may also be able to communicate directly with other UEs <b>115</b> (e.g., using a peer-to-peer (P2P) or device-to-device (D2D) protocol). One or more of a group of UEs <b>115</b> utilizing D2D communications may be within the geographic coverage area <b>110</b> of a base station <b>105</b>. Other UEs <b>115</b> in such a group may be outside the geographic coverage area <b>110</b> of a base station <b>105</b>, or be otherwise unable to receive transmissions from a base station <b>105</b>. In some cases, groups of UEs <b>115</b> communicating via D2D communications may utilize a one-to-many (1:M) system in which each UE <b>115</b> transmits to every other UE <b>115</b> in the group. In some cases, a base station <b>105</b> facilitates the scheduling of resources for D2D communications. In other cases, D2D communications are carried out between UEs <b>115</b> without the involvement of a base station <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Base stations <b>105</b> may communicate with the core network <b>130</b> and with one another. For example, base stations <b>105</b> may interface with the core network <b>130</b> through backhaul links <b>132</b> (e.g., via an Si or other interface). Base stations <b>105</b> may communicate with one another over backhaul links <b>134</b> (e.g., via an X2 or other interface) either directly (e.g., directly between base stations <b>105</b>) or indirectly (e.g., via core network <b>130</b>).</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The core network <b>130</b> may provide user authentication, access authorization, tracking, Internet Protocol (IP) connectivity, and other access, routing, or mobility functions. The core network <b>130</b> may be an evolved packet core (EPC), which may include at least one mobility management entity (MME), at least one serving gateway (S-GW), and at least one Packet Data Network (PDN) gateway (P-GW). The MME may manage non-access stratum (e.g., control plane) functions such as mobility, authentication, and bearer management for UEs <b>115</b> served by base stations <b>105</b> associated with the EPC. User IP packets may be transferred through the S-GW, which itself may be connected to the P-GW. The P-GW may provide IP address allocation as well as other functions. The P-GW may be connected to the network operators IP services. The operators IP services may include access to the Internet, Intranet(s), an IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), or a Packet-Switched (PS) Streaming Service.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">At least some of the network devices, such as a base station <b>105</b>, may include subcomponents such as an access network entity, which may be an example of an access node controller (ANC). Each access network entity may communicate with UEs <b>115</b> through a number of other access network transmission entities, which may be referred to as a radio head, a smart radio head, or a TRP. In some configurations, various functions of each access network entity or base station <b>105</b> may be distributed across various network devices (e.g., radio heads and access network controllers) or consolidated into a single network device (e.g., a base station <b>105</b>). It should be understood that the terms &#x201c;base station&#x201d; and &#x201c;TRP&#x201d; are used interchangeably. Thus, functions attributed to a base station or a TRP in the present disclosure may be implemented by a standalone base station comprising a single TRP, a base station controlling one or more TRPs, one or more TRPs controlled by a base station, or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">Wireless communications system <b>100</b> may operate using one or more frequency bands, typically in the range of 300 MHz to 300 GHz. Generally, the region from 300 MHz to 3 GHz is known as the ultra-high frequency (UHF) region or decimeter band, since the wavelengths range from approximately one decimeter to one meter in length. UHF waves may be blocked or redirected by buildings and environmental features. However, the waves may penetrate structures sufficiently for a macro cell to provide service to UEs <b>115</b> located indoors. Transmission of UHF waves may be associated with smaller antennas and shorter range (e.g., less than 100 km) compared to transmission using the smaller frequencies and longer waves of the high frequency (HF) or very high frequency (VHF) portion of the spectrum below 300 MHz.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Wireless communications system <b>100</b> may also operate in a super high frequency (SHF) region using frequency bands from 3 GHz to 30 GHz, also known as the centimeter band. The SHF region includes bands such as the 5 GHz industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) bands, which may be used opportunistically by devices that can tolerate interference from other users.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Wireless communications system <b>100</b> may also operate in an extremely high frequency (EHF) region of the spectrum (e.g., from 30 GHz to 300 GHz), also known as the millimeter band. In some examples, wireless communications system <b>100</b> may support millimeter wave (mmW) communications between UEs <b>115</b> and base stations <b>105</b>, and EHF antennas of the respective devices may be even smaller and more closely spaced than UHF antennas. In some cases, this may facilitate use of antenna arrays within a UE <b>115</b>. However, the propagation of EHF transmissions may be subject to even greater atmospheric attenuation and shorter range than SHF or UHF transmissions. Techniques disclosed herein may be employed across transmissions that use one or more different frequency regions, and designated use of bands across these frequency regions may differ by country or regulating body.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In some cases, wireless communications system <b>100</b> may utilize both licensed and unlicensed radio frequency spectrum bands. For example, wireless communications system <b>100</b> may employ License Assisted Access (LAA), LTE-Unlicensed (LTE-U) radio access technology, or NR technology in an unlicensed band such as the 5 GHz ISM band. When operating in unlicensed radio frequency spectrum bands, wireless devices such as base stations <b>105</b> and UEs <b>115</b> may employ LBT procedures to ensure a frequency channel is clear before transmitting data. In some cases, operations in unlicensed bands may be based on a CA configuration in conjunction with CCs operating in a licensed band (e.g., LAA). Operations in unlicensed spectrum may include downlink transmissions, uplink transmissions, peer-to-peer transmissions, or a combination of these. Duplexing in unlicensed spectrum may be based on frequency-division duplexing (FDD), time-division duplexing (TDD), or a combination of both.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">In some examples, base station <b>105</b> or UE <b>115</b> may be equipped with multiple antennas, which may be used to employ techniques such as transmit diversity, receive diversity, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications, or beamforming. For example, wireless communications system <b>100</b> may use a transmission scheme between a transmitting device (e.g., a base station <b>105</b>) and a receiving device (e.g., a UE <b>115</b>), where the transmitting device is equipped with multiple antennas and the receiving devices are equipped with one or more antennas. MIMO communications may employ multipath signal propagation to increase the spectral efficiency by transmitting or receiving multiple signals via different spatial layers, which may be referred to as spatial multiplexing. The multiple signals may, for example, be transmitted by the transmitting device via different antennas or different combinations of antennas. Likewise, the multiple signals may be received by the receiving device via different antennas or different combinations of antennas. Each of the multiple signals may be referred to as a separate spatial stream, and may carry bits associated with the same data stream (e.g., the same codeword) or different data streams. Different spatial layers may be associated with different antenna ports used for channel measurement and reporting. MIMO techniques include single-user MIMO (SU-MIMO) where multiple spatial layers are transmitted to the same receiving device, and multiple-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) where multiple spatial layers are transmitted to multiple devices.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Beamforming, which may also be referred to as spatial filtering, directional transmission, or directional reception, is a signal processing technique that may be used at a transmitting device or a receiving device (e.g., a base station <b>105</b> or a UE <b>115</b>) to shape or steer an antenna beam (e.g., a transmit beam or receive beam) along a spatial path between the transmitting device and the receiving device. Beamforming may be achieved by combining the signals communicated via antenna elements of an antenna array such that signals propagating at particular orientations with respect to an antenna array experience constructive interference while others experience destructive interference. The adjustment of signals communicated via the antenna elements may include a transmitting device or a receiving device applying certain amplitude and phase offsets to signals carried via each of the antenna elements associated with the device. The adjustments associated with each of the antenna elements may be defined by a beamforming weight set associated with a particular orientation (e.g., with respect to the antenna array of the transmitting device or receiving device, or with respect to some other orientation).</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">In one example, a base station <b>105</b> may use multiple antennas or antenna arrays to conduct beamforming operations for directional communications with a UE <b>115</b>. For instance, some signals (e.g. synchronization signals, reference signals, beam selection signals, or other control signals) may be transmitted by a base station <b>105</b> multiple times in different directions, which may include a signal being transmitted according to different beamforming weight sets associated with different directions of transmission. Transmissions in different beam directions may be used to identify (e.g., by the base station <b>105</b> or a receiving device, such as a UE <b>115</b>) a beam direction for subsequent transmission and/or reception by the base station <b>105</b>. Some signals, such as data signals associated with a particular receiving device, may be transmitted by a base station <b>105</b> in a single beam direction (e.g., a direction associated with the receiving device, such as a UE <b>115</b>). In some examples, the beam direction associated with transmissions along a single beam direction may be determined based at least in in part on a signal that was transmitted in different beam directions. For example, a UE <b>115</b> may receive one or more of the signals transmitted by the base station <b>105</b> in different directions, and the UE <b>115</b> may report to the base station <b>105</b> an indication of the signal it received with a highest signal quality, or an otherwise acceptable signal quality. Although these techniques are described with reference to signals transmitted in one or more directions by a base station <b>105</b>, a UE <b>115</b> may employ similar techniques for transmitting signals multiple times in different directions (e.g., for identifying a beam direction for subsequent transmission or reception by the UE <b>115</b>), or transmitting a signal in a single direction (e.g., for transmitting data to a receiving device).</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">A receiving device (e.g., a UE <b>115</b>, which may be an example of a mmW receiving device) may try multiple receive beams when receiving various signals from the base station <b>105</b>, such as synchronization signals, reference signals, beam selection signals, or other control signals. For example, a receiving device may try multiple receive directions by receiving via different antenna subarrays, by processing received signals according to different antenna subarrays, by receiving according to different receive beamforming weight sets applied to signals received at a plurality of antenna elements of an antenna array, or by processing received signals according to different receive beamforming weight sets applied to signals received at a plurality of antenna elements of an antenna array, any of which may be referred to as &#x201c;listening&#x201d; according to different receive beams or receive directions. In some examples a receiving device may use a single receive beam to receive along a single beam direction (e.g., when receiving a data signal). The single receive beam may be aligned in a beam direction determined based at least in part on listening according to different receive beam directions (e.g., a beam direction determined to have a highest signal strength, highest signal-to-noise ratio, or otherwise acceptable signal quality based at least in part on listening according to multiple beam directions).</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">In some cases, the antennas of a base station <b>105</b> or UE <b>115</b> may be located within one or more antenna arrays, which may support MIMO operations, or transmit or receive beamforming. For example, one or more base station antennas or antenna arrays may be co-located at an antenna assembly, such as an antenna tower. In some cases, antennas or antenna arrays associated with a base station <b>105</b> may be located in diverse geographic locations. A base station <b>105</b> may have an antenna array with a number of rows and columns of antenna ports that the base station <b>105</b> may use to support beamforming of communications with a UE <b>115</b>. Likewise, a UE <b>115</b> may have one or more antenna arrays that may support various MIMO or beamforming operations.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">In some cases, wireless communications system <b>100</b> may be a packet-based network that operate according to a layered protocol stack. In the user plane, communications at the bearer or Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP) layer may be IP-based. A Radio Link Control (RLC) layer may in some cases perform packet segmentation and reassembly to communicate over logical channels. A Medium Access Control (MAC) layer may perform priority handling and multiplexing of logical channels into transport channels. The MAC layer may also use hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) to provide retransmission at the MAC layer to improve link efficiency. In the control plane, the Radio Resource Control (RRC) protocol layer may provide establishment, configuration, and maintenance of an RRC connection between a UE <b>115</b> and a base station <b>105</b> or core network <b>130</b> supporting radio bearers for user plane data. At the Physical (PHY) layer, transport channels may be mapped to physical channels.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">In some cases, UEs <b>115</b> and base stations <b>105</b> may support retransmissions of data to increase the likelihood that data is received successfully. HARQ feedback is one technique of increasing the likelihood that data is received correctly over a communication link <b>125</b>. HARQ may include a combination of error detection (e.g., using a cyclic redundancy check (CRC)), forward error correction (FEC), and retransmission (e.g., automatic repeat request (ARQ)). HARQ may improve throughput at the MAC layer in poor radio conditions (e.g., signal-to-noise conditions). In some cases, a wireless device may support same-slot HARQ feedback, where the device may provide HARQ feedback in a specific slot for data received in a previous symbol in the slot. In other cases, the device may provide HARQ feedback in a subsequent slot, or according to some other time interval.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Time intervals in LTE or NR may be expressed in multiples of a basic time unit, which may, for example, refer to a sampling period of T<sub>s</sub>=1/30,720,000 seconds. Time intervals of a communications resource may be organized according to radio frames each having a duration of 10 milliseconds (ms), where the frame period may be expressed as T<sub>f</sub>=307,200 T<sub>s</sub>. The radio frames may be identified by a system frame number (SFN) ranging from 0 to 1023. Each frame may include 10 subframes numbered from 0 to 9, and each subframe may have a duration of 1 ms. A subframe may be further divided into 2 slots each having a duration of 0.5 ms, and each slot may contain 6 or 7 modulation symbol periods (e.g., depending on the length of the cyclic prefix prepended to each symbol period). Excluding the cyclic prefix, each symbol period may contain 2048 sampling periods. In some cases, a subframe may be the smallest scheduling unit of the wireless communications system <b>100</b>, and may be referred to as a transmission time interval (TTI). In other cases, a smallest scheduling unit of the wireless communications system <b>100</b> may be shorter than a subframe or may be dynamically selected (e.g., in bursts of shortened TTIs (sTTIs) or in selected component carriers using sTTIs).</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">In some wireless communications systems, a slot may further be divided into multiple mini-slots containing one or more symbols. In some instances, a symbol of a mini-slot or a mini-slot may be the smallest unit of scheduling. Each symbol may vary in duration depending on the subcarrier spacing or frequency band of operation, for example. Further, some wireless communications systems may implement slot aggregation in which multiple slots or mini-slots are aggregated together and used for communication between a UE <b>115</b> and a base station <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">The term &#x201c;carrier&#x201d; refers to a set of radio frequency spectrum resources having a defined physical layer structure for supporting communications over a communication link <b>125</b>. For example, a carrier of a communication link <b>125</b> may include a portion of a radio frequency spectrum band that is operated according to physical layer channels for a given radio access technology. Each physical layer channel may carry user data, control information, or other signaling. A carrier may be associated with a pre-defined frequency channel (e.g., an E-UTRA absolute radio frequency channel number (EARFCN)), and may be positioned according to a channel raster for discovery by UEs <b>115</b>. Carriers may be downlink or uplink (e.g., in an FDD mode), or be configured to carry downlink and uplink communications (e.g., in a TDD mode). In some examples, signal waveforms transmitted over a carrier may be made up of multiple sub-carriers (e.g., using multi-carrier modulation (MCM) techniques such as orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) or discrete Fourier transform-spread-OFDM (DFT-s-OFDM)).</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">The organizational structure of the carriers may be different for different radio access technologies (e.g., LTE, LTE-A, LTE-A Pro, NR, etc.). For example, communications over a carrier may be organized according to TTIs or slots, each of which may include user data as well as control information or signaling to support decoding the user data. A carrier may also include dedicated acquisition signaling (e.g., synchronization signals or system information, etc.) and control signaling that coordinates operation for the carrier. In some examples (e.g., in a carrier aggregation configuration), a carrier may also have acquisition signaling or control signaling that coordinates operations for other carriers.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Physical channels may be multiplexed on a carrier according to various techniques. A physical control channel and a physical data channel may be multiplexed on a downlink carrier, for example, using time-division multiplexing (TDM) techniques, frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) techniques, or hybrid TDM-FDM techniques. In some examples, control information transmitted in a physical control channel may be distributed between different control regions in a cascaded manner (e.g., between a common control region or common search space and one or more UE-specific control regions or UE-specific search spaces).</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">A carrier may be associated with a particular bandwidth of the radio frequency spectrum, and in some examples the carrier bandwidth may be referred to as a &#x201c;system bandwidth&#x201d; of the carrier or the wireless communications system <b>100</b>. For example, the carrier bandwidth may be one of a number of predetermined bandwidths for carriers of a particular radio access technology (e.g., 1.4, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 40, or 80 MHz). In some examples, each served UE <b>115</b> may be configured for operating over portions or all of the carrier bandwidth. In other examples, some UEs <b>115</b> may be configured for operation using a narrowband protocol type that is associated with a predefined portion or range (e.g., set of subcarriers or RBs) within a carrier (e.g., &#x201c;in-band&#x201d; deployment of a narrowband protocol type).</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">In a system employing MCM techniques, a resource element (RE) may consist of one symbol period (e.g., a duration of one modulation symbol) and one subcarrier, where the symbol period and subcarrier spacing are inversely related. The number of bits carried by each RE may depend on the modulation scheme (e.g., the order of the modulation scheme). Thus, the more REs that a UE <b>115</b> receives and the higher the order of the modulation scheme, the higher the data rate may be for the UE <b>115</b>. In MIMO systems, a wireless communications resource may refer to a combination of a radio frequency spectrum resource, a time resource, and a spatial resource (e.g., spatial layers), and the use of multiple spatial layers may further increase the data rate for communications with a UE <b>115</b>.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Devices of the wireless communications system <b>100</b> (e.g., base stations <b>105</b> or UEs <b>115</b>) may have a hardware configuration that supports communications over a particular carrier bandwidth, or may be configurable to support communications over one of a set of carrier bandwidths. In some examples, the wireless communications system <b>100</b> may include base stations <b>105</b> and/or UEs <b>115</b> that can support simultaneous communications via carriers associated with more than one different carrier bandwidth.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">Wireless communications system <b>100</b> may support communication with a UE <b>115</b> on multiple cells or carriers, a feature which may be referred to as carrier aggregation (CA) or multi-carrier operation. A UE <b>115</b> may be configured with multiple downlink CCs and one or more uplink CCs according to a carrier aggregation configuration. Carrier aggregation may be used with both FDD and TDD component carriers.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">In some cases, wireless communications system <b>100</b> may utilize enhanced component carriers (eCCs). An eCC may be characterized by one or more features including wider carrier or frequency channel bandwidth, shorter symbol duration, shorter TTI duration, or modified control channel configuration. In some cases, an eCC may be associated with a carrier aggregation configuration or a dual connectivity configuration (e.g., when multiple serving cells have a suboptimal or non-ideal backhaul link). An eCC may also be configured for use in unlicensed spectrum or shared spectrum (e.g., where more than one operator is allowed to use the spectrum). An eCC characterized by wide carrier bandwidth may include one or more segments that may be utilized by UEs <b>115</b> that are not capable of monitoring the whole carrier bandwidth or are otherwise configured to use a limited carrier bandwidth (e.g., to conserve power).</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">In some cases, an eCC may utilize a different symbol duration than other CCs, which may include use of a reduced symbol duration as compared with symbol durations of the other CCs. A shorter symbol duration may be associated with increased spacing between adjacent subcarriers. A device, such as a UE <b>115</b> or base station <b>105</b>, utilizing eCCs may transmit wideband signals (e.g., according to frequency channel or carrier bandwidths of 20, 40, 60, 80 MHz, etc.) at reduced symbol durations (e.g., 16.67 microseconds). A TTI in eCC may consist of one or multiple symbol periods. In some cases, the TTI duration (that is, the number of symbol periods in a TTI) may be variable.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">Wireless communications systems such as an NR system may utilize any combination of licensed, shared, and unlicensed spectrum bands, among others. The flexibility of eCC symbol duration and subcarrier spacing may allow for the use of eCC across multiple spectrums. In some examples, NR shared spectrum may increase spectrum utilization and spectral efficiency, specifically through dynamic vertical (e.g., across the frequency domain) and horizontal (e.g., across the time domain) sharing of resources.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">Control information for a data transmission may be transmitted in multiple control resource sets, sometimes from multiple TRPs, or base stations <b>105</b>, to improve reliability. The UE <b>115</b> receiving the data transmission may semi-statically know the number of downlink transmissions and the mapping of candidates across the control resource sets, and the UE may combine PDCCH information from the control resource sets. A base station <b>105</b> may perform an LBT procedure to be granted access to the transmission medium. If the base station <b>105</b> fails the LBT procedure, the preconfigured control resource sets of the base station <b>105</b> may not carry PDCCH information. If the UE <b>115</b> still attempts to combine the PDCCH information from the control resource set, the UE <b>115</b> may combine dummy values, which may degrade decoding performance.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">A UE <b>115</b> may identify which control resource sets are valid to prevent adding dummy values when combining PDCCH. In a first example, the UE <b>115</b> may perform a transmission detection procedure on each base station before combining PDCCH. The UE <b>115</b> may use DMRS as a detection mechanism. If the UE <b>115</b> detects a DMRS from a base station, the UE <b>115</b> may determine that the base station successfully passed LBT, and the UE <b>115</b> may then combine PDCCH from the base station and corresponding control resource set. If the UE <b>115</b> does not detect DMRS from the base station, the UE <b>115</b> may refrain from combining PDCCH from the base station <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">In another example, TRPs or base stations <b>105</b> that pass LBT may transmit a preamble before PDCCH transmission. A preamble may carry a preamble sequence, where each preamble sequence may be associated with a specific control resource set. If the UE <b>115</b> detects a preamble carrying a preamble sequence specific to a control resource set, the UE <b>115</b> may determine that the corresponding control resource set is valid for PDCCH combining. In some cases, to improve preamble detection, a base station which passes LBT may transmit the preamble in the shared radio frequency spectrum band and outside of the shared radio frequency spectrum band. In some examples, the out-of-band preamble may be transmitted by another TRP. The preamble transmitted by the other TRP may include the preamble sequence associated with the control resource set used by the base station <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an example of a wireless communications system <b>200</b> that supports enhanced downlink control information detection in accordance with aspects of the present disclosure.

If a base station <b>105</b> is unable to acquire the transmission medium in time to transmit downlink control information including a grant, or a UE <b>115</b> misses the downlink control information, the wireless communications system <b>200</b> may be unable to meet the strict latency and reliability requirements.

If the receiving UE <b>115</b> still attempts to combine the PDCCH information from the control resource set of the base station <b>105</b> that failed LBT, the UE <b>115</b> may combine dummy log likelihood ratios (LLRs), or invalid information. For example, those resources may have been used by another device, and combining invalid resource sets may in some cases degrade decoding performance. In some cases, backhaul communications between TRPs may not be ideal, and a TRP which is blocked from transmitting due to a failed LBT may not be easily replaced by another TRP.
