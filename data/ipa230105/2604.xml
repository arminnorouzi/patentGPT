In particular, the heterophasic polypropylene copolymers of the invention have a soluble fraction (B) with high molecular weight, and hence low MFR, and a crystalline fraction (A) of high melting point.</p><heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Metallocene catalysts have been used to manufacture polyolefins for many years. Countless academic and patent publications describe the use of these catalysts in olefin polymerization. Metallocenes are now used industrially and polyethylenes and polypropylenes in particular are often produced using cyclopentadienyl based catalyst systems with different substitution patterns.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">These metallocenes are often used to prepare polypropylenes such as isotactic polypropylene. Metallocenes, whose structure has been optimized to produce high molecular weight isotactic polypropylene, often show limitations in their molecular weight capability when used to produce heterophasic polypropylene with an ethylene-propylene copolymer in the gas phase. It is known that tensile and impact properties of a heterophasic polypropylene, for a given rubber comonomer composition, can be improved by increasing the molecular weight of the rubber phase (as described for example in J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 2002, vol. 85, pp. 2412-2418 and in J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 2003, vol. 87, pp. 1702-1712). Typically however, the ethylene-propylene rubber molecular weight (measured as intrinsic viscosity IV(EPR) is less than 4 dl/g, measured in decahydronaphthalene (decalin) at 135&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition, metallocene catalysts which might be used for the preparation of heterophasic polypropylene tend to produce a homopolymer matrix (and hence a heterophasic polypropylene polymer as a whole) with relatively low melting point (Tm), usually below 155-157&#xb0; C. It is known that a higher Tm is beneficial for the material stiffness. The combination of a high melting point of the homopolymer matrix (or a high melting point of the heterophasic polypropylene itself) and high molecular weight in the EPR rubber component is especially desirable.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In this regard, a heterophasic polypropylene is one that comprises a propylene homopolymer matrix (or a propylene copolymer matrix with a low comonomer content, i.e. a random propylene copolymer) and a propylene ethylene (or propylene-ethylene-1-butene) rubber component which is typically dispersed within the matrix.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present inventors have found that heterophasic polypropylene copolymers with advantageous properties can be prepared using certain metallocene catalysts.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0000">The metallocenes complexes of use in the preparation of the heterophasic polypropylene copolymers of the invention are asymmetric hafnium bridged bisindenyl type structures.

The IV of the produced polymers is around 3 to 3.4 dl/g, measured in tetrahydronaphthalene (THN) at 135&#xb0; C.
