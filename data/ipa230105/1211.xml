It includes an electro-mechanical system performing two major pumping functions. The left portions of the heart, including the left atrium (LA) and left ventricle (LV), draw oxygenated blood from the lungs and pump it to the organs of the body to provide the organs with their metabolic needs for oxygen. The right portions of the heart, including the right atrium (RA) and right ventricle (RV), draw deoxygenated blood from the body organs and pump it to the lungs where the blood gets oxygenated. These pumping functions result from contractions of the myocardium (cardiac muscles). In a normal heart, the sinoatrial (SA) node, the heart's natural pacemaker, generates electrical pulses, called action potentials, which propagate through natural electrical conduction pathways known as His-Purkinje system to various regions of the heart to excite the myocardial tissue of the heart. For example, the action potentials originated from the SA node propagate through the atrioventricular (AV) node, the His bundle (also known as Bundle of His), the bundle branches, and Purkinje fibers to reach the ventricular myocardium, resulting in coordinated contractions in both ventricles.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Coordinated delays in the propagation of the action potentials in a normal electrical conduction system cause the various portions of the heart to contract in synchrony to result in efficient pumping functions. A blocked or otherwise abnormal electrical conduction and/or deteriorated myocardium may cause dyssynchronous contraction of the heart, resulting in poor hemodynamic performance, including a diminished blood supply to the heart and the rest of the body. For example, an abnormal delay in the transmission of the action potentials in the His bundle may cause irregular or dyssynchronous contractions of the ventricles.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Artificial cardiac pacing system have been used to rectify cardiac dyssynchrony and to improve hemodynamic performance. The artificial cardiac pacing system may provide electrical stimulations to one or more portions of the heart such as to restore normal functioning of the heart to a certain extent. For example, right ventricular pacing via electrodes implanted in the apex of the RV have been used in both single ventricular and biventricular (BiV) pacing. RV apical pacing directly excites the ventricular myocardium in an unnatural way involving slow muscle-muscle contraction. Normally, ventricular excitation involves rapid coordinate activation via action potentials that are propagated through the natural conduction pathways. Studies have shown that, in some patients, the cardiac dyssynchrony induced by RV apical pacing, partially due to the interventricular delay in impulse propagation to the left ventricle, can result in adverse ventricular changes including enlarged ventricles and heart failure when delivered over the long term. Moreover, permanent changes in myocardial perfusion and structure may develop over time in these patients, which may further decrease cardiac output and deteriorate ventricular function. BiV pacing involves RV pacing via one lead, and LV pacing via another lead, and has been demonstrated to restore synchronized contraction of both ventricles. However, the potential adverse impact on ventricular function produced by the RV apical pacing may still exist in BiV pacing. Muscle-muscle activation via epicardial LV pacing is also known to result in a less vigorous contraction.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Some studies have shown that blockage in left bundle branch block is most often located at the root of the left bundle at the His bundle junction, or in the His bundle itself. Pacing the distal His bundle region located within the atrioventricular (or interventricular) junction has shown to result in electrical &#x201c;reconnection&#x201d; of the left bundle and restored left ventricular activation.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Overview</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">This document discusses systems, devices, and methods for controlling His-bundle pacing (HBP) according to an indication of a rate-related or intermittent atrioventricular (AV) block in a subject.

Many patients receiving artificial pacing therapy have an intact His bundle and the natural cardiac electrical conduction system in the ventricles, and therefore having normal ventricular activation. Conventional cardiac pacing such as long-term RV apical pacing (i.e., pacing at RV apex) may cause a decrease in cardiac output and efficiency due to the uncoordinated contraction sequence. This dyssynchrony may eventually cause adverse long-term effects. Dyssynchronous contraction of the ventricles occurs during conventional RV pacing because the activation sequence may be much slower and propagate slowly from the right to the left ventricle across the interventricular septum, thereby causing ventricular dyssynchrony. This sequence of activation results in an uncoordinated contraction, which does not occur during biventricular activation through the natural conduction system of the heart. The cells of the natural conduction system may propagate an activation signal about four times faster than working myocardium. A cardiac rhythm or functional management device configured to pace the His bundle is an alternative to conventional ventricular pacing. His-bundle pacing (HBP) may activate the heart's natural conduction system, including the left and right bundle branches and Purkinje fibers, and thereby restore or maintain efficient and coordinated cardiac response. This may reduce or eliminate the potential long-term harmful hemodynamic effects associated with continuous RV apical pacing.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">However, when not being successful, the HBP may not adequately restore cardiac synchrony. In some instances, the electrical stimulation may lose its ability to activate (or capture) the His bundle, but only activates the para-Hisian myocardium surrounding the His bundle. Stimulating muscles near the His bundle may cause dyssynchronous patterns similar to RV apical pacing. This undesirable outcome is referred to as para-Hisian capture. Simultaneous capture of the His bundle and para-Hisian muscle (also known as a non-selective His-bundle capture) may be as clinically effective as the His-bundle only capture (also known as a selective His-bundle capture, as the resultant ventricular activation and contraction is dominated by the more rapid conducting Purkinje system. Another undesirable outcome of HBP is known as a complete loss of capture (LOC), where the HBP pulses capture neither the para-Hisian myocardium nor the His bundle.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The ability of HBP to restore cardiac synchrony may also be dependent on the pacing site relative to the blockage site along the His-Purkinje system, such as at the His bundle or a bundle branch. Ventricular dyssynchrony in many heart failure (HF) patients may be attributed to various degrees of left bundle branch block (LBBB), which causes delayed LV depolarization lagging behind RV depolarization. Effective propagation of the action potentials through the His-Purkinje system to restore cardiac synchrony may be achieved only if the HBP pulses are delivered distal to the blockage site. If the HBP pulses are delivered proximal to the blockage site, even if the proximal portion of the His bundle is activated, the action potential cannot bypass the blockage and propagate to the ventricles through the His-Purkinje system. Consequently, no cardiac synchrony may be restored.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Atrioventricular (AV) conduction disturbance refers to abnormal conduction or obstruction (i.e., block) in the AV node or in the His-Purkinje system below the AV node. AV conduction disturbance can include different degrees of obstruction, varying from a mild delay in conduction (first-degree AV block) to a conduction block between atria and ventricles (second- and third-degree AV blocks). AV conduction disturbance can be functional in nature, or attributable to local disease in the physiologic conduction system. Conduction disturbance or blockage may occur at various sites of the physiologic conduction system, including AV node, the His bundle (the &#x201c;intra-Hisian&#x201d; conduction disturbance or block), or below the His bundle (referred to as &#x201c;infra-Hisian&#x201d; conduction disturbance or block). Infra-Hisian blocks may occur at the left or right bundle branches (referred to as &#x201c;bundle branch block&#x201d;) or the fascicles of the left bundle branch (referred to as &#x201c;fascicular block&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Often AV conduction disturbance are intermittent. For example, intra-Hisian block status may change over time. Several mechanisms have been implicated in the AV conduction disturbance, including changing autonomic tone and changes in coronary perfusion. Changes in patient health status and medication may trigger AV conduction disturbance. Some AV conduction disturbance may be rate-related, such as rate-dependent bundle branch block, in which the delay conduction or blockage only occurs at times of fast heart rates (e.g., above a critical heart rate), and diminishes at slower heart rates (e.g., below the critical heart rate). Myocardial ischemia or refractoriness of intra-Hisian or infra-Hisian fascicles at faster heart rates may cause rate-related AV conduction disturbance. Patients with rate-related AV conduction disturbance may experience dysynchrony and symptoms during exertion and activities when their heart rates rise and exceed a cut-off heart rate that triggers conduction block. Many patients with intermittent or rate-related conduction disturbance ultimately develop permanent bundle branch block.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Because the success rate of HBP capture and its ability to restore cardiac synchrony may vary from patient to patient and are affected by many factors (e.g., pacing site, stimulation strength), and considering potential side effects attributable to HBP in some patients (e.g., phrenic nerve stimulation or pain sensation), it is desirable, at least in some instances, to limit the use of HBP only as a need arises, such as when patient AV conduction is compromised. The present inventors have recognized that there is an unmet need of an artificial pacing system or device that can automatically adapt the HBP therapy to an indication of rate-related or intermittent AV conduction disturbance. The present document describes various examples of systems, devices, and methods for providing conditional HBP in accordance with the presence of an indication of AV conduction disturbance. An exemplary medical system includes an AV conduction monitor to detect an indication of presence or absence of intermittent or rate-related AV conduction disturbance using physiologic information of the subject. In the event that an intermittent or rate-related AV conduction disturbance is present, a control circuit provides a control signal to an electrostimulation circuit to deliver HBP pulses. If there is no indication of intermittent or rate-related AV conduction disturbance, or a previously detected intermittent or rate-related AV conduction disturbance has been terminated, the control circuit withholds or discontinues delivery of the HBP pulses to promote intrinsic ventricular conduction and activation, such as produced by sinus node or natural or paced atrial activations that propagate to the ventricles.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The systems, devices, and methods discussed in this document may improve the technology of cardiac pacing for patients with cardiac disease, such as HF with intermittent or rate-related conduction disturbance, yet with little to no additional cost or system complexity. HBP may activate natural His-Purkinje system, thereby preserving ventricular synchrony and improving cardiac performance without structural and functional impairment to the heart. IMP as discussed in the present document can leverage the electrophysiology of the His bundle region, and improve pacing efficiency utilizing the natural conduction mechanisms of the heart, while reducing long-term harmful hemodynamic effects associated with conventional RV apical pacing used for HF management. Compared to conventional permanent HBP, the subject matter discussed herein takes into consideration that some AV conduction disturbances (e.g., intra-Hisian block) are more likely intermittent or rate-related, and advantageously adapts HBP delivery to a detected indication of presence or absence of AV conduction disturbance, thus more efficiently uses the HBP therapy only when necessary. Withholding or discontinuing HBP whenever, and for as long as, the indication of AV conduction disturbance is absent may not only avoid unnecessary HBP therapy and therefore eliminating potential side effects of HBP (e.g., phrenic nerve stimulation or pain sensation), but also promote intrinsic ventricular activation via patient native normal His-Purkinje system, which can result in more favorable ventricular performance and hemodynamic outcome than artificial cardiac pacing such as HBP. Considering the high prevalence of intermittent or rate-related conduction disturbance in HF patient population, the conditional HBP discussed herein may potentially benefit many HF patients with intermittent or rate-related AV blocks. Additionally, compared to conventional permanent HBP, a pacing system or device implemented with the conditional HBP discussed herein may deliver less HBP therapies. This may advantageously save battery power of an artificial pacing system or device, extend device longevity, and make it possible to reduce device size (e.g., with smaller batteries or capacitors) without sacrificing existing performance metrics. As such, the subject matter discussed in this document improves the functionality of an artificial pacing system or device.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">While His-bundle pacing is specifically discussed in this document, this is meant only by way of example and not limitation.

The electrostimulation circuit <b>210</b> can be configured to generate His-bundle pacing (HBP) pulses for delivery to a target pacing site at or near the His bundle or a bundle branch along the conduction pathway, such as via the lead <b>106</b> and one or more of the electrodes <b>112</b>A-<b>112</b>B. The target site may include an interventricular septum region or a right atrial region near the His-bundle, or other conductive tissue on the physiologic conduction pathway, such as right or left bundle branches or fascicles, or Purkinje fibers. In an example, the HBP pulses may be delivered in multiple cardiac cycles, such that at least one pulse is delivered within each of the multiple cardiac cycles. In various examples, the electrostimulation circuit <b>210</b> may additionally generate electrostimulation to stimulate non-cardiac tissue, such as nerve tissue, muscle tissue, or other excitable tissue.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The electrostimulation circuit <b>210</b> may generate HBP pulses according to one or more stimulation parameters such as provided by control circuit <b>240</b>. Examples of the stimulation parameters may include information about stimulation site, stimulation strength, stimulation mode, or stimulation timing, among other parameters. Stimulation site includes information about pacing site, pacing vector configuration (e.g., anode and cathode electrodes), unipolar or bipolar pacing, etc. Stimulation strength parameters determine the amount of energy delivered to the pacing site, and may include pulse amplitude, pulse width, pulse frequency, pulse waveform, duty cycle, or stimulation duration. In some examples, the stimulation parameters may include one or more HBP parameters such as pacing rate, pacing interval, or timing of HBP pulses, among other parameters, which are collectively referred to as HBP configuration in this document.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Stimulation mode includes, by way of example and not limitation, a His-bundle only mode, an atrial-Hisian (AH) pacing mode, a His-ventricular (HV) pacing mode, or an atrial-His-ventricular (AHV) pacing mode. In the His-bundle only pacing mode, atrial activation may be sensed by the His-bundle pacing electrode, such as by using a single pass lead, or a leadless pacemaker having a form factor with multiple electrodes positioned such that reliable atrial sensing may be achieved. In the AH pacing mode, the HBP pulses may be delivered only when intrinsic atrial activation (AS), or atrial pacing (AP), fails to produce propagatable depolarization of the AV node and the His bundle. The AH pacing mode may be suitable for patients with varying degrees of heart block or sick sinus syndrome. The HV pacing mode involves sequential pacing of the His bundle and the ventricle. The ventricular pacing may be provided in a demand mode, such that the ventricular pacing pulses are delivered only when the His pacing fails to produce propagatable depolarization of the ventricles. The HV pacing mode may be indicated for patients with persistent or chronic atrial fibrillation, or who have been treated with atrioventricular node ablation or drugs to slow and the rapid ventricular rhythm that often results and allow HBP to predominate. The AHV pacing mode involves sequential atrial, Hisian, and ventricular pacing. One or more of the His-bundle pacing or the ventricular pacing may be delivered in a demand mode. The AHV pacing mode may be indicated for patients with cardiac dyssynchrony and having received cardiac resynchronization therapy, patients suffering from HF with LBBB, HF induced by right ventricular pacing, long PR intervals with hemodynamic compromise, or pacemaker induced cardiomyopathy from conventional dual-chamber pacing.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Stimulation timing parameters determine the timing and sequence of pacing pulses. For example, in demand AH pacing mode, the HBP pulses are timed relative to an AS or an AP event. An AH timing represents a latency period, within a cardiac cycle, from an intrinsic AS event or an AP event to the delivery of an HBP pulse. In demand HV pacing mode, the ventricular pacing pulses are timed relative to a His pacing event. The HV timing represents a latency period, within a cardiac cycle, from a His bundle event (e.g., an HBP pulse) to the delivery of ventricular pacing pulse. In an example, if an HBP pulse fails to induce ventricular depolarization, a backup ventricular pacing may be delivered at the end of the HV timing.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The electrostimulation circuit <b>210</b> can be configured to provide selective pacing at a site with only a targeted tissue being directly excited, without substantial unintended and undesirable excitation of other non-targeted tissue. If the pacing directly causes intended excitation of the targeted tissue as well as unintended excitation of other non-targeted tissue, a non-selective pacing results. In the context of HBP, selective HBP causes only the excitation (depolarization) of the His bundle, without direct excitation of para-Hisian myocardium adjacent to the His bundle. Non-selective HBP directly causes excitation of both the His bundle and the para-Hisian myocardium. If the HBP pulses cause only excitation of the para-Hisian myocardium or other un-intended cardiac tissue, without direct excitation of the His-bundle fibers, then a para-Hisian pacing results. If no tissue excitation is induced by HBP (e.g., neither the para-Hisian myocardium capture nor the His-bundle capture), then a complete loss of capture (LOC) results.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In addition to HBP, the electrostimulation circuit <b>210</b> can be configured to generate one or more of other pacing modalities, such as bradycardia ventricular demand pacing (VDP), cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), BiV pacing, or synchronized left ventricle (LV)-only pacing, single site pacing of only one site of a heart chamber (e.g., the left ventricle), or multisite pacing (MSP) of two or more sites of a heart chamber within the same cardiac cycle, among others. These pacing modalities may be delivered according to their respective stimulation strength, stimulation site, stimulation mode, or stimulation timing, among other parameters, such as provided by control circuit <b>240</b>. In some examples, the electrostimulation circuit <b>210</b> may generate ventricular backup pacing (VBP) if HBP does not capture the excitable tissue and activate the ventricles. The VBP pulses may be delivered to a target ventricular site via electrodes disposed on a ventricular lead. Additionally or alternatively, backup pacing may be delivered to the His bundle via electrodes on a His-bundle pacing lead. In an example, VBP may include high-output pacing (HOP) pulses with higher pacing energy than conventional pacing pulses. The HOP pulse may be a biphasic or multiphasic waveform. In an example, the HOP pulse may have a peak-to-peak voltage amplitude of 5-8 volts, and a pulse duration of 50-70 msec. With higher amount of energy delivered to the myocardium, the HOP pulse may increase myocardial contractility and improve systolic function. However, chronic HOP pacing may overstress the heart and potentially be hazardous in some heart failure patients. According, in some examples, the HOP pulses may be delivered on an intermittent basis, such that the conventional pacing pulses are delivered in 3-5 cardiac cycles between the HOP pulses. In an example, the HOP pulses may be delivered when one or more physiologic sensors sense a deterioration in cardiac hemodynamics, in addition to the indication of loss of capture of para-Hisian capture.

In various examples, the far-field EGM may be sensed between the ventricular electrode <b>131</b> and the proximal electrode <b>132</b>, between the ventricular electrode <b>131</b> and the housing <b>116</b> or an electrode therein, or between the ventricular electrode <b>131</b> and a joint electrode comprising the proximal electrode <b>132</b> and the housing <b>116</b> or an electrode therein that are at least temporarily electrically tied together. Such far-field EGMs sensed using the ventricular electrode <b>131</b> may represents far-field LV or far-field BiV (i.e., LV and RV) activations, as well as ventricular synchrony such as indicated by QRS width or interventricular conduction delay. Additionally or alternatively, the FFVA signal may be sensed using electrodes positioned in or on other heart chambers or locations other than RV and LV. In an example, the FFVA signal may be sensed using an atrial electrode, such as the RA electrode <b>111</b> associated with the lead <b>106</b>, and a reference electrode such as the housing <b>116</b> or an electrode therein.

An intermittent AV conduction disturbance is characterized by blockage status that changes over time, such as due to patient condition or medication. A rate-related AV conduction disturbance, such a rate-related LBBB, is characterized by delayed or blocked AV conduction only at times of when the heart rate is above a heart rate cutoff. Intermittent or rate-related AV conduction abnormality can often be found in patients with intra-Hisian blocks. The detection of the indication of presence or absence of intermittent or rate-related conduction disturbance can be based on heart rate, QRS width, among other physiologic parameters generated from the received physiologic sensor signals. In an example, the detection of intermittent or rate-related conduction disturbance may be carried out while the heart is being paced, such as during delivery of HBP due to a previous detection of intermittent or rate-related conduction block. For example, the AV conduction monitor <b>230</b> may sense a heart rate from an atrium and determines whether the intermittent or rate-related conduction block persists or has terminated, without interruption or suspension of an ongoing HBP delivery. Alternatively, HBP may be suspended for a specified period to allow for an assessment of the conduction block status. When the HBP is suspended, the system may operate in a sense-only mode where no cardiac pacing is delivered by the electrostimulation circuit <b>210</b>. In an example, during the delivery of HBP, the AV conduction monitor <b>230</b> may continuously scan for resumption of normal conduction, such as when heart rate falls below a heart rate cutoff (HR<sub>block</sub>) at which block has occurred. In another example, the AV conduction monitor <b>230</b> may search for resumption of normal conduction periodically (e.g., every 10 minutes). Periodic search may be used if the AV conduction disturbance is a paroxysmal block. In an example, the periodic search may entail suspending HBP temporarily and determining whether normal conduction has resumed. If AV conduction disturbance persists, HBP can be resumed at appropriate AHI (e.g., approximately 50-120 msec) following an AS or an AP event.

The HR<sub>block </sub>can vary from patient from patient, and from time to time in the same patient. An individualized HR<sub>block </sub>can be determined and updated as needed based on other sensor information, as to be discussed in the following with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. In an example, patient QRS width may be compared to a QRS width threshold (QRS<sub>block</sub>). At <b>420</b>, an intermittent AV conduction disturbance is decided to be present if the patient QRS width exceeds the QRS<sub>block</sub>, or to be absent if the QRS width falls below the QRS<sub>block</sub>. In an example, patient AVI may be compared to an AVI threshold (AVI<sub>block</sub>). At <b>420</b>, an intermittent AV conduction disturbance is decided to be present if the patient AVI exceeds the AVI<sub>block</sub>, or to be absent if the patient AVI falls below the AVI<sub>block</sub>. In an example, patient S1 intensity may be compared to an S1 intensity threshold (S1<sub>block</sub>). At <b>420</b>, an intermittent AV conduction disturbance is decided to be present if the patient S1 intensity falls below the S1<sub>block</sub>, or to be absent if the S1 intensity exceeds the S1<sub>block</sub>. In an example, a cardiac time interval may be determined, such as a pre-ejection period (PEP) representing a time duration from the onset of the QRS to the S1 heart sound. Patient PEP may be compared to a PEP threshold (PEP<sub>block</sub>). At <b>420</b>, an intermittent AV conduction disturbance is decided to be present if the PEP is above the PEP<sub>block</sub>, or to be absent if the PEP is below the PEP<sub>block</sub>.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">If it is decided at <b>430</b> that no indication of intermittent or rate-related AV conduction disturbance is present, then at <b>440</b>, the HBP may be withheld, or an ongoing HBP may be discontinued. Withholding or discontinuing HBP can promote cardiac conduction through the physiologic AV conduction system. This not only avoids or reduces unnecessary therapies (e.g., HBP or ventricular pacing), but may also bring about more favorable ventricular performance and hemodynamic outcome. Avoidance of unnecessary HBP can also conserve battery power and extend implantable device longevity. If it is decided at <b>430</b> that an indication of intermittent or rate-related AV conduction disturbance is present, then at <b>450</b> HBP may be delivered to the physiologic conduction pathway (e.g., His-bundle or a bundle branch). The HBP pulses may be delivered in accordance with stimulation waveform parameters, stimulation site, stimulation timing, among others. According to some examples, in response to an indication of a presence of intermittent or rate-related AV conduction disturbance, HBP pulses may be delivered at an atrio-Hisian interval (AHI) following an AS or an AP event. The AHI can be consistent with a normal AH interval of the patient. The AHI can be a programmable value. In an example, the AHI can be approximately 50-120 msec. In an example, at <b>450</b>, the HBP waveform parameters and/or stimulation site may be programmed or adjusted by a user, or automatically determined or adjusted such as by the HBP control circuit <b>242</b>. In some examples, the delivery of the HBP pulse may trigger a His capture verification process. If the HBP fails to capture the conduction pathway (e.g., loss of capture of para-Hisian capture), one or more HBP pacing parameters may be adjusted. In some examples, ventricular backup pacing (VBP) may be delivered if HBP fails to capture the physiologic conduction pathway and elicit ventricular activation.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">In some examples, the method <b>400</b> may be used to determine whether a presently HBP therapy needs to be continued or discontinued. The received physiologic signal at <b>410</b> may be acquired while the patient undergoes HBP, representing patient physiologic response to HBP (e.g., heart rate response, or other physiologic responses as detected by physiologic sensors). An indication of a presence of intermittent or rate-related AV conduction disturbance may be detected at <b>420</b> using patient physiologic response to HBP. In an example of HR-based detection of intermittent or rate-related AV conduction disturbance, the heart rate can be represented by atrial heart rate. Because the atrial heart rate is less likely to be interfered by HBP than ventricular heart rate, an ongoing HBP can be continued without interruption or suspension, while the AV conduction status may be assessed. The atrial heart rate can be an atrial intrinsic rate (sinus rate, or AS rate), or an atrial pacing (AP) rate. The atrial heart rate can be determined using the P wave or atrial pacing artifacts sensed from an ECG or from an atrial EGM, or a far-field EGM (representing an electrical signature in the far field of atrium) using an electrode outside the atrium such as the proximal electrode <b>132</b>. In some examples, the atrial heart rate includes a sensor-driven atrial pacing rate, determined based on patient physiologic response (e.g., physical activity or respiration). If atrial heart rate (e.g., AS, AP, or sensor-drive atrial pacing rate) exceeds a threshold (e.g., HR<sub>block</sub>), then a presence of intermittent or rate-related AV conduction disturbance is indicated, and the present HBP therapy can be continued. However, if atrial heart rate slows down and falls below the threshold (e.g., HR<sub>block</sub>), then an absence of intermittent or rate-related AV conduction disturbance is indicated, and the present HBP therapy can be discontinued.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a flow chart illustrating an example of a method <b>520</b> of sequential detection an indication of presence or absence of rate-related or intermittent AV conduction disturbance using heart rate (BR) and at least one physiologic parameter different from the HR. The method <b>520</b> is an embodiment of a portion of the method <b>400</b>, such as step <b>420</b>. At <b>521</b>, HR and at least one physiologic parameter different from BR, determined from the received physiologic information, may be monitored continuously or periodically (e.g., every 10 minutes). By way of example and not limitation, the physiologic parameter may include QRS width, AV interval, heart sounds, or cardiac timing, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. At <b>522</b>, the monitored HR can be compared to a heart rate threshold HR<sub>block </sub>(or a function of HR<sub>block</sub>). If the monitored HR is below the HR<sub>block</sub>, then the process goes back to <b>521</b> to continue monitoring the HR and the physiologic parameter. If the monitored HR exceeds the HR<sub>block</sub>, then the detection of intermittent or rate-related AV conduction disturbance is initiated using the monitored physiologic parameter. Using HR exceeding the HR<sub>block </sub>to trigger the detection of intermittent or rate-related AV conduction disturbance can be performed using the control circuit <b>240</b>. One or more of QRS width, AV interval, heart sounds, or cardiac timing, among other physiologic parameters, may be used to detect an intermittent or rate-related AV conduction disturbance using, are discussed above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating another example of a method <b>600</b> for providing His-bundle pacing (HBP) to correct rate-related or intermittent AV conduction abnormality in a patient using a medical-device system.

Similar to step <b>410</b>, physiologic information may be received at <b>610</b>. At <b>620</b>, heart rate (BR) and at least one physiologic parameter different from the HR can be determined from the received physiologic information, and monitored continuously or periodically. By way of example and not limitation, the physiologic parameter can include QRS width, AV interval, heart sounds metrics, or cardiac timing, among other physiologic parameters, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">At <b>630</b>, the physiologic parameter, other than the BR, can be used to generate an initial detection of intermittent or rate-related AV conduction disturbance, such as discussed above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. HR may be monitored during the initial detection. A decision is made at <b>640</b> about presence or absence of an indication of the intermittent or rate-related AV conduction disturbance. If it is decided at <b>640</b> that no indication of intermittent or rate-related AV conduction disturbance is present, then at <b>650</b>, the HBP may be withheld, or an ongoing HBP may be discontinued. If it is decided at <b>640</b> that an indication of intermittent or rate-related AV conduction disturbance is present, then at <b>660</b>, a heart rate cutoff (HR<sub>block</sub>) that corresponds to the initial detection of an event of intermittent or rate-related AV conduction disturbance can be determined. The HR<sub>block </sub>may be reported to a user (e.g., a clinician). Additionally or alternatively, the determined HR<sub>block </sub>may replace the existing heart rate threshold used in detecting rate-related or intermittent AV conduction disturbance. At <b>670</b>, HBP may be delivered to the physiologic conduction pathway (e.g., His-bundle or a bundle branch). At <b>680</b>, the monitored HR, optionally along with one or more physiologic parameter, may be used to determine whether the HBP needs to be continued or discontinued. In an example, the HBP can be continued without interruption, while the HR may be continuously scanned for resumption of normal conduction.

If at <b>680</b> the patient HR falls below the HR<sub>block</sub>, then it is determined that the rate-related or intermittent AV conduction disturbance has terminated, and the HBP can be discontinued at <b>650</b>. When the HBP is discontinued, the pacing system may operate in a sense-only mode where no cardiac pacing is delivered. In some examples, at <b>680</b>, resumption of normal conduction may be periodically searched (e.g., every 10 minutes). During the search period, the HBP can be temporarily suspended. Periodic searches may be used to detect paroxysmal AV block. If AV conduction disturbance persists, HBP can be resumed at <b>670</b> with appropriate AHI (e.g., approximately 50-120 msec) following an AS or an AP event.
