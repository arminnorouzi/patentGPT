RA is a systematic disease, and manifestations may include constitutional symptoms such as fatigue, fever and malaise, vasculitis, cardiovascular complications, ocular involvement, pulmonary interstitial disease, and widespread nodulosis. Patients with RA have a reduced life span which correlates with disease severity, and increased levels of cytokines such as TNF-&#x3b1;, IL-1 and IL-6, circulating immune complexes (ICs), rheumatoid factor (RF) levels, and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Despite recent progress in RA therapy with a number of approved targeted biologics in the United States and Europe, unmet medical needs remain. First, many agent approved for RA exhibit significant safety concerns, including risk of tuberculosis and other serious infections, malignancies, and gastrointestinal perforation. Second, many patients are only partially respond to current available therapies, and true remission is achieved by only a minority of patients (&#x3c;10% in many series). Third, current treatments have toxicities that lead to frequent drug discontinuation. In addition, the destructive process of RA cannot be halted in all patients, and new drugs that reduce osteoclast-mediated bone loss and inflammation may offer unique benefits to patients with RA.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Immune complexes containing IgG play a critical role in the immunopathology of many immune-mediated disorders. In RA, immune complexes (ICs) are present in the joints and act on synovial macrophages to drive the production of the cytokines, chemokines, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that are critical in mediating disease pathology. Expression of Fc&#x3b3;RIIa and Fc&#x3b3;RIIIa are increased in monocytes and macrophages of patients with RA, and produce higher levels of TNF-&#x3b1; and MMPs than healthy controls.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Activating Fc&#x3b3; receptors are also important in the activation of monocyte-derived dendritic cells. Genome-wide association studies have shown Fc&#x3b3;RIIIa to be associated with RA susceptibility, and murine models of RA such as the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model have demonstrated a role for activation Fc&#x3b3; receptors in disease pathogenesis. BTK is highly expressed in myeloid lineages and regulates signaling pathways leading from the binding of ICs to Fc&#x3b3;RIIIa and Fc&#x3b3;RIIa to expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and cell adhesion molecules. BTK also mediated Fc&#x3b3;RI signaling in mast cells and basophils although the role of these pathways in RA is not well established. However, IgE ACPAs have been identified in patients with RA, and the number of activated mast cells may be increased in synovial tissue and have been correlated with disease activity. Thus, inhibition of BTK could have therapeutic benefit on a variety of immunopathogenic features of RA.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a member of the Tec family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases and is expressed in all hematopoietic cells, with the exception of T cells and terminally differentiated plasma cells. Wu, J. et al., Journal of Hematology &#x26; Oncology (2016) 9:80.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Lastly, BTK inhibition could potentially counter the bone damage in RA through its role in mediating RANK-dependent osteoclastogenesis.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The inventors have discovered methods of treating a patient having rheumatoid arthritis by the administering sequentially a BTK inhibitor for a first period followed by abatacept for a second period.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention provides methods of treating a patient having rheumatoid arthritis, comprising administering sequentially to said patient, a therapeutically effective dose of a Btk inhibitor for a first period, followed by a therapeutically effect dose of abatacept for a second period.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention provides methods of treating a patient having rheumatoid arthritis, comprising administering sequentially to said patient, a therapeutically effective dose of an irreversible Btk inhibitor for a first period, followed by a therapeutically effect dose of abatacept for a second period.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention provides methods of treating a patient having rheumatoid arthritis, comprising administering sequentially to said patient, a therapeutically effective dose of branebrutinib for a first period, followed by a therapeutically effect dose of abatacept for a second period.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">These and other features of the invention will be set forth in expanded form as the disclosure continues.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DEFINITIONS</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In order that the present description may be more readily understood, certain terms are first defined.
