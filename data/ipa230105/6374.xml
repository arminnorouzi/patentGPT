For example, most desktop computers include multiple PCIe (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express) expansion slots with connectors mounted to the motherboard that are configured to interface with edge connectors on PCIe AICs (also referred to as expansions cards). This PCIe connectors are mounted perpendicular to the motherboard PCB (printed circuit board).</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In 2012, Intel&#xae; Corporation introduced M.2 (pronounced M dot 2) for internal expansion cards on PC motherboards and laptop and the like. M.2, which originally Next Generation Form Factor (NGFF), was conceived as a successor of the mSATA interface. Today, M.2 supports multiple types of interfaces, including Peripheral Interconnect Connect Express (PCIe) 3.0 and 4.0, Serial ATA 3.0, USB 3.0, and Non-volatile Memory Express (NVMe).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">PCI-SIG (Special Interest Group), the PCIe standards body, developed and standardized the PCIe M.2 card edge and mating PCIe M.2 connector, which is a right-angle connector that enables the expansion card to be installed parallel to the motherboard. Examples of an SSD M.2 edge card <b>100</b> and an M.2 connector <b>120</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b><i>a </i></figref>and <b>1</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">SSD edge card <b>100</b> includes a PCB <b>102</b> including an PCIe M.2 edge connector <b>104</b>, Various integrated circuits (aka chips) and other electronic components are mounted to PCB <b>102</b>, including a memory controller chip <b>106</b>, a DRAM memory chip <b>108</b>, and a pair of non-volatile (NV) memory chips <b>110</b> and <b>112</b>. PCIe M.2 edge connector has a Key B+M form factor with pins on a single side (the top side of SSD edge card <b>100</b> in this example).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">PCIe M.2 connector <b>120</b> includes a body <b>122</b> having a slot in which edge contacts <b>124</b> are disposed. The edge contacts <b>124</b> are electrically coupled to contacts <b>126</b>, which are soldered to pads in the motherboard PCB (or other type of PCB). When installed in PCIe M.2 connector <b>120</b>, the pins in PCIe M.2 edge connector are electrically coupled to edge contacts <b>124</b>, and thus to the pads in the PCB.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The PCIe M.2 connector was designed for PCIe 3.0 and PCIe 4.0 (3rd and 4th generation) standards. For high speed I/O, such as PCIe5 (PCIe 5th generation), the M.2 connector shows performance degradation. The connector performance improvement is critical for higher data rate I/O applications. In addition, the pin count of this connector is not scalable with given PCIe edge card form factor, which limit the bandwidth of the card.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The M.2 connector used for WWAN has a current limitation of 500 mA per pin. There are 5 pins allocated for current, which means the present M.2 connector can support only up to 3.3V&#xd7;5&#xd7;500 mA=8.25 W(atts). With the advent of 5G and LTE advanced, the power requirement has increased significantly and hence the present M.2 connector cannot be used to support all the advanced feature of these new technologies. With the advancement in technologies (Next Gen SSD and WWAN module sub-6 with mm-wave), the PCIe interface needs to support higher speed and bandwidth. However, the current connectors are not designed to work at PCIe speed.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The foregoing aspects and many of the attendant advantages of this invention will become more readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description, when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to like parts throughout the various views unless otherwise specified:</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a </i></figref>shows an NVMe SSD card including a PCIe M.2 edge connector.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>b </i></figref>shows a right-angle PCIe M.2 connector.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b><i>a </i>and <b>2</b><i>b </i></figref>show cross-section views of a platform before and after a WWAN module has been coupled to a motherboard;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>a </i></figref>is a 3D isometric topside view of a platform including a WWAN module including an LGA that is coupled to a motherboard using a clip assembly, according to one embodiment;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>b </i></figref>is a 3D isometric underside view of the platform of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref><i>a; </i></p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>a </i></figref>is a 3D isometric underside view of the module PCB with LGA, according to one embodiment;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>b </i></figref>shows an enlarged view of a portion of the module PCB illustrating further details of the LGA pin structure, according to one embodiment;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>a </i></figref>is a 3D shaded image view of the frontside of a clip assembly, according to one embodiment;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>b </i></figref>is a hidden line view of the clip assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref><i>a; </i></p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>c </i></figref>of a 3D shaded image view of the backside of the clip assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b><i>a </i></figref>and <b>5</b><i>b; </i></p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b><i>a </i>and <b>6</b><i>b </i></figref>are 3D hidden line views showing further details of a motherboard and installation of the clip assembly;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b><i>a </i>and <b>7</b><i>b </i></figref>shows 3D perspective views of the topside of a heat shield and the underside of the heat shield, according to one embodiment;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows an underside 3D view of a platform with the motherboard removed and the module PCB shown transparently;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b><i>a </i>and <b>9</b><i>b </i></figref>respectively show topside and underside views of a first NVMe SSD card including a first array of pads that are used to connect to mating pins or contacts in a CMT connector; and</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> show heat maps demonstrating a reduction in the module shielding temperature and module board temperature for a 9 Watt WWAN module.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Embodiments of apparatus comprising connector-less modules are described herein.

The shelves of debossed features <b>714</b>, <b>716</b>, and <b>718</b>, which may have variable depths (as applicable) are configured to be disposed above respective chips in the baseband circuitry, with an appropriate thermal interface material (TIM) between the top of the chips and the underside of the debossed features to facilitate heat transfer from high power components such as the baseband modem SoC to the heat shield cap. The shielding height of RF portion is retained to avoid any possible cavity effect which might degrade RF performance.

Each PCB form factor includes a notch having a radius formed in the end of the PCB opposite the connector end that is used to align that end of the PCB with a mounting screw. The M.2 specification defines several edge connector configurations, including connectors with a single row of pins and connectors with two columns of pins. Under some embodiments herein, the module PCBs employ an M2 PCB form factor while employing a connection-less LGA rather than a card edge configured to mate with an edge connector.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In addition to the M.2 form factors, other PCB form factors may also be used.
