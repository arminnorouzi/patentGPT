Said cylinders are connected to a liquid source to pump through a suction channel, usually comprising a primary duct and a plurality of branch ducts that place the primary duct in fluid communication with the cylinders.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Axial pumps with inclined plate for high pressures with three pistons are known, which on one hand are of relatively simple design and construction, particularly as regards the construction and design of the suction and delivery channels, and on the other hand have significant fluctuations in flow rate during operation.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">An object of the present invention is to make available an axial piston pump with reduced delivery flow rate fluctuation which is at the same time of compact and efficient construction in fluid-dynamic terms, all within a rational and affordable solution. Such object is achieved by the features of the invention indicated in the independent claim. The dependent claims outline preferred and/or particularly advantageous aspects of the invention.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In particular, the invention makes available an axial piston pump for pumping liquid comprising:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0006">a head in which there is at least partially a plurality of cylinders in a number greater than three, with central parallel axes,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0007">a plurality of pistons that each slide within a respective cylinder of the plurality of cylinders for the pumping of the liquid,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0008">a housing seat of a suction valve made in the head, and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0009">a housing seat of a delivery valve made in the head,</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0007" num="0010">wherein the housing seat of the suction valve and the housing seat of the delivery valve are in direct fluid communication with each other via a channel made in the head, said channel in turn being in direct fluid communication with a cylinder of the plurality of cylinders and is rectilinear.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0011">This solution makes available an axial piston pump with reduced delivery flow rate fluctuations, which is compact, robust, quick to construct and particularly efficient in fluid-dynamic terms, as it is possible, through the creation of a single channel, to connect a suction valve to a respective delivery valve and a corresponding cylinder.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0012">According to another aspect of the invention, the channel may have a central axis which lies on a transversal plane to the central axes of the cylinders.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0013">In such way the axial compactness of the pump is improved (axial compactness means the compactness in a direction parallel to the central axes of the cylinders)</p><p id="p-0011" num="0014">An aspect of the invention envisages that the channel may have a uniform cross-section along the whole of its longitudinal extension.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0015">Another aspect of the invention envisages that the channel may be part of a through hole from one side to an opposite side of the head.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0016">In this way the head is of rapid construction, also in view of the fact that no channel depth checks are required.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0017">According to one aspect of the invention, the pump may comprise a plurality of housing seats of respective suction valves made in the head and a plurality of housing seats of respective delivery valves made in the head and in which each housing seat of a delivery valve is in direct fluid communication with a corresponding housing seat of a suction valve via a channel of a plurality of channels made in the head, each of which is in direct fluid communication only with a single respective cylinder of the plurality of cylinders.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0018">According to another aspect of the invention, at least one channel of the plurality of channels is placed at a different distance, from a face of the head facing a crankcase containing a rotating plate of the pump, in relation to the other channels.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0019">With this solution, the pump is particularly compact, especially in the transversal direction to the central axes of the cylinders.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0020">In particular, preferably, at least two channels have central axes lying on a same plane and a further channel has a central axis lying at a different distance to said face in relation to the lying plane of the central axes of the other two channels.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0021">According to another aspect again of the invention, the channels may have longitudinal axes parallel to each other.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0022">This characteristic contributes to improving the compactness of the pump.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0023">Furthermore, the axial piston pump may comprise a plurality of through holes used to house tightening screws to tighten the head to a crankcase, and in which these through holes are all made in two diagonally opposite portions of the head which are subtended by two symmetrical angles having their centre in a central portion of the head and which each measure a maximum of 75&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0024">In this way maintenance is simplified and faster, as there is excellent access to the screws fixing the head to the crankcase.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0025">According to another aspect of the invention, the housing seat of the suction valve has a central axis transversal to a central axis of the duct which connects it to the housing seat of the delivery valve.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0026">In this way the valve maintenance operations are made easier and quicker, as it is simpler to access the cap closing the housing seat using standard tools.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings

to these figures, <b>1</b>,<b>1</b>&#x2032; indicates overall an axial piston pump for high pressures, preferably suited for pumping liquids with low viscosity, for example water.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0035">For example, the axial piston pump <b>1</b>,<b>1</b>&#x2032; is of the type fitted with a fixed inclination rotating plate, as better described below. Furthermore it is of the type fitted with automatic valves for controlling the pumping flow.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0036">The axial piston pump <b>1</b>,<b>1</b>&#x2032; may comprise a crankcase <b>5</b>, a rotating inclined plate <b>10</b>, adapted to receive a rotating motion from a crankshaft external to the axial piston pump <b>1</b>,<b>1</b>&#x2032;, and for example a fixing flange <b>6</b> fixed to a motor equipped with said crankshaft.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0037">The inclined plate <b>10</b> is housed in the crankcase <b>5</b>, it is rotatably associated to it on a pivot axis A, and for example comprises a flat annular surface <b>15</b> lying on an inclined plane in relation to the pivot axis A. In particular, the inclined plate is rotatably associated by a bearing to the flange <b>6</b>, which is bolted to the crankcase <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0038">The axial piston pump <b>1</b>,<b>1</b>&#x2032; comprises a head <b>20</b> fixed to the crankcase <b>5</b>, or fixed without residual degrees of freedom to the crankcase <b>5</b>, in which there is a plurality of cylinders <b>25</b>, that is cylindrical holes, each one adapted to contain respective liquid pumping chambers <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0039">The head <b>20</b> can be made in a unitary body, that can be obtained by processing a single body obtained from the solidification of a single cast or injection of material into a mould.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0040">The cylinders <b>25</b> of the plurality of cylinders <b>25</b> are more than three, that is at least four, preferably there are five, and are arranged with their respective central axes parallel to each other.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0041">For example, the cylinders <b>25</b> are arranged radially along a common axis, in relation to which the axes of the single central cylinders are parallel. Furthermore they are placed at an equal distance from each other and at the same distance to the common axis. In other words, the cylinders <b>25</b>, that is the central axes of the cylinders <b>25</b>, are arranged at equidistant angles to each other along an imaginary circumference centred on the common axis. In the shown embodiment, the common axis of the cylinders <b>25</b> is coaxial to a central axis of the head. For example, said common axis is also coaxial to the pivot axis A.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0042">Again in the shown embodiment, in which there are five cylinders, the central axes of the cylinders pass through the vertices of an imaginary regular pentagon lying on a perpendicular plane to the central axes of the cylinders themselves.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0043">Preferably the cylinders <b>25</b> are made as blind holes, each one with an opening facing the base frame.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0044">In particular, the head may comprise a first face <b>35</b>, which is transversal to the central axes of the cylinders, and is proximal to, preferably in contact with, the crankcase <b>5</b>, and is for example flat, and an opposite second face <b>40</b>, which is transversal to the central axes of the cylinders and is distal to the crankcase <b>5</b>. The cylinders <b>25</b>, that is cylindrical holes, cross only the first face <b>40</b> making the respective opening in it.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0045">The cylindrical holes can for example have a cross-section that is not constant along their axial extension. This characteristic allows the creation of shoulder surfaces.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0046">It is specified that the second face <b>40</b> and the first face <b>35</b> are connected by a tubular shaped side surface <b>60</b> of the head.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0047">Each cylinder comprises a bottom wall <b>26</b> lying on a transversal plane, for example perpendicular, to the axis of the cylinder itself. For example, the bottom wall <b>26</b> is separated from the second face of the head by a non-null distance.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0048">The cylinders <b>25</b> all have the same diameter.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0049">For further detail, the plurality of cylinders <b>25</b> comprises a first cylinder the central axis of which lies on a centreline plane M of the pump parallel to the central axes of all the cylinders, a second cylinder, a third cylinder, a fourth cylinder and a fifth cylinder, in which the second and third cylinders are specular to the fourth and fifth cylinders in relation to said centreline plane. Furthermore, the second cylinder and the fifth cylinder are closer to the first cylinder and are further from the centreline plane compared to the third and fourth cylinders.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0050">The axial piston pump <b>1</b>,<b>1</b>&#x2032; comprises a plurality of pistons <b>75</b> each adapted to slide in a respective cylinder <b>25</b>, driven by the inclined plate <b>10</b> to pump the fluid.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0051">In particular, following the rotation of the inclined plate <b>10</b>, the pistons <b>75</b> are made to slide along the central axes of the respective cylinders <b>25</b> between a top dead centre, in which the volume of the pumping chamber <b>30</b> is minimal, and a bottom dead centre, in which the volume of the pumping chamber is maximum.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0052">In the shown embodiment, each piston <b>75</b> has a first axial end <b>80</b> which partially delimits the pumping chamber and an opposite second axial end <b>85</b> which protrudes from the cylinder inside the crankcase <b>5</b> and, via a respective elastic element <b>90</b>, is held in contact with an annular guide <b>95</b> which rests on the flat annular surface <b>15</b> of the inclined plate <b>10</b>, for example by interposition of an axial roller bearing.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0053">Each elastic element <b>90</b> has a first end connected to the crankcase <b>5</b> and a second end connected to the piston <b>75</b>, for example near the second end <b>85</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0054">The second axial end <b>85</b> may be rounded and convex in shape. In this case the annular guide <b>95</b> has a concave annular surface <b>100</b> adapted to house the second axial end and allows relative sliding between the annular guide and the second axial end <b>85</b>. In particular, the concave annular surface <b>100</b> defines a profile, in a section plane containing the pivot axis, with a radius of curvature of between 1.5 and 1.7 times the diameter of the piston <b>75</b>, preferably 1.6 times.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0055">The axial piston pump <b>1</b>,<b>1</b>&#x2032; comprises a plurality of annular gaskets <b>105</b> adapted to embrace and seal a respective piston <b>75</b>, for example these annular gaskets being some housed in the crankcase <b>5</b> and others in the head <b>20</b>, to prevent the fluid communication between the pumping chambers <b>30</b> and the crankcase <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0056">Furthermore, the axial piston pump <b>1</b>,<b>1</b>&#x2032; may comprise a plurality of guide cylinders <b>110</b>, for example made in the crankcase <b>5</b>, each one adapted to guide a respective piston <b>75</b> sliding along the central axis of the corresponding cylinder <b>25</b><i>a, </i><b>25</b><i>b, </i><b>25</b><i>c, </i><b>25</b><i>d, </i><b>25</b><i>e. </i></p><p id="p-0054" num="0057">These guide cylinders <b>110</b> are in communication with the respective first openings <b>45</b> in the head <b>20</b>.

The spacer <b>106</b> also comprises radial openings used to allow the circulation of the suctioned and pumped liquid.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0059">Furthermore, the pump <b>1</b>,<b>1</b>&#x2032; may comprise a suction valve <b>115</b> and a delivery valve <b>120</b> for each cylinder <b>25</b>, the valves of which are automatic and single-acting and allow the definition of the flow direction from and to the pumping chamber <b>30</b>. In particular the suction valve <b>115</b> allows the flow only to the pumping chamber <b>30</b> and the delivery valve <b>120</b> allows the flow only from the pumping chamber <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0060">It is specified that automatic valve refers to a valve configured to open automatically allowing fluid communication, between two environments between which it is interposed, when a pre-set difference between the pressures in both environments divided by the valve itself is reached. Specifically, automatic valves do not exploit electromechanical operating mechanisms but only differences in pressure.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0061">Each suction valve <b>115</b> comprises an inlet mouth and an outlet mouth, which is in fluid communication with the pumping chamber, and each delivery valve <b>120</b> comprises an inlet mouth, which is in fluid communication with the pumping chamber, and an outlet mouth.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0062">The pump <b>1</b>,<b>1</b>&#x2032; comprises a respective housing seat for each suction valve <b>115</b> made directly in the head, for example made directly in the head as a hollow with an opening that flows externally to the head and is closed by a suction cap <b>116</b> configured to maintain the respective suction valve <b>115</b> in position in its housing seat.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0063">The pump <b>1</b>,<b>1</b>&#x2032; comprises a suction channel <b>140</b> for the distribution of the liquid to be pumped to the cylinders <b>25</b>.

Consequently, liquid is suctioned by the suction channel <b>140</b>, from there directly enters the respective housing seat of the suction valve to then reach the corresponding pumping chamber <b>30</b> crossing the respective suction valve <b>115</b> and subsequently the channel <b>155</b>. Having reached the bottom dead centre, the piston rises towards the top dead centre following the thrust of the inclined plate, generating an overpressure in the pumping chamber which closes the suction valve and opens the delivery valve. The fluid therefore flows through the channel <b>155</b> towards the delivery valve <b>120</b>, through which it is collected in the housing seats of the delivery valve and subsequently in the delivery channels.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0099">The invention thus conceived is susceptible to several modifications and variations, all falling within the scope of the inventive concept.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0100">Moreover, all the details can be replaced by other technically equivalent elements.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0101">In practice, the materials used, as well as the contingent shapes and sizes, can be whatever according to the requirements without for this reason departing from the scope of protection of the following claims.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
