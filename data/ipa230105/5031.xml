facilitating the purchase of data transfer service using cellular network in real time. The following description is presented to enable one of ordinary skill in the art to make and use the invention and is provided in the context of a patent application and its requirements. Various modifications to the preferred embodiments and the generic principles and features described herein will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. Thus, the present invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiments shown, but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and features described herein.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Given the proliferation of devices using cellular services, in the consumer, M2M and other markets, and the loss of resources both by users who spend money for unused capacity and by users who must pay for overage at high rates, it would be advantageous to provide a system and method for enabling the transfer of excess capacity. A system and method in accordance with the present invention utilize an exchange market operated by cellular service providers or other authorized parties (an exchange) that allows subscribers who have excess plan voice minutes, messages and bytes of data etc. to sell such excess to the subscribers who need them without either having to change their service contracts with their cellular service providers. An exchange is defined as a system that allows subscribers to buy and sell cellular service. The system, for example, can be operated by a cellular service provider or other authorized party. The subscribers, for example, can be any of network service providers, enterprises and consumers.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In one or more embodiments, a computer-implemented method and system are disclosed. The computer-implemented method and system allow subscribers whose contracts with a cellular service provider permit use of a specified quantity of voice minutes, messages and/or data for a set fee to use an exchange to sell excess plan voice minutes, messages, bytes of data, etc., giving rise to real-time priced cellular service for cellular subscribers, without any change to the subscribers' contracts and price plans with their cellular service providers. The computer-implemented method and system describe a network control scheme to support a real-time market for service offered at then-current real-time prices.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In an embodiment, a buyer and a seller with active subscriptions and cellular service profiles from the same cellular service provider are eligible for selling and purchasing the excess plan voice minutes, messages, bytes of data, etc. offered by the seller. The seller's subscription and service profile may be identified by an international mobile subscriber identifier (IMSI) or mobile identification number (MIN). Using the method enabled, the seller submits an offer to the exchange for sale at a given price of a quantity of excess voice minutes, short messages (SMS) or data valid for use within a specified time period. In one or more embodiments, the specified time period during which the cellular service offered is valid for use can be in multiples of one hour.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As part of an offer process, the seller also specifies cellular service profile identifiers associated with the offer. The exchange then publishes all offers in a continuous 24 hour window. A buyer enters the market through submitting a request specifying the quantity of voice minutes, messages and/or data required and a price range for this service that the buyer is willing to pay. As part of a request process, the buyer also specifies its service provider identifiers for the service profile that would use the purchased capacity. The computer-implemented method and system enables the exchange to find the lowest-priced offer that matches the buyer's requirements.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Once a matching offer is found, the exchange uses the computer-implemented method and system to complete the transaction and store any desired information, which may include the parties' respective service provider identifiers, quantity of service purchased, price and so on. In a method and system in accordance with an embodiment, the exchange then adjusts the service profiles of both the seller (deducting the quantity of service sold from available amounts) and the buyer (adding the purchased capacity to the available amounts). Accordingly, in an embodiment, an offer is allowed either to be taken off the market if quantities in the offer have been matched with at least one buyer or adjusted so that purchased amounts are removed. At the end of the purchased service period, the exchange removes the unused portion of the purchased service quantity from the buyer's service profile, without any further change to the seller's service profile. Payment settlement between the seller and buyer can be performed via a mechanism chosen and implemented by the exchange.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Additionally or alternatively, many users of devices attaching to and accessing cellular networks enter into service contracts with cellular service providers that permit use during a given time period of a specified quantity of messages and/or data for a set fee, for example, rate plans. Users with a need to transfer certain quantity of data but have the flexibility regarding time of data transfer and/or process of data transfer, may still have to purchase additional cellular service capacity from a service provider. These subscribers may face two challenges&#x2014;1) They may not be able to utilize the entire purchased capacity, resulting in underutilized capacity and overspending; 2) Potential data transfer to the destination device when there is no native cellular coverage but utilizing a roaming partner cellular coverage at the device location, resulting in expensive roaming charges.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Accordingly, there is a need for a method and system that would allow a subscriber with excess capacity provide services such as data transfer on a real time basis and perform the data transfer in a cost effective, and efficient way. The present invention addresses such a need.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In one or more embodiments, a computer-implemented method, system and computer program product for buying and selling service to transfer a quantity of data using cellular network are disclosed.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In an embodiment, the computer-implemented method for buying and selling service for transferring a quantity of data using cellular network includes receiving and storing one or more offers to transfer a quantity of data using cellular service; receiving and processing one or more discovery requests to transfer a quantity of data using cellular service; matching at least one of the one or more discovery requests with at least one of the one or more stored offers; and facilitating buying and selling of the service to transfer a quantity of data.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In an embodiment, the system for buying and selling service for transferring a quantity of data using cellular network, having at least one server comprising a processor, and a memory in communication with the processor wherein the memory including program instructions which when executed by the processor, perform the following operations including receiving and storing one or more offers to transfer a quantity of data using cellular service; receiving and processing one or more discovery requests to transfer a quantity of data using cellular service; matching at least one of the one or more discovery requests with at least one of the one or more stored offers; and facilitating buying and selling of the service to transfer a quantity of data.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In an embodiment, the computer program product stored on a computer readable medium for buying and selling service for transferring a quantity of data using cellular network, having computer readable programming for causing a computer to control an execution of an application for buying and selling service for transferring a quantity of data using cellular network, including the steps of: receiving and storing one or more offers to transfer a quantity of data using cellular service; receiving and processing one or more discovery requests to transfer a quantity of data using cellular service; matching at least one of the one or more discovery requests with at least one of the one or more stored offers; and facilitating buying and selling of the service to transfer a quantity of data.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In an embodiment, the one or more offers for transferring a quantity of data using cellular service comprise an offer to sell the service of transferring a quantity of data using cellular service initiated by a seller or an offer to buy the service of transferring a quantity of data using cellular service initiated by a buyer.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In an embodiment, the method, system and computer program product for buying and selling service to transfer a quantity of data using cellular network includes transferring the data to be transferred by the buyer to the seller of the data quantity transfer via exchange, where the timing and process of actual data transfer is controlled by the seller of the service to transfer a quantity of data, and may involve multiple sellers of service for a data quantity transfer, where the transfer of data to each of the one or more sellers may take place in multiple segments. The multiple sellers may include sellers based on geographical location as well as data transfer capacity of each seller etc.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In another embodiment, the method, system and computer program product for buying and selling service to transfer a quantity of data using cellular network includes transferring the data to be transferred by the buyer to the one or more sellers of the data transfer capacity via exchange, where the timing and process of actual data transfer is controlled by the seller of the service for transferring a quantity of data, and may involve one or more sellers of service for a data quantity transfer, where the transfer of data to each of the one or more sellers may take place in multiple segments.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In yet another embodiment, the method, system and computer program product for buying and selling service to transfer a quantity of data includes transferring the data to be transferred by the buyer to the seller, and where the timing and process of actual data transfer is controlled by the seller of the service to transfer a quantity of data, and may involve single seller, where the transfer of data to the seller may take place in a single shot.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In yet another embodiment, the method, system and computer program product for buying and selling service to transfer a quantity of data includes transferring the data to be transferred by the buyer to the seller, and where the timing and process of actual data transfer is controlled by the seller of the service to transfer a quantity of data, and may involve single seller, where the transfer of data to the seller may take place in multiple segments.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In yet another embodiment, the method, system and computer program product for buying and selling service to transfer a quantity of data using cellular network includes transferring the data to be transferred by the buyer to the one or more sellers of the data transfer capacity via exchange, where the timing is controlled by the seller of the service but the process of actual data transfer is controlled by the buyer, for transferring a quantity of data, and may involve one or more sellers of service for a data quantity transfer, where the transfer of data to each of the one or more sellers may take place in a single shot.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The SIM card on the receiving device has to be configured to receive data from the cellular service profile of the particular seller of the data transfer capacity. For example, if the SIM is configured to receive data using a cellular service provider, and if the seller will use a different cellular service provider, the SIM has to be configured to receive data using the cellular service provider of the seller.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">If necessary, the SIM on the receiving device needs to be reconfigured to receive data over the cellular service of the seller. And reconfigure the device back to the original cellular network used by the buyer.
