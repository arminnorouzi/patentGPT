These scanners may be used to scan barcodes and other objects. Such scanners are typically contained within a chassis to ensure optical components are protected from bumps, falls, and/or other potentially damaging events. In some environments, high powered scanners capable of scanning or resolving barcodes (e.g., 100 ml wide) across a wide range of distances, such as from a few inches to tens of feet, or more, may be desirable. Such systems require larger optics (e.g., imaging lens systems greater than approximately 6 mm in overall diameter) in order to meet performance requirements, but there remains a compromise between the lens system having a specific size while being constrained by the overall dimensions of the housing and the chassis. Also, compact imaging systems require high precision alignment of optics to prevent optical distortion, which can result in reduced efficiency of scanning rates, or faulty equipment. Additionally, each component of an imaging system can have a fabrication error that may cause optical misalignment resulting in reduced image resolution and scanning performance. Larger optics may be more susceptible to higher rates of fabrication errors, while smaller components are less robust to fabrication error with respect to optical alignment.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Accordingly, there is a need for improved optical alignment techniques allowing for improved functionalities of current and future optical systems.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In accordance with a first aspect, a method of alignment assembly of an imaging system is provided. The method includes positioning a lens holder at a calibrated back flange focal length from a calibration sensor. The calibration sensor is disposed along an optical axis to receive an image thereon, and the lens holder is positioned along the optical axis with a front aperture of the lens holder being along the optical axis and a back flange of the lends holder also along the optical axis. The lens holder contains a front lens group disposed along the optical axis and a rear lens group disposed along the optical axis. The method further includes translating, by an actuator, the front lens group to a plurality of positions along the optical axis while maintaining the rear group in a fixed position relative to the calibration sensor. Translating the front lens group changes a focal distance of the imaging system to focus the image onto the calibration sensor. The method then includes determining, by a processor, a calibrated position of the front lens group, the calibrated position being a position with a calibrated image focused at the calibration sensor; and setting, by the actuator, the front lens group to the calibrated position.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a variation of the current embodiment, the method further includes re-positioning the lens holder relative to an image sensor at a predetermined distance from the lens holder. In examples, the lens holder is repositioned at the calibrated back flange focal length from the image sensor. In yet more examples, the lens holder is repositioned at a distance from the image sensor, with the distance being determined by a physical spacer disposed between the lens holder and the image sensor. In yet more examples, the current variation includes actively aligning the lens holder to the image sensor.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In variations of the embodiment, the calibrated back flange focal length may be less than 0.25 millimeters, and/or the calibrated back flange focal length has a position tolerance along the optical axis of less than 50 microns.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some examples, the method may further include actively aligning the lens holder to the image sensor, which may include translating the lens holder in a plane orthogonal to the optical axis to position the image on the image sensor, tilting the lens holder to focus the image on the image sensor, determining a calibrated tilt alignment of the lens holder relative to the image sensor, translating the lens holder in the plane orthogonal to the optical axis to position the image on the image sensor, and determining a calibrated orthogonal position of the lens holder relative to the image sensor.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a variation of this embodiment, the actuator is one of a voice coil motor, a one-dimension translation stage, a piezoelectric device, a ball-bearing linear motor, or a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) motor. In examples the actuator has a travel distance of less than 0.5 mm. In further examples the focal distance of the optical assembly may be tuned from between 2 inches and infinity.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The accompanying figures, where like reference numerals refer to identical or functionally similar elements throughout the separate views, together with the detailed description below, are incorporated in and form part of the specification, and serve to further illustrate embodiments of concepts that include the claimed invention, and explain various principles and advantages of those embodiments.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a front elevation view of an example imaging assembly of an example scanner for capturing images of an object;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a perspective view of the example imaging assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> in accordance with various embodiments;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a perspective view of an example lens holder for use with the example imaging assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> &#x26; <b>2</b></figref> in accordance with various embodiments;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a perspective view of an example chassis for use with the example imaging assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> &#x26; <b>2</b></figref> in accordance with various embodiments;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates a perspective view of the example imaging assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b></figref> in accordance with various embodiments;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates a front elevation cross-sectional view of the example imaging system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>5</b></figref> in accordance with various embodiments.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a flowchart of a method for performing alignment of an optical assembly with respect to a calibration sensor, as may be performed for the imaging system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a front elevation cross-sectional view of an example imaging alignment apparatus for aligning an optical assembly.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a flowchart of a method for performing alignment of an optical assembly with respect to an imaging sensor, as may be performed for the imaging system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a front elevation cross-sectional view of a fabricated optical assembly that is aligned according to the methods of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>9</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Skilled artisans will appreciate that elements in the figures are illustrated for simplicity and clarity and have not necessarily been drawn to scale.

More specifically, the method described provides very high precision optical alignment allowing for the use of smaller, more compact, lenses and optical elements to fabricate optical systems that have low misalignment tolerances. The methods may also be useful for compensating for fabrication errors in optical systems. Further, the described methods may be implemented on larger optical systems that incorporate larger, higher-powered optical units capable of resolving images (e.g., barcodes and other indicia) disposed at greater distances, and greater ranges of distances, from the optical system.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">As to the figures, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a front elevation view of an example imaging assembly <b>100</b> of scanner for capturing images of an object in accordance with various embodiments. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a perspective view of the example imaging assembly <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in accordance with various embodiments. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an imaging system <b>110</b> disposed on a circuit board <b>102</b> without including other components of the imaging assembly <b>100</b>. The assembly <b>100</b> or scan engine is an example of an imaging assembly for capturing at least one image of an object appearing in an imaging field of view (FOV). The alignment methods described herein may be used to align optics of the imaging assembly <b>100</b>. The assembly <b>100</b> includes the circuit board <b>102</b>, the imaging system <b>110</b> operably coupled with the circuit board <b>102</b>, and a chassis <b>150</b>. Further, in some examples, the system <b>100</b> may include an aiming system <b>170</b> and an illumination system <b>180</b>, as well as any number of additional components used to assist with capturing an image or images of an object.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The circuit board <b>102</b> may include any number of electrical and/or electro-mechanical components (e.g., capacitors, resistors, transistors, power supplies, etc.) used to communicatively couple and/or control various electrical components of the assembly <b>100</b>. For example, the circuit board <b>102</b> may include any number of component mounting portions <b>103</b>, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, to receive components (e.g., the imaging system <b>110</b>) to operably couple therewith, and may additionally include a board mounting region <b>104</b> used to secure the circuit board <b>102</b> with the scanner housing (not illustrated). In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the circuit board <b>102</b> further includes one or more flex tail connected (not illustrated) to communicatively couple components disposed within the chassis <b>150</b>, and/or the imaging system <b>110</b> with the circuit board <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The imaging system <b>110</b> is also operably coupled with the circuit board <b>102</b>. The imaging system <b>110</b> includes an autofocus system <b>220</b> and a rear lens holder <b>112</b>, both containing lenses for imaging. The autofocus system <b>220</b> is positioned adjacent to and/or operably coupled with the rear lens holder <b>112</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a perspective view of an example lens holder as the rear lens holder <b>112</b> for use with the example imaging system <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> &#x26; <b>2</b></figref> in accordance with various embodiments. The rear lens holder <b>112</b> is in the form of a generally hollow body that defines a lower portion <b>112</b><i>a</i>, an upper portion <b>112</b><i>b</i>, and a sidewall <b>112</b><i>c </i>extending between the lower and upper portions <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b</i>. The rear lens holder <b>112</b> may have any number of features such as shapes and/or cutouts <b>113</b> such that the sidewall <b>112</b><i>c </i>has a generally uniform thickness despite its unique shape that corresponds to the shape of the lens or lenses disposed therein. These cutouts <b>113</b> reduce overall weight of the rear lens holder <b>112</b>, and due to the uniform thickness of the sidewall <b>112</b><i>c</i>, the rear lens holder <b>112</b> is easier to manufacture (e.g., mold via an injection molding machine) as compared with lens holders having varying thickness. Each of the different components of the rear lens holder <b>112</b> has a fabrication tolerance that may cause two different rear lens holders <b>112</b> to be fabricated with different dimensions. These fabrication errors may lead to optical misalignment of optics, such as lenses, that are contained inside of the rear lens holder <b>112</b> resulting in image distortion, and/or errors in identifying indicia in scanned images.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some examples, the rear lens holder <b>112</b> is coupled with the circuit board <b>102</b> via the component mounting portion <b>103</b>. As a non-limiting example, the component mounting portion <b>103</b> may be in the form of a pad to which the lower portion <b>112</b><i>a </i>of the rear lens holder <b>112</b> is pressed onto. The component mounting portion <b>103</b> may include an adhesive, such as glue, to assist in securing the rear lens holder <b>112</b> to the circuit board <b>102</b>. In other examples, the component mounting portion <b>103</b> may include any number of electrical interconnects that receive corresponding electrical interconnects disposed or otherwise coupled with the rear lens holder <b>112</b>. Other examples are possible.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The rear lens holder <b>112</b> further includes a lens holder mounting portion <b>114</b> positioned on an outer periphery of the sidewall <b>112</b><i>c</i>.

As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, each of the upper tabs <b>116</b> includes a generally planar facing surface <b>116</b><i>a</i>, a curved upper surface <b>116</b><i>b </i>positioned adjacent to the facing surface <b>116</b><i>a</i>, an angled surface <b>116</b><i>c </i>positioned adjacent to the curved upper surface <b>116</b><i>b</i>, and an inner sidewall <b>116</b><i>d </i>positioned adjacent to the facing surface <b>116</b><i>a</i>, the curved upper surface <b>116</b><i>b</i>, and the angled surface <b>116</b><i>c</i>. In the illustrated example, the respective inner sidewalls <b>116</b><i>d </i>of each of the upper tabs <b>116</b> are arranged such that they face each other. The angled surface <b>116</b><i>c </i>is a generally planar surface that forms an angle relative to the facing surface <b>116</b><i>a </i>of approximately 30&#xb0;. However, other examples of suitable angles are possible. Further, each of the mounting portions <b>114</b>, upper tabs <b>116</b>, lower tabs <b>120</b>, and position of these various elements on the sidewall <b>112</b><i>c </i>may have fabrication errors that cause misalignment of any optics, relative to each other and to an image sensor, contained by the rear lens holder <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a perspective view of an example chassis <b>150</b> for use with the example imaging assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> &#x26; <b>2</b></figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates a perspective view of the example imaging assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b></figref> in accordance with various embodiments.

Imaging systems that employ small area sensors typically require active alignment of the sensor to achieve high levels of image resolution for processing of images.

The bead of glue may be applied to the rear lens group holder <b>212</b> while the imaging system <b>110</b> is held in at the calibrated back flange focal distance from the imaging sensor <b>210</b>. Further, the bead of glue may be applied to the rear lens group holder <b>112</b> and the circuit board <b>102</b> while the rear lens group holder <b>212</b> is held at the calibrated active alignment position along the optical axis A, calibrated orthogonal position, and calibrated tilt alignment of the rear lens group holder <b>212</b>. In examples, the component mounting portion <b>103</b> may include one or more of an adhesive, a tape, a clamp, an optical mount, a lens tube, a screw, a washer, or another element capable of physically coupling the rear lens group holder <b>212</b> to the circuit board <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Reducing the thickness of the component mounting portion <b>103</b> reduces any defocusing of the image plane of the front and rear lens groups <b>222</b> and <b>262</b> with the image sensor <b>210</b>. Defocusing effects of thicker component mounting portions <b>103</b> include thickness fluctuations due to temperature changes, pressure changes, humidity changes, or material degradation of the component mounting portion. Enabled by the alignment procedures described herein, the thin component mounting portion <b>103</b> with back flange focal distances <b>280</b> of less than 0.5 mm allows for more compact imaging systems having the optical benefits of a large range of focal lengths and reduced defocusing over time as compared to other imaging systems.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In embodiments, the method <b>900</b> may further include translating, by the actuator <b>225</b>, the front lens group <b>222</b> along the optical axis A to fine tune the focal distance of the imaging system <b>110</b> after affixing the rear lens group holder <b>212</b> to the circuit board <b>102</b>. Translating the front lens group <b>222</b> further focus an image on the imaging sensor <b>210</b> and a fine-tune position of the front lens group <b>222</b> may be determined manually by a user or operator, or automatically by a processor through image processing and image analysis. The method <b>900</b> may determine a fine-tune position of the front lens group <b>222</b> and a processor may store data indicative of the fine-tune position of the front lens group <b>222</b>. The actuator <b>225</b> may provide the data indicative of the fine-tune position to the processor, and the processor may store the fine-tune position in a memory.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">All of the features described above contribute to the compact form factor of the imaging system <b>110</b>. For example, the imaging system may have a length (i.e., distance from the aperture <b>228</b> to the circuit board <b>102</b>) of less than 12 mm, a height (as described above in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>) of less than 8 mm, and a width of less than 10 mm. So configured, and as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the imaging system <b>110</b> described herein may occupy an entire available height between the opposing large flat mounting surfaces of the chassis <b>150</b> as compared with being constrained by the body <b>151</b> of the chassis <b>150</b>. Further, instead of the chassis <b>150</b> being mounted directly to the circuit board <b>102</b>, the imaging system <b>110</b> is mounted directly to the circuit board <b>102</b> while the chassis <b>150</b> is coupled with the imaging system <b>110</b>, and indirectly coupled to the chassis <b>150</b>. Advantageously, such an arrangement isolates heat of the aiming system <b>170</b> and the illumination system <b>180</b> disposed within the chassis <b>150</b> from the image sensor <b>210</b> mounted on the circuit board <b>102</b>, while also providing for additional optical path length for the imaging system <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The above description refers to a block diagram of the accompanying drawings.
