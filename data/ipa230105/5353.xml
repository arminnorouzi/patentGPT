Each example is provided by way of explanation of the embodiments, not limitation of the present disclosure. In fact, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made to the embodiments without departing from the scope or spirit of the present disclosure. For instance, features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment can be used with another embodiment to yield a still further embodiment. Thus, it is intended that aspects of the present disclosure cover such modifications and variations.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Generally, the present disclosure is directed to a wearable device. The wearable device can include a wearable band configured to contact a user of the wearable device. As one example, the wearable device can be or include a smartwatch, movement tracker, or other wearable device that is worn on a wrist of a user. The wearable device can include an actuator, a sensor, and one or more processors in communication with the actuator and sensor. The processor(s) can be configured to measure a back electromotive force (&#x201c;EMF&#x201d;) of the actuator. For example, an input signal corresponding with a pulse, tap, or the like can be transmitted to the actuator. Electrical signals associated with application of the input signal to the actuator can be measured by the processor. The processor can determine, based on the measured back EMF, data that describes a contact force between the wearable band and the user. For example, the contact force can be applied between the sensor and the wrist of the user. The contact force can be associated with a pressure applied to the user's wrist by the wearable band of the wearable device. The processor can determine, based on the data that describes the contact force, a quality metric describing a data quality of sensor data collected by the sensor. If the wearable band is secured too loosely or too tightly on the user's wrist, the quality of sensor data may be compromised. As one example, in some embodiments, the sensor can include multiple electrodes configured to contact the user's skin. If the wearable band is too loose, one or more electrodes may not be contacting the user's skin or may intermittently be contacting the user's skin. Such data corruption may not be apparent or readily detectable by observing the sensor data itself. Aspects of the present disclosure can facilitate detection and/or correction of such corrupt data.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some embodiments, the processor(s) can be configured to identify a portion of the sensor data as corrupt based on the quality metric. The corrupt data can be discarded or otherwise treated differently than sensor data that has not been identified as corrupt. For example, the processor(s) can be configured to exclude the portion of the sensor data identified as corrupt from further processing. Sensor data that has not been identified as corrupt can be processed to generate sensor output data based on the sensor data and based at least in part on the data that describes the contact force. For instance, the sensor can be or include one or more of the following: a photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensor, temperature sensor, relative humidity sensor, electro-dermal-activity (EDA) sensor, electrocardiogram (ECG) sensor, and an electromyography (EMG) sensor. The sensor can be or include any type of suitable sensor, however. For a temperature sensor, the sensor output data can be or include a skin temperature of the user. For a PPG sensor, the sensor output data can be or include a pulse rate and/or blood pressure. Sensor data that has been identified as corrupt can be excluded from the determination of the sensor output data to avoid generating a sensor output data that is likely to be incorrect.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some embodiments, the sensor can be arranged in a stacked configuration with the actuator. For example, the sensor and/or actuator can be generally disk or coin shaped. The sensor and actuator can be stacked in a similar manner as two coins can be stacked. The sensor can have a pair of opposing parallel surfaces, and the actuator can have a pair of opposing parallel surfaces that are arranged parallel with the pair of opposing parallel surfaces of the sensor. This configuration can reduce the space needed for the actuator and sensor to be provided within and/or coupled to the wearable band. For example, the actuator can be stacked over the sensor, which can contact the user's skin (e.g., wrist). In some embodiments, the sensor, or a portion thereof (e.g., one or more electrodes) can directly contact the user's skin. However, in other embodiments one or more intermediate layers may be arranged between the sensor and the user's skin.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some embodiments, the processor(s) can be further configured to determine that the contact force exceeds an upper threshold (e.g., that the wearable band is arranged too tightly on the user's wrist). In response to this determination, the processor(s) can provide a notification to the user of the wearable device. For example, the notification can include a visual notification, audible notification, haptic notification, or combination thereof. For instance, the notification can include a beeping sound, haptic buzzing, and text displayed instructing the user to loosen the wearable band.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Similarly, in some embodiments, the processor(s) can be configured to determine when the wearable band is too loose. The processor(s) can notify the user as described above. For instance, the processor(s) can determine that the contact force is less than a lower threshold. In response to determining that the contact force is less than the lower threshold, the processor(s) can provide a notification to the user of the wearable device. The notification can include an instruction to tighten the wearable band.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments, the wearable band may be configured to automatically adjust the tightness of the wearable band. For example, in response to determining that the contact force exceeds the upper threshold (e.g., that the wearable band is arranged too tightly on the user's wrist), the processor(s) can control a tightness adjustment actuator of the wearable band to loosen the wearable band. As another example, in response to determining that the contact force is less than the lower threshold (e.g., that the wearable band is arranged too loosely on the user's wrist), the processor(s) can control a tightness adjustment actuator of the wearable band to tighten the wearable band. The tightness adjustment actuator of the wearable band can include a variety of types of actuators and/or mechanisms to automatically adjust the tightness of the band. As another example mechanism for automatically tightening and/or loosening the wearable band, the wearable band may include a material or mechanism configured to lengthen (e.g., causing the band to loosen) or shorten (e.g., causing the band to tighten) in response to the actuator of the wearable device vibrating (e.g., in a pulsing manner or continuously) at a particular frequency in a particular pattern of frequencies.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The processor(s) can determine the upper threshold and/or lower threshold based on criteria. For example, the processor(s) can determine a current activity being performed by the user and determine at least one of the upper threshold or the lower threshold based on the current activity. The current activity can include a stationary activity (e.g., sitting, standing, sleeping, etc.) or an activity including movement or exercise, such as walking, jogging, running, skiing, weight lifting, kayaking, rock climbing, or the like. The processors may determine higher thresholds for activities including movement or exercise than stationary activities. For instance, the processor may determine that the wearable band should be arranged tighter for more vigorous activities, such as running, as compared with stationary or sedentary activities, such as sitting or standing. Such thresholds can be updated as the user changes activities.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Additionally, in some embodiments, the processors can be configured to determine when the contact force is within a range that is ideal or acceptable for use of the wearable device. The processors can provide notifications to the user based on this determination. For instance, when the user is tightening the wearable device as he or she is putting it on his or her wrist, the wearable device can notify the user when the wearable band is tightened such that the contact force is within the range.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some embodiments, the actuator can include a linear resonant actuator including an internally moving mass. The processor(s) can be configured to measure a damping of the internally moving mass. The damping of the internally moving mass can be used when determining the back EMF and/or contact force. The linear resonant actuator including a magnet and a spring. The internally moving mass and the magnet can be coupled to the spring. However, other types of actuators can be implemented, such as piezoelectric actuators, eccentric rotating mass (ERM), or actuators employing a combination of actuator types described herein.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">According to aspects of the present disclosure, the processor can adjust the sensor data based on the contact force. For example, the processor can adjust or compensate for the contact force being outside of an ideal or nominal range for the sensor. The processor(s) of the wearable device can be configured to measure a back electromotive force (&#x201c;EMF&#x201d;) of the actuator and determine, based on the measured back EMF, data describing a contact force between the wearable band and the user. The processor can generate sensor output data based on the sensor data and based at least in part on the data describing the contact force between the wearable band and the user.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The processors can determine one or more of an upper bound or a lower bound for the contact force range based on contextual data. For example, the processor can determine the upper bound or lower bound based on a current activity being performed by the user, for example as described above with respect to the upper threshold and lower threshold for the contact force for notifications to the user.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">For example, the processor can determine that the contact force falls outside of a contact force range. The processor can determine a compensation value for the sensor data based on the contact force being outside of the contact force range. The processor can adjust the sensor output data based on the compensation value. Determining the compensation value for the sensor data based on the contact force being outside of the contact force range can include determining the compensation value for the sensor data based on a difference between the contact force and at least one of an upper bound or a lower bound of the contact force range. The compensation value can be determined based on an empirical correlation between the difference and empirically detected error values.

The processor can determine a compensation value for the sensor data based on the contact force being outside of the contact force range. The processor can adjust the sensor output data based on the compensation value.

For example, an input signal corresponding with a pulse, tap, or the like can be transmitted to the actuator. Electrical signals associated with application of the input signal to the actuator can be measured by the processor.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The method, at (<b>604</b>), can include determining, based on the measured back EMF, a contact metric that describes a contact force between a wearable band of the wearable device and the user.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The method <b>600</b> can include, at (<b>606</b>), determining, based on the data that describes the contact force, a quality metric describing a data quality of sensor data collected by the sensor. As one example, the quality metric can include or describe a confidence value describing a likelihood that the data is accurate. If the wearable band is secured too loosely or too tightly on the user's wrist, the quality of sensor data may be compromised. As one example, in some embodiments, the sensor can include multiple electrodes configured to contact the user's skin. If the wearable band is too loose, one or more electrodes may not be contacting the user's skin or may intermittently be contacting the user's skin. Such data corruption may not be apparent or readily detectable by observing the sensor data itself. Aspects of the present disclosure can facilitate detection and/or correction of such corrupt data. As another example, if the wearable band is too tight, it may adversely affect the parameter (e.g., blood pressure, temperature, pulse, etc.) that the sensor is configured to detect.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The processor(s) can be configured to identify a portion of the sensor data as corrupt based on the quality metric. For example, sensor data can be identified as corrupt having a quality metric falling outside of a quality metric range. The quality metric range can be empirically determined or theoretically determined. The corrupt data can be discarded or otherwise treated differently than sensor data that has not been identified as corrupt. For example, the processor(s) can be configured to exclude the portion of the sensor data identified as corrupt from further processing. Sensor data that has not been identified as corrupt can be processed to generate sensor output data based on the sensor data and based at least in part on the data that describes the contact force. As another example, the corrupt data can be compensated, as described herein, to generate compensated sensor data that more closely resembled sensor data that would have been collected if the wearable band were tightened within the appropriate tightness range.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">For instance, the sensor can be or include one or more of the following: a photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensor, temperature sensor, relative humidity sensor, electro-dermal-activity (EDA) sensor, electrocardiogram (ECG) sensor, and an electromyography (EMG) sensor. The sensor can be or include any type of suitable sensor, however. For a temperature sensor, the sensor output data can be or include a skin temperature of the user. For a PPG sensor, the sensor output data can be or include a pulse rate and/or blood pressure. Sensor data that has been identified as corrupt can be excluded from the determination of the sensor output data to avoid generating a sensor output data that is likely to be incorrect.
