No. 8,048,089 describes a system for treating skin using an apparatus with a removable, disposable tip, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference. Whereas the tip of the '089 patent is spiral, it does not maximize the residency of the fluid on the skin and is less efficient at removing the fluid. Moreover, there is a high ratio of negative surface area to negative pressure with the device of the '089 patent. That is, with a single vacuum port the amount of negative pressure to move the entire surface area is distributed over a small area, increasing the opportunity for skin damage. The present invention is intended to improve on the system of the '089 patent with an improved disposable applicator tip that increases residency time of the working fluid and more efficiently and safely removes the working fluid from the dermal surface.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention is an applicator tip for a hand piece assembly having a cap shape with a circumferential edge and an outer abrading surface. The outer abrading surface includes a plurality of apertures that form ports communicating with a fluid supply line in the hand piece assembly and a vacuum source to remove the abrading fluid. The fluid is introduced onto the outer abrading surface of the applicator tip through a first central aperture and spreads out along the outer abrading surface when the applicator tip is placed against the patient's skin. Recesses in the outer abrading surface establish pathways for the abrading fluid to move along as the applicator tip is moved over the patient's skin. This motion of the applicator tip along the patient's skin, in combination with the moving fluid circulating on the applicator tip's outer abrading surface, provides the conditions under which skin cells may be sloughed off gently but effectively by the device.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the present embodiment, the fluid emitting from the central port is moved into one of four quadrants defined by recesses in the outer abrading surface, each quadrant serving as a fluid chamber that receives fluid from the central fluid supply port. It should be noted that the number of chambers is not essential, and that three, five, or six chambers would work as well. Each fluid chamber has a fluid path beginning at the exit of the fluid supply port from the supply port into one of the sector shaped chambers. Each sector shaped chamber includes within its border a C-shaped barrier with its opening facing a dividing sector wall. As the applicator tip forms a seal with the patient's skin, fluid is introduced through the supply port and through the entrance of the chamber, filling each chamber with working fluid as the working fluid flows to and around the C-shaped barrier. Disposed inside each C-shaped barrier is a respective vacuum port that removes the working fluid from each chamber. Fluid from each chamber is vacuumed through its vacuum port after having flowed around a maze-like path, navigating the C-shaped barrier and sector walls in a vortex flow pattern. The present invention's use of four vacuum ports reduces the opportunity for a suction related injury by lowering the negative pressure requirements to provide a safer device.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">These and other features of the present invention will best be understood with reference to the accompanying figures and the detailed description of the invention below.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an elevated, perspective view of a first embodiment of an applicator tip of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a cross sectional view of the applicator tip of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is a cross sectional view of the applicator tip in contact with a pore on the skin;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> is a cross sectional view of the applicator tip flushing an exposed pore; and</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> is a cross sectional view of the applicator tip evacuating the exposed pore.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> illustrate a new disposable, removable tip <b>10</b> to a microdermabrasion hand piece. The disposable tip is formed in the shape of a cap (like a bottle cap) defining an interior space, and an exterior peripheral wall <b>12</b> formed with longitudinal recesses <b>14</b> for a more tactile response while applying and removing the tip <b>10</b>. A central fluid channel <b>16</b> in the form of a tubular member is formed in the tip <b>10</b> beginning at a proximal end <b>13</b> and extending through the interior space to a central orifice <b>18</b> at the distal end. The central orifice <b>18</b> provides an outlet where fluid pumped through the tip <b>10</b> is introduced to an interface between the tip's distal surface and a patient's skin. Four vacuum ports <b>20</b> arrayed radially from the central orifice and circumferentially spaced from each other remove the fluid introduced at the central orifice <b>18</b>. Each vacuum port <b>20</b> is located in a recessed sector <b>22</b> of the distal surface <b>24</b> of the tip <b>10</b> that are defined by a circumferential ridge or wall <b>26</b> and substantially radially inwardly oriented walls <b>28</b> from the circumferential wall, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The walls <b>28</b> terminate at the central orifice <b>18</b> and cooperate to form an opening <b>30</b> about the central orifice where fluid is delivered into one of the four sectors <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Each vacuum port <b>20</b> is substantially surrounded by a C-shaped barrier <b>32</b> having a height consistent with, or slightly below, the circumferential ridge <b>26</b> and the radially inwardly oriented walls <b>28</b>. The height of the C-shaped barrier <b>32</b> allows the patient's skin to flex when pulled by the vacuum ports <b>20</b>, which in turn brings the skin in contact with the edges of the quadrant borders <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> to abrade the skin. It is important that the borders of the quadrant <b>22</b> and the barriers <b>32</b> allow a vacuum seal to be formed against the patient's skin from the negative pressure of the vacuum ports <b>20</b>. Fluid <b>34</b> entering the central orifice flow into each quadrant <b>22</b> through a narrow opening <b>30</b> formed between the ends of the radially inwardly oriented extensions <b>28</b>, and begin to fill the quadrants <b>22</b> with the fluid <b>34</b>. The shape and position of the C-shaped barriers <b>32</b> establish a preferred flow direction using a path of least resistance to preferentially move the fluid <b>34</b> along an elongated arc to the vacuum port <b>20</b>. To maximize the distance traveled by the fluid, the C shaped barrier <b>32</b> may open toward an adjacent radial wall <b>28</b>. The vacuum ports <b>20</b> draw the fluid <b>34</b> out of the sector using the negative pressure in the closed space between the patient's skin and the borders <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> of the sector <b>22</b>, moving the fluid <b>34</b> into the sector and around the barrier <b>32</b> before exiting the sector through the vacuum port <b>20</b> so as to be collected outside of the hand piece. To remove the fluid <b>34</b>, a substantially airtight seal is formed by the wet distal surfaces of the tip (circumferential wall, radially oriented walls, and C-shaped barriers) and the wet skin of the patient, reducing the level of vacuum needed to remove the fluid. Since the four vacuum ports <b>20</b> cooperate to remove the fluid <b>34</b> from the central orifice <b>18</b>, each vacuum port <b>20</b> requires less negative pressure than the prior art where a single or dual vacuum ports are disclosed.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">During treatment, a vacuum is applied to the hand piece (not shown) resulting to the patient's skin being drawn against the distal surfaces of the tip's four quadrants. During this condition, a treatment fluid <b>34</b> is dispensed from the central orifice <b>18</b> of the tip <b>10</b>, wetting and lubricating the skin and its pores while the skin is in a dilated stage. A negative pressure is applied to the tip <b>10</b> at the vacuum ports <b>20</b>, whereupon the tip <b>10</b> is moved and rotated over the surface of the skin resulting to improved exfoliation, abrasion, stimulation or angulation of the skin.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The use of quadrants <b>22</b> (or other radially defined shapes) increase the extraction/hydration efficiency and minimize cross contamination. Contrast with prior art devices that have longer fluid return paths that promote a possibility of exposing the used fluid to open/dilated pores, the present invention minimizes such opportunity for contamination without the need for a higher vacuum level. Moreover, the turbulent swirling action of the fluid on the skin's surface due to the C-shaped barrier <b>32</b> results in a higher fluid velocity and better exfoliation of the skin. That is, the greater the fluid velocity, the better the fluid overcomes any surface tension and therefore results in higher skin absorption of fluid during the dilated stage of the skin pores. The turbulent swirling effect also increases the residence time of fluid on the skin, resulting in better absorption and better utilization of the fluid. Finally, the combination of the abrupt distal edges and swirling fluid/vacuum action results to more efficient dislodging of clogged skin pores, and extracting the sebum axially. Conversely, the prior art dislodges clogged skin pores in a radial direction.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates the process whereby the present invention is used to treat the surface of a patient's skin. One can observe the interface <b>36</b> between the patient's skin <b>38</b> and the distal surface <b>24</b> of the tip <b>10</b>, where a pore on the skin is shown in significant exaggeration for illustrative purposes. In the first stage of the process, a patient's skin <b>38</b> with a clogged pore <b>42</b> has the tip <b>10</b> of the present invention moved over its surface such that the dermis <b>44</b> covering of the clogged pore <b>42</b> is abraded by the tip's distal abrupt surfaces <b>24</b>. The now exposed pore <b>42</b> in stage <b>2</b> is flushed with the fluid as the tip <b>10</b> moves over the surface of the skin <b>38</b>, and the vacuum port <b>20</b> draws the fluid <b>34</b> and the contents of the pore through the tip <b>10</b> and into the hand piece. Some fluid remains in the pore to disinfect and clean the pore <b>42</b>, leaving the skin hydrated and free of clogs and dirt.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">While specific geometries, shapes, and numbers have been disclosed, the invention is not limited to any such specific embodiment. For example, the quadrants of the distal surface can be substituted into tripartite or five or more sectors without departing from the scope of the invention. Similarly, the shape of the barrier around the vacuum port can vary as long as there is a preferred flow direction of the fluid exiting the central aperture. Other such substitutions and modifications will readily be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art, and such substitutions and modifications are intended to be included within the scope of the invention.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
