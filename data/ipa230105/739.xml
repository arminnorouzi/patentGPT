The compositions include a level of skin heath components to help to maintain or improve skin health while also maintaining an acceptable skin feel and efficiency.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Alcohol compositions are desirable hand and skincare products. They are effective against a wide range of microorganisms such as gram positive and gram negative bacteria and fungi. They are also able to kill microorganisms faster than other antimicrobial products. Alcohol antimicrobial products are available as water thin liquids, gels, emulsions, and aerosol foams.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Hand sanitizing substances are intended to reduce the risk of exposure to and the spread of pathogenic microorganisms encountered in day-to-day activities. Although the use of sanitizing alcohol based foams and gels is well known, a need exists for a formulation that will more effectively kill germs and dry quickly, without negatively affecting skin health. However, many such quick drying gels have a composition that leaves an undesirable sticky residue. In addition, if the level of alcohol is increased, such conventional gels often dry the skin. Accordingly, the need persists for a higher percentage of alcohol without generating an undesirable residue or the drying of the skin.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is well known that skin health can be improved in leave on antibacterial products by the addition of humectants or moisturizers. However, the level of moisturizer needed to improve skin health typically has the drawback of causing excessive product build-up and stickiness which is unpleasant aesthetically to the user, and can also lead to increased difficulty in applying gloves, reducing work efficiency. Both the stickiness and gloving issues may result in reduced product use by healthcare providers because the stickiness tends to make the worker feel their hands are &#x201c;dirty&#x201d; and need to be washed and the reduced ability to glove impedes with their work flow.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">When the level of skin health components in an alcohol-based sanitizer is not high enough, healthcare workers may experience extreme drying of their hands or in a worse case contact dermatitis, especially in low humidity climates or during the &#x201c;dry&#x201d; months of the year.

The package also provides improved skin feel without a tacky residue upon drying.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to the invention, a skin benefit package of components is employed which includes a specific combination of emollients. The invention uses a combination of &#x201c;high spreading oils&#x201d; (such as dicaprylyl carbonate, dibutyl adipate, hexyl laurate, dicaprylyl ether, propylheptyl caprylate, 4-10 centistoke silicone oil, D4, D5, or D6 cyclic siloxane, isocetyl palmitate, hydrogentated polyisobutene, and diethylhexylcarbonate), in combination with medium spreading oils (such as capric/caprylic triglyceride, C12-15 alkyl benzoate, capric triglyceride, caprylic triglyceride, isopropyl myristrate, isopropyl palmitate, octyldodecanol, decyl oleate, cocoglycerides, ethylhexyl stearate, ceteraryl isononanoate, cetearyl ethyhexanonate, decyl cocoate, cetyl dimethicone, ethylhexyl palmitate, PPG-11 stearyl ether, PPG-15 stearyl ether, and PPG-14 butyl ether).

Examples of suitable alcohols include ethanol, propanols, such as isopropanol and n-propanol, and butanols.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The composition can also include other components such as other skin conditioners, emollients, moisturizers, humectants, thickeners, surfactants, fragrance, water and the like.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The invention also includes a method of sanitizing skin by applying the sanitizer to the skin and allowing the sanitizer to dry. The method is particularly designed for multiple use settings, such as healthcare, where workers may apply the composition multiple times a day. The method includes use of a composition that includes lower amount of skin health materials applied multiple times a day (chronic dosing) and has similar affects as higher levels applied once or twice a day (acute dosing).</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">These and other embodiments will be apparent to those of skill in the art and others in view of the following detailed description of some embodiments.

Antimicrobial compositions can affect two kinds of microbial cell damage. The first is a lethal, irreversible action resulting in complete microbial cell destruction or incapacitation. The second type of cell damage is reversible, such that if the organism is rendered free of the agent, it can again multiply. The former is termed bacteriocidal and the later, bacteriostatic. A sanitizer and a disinfectant are, by definition, agents which provide antibacterial or bacteriocidal activity. In contrast, a preservative is generally described as an inhibitor or bacteriostatic composition.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The term &#x201c;sanitizer,&#x201d; as used herein, refers to an agent that reduces the number of bacterial contaminants to safe levels as judged by public health requirements. The recitation of numerical ranges by endpoints includes all numbers subsumed within that range (e.g., 1 to 5 includes 1, 1.5, 2, 2.75, 3, 3.80, 4, and 5).</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The terms &#x201c;include&#x201d; and &#x201c;including&#x201d; when used in reference to a list of materials refer to but are not limited to the materials so listed. Skin health can be improved by the addition of humectants or moisturizers to leave-on antibacterial products. However, the level of moisturizer needed to improve skin health typically causes excessive product build-up and stickiness which is unpleasant aesthetically to the user, and can also lead to increased difficulty in applying gloves, reducing work efficiency. Both the stickiness and gloving issues may result in reduced product use by healthcare providers because the stickiness tends to make the worker feel their hands are &#x201c;dirty&#x201d; and need to be washed and the reduced ability to glove impedes with their work flow.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">When the level of skin health components in an alcohol-based sanitizer is not high enough, healthcare workers may experience extreme drying of their hands or in a worse case contact dermatitis, especially in low humidity climates or during the &#x201c;dry&#x201d; months of the year. Typical, basic/conventional hand sanitizers do not contain adequate amounts of skin health promoting agents to improve skin health with repeated use.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">There is limited data looking at low dose application of the skin health components such as niacinamide, ceramides, vitamin E, vitamin K, Vitamin D, amino acids (including glycine and proline), applied multiple times a day to reach the same levels that are typically applied in one or two doses in the published clinical studies which have demonstrated improved health with these components. Since healthcare workers apply leave-on products (generally in the form of hand sanitizers) typically ranging from 20 to 100 applications a day, with periodic washes throughout the day, they do not fit into the model of one or two doses of higher active level per day. According to the invention, lower doses of skin health materials applied multiple times a day (chronic) in the correct ratios, can have similar affects as higher dosing once or twice a day (acute).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">While skin health is one side of the product acceptance equation, the other side is product feel. If the product is perceived as sticky, tacky, or has high levels of product build-up, the product will not be well accepted by healthcare workers.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">As indicated earlier, applicants have identified a critical skin benefit package that can be used in liquid alcohol sanitizing compositions that provides improved skin health with chronic repeated use.
