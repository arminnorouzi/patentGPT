Field of the Disclosure</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to an air sterilizing device, and more particularly to an air sterilizing device that can significantly improve the efficiency of filtration and sterilization, and thereby effectively eliminate viruses and bacteria in ambient air.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">2. Description of the Prior Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">There are various suspended substances with different particle sizes in the air, such as dust of about 500 microns or less, bacteria of about 0.5-5 microns, and viruses of about 10-300 nanometers. Many suspended substances are invisible to the naked eye, and some (such as bacteria and viruses) are harmful to the human body. Therefore, the elimination of harmful substances in the air to maintain a clean environment and uphold human health has aroused wide public concern.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Air purifiers are usually placed in the environment to filter the air. The air flows through the filter of the air purifiers which filter out harmful substances and produce cleaner air. General filters can filter out dust and other pollutants with larger particle sizes, but substances with smaller sizes such as bacteria and viruses may still pass through such filters. In order to purify the air more effectively, a High-Efficiency Particulate Air filter (HEPA filter) is available, but needs to be regularly replaced or replaced timely depending on the pollution situation to achieve better filtration effect. If not replaced in time, the filter is prone to becoming a breeding ground for bacteria or viruses, causing secondary pollution and failure to purify the air.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition to filtration, sterilization or disinfection can be achieved via high temperature, chemicals, radiation, high pressure, etc. In principle, the compositions of bacteria or virus pathogens change irreversibly by physical or chemical means to achieve disinfection and sterilization. e.g., heat is used to coagulate and denature the protein of pathogens or dissolve lipids to inactivate the pathogens. Alternatively, UV is used to irradiate pathogens, destroy their structures and prevent them from continuing to proliferate.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A lot of energy will be consumed by an air purifier to heat all air in a room to a temperature for sterilization, so it is inconvenient, and even unfeasible in practice. Therefore, some air purifiers adopt an elongated member made of ceramics. The elongated member has a plurality of narrow and parallel channels, through which a heating wire is inserted and extended. When air flows through the channels, the heating wire can heat the air and sterilize it. However, such air purifiers perform sterilization only relying on the heat convection in small channels, exhibiting a severe limitation to the amount of air that can be treated and therefore resulting in low sterilization efficiency. To increase the amount of air to be treated, the electrical heating power must be increased so that the air can be heated to the required sterilization temperature, causing large energy consumption by the air purifiers during their operation.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Moreover, if such air purifiers perform sterilization via high-power heating, the temperature of the purified air is significantly higher than the ambient temperature, causing significant changes in the temperature and humidity of the environment and discomfort to the user.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">To solve the above problems, the present disclosure provides an air sterilizing device with lower energy consumption, higher sterilization intensity, larger air treatment amount and more compact size.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to achieve this purpose, an embodiment of the air sterilizing device according to the present disclosure comprises a casing, on which an air inlet and an air outlet are arranged; a blower, arranged in the casing, driving air to flow from the air inlet to the air outlet; a wheel disc, arranged in the air flow path and comprising a wheel-shaped body with uniform thickness, wherein the wheel-shaped body comprises a plurality of holes for air to flow through the wheel-shaped body, and a plurality of microporous structures on an outer surfaces of the wheel-shaped body; a first sterilizing module, arranged between the air inlet and the wheel disc and arranged adjacent to an air inlet side of the wheel disc, wherein the first sterilizing module comprises a cover, comprising an opening arranged on a first side of the cover adjacent to the wheel disc, a vent arranged on a second side of the cover away from the wheel disc, and a first space formed between the opening and the vent; a first reflector, arranged within the first space and spaced from the vent for forming a non-linear channel from the vent, through the first reflector and into the first space; a sterilizing element, arranged within the first space and located between the opening and the first reflector; and a driving mechanism, driving the wheel disc to rotate with respect to the first sterilizing module; wherein after the blower introduces the outside air into the casing through the air inlet, a first portion of the outside air flows into the first space through the non-linear channel of the first sterilizing module; wherein the first portion of the air flows through the sterilizing element, through the holes of the wheel disc and over the microporous structures, and is discharged from the air outlet to the outside of the casing; a second portion of the outside air flows through the holes of the wheel disc not covered by the first sterilizing module, over the microporous structures, and is discharged from the air outlet to the outside of the casing.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, the air sterilizing device according to the present disclosure improves the sterilization function, the efficiency of the energy utilization, and the user's comfort without significantly changing the temperature and humidity of the environment.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">These and other objectives of the present disclosure will no doubt become obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art after reading the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment that is illustrated in the various figures and drawings.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present disclosure will be understood by referring to the following detailed description of some illustrative embodiments in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of the appearance of the air sterilizing device according to one embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is another perspective view of the air sterilizing device in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> with a part of the casing removed;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the air sterilizing device in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> from another perspective;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an exploded view of some parts of the air sterilizing device of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a cross-sectional and partial enlarged view of the wheel disc of the air sterilizing device;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a front view of the sterilizing module according to one embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the sterilizing module in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> along the line C-C;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating the air flows in the air sterilizing device in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating the air flows in the air sterilizing device according to another embodiment of the present disclosure;

Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>4</b></figref>, they are three-dimensional and cross-sectional views of the air sterilizing device <b>1</b> according to one embodiment of the present disclosure. The air sterilizing device <b>1</b> comprises a casing <b>20</b>, a sterilizing module <b>30</b>, a wheel disc set <b>40</b> and a blower <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The casing <b>20</b> in this embodiment comprises an upper casing <b>203</b>, a lower casing <b>204</b>, and a side casing <b>205</b> arranged around and between the upper casing <b>203</b> and the lower casing <b>204</b>. In this embodiment, an air inlet <b>201</b> is arranged on the side casing <b>205</b>, and an air outlet <b>202</b> is arranged on the upper casing <b>203</b>. In other embodiments, the air inlet <b>201</b> and the air outlet <b>202</b> may be arranged at other appropriate positions of the casing <b>20</b> to meet different design needs. e.g., the air inlet <b>201</b> and the air outlet <b>202</b> may be arranged on different sides of the side casing <b>205</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The sterilizing module <b>30</b>, the wheel disc set <b>40</b> and the blower <b>50</b> are arranged in the casing <b>20</b>. In this embodiment, the wheel disc set <b>40</b> is arranged between the blower <b>50</b> and the air inlet <b>201</b>, and the sterilizing module <b>30</b> is arranged between the air inlet <b>201</b> and the wheel disc set <b>40</b>. The blower <b>50</b> comprises an air suction inlet <b>51</b>, an air exhaust outlet <b>52</b>, and a blade <b>53</b>. The location of the air suction inlet <b>51</b> of the blower <b>50</b> corresponds to the location of the wheel disc set <b>40</b>, and the location of the air exhaust outlet <b>52</b> of the blower <b>50</b> corresponds to the location of the air outlet <b>202</b> of the casing <b>20</b>. The outside air is sucked into the casing <b>20</b> through the air inlet <b>201</b>, sterilized by the sterilizing module <b>30</b> and the wheel disc set <b>40</b>, then the purified air is discharged through the air outlet <b>202</b> of the casing <b>20</b> to the outside of the air sterilizing device <b>1</b> by the blower <b>50</b>. The mechanism configuration and operating principle of the blower <b>50</b> are known in the art, e.g., an axial flow fan can also be used. In other embodiments, the blower <b>50</b> may also be arranged between the air inlet <b>201</b> and the wheel disc set <b>40</b>. In order to simplify the drawings and facilitate the description, other elements of the blower <b>50</b> are not shown in the drawings.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> to <b>5</b></figref>, the wheel disc set <b>40</b> comprises a wheel disc <b>41</b> and a wheel disc driving mechanism <b>42</b>. In this embodiment, the wheel disc <b>41</b> has a wheel-shaped body with uniform thickness, which has a first wheel surface and a second wheel surface opposing to the first wheel surface (referred to as the air inlet side <b>411</b><i>a </i>and the air outlet side <b>411</b><i>b </i>respectively). There are a plurality of holes <b>412</b> formed between the first wheel surface and the second wheel surface as well as penetrating the wheel-shaped body of the wheel disc <b>41</b>. As a result, air can flow in the air inlet side <b>411</b><i>a</i>, through the holes <b>412</b>, and then be discharged via the air outlet side <b>411</b><i>b</i>. On micro views, the outer surface of the wheel disc <b>41</b> is provided with microporous structures <b>413</b>. The outer surface of the wheel disc <b>41</b> disclosed herein refers to the surface of the wheel disc <b>41</b> in contact with air. The outer surface may contain the inner wall surfaces of the holes <b>412</b> and at least one of the air inlet side <b>411</b><i>a </i>and the air outlet side <b>411</b><i>b </i>of the wheel disc <b>41</b>, on which the microporous structures <b>413</b> are formed. When fine dust, bacteria or viruses contained in the air flow through the microporous structures <b>413</b>, they are adsorbed onto the microporous structures <b>413</b> under the action of van der Waals force and electrostatic force, so the harmful suspended pollutants are captured. In this embodiment, the wheel disc <b>41</b> adopts a heat-resistant fiber skeleton for forming the holes <b>412</b>. Zeolite, molecular sieve, etc. are applied to the heat-resistant fiber skeleton to form the microporous structures <b>413</b> on the outer surface. Moreover, the size and the structure type of the microporous structures <b>413</b> can be varied considering different design factors. E.g., microporous structures with a suitable pore size of less than 2 nanometers or less than 50 nanometers may be used. The microporous structures <b>413</b> also may have a suitable pore size of less than 20 nanometers. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a partial enlarged view of the microporous structure <b>413</b> on the inner wall of the hole <b>412</b> according to one embodiment of the present disclosure. When the blower <b>50</b> sucks air, the airflow F flows in the air inlet side <b>411</b><i>a </i>of the wheel disc <b>41</b>, passing through the holes <b>412</b>, and then flows out via the air outlet side <b>411</b><i>b </i>of the wheel disc <b>41</b>. In this embodiment, the wheel disc driving mechanism <b>42</b> is provided with a power unit <b>421</b> and an output shaft <b>422</b>. The output shaft <b>422</b> is provided with a gear engaged with the toothed rim of the wheel disc <b>41</b>. When the power unit <b>421</b> drives the gear of the output shaft <b>422</b> to rotate, the wheel disc <b>41</b> is driven to rotate correspondingly. The rotation speed of the wheel disc <b>41</b> depends on the rotation speed of the gear of the output shaft <b>422</b> driven by the power unit <b>421</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The wheel disc <b>41</b> provided with the holes <b>412</b> and the microporous structures <b>413</b> adsorbs, retains and captures airborne bacteria and viruses flowing through the wheel disc <b>41</b>. The wheel disc driving mechanism <b>42</b> drives the wheel disc <b>41</b> to rotate so that all parts of the wheel disc <b>41</b> can pass through the sterilizing module <b>30</b> which eliminates the bacteria and viruses adsorbed on the wheel disc <b>41</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows the flowing direction of the airflow F at the air inlet side <b>411</b><i>a </i>and the air outlet side <b>411</b><i>b </i>of the wheel disc <b>41</b>. Usually, more bacteria and viruses are collected on the air inlet side <b>411</b><i>a</i>, so the sterilizing module <b>30</b> is preferably arranged adjacent to the air inlet side <b>411</b><i>a </i>of the wheel disc <b>41</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> to <b>7</b></figref>, the sterilizing module <b>30</b> is arranged on one side of the wheel disc <b>41</b>. In this embodiment, the sterilizing module <b>30</b> is arranged adjacent to the air inlet side <b>411</b><i>a</i>. The sterilizing module <b>30</b> comprises a cover <b>31</b>, a reflector <b>32</b> and a sterilizing element <b>33</b>. In this embodiment, the cover <b>31</b> comprises a first cover <b>31</b><i>a </i>and a second cover <b>31</b><i>b</i>. In other embodiments, the cover <b>31</b> can be integrally formed or assembled by multiple components. In this embodiment, the cover <b>31</b> is arranged adjacent to but not in contact with the surface of the wheel disc <b>41</b> to ensure the smooth rotation of the wheel disc <b>41</b>, and to prevent air from escaping via the gap between the cover <b>31</b> and the wheel disc <b>41</b> without passing through the wheel disc <b>41</b>. An opening <b>313</b> is arranged at a first side of the cover <b>31</b> which is adjacent to the wheel disc <b>41</b> (on the first cover <b>31</b><i>a</i>), and a vent <b>312</b> is arranged at a second side of the cover <b>31</b> which is away from the wheel disc <b>41</b> (on the second cover <b>31</b><i>b</i>). A first space <b>311</b> is formed between the opening <b>313</b> and the vent <b>312</b> of the cover <b>31</b>. The reflector <b>32</b> and the sterilizing element <b>33</b> are arranged within the first space <b>311</b>, and the sterilizing element <b>33</b> is arranged between the reflector <b>32</b> and the wheel disc <b>41</b>. The reflector <b>32</b> is arranged to cover the vent <b>312</b> but is not completely attached to the cover <b>31</b>, so that a non-linear channel <b>311</b><i>a </i>is formed which allows the air to flow along a path from the vent <b>312</b>, through the inner peripheral wall of the cover <b>31</b> and the first reflector <b>32</b>, to the first space <b>311</b>. When the blower <b>50</b> sucks air, part of the sucked air flows through the non-linear channel <b>311</b><i>a </i>and sterilized by the sterilizing element <b>33</b>, after which it flows through the wheel disc <b>41</b> into the blower <b>50</b>, then being discharged via the air outlet <b>202</b> to the outside of the air sterilizing device <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The efficacy factors in killing bacteria or viruses by heating or UV irradiation mainly include intensity (temperature or light intensity) and sterilization (heating, irradiation) time. e.g., the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is inactivated and loses its infectivity by exposure to 56&#xb0; C. for 30 minutes; but if a filter heated to 200&#xb0; C. is used for purification, it can eliminate 99.8% of the COVID-19 viruses in the airflow within about 0.01 seconds. In addition, the time required for sterilization can be shortened by about 10 times every time the temperature is increased by 10&#xb0; C. Generally, the blowers of household air conditioners drive air to flow at a rate of about 1.5-6 m/s, so the air directly flowing through the sterilizing element is sterilized in a quite short time. e.g., when the air flows at 2 m/s and the sterilization path is 0.02 m, it will flow through the sterilization path within 0.01 seconds, indicating that a temperature of higher than 200&#xb0; C. is required for effective heat sterilization in this short time.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The shape of the sterilizing module <b>30</b> and the rotation speed of the wheel disc set <b>40</b> according to the present disclosure can be adjusted according to the energy and time required for sterilization. For instance, the sterilizing element <b>33</b> of the sterilizing module <b>30</b> may provide a sterilization-acting range as a fan-shaped area with a central angle of 30&#xb0; on the wheel disc <b>41</b> while the wheel disc <b>41</b> takes 120 seconds to turn a circle. As a result, a certain area on the wheel disc <b>41</b> corresponding to the sterilization-acting range would be sterilized by the sterilizing module <b>30</b> over a 10-second period, which is 1/12 of the rotation period of the wheel disc <b>41</b> (with a rotation angle of 360&#xb0;). The sterilization time may be extended as required, so that the energy consumption of the sterilizing element <b>33</b> (e.g., by heat or light sterilizing means) can be reduced to save power.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the sterilizing element <b>33</b> is exemplified by an electrical heating element and represented by a zigzag symbol. The heat radiation generated by the sterilizing element <b>33</b> is represented by arrows and R, and an appropriate heating power or temperature can be set depending on, for example, the types of viruses or bacteria to be eliminated. The reflector <b>32</b> is arranged between the vent <b>312</b> and the sterilizing element <b>33</b>, and can reflect the heat radiation R generated by the sterilizing element <b>33</b>, so that the heat radiation R can be concentrated in the opening <b>313</b> for sterilizing the wheel disc <b>41</b> rather than directly dissipate through the vent <b>312</b>. In other words, the reflector <b>32</b> can effectively prevent the sterilizing element <b>33</b> from dissipating heat to the outside. In addition, the non-linear channel <b>311</b><i>a </i>formed by the reflector <b>32</b> and the cover <b>31</b> is in a bent shape, which blocks the air in the first space <b>311</b> from flowing back, and reduces the heat energy dissipation. Thus, the reflector <b>32</b> can work with the cover <b>31</b> to concentrate the heat radiation R, maintain the sterilizing temperature on the wheel disc <b>41</b> and reduce the heat energy dissipation to effectively save energy and improve the sterilizing effect.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The operations of the air sterilizing device <b>1</b> are described below along with in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> to <b>8</b></figref>. When the air sterilizing device <b>1</b> works, the blower <b>50</b> operates to introduce outside air into the casing <b>20</b> through the air inlet <b>201</b>, and the wheel disc <b>41</b> is driven by the wheel disc driving mechanism <b>42</b> to rotate at a proper speed. For the convenience of description, the introduced outside air is divided into a first portion of air A and a second portion of air B. The first portion of air A flows through the sterilizing module <b>30</b> before flowing through the wheel disc <b>41</b>, and the second portion of air B flows through the wheel disc <b>41</b> rather than the sterilizing module <b>30</b>. The first portion of air A flows into the first space <b>311</b> from the vent <b>312</b> of the cover <b>31</b> through the non-linear channel <b>311</b><i>a</i>, being heated and sterilized by collaboration of the sterilizing element <b>33</b> and the reflector <b>32</b>, which indicates the first sterilization process. Then the first portion of air A after being heated and sterilized flows through the holes <b>412</b> of the wheel disc <b>41</b> and over the microporous structures <b>413</b> on the holes <b>412</b>, where bacteria and viruses are captured. Afterwards, such bacteria and viruses captured by the microporous structures <b>413</b> are inactivated as the sterilizing element <b>33</b> also sterilizes the wheel disc <b>41</b>, which indicates the second sterilization process. After being sterilized by the first and the second sterilization processes, the first portion of air A has been sterilized and is clean, then being discharged via the air outlet <b>202</b> to the outside of the air sterilizing device <b>1</b> by the blower <b>50</b>. On the other hand, after the second portion of air B flows into the casing <b>20</b>, it directly passes through the holes <b>412</b> of the wheel disc <b>41</b>, where the bacteria and viruses in the second portion of air B are adsorbed, captured and filtered by the microporous structures <b>413</b>. After flowing out from the wheel disc <b>41</b>, the second portion of air B has been sterilized and is clean, then being discharged via the air outlet <b>202</b> to the outside of the air sterilizing device <b>1</b> by the blower <b>50</b>. In addition, despite the part of the wheel disc <b>41</b> through which the second portion of air B flows is not covered and sterilized by the sterilizing element <b>33</b> then, it would be sterilized since all parts of the wheel disc <b>41</b> will pass through and sterilized by the sterilizing element <b>33</b> in sequence with the rotation of the wheel disc <b>41</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the above embodiment, the wheel disc <b>41</b> is circular, and the range covered by the cover <b>31</b> of the sterilizing module <b>30</b> is roughly fan-shaped. More specifically, the cover <b>31</b> of the sterilizing module <b>30</b> covers a fan-shaped area (or a fan-like area) on the wheel disc <b>41</b>, which is from the vicinity of the circle center to the circumference of the wheel disc <b>41</b>. The central angle of the cover <b>31</b> can be set between 20&#xb0; and 110&#xb0;, and the area of the air inlet side <b>411</b><i>a </i>of the wheel disc <b>41</b> covered by the cover <b>31</b> can be set to 5-30% of the whole area of the air inlet side <b>411</b><i>a </i>of the wheel disc <b>41</b>. When the wheel disc <b>41</b> is driven by the wheel disc driving mechanism <b>42</b> to rotate at a proper speed, different parts of the wheel disc <b>41</b> pass through the sterilizing module <b>30</b> in sequence and the bacteria and viruses adsorbed by the microporous structures <b>413</b> of the wheel disc <b>41</b> are sterilized and eliminated due to undergoing sufficient sterilization time.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The energy or power consumed by the sterilizing element <b>33</b> can be greatly reduced with a significant increase in the sterilization efficiency by using the non-linear channel <b>311</b><i>a </i>formed by the reflector <b>32</b> of the sterilizing module <b>30</b> and the reflection effect as the heating sterilization is processed in the sterilizing module <b>30</b> and by rotating the wheel disc <b>41</b> at a proper speed such that an appropriate sterilization time is set. In addition, the area of the air inlet side <b>411</b><i>a </i>of the wheel disc <b>41</b> covered by the sterilizing module <b>30</b> is much smaller than the uncovered area of the air inlet side <b>411</b><i>a </i>of the wheel disc <b>41</b>. Therefore, the first portion of air A that flows through the sterilizing module <b>30</b> is less than the second portion of air B that does not flow through the sterilizing module <b>30</b>. In other words, the first portion of air A heated by the sterilizing module <b>30</b> accounts for a smaller proportion of the air discharged out of the casing <b>20</b>. Therefore, according to the parameters such as the suction and exhaust airflow rate of the blower <b>50</b>, the rotation speed of the wheel disc <b>41</b>, and/or the power, area and airflow rate of the sterilizing module <b>30</b>, the temperature difference between the air sucked in the air inlet <b>201</b> and that discharged from the air outlet <b>202</b> of the air sterilizing device <b>1</b> can be set to 10&#xb0; C. or less. The temperature and humidity of the air discharged from the air outlet <b>202</b> is not much different from that of the environment, and will not cause discomfort to the user.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the above embodiment, the sterilizing module <b>30</b> comprises a cover <b>31</b>, a reflector <b>32</b> and a sterilizing element <b>33</b> that are covered by the cover <b>31</b>, and is arranged at the air inlet side <b>411</b><i>a </i>of the wheel disc <b>41</b>, which is not limited thereto. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> discloses another embodiment of the air sterilizing device <b>1</b> of the present disclosure.

When the outside air flows into the air sterilizing device <b>1</b>, the first portion of air A flows through the sterilizing module <b>30</b>, the wheel disc <b>41</b>, and then encounters the reflector <b>32</b><i>a </i>arranged at the air outlet side <b>411</b><i>b </i>of the wheel disc <b>41</b>, so that part of heat radiation can be reflected back to the wheel disc <b>41</b> as the wheel disc <b>41</b> is adjacent to it. Such arrangement enables the heat radiation emitted by the sterilizing element <b>33</b> to be reflected back to the wheel disc <b>41</b> by the reflector <b>32</b><i>a </i>after it passes through the wheel disc <b>41</b>, which further reduces energy consumption, improves energy efficiency, and more effectively eliminates bacteria and viruses on the wheel disc <b>41</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> discloses another embodiment of the air sterilizing device <b>1</b> of the present disclosure.
