Unlike chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), both of which potentially damage the Earth's ozone layer, HFOs pose no threat to the ozone layer. HFO-1234yf has also been shown to be a low global warming compound with low toxicity and, hence, can meet increasingly stringent requirements for refrigerants in mobile air conditioning.

In this context, &#x2018;impurity&#x2019; (and &#x2018;impurities&#x2019;) covers substances that are intended to be separated from the 2-chloro-1,1,1,2-tetrafluoropropane (HCFC-244bb), although the substances to be separated can nevertheless have value themselves. An example of such an &#x2018;impurity&#x2019; is 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoropropene (HFO-1234yf), which is a highly valuable commercial product that can be sold to generate revenue. The claims refer to &#x2018;other substances&#x2019; instead of &#x2018;impurity&#x2019; to emphasize this point, and the terms &#x2018;other substances&#x2019; and &#x2018;impurity&#x2019; are intended to be used interchangeably in the present disclosure in this context.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0013">In the foregoing method, the step of modifying the relative amounts of 2-chloro-1,1,1,2-tetrafluoropropane (HCFC-244bb) and water may involve adding 2-chloro-1,1,1,2-tetrafluoropropane (HCFC-244bb) to the composition, adding water to the composition, or adding both 2-chloro-1,1,1,2-tetrafluoropropane (HCFC-244bb) and water to the composition.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0014">The present disclosure also provides a method of producing 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoropropene (HFO-1234yf) comprising converting at least some of the 2-chloro-1,1,1,2-tetrafluoropropane (HCFC-244bb) present in the azeotrope or azeotrope-like composition defined above into 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoropropene (HFO-1234yf). This method covers both direct conversion (where HCFC-244bb is present in an azeotrope at the point it is converted into HFO-1234yf) and indirect conversion (e.g. where HCFC-244bb previously present in the azeotrope or azeotrope-like composition is not part of the azeotrope or azeotrope-like composition at the point it is converted into HFO-1234yf). The latter possibility includes, for example, converting HCFC-244bb into HFO-1234yf in a reaction mixture that does not comprise the azeotrope/azeotrope-like composition of the present disclosure because other substances present that disrupt the azeotropy, but wherein the molecules of HCFC-244bb had previously been in the form of the azeotrope/azeotrope-like composition. The method may involve reacting the HCFC-244bb with a base, wherein the base may be a caustic base, preferably an alkali metal hydroxide, preferably KOH or NaOH. The reaction may be conducted in an aqueous environment, preferably in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst, preferably an ammonium halide, preferably a trialkylammonium halide or a tetraalkylammonium halide, preferably a trialkylammonium chloride or a tetraalkylammonium chloride.

The dehydrochlorination reaction is performed in a reaction zone and may occur in the vapor phase with a catalyst or in liquid phase with base and optionally phase transfer catalyst, and/or solvent and/or salt.

For a heterogenous azeotrope at a given temperature and pressure, the composition of each of the two liquid phases and the composition of the vapor phase remain constant. If a heterogenous azeotrope is formed, at a constant pressure the boiling point of the heterogenous azeotrope will be less than the lower boiling point component (a &#x201c;minimum boiling azeotrope&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0047">An &#x201c;azeotrope&#x201d; (or &#x201c;azeotropic&#x201d;) composition is a unique combination of two or more components. An azeotrope can be either homogenous (which has one liquid phase) or heterogenous (which has two liquid phases). An azeotrope composition can be characterized in various ways. For example, at a given pressure, an azeotrope composition boils at a constant characteristic temperature which is either greater than the higher boiling point component (maximum boiling azeotrope) or less than the lower boiling point component (minimum boiling azeotrope). However, in the case of a heterogenous azeotrope the boiling point of the azeotrope will always be below the boiling point of the lower boiling point component. At this characteristic temperature a homogenous azeotrope has the same composition in both the vapor and liquid phases. In the case of a heterogenous azeotrope then at this characteristic temperature the composition of each of the two liquid phases and the vapor phase will remain constant upon boiling. The azeotrope composition does not fractionate upon boiling or evaporation. Therefore, the components of the azeotrope composition cannot be separated during a phase change.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0048">A homogenous azeotrope composition is also characterized in that at the characteristic azeotrope temperature, the bubble point pressure of the liquid phase is identical to the dew point pressure of the vapor phase. The behavior of an azeotrope composition is in contrast with that of a non-azeotrope composition in which during boiling or evaporation, the liquid composition changes to a substantial degree.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0049">One of ordinary skill in the art would understand however that at different pressures, both the composition and the boiling point of the azeotrope composition will vary to some extent. Therefore, depending on the temperature and/or pressure, an azeotrope composition can have a variable composition. The skilled person would therefore understand that composition ranges, rather than fixed compositions, can be used to define azeotrope compositions. In addition, an azeotrope may be defined in terms of exact weight percentages of each component of the compositions characterized by a fixed boiling point at a specified pressure.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0050">An &#x201c;azeotrope-like&#x201d; composition is a composition of two or more components which behaves substantially as an azeotrope composition. Thus, for the purposes of this disclosure, an azeotrope-like composition is a combination of two or more different components which, in the case of a homogenous azeotrope when in liquid form under given pressure, will boil at a substantially constant temperature, and which will provide a vapor composition substantially identical to the liquid composition undergoing boiling. In the case of a heterogenous azeotrope two liquid phases form under a given pressure which will be covered by a vapor composition. Each of the two liquid phases and the vapor phase will remain substantially constant on boiling.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0051">For the purposes of this disclosure, an azeotrope-like composition is a composition or range of compositions which boil(s) at a temperature range of between about 12.0&#xb0; C. and 13.6&#xb0; C. at a pressure from about 12.5 psia to about 16.5 psia.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0052">Azeotrope or azeotrope-like compositions can be identified using a number of different methods.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0053">For the purposes of this disclosure the azeotrope or azeotrope-like composition is identified experimentally using an ebulliometer (Walas, Phase Equilibria in Chemical Engineering, Butterworth-Heinemann, 1985, 533-544).

The second component of the composition is then added in varying amounts and the boiling point of each of the obtained compositions is measured using the ebulliometer at said constant pressure. In the case of a ternary azeotrope the initial composition would comprise of a binary blend and a third component is added in varying amounts. The boiling point of each of the obtained ternary compositions is measured using the ebulliometer at said constant pressure.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0055">The measured boiling points are plotted against the composition of the tested composition, for example, for a binary azeotrope, the amount of the second component added to the composition, (expressed as either weight % or mole %).

The step of modifying the relative amounts of 2-chloro-1,1,1,2-tetrafluoropropane (HCFC-244bb) and water may involve adding 2-chloro-1,1,1,2-tetrafluoropropane (HCFC-244bb) to the composition, adding water to the composition, or adding both 2-chloro-1,1,1,2-tetrafluoropropane (HCFC-244bb) and water to the composition.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0068">The azeotrope or azeotrope-like composition comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of effective amounts of 2-chloro-1,1,1,2-tetrafluoropropane (HCFC-244bb) and water can be used in the production of 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoropropene (HFO-1234yf). For example, the azeotrope or azeotrope-like composition can be combined with further components, such as a base and/or a phase transfer catalyst, to facilitate dehydrochlorinating the 2-chloro-1,1,1,2-tetrafluoropropane (HCFC-244bb) to form 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoropropene (HFO-1234yf). Residual 2-chloro-1,1,1,2-tetrafluoropropane (HCFC-244bb) present in crude 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoropropene HFO-1234yf) can be removed along with water in the form of the azeotrope or azeotrope-like composition of the present disclosure, wherein the removal can for example take the form of a distillation, phase separation or combination thereof. The azeotrope or azeotrope-like composition removed from the crude product can be recycled back to step 3, especially when conducting step 3 in the liquid phase.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0069">It is also possible, though not inevitable, for the azeotrope or azeotrope-like composition to form in a reaction that produces 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoropropene (HFO-1234yf) from 2-chloro-1,1,1,2-tetrafluoropropane (HCFC-244bb). The existence of the azeotrope or azeotrope-like composition will depend on factors such as whether the azeotropy is disrupted by other substances present. Examples of how it is possible, though not inevitable, for the azeotrope or azeotrope-like composition to form include the following:<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0070">When water is present in the reaction as a solvent, e.g. when the reaction is conducted in an aqueous environment, such as when a base is used in an aqueous solution.</li>        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0071">When water is evolved in a reaction.
