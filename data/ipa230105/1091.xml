Fluid can flow from the lumen of the inner tube and into the annulus formed between the inner tube and the medication plunger shaft lumen. By allowing fluid flow into the annulus, fluid, such as saline, can flow into the saline chamber when the medication plunger and the saline plunger are in any position while maintaining a compact profile.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The detailed description set forth below is intended as a description of various configurations of the subject technology and is not intended to represent the only configurations in which the subject technology may be practiced. The detailed description includes specific details for the purpose of providing a thorough understanding of the subject technology. However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the subject technology may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well-known structures and components are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the concepts of the subject technology. Like components are labeled with identical element numbers for ease of understanding. Reference numbers may have letter suffixes appended to indicate separate instances of a common element while being referred to generically by the same number without a suffix letter.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">While the following description is directed to the administration of medical fluid using the disclosed syringe, it is to be understood that this description is only an example of usage and does not limit the scope of the claims. Various aspects of the disclosed syringe may be used in any application where it is desirable to provide for the administration of medical fluids.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The disclosed syringe overcomes several challenges discovered with respect to certain conventional syringe. One challenge with certain conventional syringes is that syringes may deliver excess medical fluid, such as saline, to patients. Further, conventional syringes with multiple plungers may have a large profile. Because excess medical fluid may delay the delivery of medical fluids, may not be tolerated by fluid restricted patients, such as premature babies, and large profile syringes limit IV set configurations, the use conventional syringes is undesirable.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Therefore, in accordance with the present disclosure, it is advantageous to provide a syringe as described herein that eliminates or substantially reduces delivering excess medical fluid to a patient and reduces the overall profile of the syringe body. The disclosed syringe provides a tube-in-tube configuration that permits a reduced profile while reducing excess medical fluid delivered to the patient.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">An example of a syringe that prevents delivery of excess medical fluid is now described.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of a medication delivery system <b>100</b>, in accordance with various aspects of the present disclosure. In the illustrated example, the medication delivery system <b>100</b> delivers medication from the syringe <b>130</b> to the patient via a catheter <b>112</b> without delivering excess fluid, such as saline, used to prime the medication delivery system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some embodiments, a medication flow path within a dual lumen tubing <b>120</b> can be primed with saline to remove any air or trapped gasses within the medication flow path of the dual lumen tubing <b>120</b>. Saline can be advanced from a proximal end <b>132</b> of the syringe <b>130</b>, through the medication flow path of the dual lumen tubing <b>120</b> and to the valve <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The saline from the medication flow path of the dual lumen tubing <b>120</b> can be received by the medication flow path <b>111</b> of the valve <b>110</b>. In a priming configuration, a valve element <b>113</b> can prevent saline from the medication flow path <b>111</b> from entering the patient catheter <b>112</b> and can instead direct the saline toward the return flow path <b>109</b> of the valve <b>110</b> to allow primed saline to be returned to the syringe <b>130</b> via the return flow path of the dual lumen tubing <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective view of the medication delivery system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> with the priming trigger <b>180</b> removed, in accordance with various aspects of the present disclosure. In the illustrated example, the syringe <b>130</b> advances medication within the medication flow path of the dual lumen tubing <b>120</b> to prime the medication flow path of the dual lumen tubing <b>120</b>. Advantageously, by priming the medication flow path with medication, the medication can be delivered to the patient via the catheter <b>112</b> proximal to the patient with less delay and without delivering the saline used to prime the medication flow path of the dual lumen tubing <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">To introduce medication into the medication flow path of the dual lumen tubing <b>120</b>, the medication plunger within the syringe <b>130</b> can be advanced or otherwise displaced to introduce a volume of medication into the medication flow path of the dual lumen tubing <b>120</b>. Optionally, the medication plunger of the syringe <b>130</b> can be configured to be advanced or displaced a desired amount to dispense a volume of medication into the medication flow path of the dual lumen tubing <b>120</b> that is equivalent to the volume of the medication flow path of the dual lumen tubing <b>120</b>. In other words, medication plunger of the syringe <b>130</b> can be advanced to fill the volume of the medication flow path of the dual lumen tubing <b>120</b> up to the valve element <b>113</b> to prime the medication for administration via the catheter <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some embodiments, the priming of medication into the medication flow path of the dual lumen tubing <b>120</b> can be automated or otherwise simplified. For example, the medication plunger can be biased to be advanced to introduce medication into the medication flow path of the dual lumen tubing <b>120</b>. The biasing member of the priming mechanism within the syringe <b>130</b> can be released by removing the priming trigger <b>180</b>. By removing the priming trigger <b>180</b>, the biasing member can advance the medication plunger to prime the medication within the medication delivery system <b>100</b>. Optionally, the priming travel of the medication plunger can be stopped or limited by a priming stop <b>182</b>. By limiting the travel of the medication plunger during priming, a desired volume of medication can be introduced into the medication flow path of the dual lumen tubing <b>120</b>, for example, sufficient medication volume to fill the medication flow path of the dual lumen tubing <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As illustrated, as the medication is introduced into the medication flow path of the dual lumen tubing <b>120</b>, the saline previously primed through the dual lumen tubing <b>120</b> is displaced. The displaced saline is directed by the valve element <b>113</b> through the return flow path <b>109</b> of the valve <b>110</b> and into the return flow path of the dual lumen tubing <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Medical fluid from the return flow path of the dual lumen tubing <b>120</b> can be returned into the syringe <b>130</b>.

In addition, in the Detailed Description, it can be seen that the description provides illustrative examples and the various features are grouped together in various embodiments for the purpose of streamlining the disclosure. This method of disclosure is not to be interpreted as reflecting an intention that the claimed subject matter requires more features than are expressly recited in each claim. Rather, as the following claims reflect, inventive subject matter lies in less than all features of a single disclosed configuration or operation. The following claims are hereby incorporated into the Detailed Description, with each claim standing on its own as a separately claimed subject matter.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The claims are not intended to be limited to the aspects described herein, but is to be accorded the full scope consistent with the language claims and to encompass all legal equivalents.
