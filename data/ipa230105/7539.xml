Embodiments of this disclosure relate to methods and apparatuses for facilitating the use of stations of a multi-link device to set up and operate backhaul links to serve a Mobile Access Point within the same multi-link device in a wireless local area network communications system.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Wireless local area network (WLAN) technology allows devices to access the internet in the 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, 6 GHz or 60 GHz frequency bands. WLANs are based on the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE)802.11 standards. The IEEE 802.11 family of standards aim to increase speed and reliability and to extend the operating range of wireless networks.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Multi-link operation (MLO) is a key feature for next generation extremely high throughput (EHT) WI-FI systems, e.g., IEEE 802.11be. The WI-FI devices that support MLO are referred to as multi-link devices (MLDs). With MLO, it is possible for a non-access point (non-AP) MLD to discover, authenticate, associate, and set up multiple links with an AP MLD. Channel access and frame exchange is possible on each link that is set up between the AP MLD and non-AP MLD.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">MLO has two variations. The first type is simultaneous transmit/receive (STR) where the STAs affiliated with an MLD can transmit and receive independent of each other. The second variation is non-simultaneous transmit/receive (NSTR) in which the links formed by the STAs affiliated with an MLD do not form an STR link pair. If a link pair constitutes an NSTR link pair, transmission on one link can cause interference to the other link due to signal leakiness which the device's radio transceiver is unable to withstand. Consequently, two STAs forming an NSTR link pair cannot simultaneously transmit and receive frames. Since the STR mode of operation requires two or more radios with sufficient isolation, it is expected that AP MLDs will have STR capabilities while non-AP MLDs are more likely not to be capable of STR, and thus use NSTR.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An MLD can be configured as a Mobile AP. For instance, when a battery powered mobile device is configured as a Mobile AP, it executes the functionalities of an AP. It can utilize links with a WI-FI router as the backhaul and one or more links connected to another MLD to provide connectivity to that other MLD. The role of an AP is performed on the latter links. When configured as a Mobile AP, an MLD may be required to support high throughput applications (e.g., AR, VR, etc.).</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Embodiments of the present disclosure provide methods and apparatuses for facilitating the use of STAs of an MLD to set up and operate backhaul links to serve a Mobile AP within the same MLD in a wireless local area network.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one embodiment, an MLD is provided, comprising APs forming a Mobile AP MLD, backhaul STAs, and a processor operably coupled to the APs and the backhaul STAs. The APs and the backhaul STAs each comprise a transceiver. The processor is configured to instruct at least one of the APs to set up an access link with a corresponding STA of a non-AP MLD, and to instruct at least one of the backhaul STAs to set up a backhaul link with a corresponding AP of an AP MLD to carry traffic of the non-AP MLD that flows through the Mobile AP MLD over the access link.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another embodiment, a method performed by an MLD is provided, including the steps of instructing at least one AP forming a Mobile AP MLD to set up an access link with a corresponding STA of a non-AP MLD, and instructing at least one backhaul STA to set up a backhaul link with a corresponding AP of an AP MLD to carry traffic of the non-AP MLD that flows through the Mobile AP MLD over the access link.

In such embodiments, the illustrated components of the AP MLD <b>101</b> represent a single upper MAC (UMAC) layer and other higher layers in the OSI model, which are shared by all of the affiliated APs <b>202</b><i>a</i>-<b>202</b><i>n. </i></p><p id="p-0052" num="0053">For each affiliated AP <b>202</b><i>a</i>-<b>202</b><i>n</i>, the RF transceivers <b>209</b><i>a</i>-<b>209</b><i>n </i>receive, from the antennas <b>204</b><i>a</i>-<b>204</b><i>n</i>, incoming RF signals, such as signals transmitted by STAs in the network <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, each affiliated AP <b>202</b><i>a</i>-<b>202</b><i>n </i>operates at a different bandwidth, e.g., 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, or 6 GHz, and accordingly the incoming RF signals received by each affiliated AP may be at a different frequency of RF. In other embodiments, each affiliated AP <b>202</b><i>a</i>-<b>202</b><i>n </i>can operate at various different bandwidths, and the RF transceivers <b>209</b><i>a</i>-<b>209</b><i>n </i>include transceivers capable of operating at those different bandwidths. The RF transceivers <b>209</b><i>a</i>-<b>209</b><i>n </i>down-convert the incoming RF signals to generate IF or baseband signals. The IF or baseband signals are sent to the RX processing circuitry <b>219</b>, which generates processed baseband signals by filtering, decoding, and/or digitizing the baseband or IF signals.

The controller/processor <b>224</b> could support additional functions as well, such as more advanced wireless communication functions. For instance, the controller/processor <b>224</b> could support beam forming or directional routing operations in which outgoing signals from multiple antennas <b>204</b><i>a</i>-<b>204</b><i>n </i>are weighted differently to effectively steer the outgoing signals in a desired direction. The controller/processor <b>224</b> could also support OFDMA operations in which outgoing signals are assigned to different subsets of subcarriers for different recipients (e.g., different STAs <b>111</b>-<b>114</b>).
