Both are expensive options. With regard to conventional wells, it is typically necessary to dig about 100 ft (or about 30 m) or deeper into the ground, which incurs great expense for installation of the well, as well as ongoing costs for maintenance and for taxes. Such conventional wells (or piping in of water from the water utility) also cannot take advantage of any surface water sources for irrigation purposes, as such conventional approaches are ill-equipped to utilize such either low-flow, low-volume, and/or shallow water sources without significant modification of the irrigation system being used in conjunction with these conventional approaches. Such systems also require additional irrigation infrastructure for coupling with the irrigation system to provide water directly to the plants or crops, conventional versions of such irrigation infrastructure being inefficient and typically indiscriminate in terms of watering, resulting in water waste, which translates to cost increases.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Hence, there is a need for more robust and scalable solutions for implementing Internet of Things (&#x201c;IoT&#x201d;) functionality, and, more particularly, to methods, systems, and apparatuses for implementing IoT-based microwell solution for irrigation.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A further understanding of the nature and advantages of particular embodiments may be realized by reference to the remaining portions of the specification and the drawings, in which like reference numerals are used to refer to similar components.

In some embodiments, the first sensor data may include, without limitation, at least one of humidity sensor data, soil moisture sensor data, ground water sensor data, water flow sensor data, clog sensor data, water pump sensor data, irrigation system sensor data, temperature sensor data, wind sensor data, weather sensor data, slope sensor data, topography sensor data, light sensor data, light intensity sensor data, image sensor data, video sensor data, object orientation sensor data, surface orientation sensor data, plant monitoring sensor data, motion sensor data, infrared sensor data, or pest detector data, and/or the like.

In some cases, the plurality of sensors may comprise at least one second sensor among the one or more second sensors, where the at least one second sensor comprises a third sensor, which may be disposed in an aerial drone that is configured to fly over the first area to collect sensor data indicative of at least one of environmental conditions, topographical features, geographical features, plantable areas, water features, land features, plant-life, or wildlife within the first area, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The use of the microwells or microwell network as described herein allows for tapping of surface water sources or relatively shallow underground water sources (e.g., less than 50 feet or about 15.2 m) for providing irrigation to an agriculture, commercial, or residential field/lawn, compared with traditional wells that require 100 foot deep installations or deeper. Accordingly, the costs of installation and operation (including applicable taxes) is much lower for the microwell or microwell network implementation. Further, the features of the microwells enable more efficient use and direction of water that takes into account current or up-to-date conditions (and thus water needs of particular plants or crops) to direct the correct amount of water (along with insecticide, fertilizer, and/or growth enhancers) to particular plants (or portions of plants) or crops, thereby minimizing waste while enhancing growth potential of the plants or crops. Maintenance of the microwell network may also be facilitated with use of remotely controlled valves and pumps for controlling flow and pressure of water and air through the system, or the like. These features are facilitated by use of IoT communications that automate the system, thereby reducing potential human error while enabling more control (and less physical labor) by human users or operators.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">These and other aspects of the IoT-based microwell solution for irrigation are described in greater detail with respect to the figures.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The following detailed description illustrates a few exemplary embodiments in further detail to enable one of skill in the art to practice such embodiments.

Other factors that may be considered in creating the &#x201c;farm plan&#x201d; or water distribution plan may include, without limitation, amount of water required by each type of plant or crop, time of day for optimal watering, orientation of plants or crops on the land (e.g., orientation with respect to the sun, etc.), taking advantage of slopes, results of soil percolation tests throughout the field, etc.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">(2) The farmer would fertilize and plant the crops.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">(3) A microwell service provider would come in with the farm plan and would plant or install the microwells appropriately and to bring it online. Based on the farm plan, irrigation lines (which may be disposable, biodegradable, and/or chewed up during harvest, or the like) that are attached to the microwells could be quickly spread out and oriented to said farm plan for proper field flooding. The goal to achieve the most coverage with the least number of microwells may depend on the precision of the farm plan. The use of IoT-capable sensors and IoT-capable microwells would enable greater precision in formulating the farm plan and for continued optimization of the farm plan even after installation of microwells. In some cases, based on updated IoT-based sensor data from the sensors and/or microwells, the farm plan may be updated to include additional (or turn-off already installed) microwells and/or redirect flow of water among the installed microwells, or the like.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In the case that microwells are removed at the end of the planting season (as opposed to the case where microwells are permanently or semi-permanently left installed in the ground for years or decades, or the like), to remove microwells from the ground, one embodiment may utilize either a &#x201c;sidecar&#x201d; mounted on a harvester (or other equipment) that has a very small boom or the like that is configured to grab or capture the top of each microwell, to spin or rotate it out of the ground, and to place it to the side or back of the harvester by drilling it a foot or two into the ground to stand it up or by laying it on the ground for the microwell service provider to pick up at a later time. Alternatively, the microwell service provider may utilize a boom-equipped truck to follow the harvester and to pull the microwells out of the next X rows over to be harvested on the next pass (e.g., about the width of the harvester, or the like).</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In a non-limiting use case, an agricultural field may require 300 gallons of water to sufficiently water the crops planted therein. A gallon is 231 cubic inches. 300 gallons is 69,300 cubic inches. That is about 480 square feet at 1 inch of water per day or about 3370 square feet at 1 inch of water per week. For really sandy soil that does not hold water well, one would need an inch a week at a worst case. An acre is 43560 square feet, which means 1 acre divided by 3370 square feet equals 43560 square feet divided by 3370 sq feet equals about 13 microwells an acre in very worst case assuming each microwell can produce its share of water (or the total number of microwells can produce 300 gallons of water a day).</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In some aspects, the microwells may be permanently installed at least two harvester widths apart in both dimensions. They would not be in the plant line but would instead be in the track where the harvester wheels would travel and the harvester could be used to work between them. The microwells would have irrigation lines running between them and valved with IoT-based valves to control them such that they could work in union to create enough pressure to sprinkle or spray water at a distance out of any one (or N number) of them at a time (compared to where each would have worked independently and just drained immediately to a patterned ground for distribution). This would provide sufficient &#x201c;reach&#x201d; to water a field without needing to have excessive numbers of microwells installed and likewise could be more permanent so that one could go deeper if need be. The precision IoT implementation may be used to facilitate and optimize such microwell implementation.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In some embodiments, the precision IoT implementation may include an automated drone flight(s) that would use an IoT-based drone(s) to fly the boundaries of the field (or fields) for complete coverage. Artificial intelligence (&#x201c;AI&#x201d;) algorithms may be used to analyze the crops and/or environmental conditions and to compute where water should next be applied, based at least on one or more of sun position, sunlight amount, humidity, wind direction, wind speed, day in growing season for particular crop(s), local weather forecasts, and/or drone visual crop inspection (e.g., crop size, crop shape, color, etc.), and/or the like. Using that analysis with the &#x201c;farm plan,&#x201d; the system would keep the water precisely directed. Each microwell sprinkler would be configured with IoT to valve appropriately to spray out of its own sprinkler head or redirect its pumped water each way to other microwells in the respective watering line. Likewise, the microwell would not just sprinkle in a circle but may be used to spray at a particular direction and at a particular distance (and/or using the spray patterns <b>245</b> described above) as instructed by the analysis combined with the farm plan.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">According to some embodiments, where the land has surface water sources, the microwell network or system may be enhanced by running a line from the surface water source(s) to the microwell watering line and boosting the water distribution of the microwell network with use of an electric pump or the like that would be feasible at the edges of the field.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In some embodiments, a sidecar with a micro- or nano-processor (e.g., Raspberry Pi&#xae; or other general purpose small single-board computers (&#x201c;SBCs&#x201d;), finite state machine or other custom-designed circuit boards, or other electronics, etc.), with IoT platform functionalities (in some cases, with ThingsBoard&#xae; based IoT functionalities, etc.) and with long range and/or low power wide area networking functionalities (e.g., using long range (&#x201c;LoRa&#x201d;) wide area network or LoRaWAN&#xae; or other networking protocols, etc.), may be used for driving precision, decision, and/or automation of the microwells, in some instances, controlling actuators driving valves on the base of one or more microwells at ground level, including (a) implementing teaming of two or more microwells configured to switch flow either up a given microwell or out to the side of other teams microwells connected in tandem in order to throw or spray water up to 50 feet or more, and/or (b) using servo-based control for implementing directional precision of the water spout, etc. In some cases, software may be used to lay down a base grid using coordinates (e.g., military coordinates, geographical coordinates, etc.) of the types of soils (as determined using perc tests every square meter, etc.) so as to implement distribution of water statically. Alternatively, software may be used to implement AI-coupled with drone functionalities to lay down next one or more layers of grid so as to implement distribution of water dynamically per the metrics captured daily (e.g., sun, humidity, drone visual crop inspection, wind, day in season, forecasts, etc., . . . , one per layer). According to some embodiments, the microwells are positioned per available near ground surface water (e.g., 8 to 15 feet, or the like) or surface water that is available on the land, with an expected coverage of &#x2dc;50 foot radius thereby allowing &#x2dc;100 feet width for a harvester to go between two microwells among the plurality of microwells. A base static layer may be mapped with dynamic layers mapped above the base layer, with the system configured to determine whether or not to team two or more microwells, or the like. Daily drone-based metrics collection may be analyzed and used to provide metrics for the dynamics layers, etc.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">For maintenance at the end of the season, the microwell system may include a mode in which it could automatically &#x201c;blow its lines&#x201d; prior to the winter freeze, not unlike winterizing processes in a residential home irrigation system. In some embodiments, the drone may be instructed to hover while watering as a regular maintenance check to ensure that the reach of the sprinklers is actually occurring as expected.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">According to some embodiments, where the microwells are permanently installed, they may be used to control autonomous vehicles more accurately than GPS systems. Likewise, small underground lines may be run to them to augment the water and pressure, and, in some cases, chemicals for killing or preventing bugs and weeds could be piped in through the small underground lines. The application of such could be more accurate and timely, while being completely automated. This enables a farmer to only be in the field twice a growing season&#x2014;i.e., once to plant and once to harvest &#x2014;, thereby making it less of a need to own a tractor, which may be owned a shared cooperative of neighboring or regional farmers. The microwell system allows for lower installation expenses along with lower operating expenses compared with a traditional well, which is very costly to install and costly on an ongoing basis due to applicable taxes. Further, the crops could be planted tighter together since no wheel tracks would then be necessary for the tractor thereby increasing yields considerably.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a non-limiting example <b>300</b> of a geographic area in which IoT-based microwell solution for irrigation may be implemented, in accordance with various embodiments.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">With reference to the non-limiting example <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, geographic location or region <b>305</b> (or &#x201c;geographic area <b>305</b>&#x201d; or the like), which might include, without limitation, one or more first areas <b>310</b> (which might include, but are not limited to, at least one of an agricultural field, a farm, a plot of land, a crop field, a sod farm, a residential lawn, a commercial lawn, a residential garden, or a commercial garden, and/or the like), one or more roadways or vehicular paths <b>315</b>, one or more standing surface water sources <b>320</b> (e.g., lakes, ponds, wetlands, reservoirs, swamps, etc.), one or more moving surface water sources <b>325</b> (i.e., waterways or watercourses; e.g., rivers, streams, creeks, brooks, rivulets, gullies, rills, aqueducts, or canals, and/or the like), and one or more hills or rises <b>330</b><i>a </i>and <b>330</b><i>b </i>(collectively, &#x201c;hills <b>330</b>&#x201d; or &#x201c;rises <b>330</b>,&#x201d; or the like; depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> by gray-colored contour lines), or the like.
