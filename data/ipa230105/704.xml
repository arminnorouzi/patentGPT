A patient harness sling is connected to the spreader bar to lift patients in use. Slings can also assist in partially bearing weight of a person for assisted standing.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The spreader bars similarly comprise various configurations but generally comprise at least two connection points at distal ends thereof to which sling straps are connected to hold the harness from the spreader bar.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Furthermore, certain spreader bar connection points of various configurations exist which are designed to reduce the likelihood of inadvertent detachment of a sling strap from the connection point in use.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some configurations comprise an integrated upper spring latch extending substantially horizontally across the mouth of the connection point. However, if the sling strap loops over the bend of the connection point, it may lie across the latch and pull the latch open, thereby dropping the sling strap. Some connection point configurations have a hook doubling back sufficiently such that the latch extends across the mouth more vertically to reduce this likelihood.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Furthermore, connection points have various configuration of latches including those comprising a looped spring steel clip having legs of different lengths which engage the hook at offset points to bias the latch to a closed position.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, these types of latches are difficult to use, including in requiring two-handed operation to release a sling strap wherein opposing forefingers of one hand are used to pull the latch open and the other hand used to pull the sling strap from the connection point.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is been reported that, as a result of such inconvenience, staff often break these latches from the hook to avoid the inconvenience thereof but which renders the connection point potentially unsafe.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention seeks to provide a connection point assembly for a patient lifter spreader bar, which will overcome or substantially ameliorate at least some of the deficiencies of the prior art, or to at least provide an alternative.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is to be understood that, if any prior art information is referred to herein, such reference does not constitute an admission that the information forms part of the common general knowledge in the art, in Australia or any other country.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">There is provided herein a connection point assembly for a patient lifter spreader bar which comprises a hook member defining a throat having a mouth between a distal end and an adjacent portion thereof. The connection point assembly further comprises a latch assembly operably coupled to the hook member at the mouth.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The latch assembly is configurable between an open position where the latch does not obstruct the mouth and a closed position wherein the latch obstructs the mouth.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Furthermore, the connection point assembly comprises a visual indicator indicative of the open position and the closed position.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The latch assembly may comprise a base rotatably engaged to a distal end of the hook member at an axis.

The base may comprise an arc aperture within which plastic pieces of different colours are inserted.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The distal end of the hook may comprise a reference point at which the radial offset of the base of the latch assembly is visually gauged to determine the latch position. In embodiments, the distal end of the hook comprises a window through which either of the first or second visual indication is visible depending on the position of the latch assembly.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">For example, when the latch is safely closed, a green visual indication may collocate with the window and wherein the latch is unsafely open, a red visual indication a collocate with the window thereby providing a visual indication of the position of the latch assembly.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The distal end of the hook member may comprise windows on either side thereof such that the visual indication is apparent from either side of the connection point assembly.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The latch assembly may comprise a biasing member (such as a coiled spring) to bias the latch assembly to a closed position. The coiled spring may be concealed between bifurcations of the latch assembly to avoid tampering.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">An edge of the base of the latch assembly may be accessible for manually opening the latch assembly. For example, an edge of the base substantially opposite the latch may comprise a tactical edge extending from between bifurcations of the distal end of the hook member such that the user may run a finger thereacross to open the latch assembly.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">As such, when compared to prior art arrangement, the present connection point assembly enhances safe operation thereof by providing a visual indication of the position of the latch assembly.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Furthermore, in the embodiment wherein the distal end of the hook comprises bifurcations between which the base of the latch assembly is rotatably engaged and comprises a concealed coiled spring therebetween, when compared to prior art arrangements, the present connection point assembly prevents tampering with the latch assembly.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Furthermore, in the embodiment wherein the distal end of the comprises bifurcations between which the base of the latch assembly is rotatably engaged and exposes a tactical edge therebetween, the latch assembly may be opened, and a sling strap removed therefrom in a one-handed operation.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to one aspect, there is provided a connection point assembly for a patient lifter spreader bar, the connection point assembly comprising a hook member defining a throat having a mouth, the mouth being formed between a distal end of the hook member and an adjacent base portion adjacent the distal end of the hook member, a latch assembly operably coupled to the hook member at the mouth, the latch assembly comprising a latch, the latch assembly configurable between an open position wherein the latch does not obstruct the mouth and a closed position wherein the latch obstructs the mouth, wherein the connection point assembly comprises a visual indicator indicative of the open position and the closed position, wherein the visual indicator comprises a first visual indication and a second radially offset visual indication and wherein the distal end of the hook member comprises a window and wherein the first visual indication is viewable through the window in the closed position and the second visual indication is viewable through the window in the open position.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The latch assembly may be rotatably engaged to the distal end of the hook member.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The latch may comprise a base from which the latch extends.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The distal end of the hook member may comprise bifurcations between which the base may be rotatably engaged by an axle pin.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The base may comprise a circular periphery.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The latch may comprise a base from which the latch extends and wherein the distal end of the hook member may comprise bifurcations between which the base may be rotatably engaged and wherein at least one of the bifurcations defines the window therethrough.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The visual indicator may be viewable from both sides of the base and wherein each bifurcation defines a respective window therethrough.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The window may comprise a notch formed through an edge of at least one of the bifurcations.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The first and second visual indication may be of different

surface.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The latch may comprise a base from which the latch extends and wherein the latch extends tangentially from the base thereby defining an outer edge and an inner edge, the outer edge being more tangential with respect to the base than the inner edge and wherein the latch assembly may be connected to the distal end of the hook member in an orientation such that the outer edge faces out from the entrance and the inner edge faces the throat member and such that the latch hits the adjacent base portion at an angle in the closed position.</p><p id="p-0041"
