They resist most of these aggressors by activating defense process (plant immunity concept). However, when this resistance is ineffective, the development of the aggressor alters the growth of the plant to the point of sometimes killing it, thus causing a significant decrease in the yield and/or quality of the crop.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Plant protection products traditionally used in crop protection against disease are problematic in terms of respect for the environment and the health of users and consumers. Measures have already been taken, as part of the Ecophyto plan, to reduce the use of these products. The development of crop protection methods that are more environmentally friendly and at lower risk for users and consumers is a major challenge. In this context, the protection of plants by biological molecules has already shown a real but limited potential for application. Some products are beginning to be registered but their effectiveness in fields is often partial.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The knowledge acquired on the innate immunity of plants has led to the use of elicitors, i.e. molecules that stimulate defenses, as a crop protection strategy against pathogens. There is a great diversity of biotic elicitors. They can be of plant, animal, fungal or bacterial origin and of various chemical nature (e.g. proteins, lipopeptides, oligosaccharides, etc.) (Ebel et Cosio, 1994) [1]. Oligosaccharide elicitors, such as &#x3b2;-glucans, chitin (or derivatives), pectins and oligogalacturonans (OG) have been particularly studied (Trouvelot et al., 2014) [2]. They differ in origin, structure and mechanism of action (Shibuya et Minami, 2001) [3]. Other polysaccharides can potentially be used as elicitors.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">For example, alginates are polymers of biological origin derived from the cell wall of brown algae (Vera et al., 2011) [4] formed by two monomers linked together: mannuronate (or mannuronic acid, M) and guluronate (or guluronic acid, G) arranged in homopolymeric block (ALG) of guluronate (G), homopolymeric block (ALM) of mannuronate (M) or heteropolymeric block (MagUg) of mannuronate (M) and guluronate (G). The chemical composition of this wall may vary according to the different species of algae, and is subject to seasonal changes. Nevertheless, by selecting raw materials, it is possible to produce a variety of alginates with constant characteristics. Another advantage of these bio-polymers is that they are nowadays widely used in the food and cosmetic industries as thickeners, gelling agents, emulsifiers and stabilizers used in the composition of various industrial products (sauces, desserts, creams, etc. . . . ). They are therefore already approved and notably for use in food and human health. Their safety for humans is therefore no longer to be demonstrated. However, their role in agronomy still requires further study.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The Patent Application FR 2 795 289 [5] relates to 1,4 &#x3b2;-D-glucuronane polymers and/or glycuronic oligosaccharides in sequence &#x3b2;(1-4) having a degree of polymerisation (DP) lower than 30 derived thereof, which might activate defense and resistance reactions in plants against biotic and abiotic stresses, because of their ability to amplify the activity of 1,3 &#x3b2;-D-glucanase and/or 1,4 &#x3b2;-D-glucanase enzymes. However even if the exemplified 1,4 &#x3b2;-D-mannuronane and 1,4 &#x3b2;-D-guluronane oligomers with an average DP of 4 derived from alginate hydrolysis are capable to amplify activity of 1,3 &#x3b2;-D-glucanase, they do not amplify activity of 1,4 &#x3b2;D-glucanase, in <i>Rubus </i>protoplasts. Furthermore, no real efficacy to protect plant against pathogenic microorganisms was demonstrated. In fact, it is well known in the art that glucanase activity is not always correlated with plant resistance against pathogens attacks (Aziz et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2005; Enkerli et al., 1993) [6-8] and can greatly vary upon stage of development or variety of a plant (Cota et al., 2007) [9].</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The international Application WO 2013/038197 [10] relates to the use of alginate oligomers to enhance the efficacy of antifungal agents, in particular in the context of medical uses. However, in this case alginate oligomers are never used alone against plant pathogens attacks but for their capacity to synergize antifungal agents when used in combination therewith.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Therefore, identifying new molecules capable of protecting cultivated plants from pathogenic microorganisms is still a major challenge in agriculture.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">To this end, the inventors characterized natural molecules derived from alginates with high phyto-protective activity under controlled conditions but that did not increase the expression of the PR2 gene encoding 1,3 &#x3b2;-D-glucanase in the vine, unlike the positive PS3 control (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). The use of these alginate oligomers in sequence &#x3b1;(1-4)Guluronane and &#x3b2;(1-4)Mannuronane having a DP greater than 30, provided protection for greenhouses or field crops (e.g. vine, <i>Vitis vinifera</i>) against cryptogamic diseases (possibly insect pests) and can thus reduce the use of phytosanitary products derived from chemical synthesis. The results of the greenhouse tests were very interesting because they showed that the alginate oligomers tested highly reduced the sporulation of <i>Plasmopara viticola </i>(agent of downy mildew) on the leaves of vine plants and provided a high phyto-protection (greater than 90%). The other results obtained in the vineyard against mildew are also very encouraging, while the formulation and use of these alginate oligomers can still be improved for example when used in combination with other molecules such as phytohormones. These alginate oligomers are therefore new biocontrol products for an organic market with high potential in sustainable/organic agriculture.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Thus the present invention relates to the use of alginate oligomers in sequence &#x3b1;(1-4)Guluronane and &#x3b2;(1-4)Mannuronane having a DP greater than 30, as an active ingredient, to enhance plant protection against pathogens.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to a particular embodiment of the present invention, the alginate oligomers may be used in combination with another molecule such as a phytohormone. For example, phytohormone can be chosen from salicylate and its derivatives, in particular methyl salicylate and methyl glucose salicylate; jasmonate and its derivatives, in particular methyl jasmonate and jasmonate isoleucine; pipecolic acid; and beta amino butyric acid.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to a particular embodiment of the present invention, the alginate oligomers are 1,4 &#x3b2;-D-mannuronane and/or 1,4 &#x3b1;-L-guluronane oligomers.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to a particular embodiment of the present invention, the pathogens are chosen from fungi, oomycetes, bacteria, virus, eventually insect pests.
