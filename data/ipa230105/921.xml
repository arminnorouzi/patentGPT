description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to methods for purifying, culturing and selecting mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) subpopulations with neonatal and/or lung quality tissue specificity for use in production of advanced therapeutic medicinal products for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first detected in Wuhan, China, from there expanding into a global pandemic affecting almost the entire world. COVID-19 is caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, which attaches to the abundant cell surface protein ACE2, which is present in significant numbers on cells in the alveoli of the lung. COVID-19 has been shown to primarily affect the lungs, leading to both acute and chronic respiratory diseases, including Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). ARDS is typically induced by either known or unknown environmental factors including viral (such as SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19) or bacterial infection that induces pulmonary tissue damage and inflammatory responses. As of yet, no drug or vaccine has been clearly shown to cure patients with COVID-19, therefore there is a need for new treatments. In particular, modulating and/or reducing the well-documented and potentially lethal &#x201c;cytokine storm&#x201d; inflammatory response in COVID-19 patients may improve patient health and survival.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Acute respiratory disorders may affect both children and adults and are particularly life threatening for elderly patients. There are also acute respiratory complications specific to premature neonates where damage from breathing in the underdeveloped lung develops into a chronic disease during childhood and adolescence. Additional respiratory disorders, such as chronic lung disorders, may be caused by long term exposure to environmental factors (pollution or smoke), such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) typically affect the elderly. Further respiratory diseases of note include interstitial pneumonia and sepsis.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Mesenchymal Stromal cells and/or Mesenchymal Stem cells have been studied for their use in the treatment of numerous inflammatory diseases due to their immune modulatory effects and positive effects in tissue remodeling and regeneration. As such, both acute and chronic forms of respiratory diseases and disorders have been considered and tested for therapeutic effect using these cells. MSC medication should be an effective means to treat these respiratory disorders and diseases by promoting a modulated immune response in the damaged tissue allowing for tissue regeneration and stabilization. As explained by Zhao et al in their article &#x201c;Transplantation of ACE2-Mesenchymal Stem Cells Improves the Outcome of Patients with COVID-19 Pneumonia,&#x201d; published in Aging and Disease March 2020, and incorporated by reference herein and attached as Appendix A, MSCs have been shown to be an effective treatment in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. However, MSCs derived from additional cell sources, such as from amniotic fluid, and selected for particular lung markers, may provide further advantages for the treatment of both acute and chronic respiratory diseases, including ARDS.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The amniotic fluid is the liquid surrounding and protecting the fetus during pregnancy. During the last trimester, the amniotic fluid is partly secreted by the fetal lung and partly by fetal urine. The amniotic fluid is ingested orally and is absorbed by the gut of the fetus and thus re-enters the fetal circulation. Full term amniotic fluid consists of water with electrolytes, but also contains proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, phospholipids, and urea. In addition to these metabolic products, amniotic fluid also contains fetal cells and other materials chafed off the skin such as hair and vemix, a greasy deposit covering the skin of a baby at birth. Tissue interfaces in contact with the amniotic fluid contribute to content of the amniotic fluid including cellular material. The lung is the largest of those surfaces, which also secrete lung surfactant into the TAF. The oral and nasal mucosa, the eye, and the urinary tract are other such surfaces with a non-keratinized epithelial interface in topological contact with the amniotic fluid.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be found in nearly all tissues and are mostly located in perivascular niches. As will be understood by one of skill in the art, mesenchymal stem cells are multipotent stromal cells capable of differentiating into numerous cell types, and also possessing anti-inflammatory, angiogenic properties for directing tissue repair processes, thereby making mesenchymal stem cells valuable for therapeutic treatments. Term amniotic fluid (TAF) collected during a caesarean section contains a number of valuable cells, including MSCs. However, extracting and growing the MSCs has not previously been performed on a large scale due to difficulties associated with sterilely collecting, handling the TAF and identifying and extracting the MSCs. Moreover, specific subpopulations of MSCs are likely to be particularly well suited to use for production of therapeutic drugs. Previously, MSCs sourced from adult bone marrow, adult adipose tissue or neonatal birth-associated tissues including placenta, umbilical cord and cord blood were extensively used to obtain MSCs. MSCs from these neonatal tissues may have additional capacities in comparison to MSCs derived from adult sources. Indeed, several studies have reported superior biological properties such as improved proliferative capacity, life span and differentiation potential of MSCs from birth-associated tissues over adult derived MSCs. For example, the journal article &#x201c;Term amniotic fluid: an unexploited reserve of mesenchymal stromal cells for reprogramming and potential cell therapy applications&#x201d; by Woods et al. and published in Stem Cell Research &#x26; Therapy explains some of the advantages of birth-associated tissues over adult derived MSCs. However, neither of these neonatal MSC sources have a corresponding tissue or organ in the adult body. Therefore, neonatal quality MSCs with adult tissue specificity would be extremely beneficial. Moreover, acquisition of fetal material may be linked to negative consequences for the infant. For example, in cord blood harvesting it has been shown that as much of the cord blood as possible should be returned to the infant for improved survival, growth and fine motor skills development. Amniotic fluid, on the other hand, is today considered medical waste that is discarded. Therefore, both the ethical and practical incentive to harvest such an untapped resource is clear. Consequently, there is a need for new methods and materials that utilize TAF-derived cells in the treatment of various respiratory disease states, such as COVID-19 induced ARDS.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Certain disclosed examples relate to devices, cells, methods, and systems for obtaining amniotic mesenchymal stem cells from amniotic fluid and cells derived thereof.

Although the term &#x2018;term amniotic fluid&#x2019; is employed here and elsewhere in the present disclosure, it is understood that methods, processes, and devices of the present disclosure may be applied to all amniotic fluids and not just term amniotic fluid. Term amniotic fluid may be amniotic fluid collected at term caesarean section deliveries using, for example, a closed catheter-based system. For the purposes of the present description, &#x2018;term amniotic fluid&#x2019; may be amniotic fluid collected at planned cesarean sections after 37 completed weeks of pregnancy or later, or at planned cesarean section close to term, for example after 36 completed weeks of pregnancy. Preferably, term amniotic fluid is taken at planned caesarean sections during week 37 of pregnancy or later.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic illustration of an apparatus <b>100</b> for filtering amniotic fluid according to one example. The amniotic fluid contains amniotic cells originating from the fetus or the amniotic sac such as Mesenchymal stem cells. The amniotic fluid also contains other materials chafed off the skin such as hair and vemix. Material other than the amniotic cells are here referred to as particulate matter and may also comprise meconium, blood clots, etc. Particulate matter may be considered as anything larger than 20 pm. For the purposes of filtering, it may be particularly advantageous to treat anything larger than 30 pm or even 50 pm as particulate matter. Optionally, anything larger than the targeted amniotic cells may be treated as particulate matter. The amniotic fluid thus generally contains a mixture of amniotic cells and particulate matter. The apparatus <b>100</b> comprises a filter <b>101</b> for filtering the particulate matter from the amniotic fluid, and a chamber <b>102</b> enclosing the filter <b>101</b>. The chamber <b>102</b> comprises a fluid inlet <b>103</b> and a fluid outlet <b>104</b>. The chamber <b>102</b> enclosing the filter <b>101</b> should be construed as the filter <b>101</b> being isolated by the chamber towards the environment surrounding the chamber <b>102</b> such that there is no fluid communication between the amniotic fluid in the chamber <b>102</b> with said environment. Fluid communication through the chamber <b>102</b> is thus controlled via the fluid inlet <b>103</b> and the fluid outlet <b>104</b> in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. The filter <b>101</b> is attached to the inside of the chamber <b>102</b> between the fluid inlet <b>103</b> and the fluid outlet <b>104</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> shows an example of a cross-section A-A as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> of a circular chamber <b>102</b> and filter <b>10</b> I. It should however be understood that the chamber <b>102</b> and filter <b>101</b> may have varying shapes for optimization to different applications. The apparatus <b>100</b> comprises an inlet connector <b>105</b> arranged to form a sealing connection between the fluid inlet <b>103</b> and an amniotic fluid sample source <b>201</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a schematic example of such source <b>201</b> of amniotic fluid. Having an inlet connector <b>105</b> connected to the fluid inlet <b>103</b> and configured to provide a sealing connection between the fluid inlet <b>103</b> directly to a source <b>201</b> of amniotic fluid provides for minimizing exposure to contaminants and an efficient aseptic handling of the amniotic fluid. This facilitates obtaining amniotic cells which allows post-filtration processing at an improved quality standard. Hence, an aseptic pharmaceutical production process is facilitated. The preparation of e.g. surfactant molecules may be facilitated. The apparatus <b>100</b> provides for improving the functioning of the amniotic stem cells, such as an improved engraftment phase following transplantation. Such improved processes are enabled by having the filter <b>101</b> enclosed in a chamber <b>102</b> and an inlet connector <b>105</b> arranged to form a sealing connection between the fluid inlet <b>103</b> of the chamber <b>102</b> and an amniotic fluid sample source <b>201</b>. The risk of exposing the amniotic stem cells to contaminants, such as bacteria and viruses, is thus reduced. Exposure to oxygen is also minimized, which provides for reducing formation of oxygen free radicals which may negatively impact the functioning of the stem cells.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows an example where the inlet connector <b>105</b> comprises a tube <b>105</b> connected to the fluid inlet <b>103</b> at a first sealing connection <b>114</b>. The inlet connector <b>105</b> may form a sealing connection with the fluid inlet <b>103</b> with a force-fitting connection, an adhesive, a clamp, or other fixation elements. In another example, such as schematically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the inlet connector <b>105</b> is a continuous extension of the fluid inlet <b>103</b>, without a separate fixation element, e.g. by being formed as a single piece by molding or other material forming techniques. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref> show a second connector <b>115</b> configured to form a sealing connection with a sample source <b>201</b>, such as a container or bag <b>201</b> containing amniotic fluid. The second connector <b>115</b> may comprise releasable force-fitting connection, a clamp, or a combination thereof, or other releasable fixation elements. The chamber <b>102</b>, filter <b>101</b>, fluid inlet <b>103</b>, fluid outlet <b>104</b>, and inlet connector <b>105</b> may be provided as a kit in a sterile packaging, e.g. as a disposable kit. Such kit, i.e. apparatus <b>100</b>, thus provides for a facilitated and improved process of filtering and obtaining amniotic stem cells. Hence, in use, the amniotic fluid passes the filter <b>101</b> when flowing from the fluid inlet <b>103</b> to the fluid outlet <b>104</b>. The particulate matter is thus deposited on the filter <b>101</b> and the amniotic fluid containing the amniotic cells flows through the fluid outlet <b>104</b>. As seen in the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, the filter <b>101</b> may be connected around its periphery <b>116</b> to the inner wall <b>113</b> of the chamber <b>102</b>. This avoids passing of amniotic fluid from the inlet <b>103</b> to the outlet <b>104</b> without being filtered. The filter <b>101</b> may be tensioned or otherwise supported so that a folding or curving of the filter <b>101</b> in the chamber <b>102</b> is avoided. This maintains a defined mesh or pore size across the area of the filter <b>101</b> and thus defined filtering characteristics. Maintaining a defined mesh or pore size also reduces the risk of clogging the filter <b>101</b>. Long-term performance may accordingly be improved.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0059">The apparatus <b>100</b> may comprise an outlet <b>5</b> connector <b>106</b> to form a sealing connection between the outlet and an amniotic cell-receiving device <b>202</b>, such as a centrifuge or other amniotic cell-processing equipment downstream of the apparatus <b>100</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a schematic example of such device <b>202</b>. This minimizes exposure to contaminants and allows efficient aseptic handling of the amniotic fluid in post-filtering processing steps. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows an example where the outlet connector <b>106</b> comprises a tube <b>106</b> connected to the fluid outlet <b>104</b> at a first sealing connection <b>117</b>. The outlet connector <b>106</b> may form a sealing connection with the fluid outlet <b>104</b> with a force-fitting connection, an adhesive, a clamp, or other fixation elements. In another example, such as schematically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the outlet connector <b>106</b> is a continuous extension of the fluid outlet <b>104</b>, without a separate fixation element, e.g. by being formed as a single piece by molding or other material forming techniques. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref> show a second connector <b>118</b> configured to form a sealing connection with an amniotic cell-processing device downstream of the apparatus <b>100</b>, such as a centrifuge <b>202</b>. The second connector <b>118</b> may comprise a force-fitting connection, a clamp, a combination thereof, or other releasable fixation elements. The connection between the second connector <b>118</b> and e.g. a centrifuge <b>202</b> may thus be repeatedly connected and disconnected, and also re-sealable to maintain a sealing connection in such procedure. The chamber <b>102</b>, filter <b>101</b>, fluid inlet <b>103</b>, fluid outlet <b>104</b>, inlet connector <b>105</b>, and outlet connector <b>106</b> may be provided as a kit in a sterile packaging, e.g. as a disposable kit. Such kit, i.e. apparatus <b>100</b>, thus provides a facilitated and improved process of filtering and processing of amniotic stem cells. The apparatus <b>100</b> may comprise a pump <b>122</b>, <b>123</b>, arranged to pressurize the amniotic fluid to flow from the fluid inlet <b>103</b> to the fluid outlet <b>104</b>. This provides for a more effective filtering of the amniotic fluid. Larger volumes may be filtered in less time.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows an example where a pump <b>122</b> is connected to the fluid outlet <b>104</b> to draw amniotic fluid through the filter <b>101</b> in the direction of the indicated arrows. The pump <b>122</b> may be arranged at the fluid inlet <b>103</b> to push the amniotic fluid through the filter <b>101</b>. The pump <b>122</b> may be a compact manually operated pump integrated with the fluid inlet <b>103</b>, fluid outlet <b>104</b>, inlet connector <b>105</b>, or outlet connector <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows another example, described in more detail below, where a pump <b>123</b> is arranged to pressurize the amniotic fluid to flow from the fluid inlet <b>103</b> to the fluid outlet <b>104</b>. The chamber <b>102</b> may comprise a conduit <b>119</b> arranged between the fluid inlet <b>103</b> and the fluid outlet <b>104</b>. The pressure in the chamber <b>102</b> may be variable in response to fluid and/or gaseous communication through the conduit <b>119</b>. The flow of amniotic fluid through the filter <b>101</b> may thus be optimized depending on the application, e.g. the flow rate through the filter <b>101</b> may be increased or decreased by varying the pressure in the chamber <b>102</b> via conduit <b>119</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows an example in which a conduit <b>119</b> is in communication with the chamber <b>102</b>. An access port <b>120</b>, such as a connector or valve element, may be actuated to allow a fluid or gas to be expelled from the chamber <b>102</b>, and/or injected into the chamber <b>102</b>, to affect the pressure therein. The conduit <b>119</b> is arranged between the fluid outlet <b>103</b> and the filter <b>101</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, but the conduit <b>119</b> may be arranged between the fluid inlet <b>103</b> and the filter <b>101</b> in another example. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> as described below shows a further example of a conduit <b>119</b> in communication with the chamber <b>102</b>. A pump <b>123</b> may be arranged in communication with the conduit <b>119</b>, as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. This facilitates optimization of the flow in the chamber <b>102</b> and the associated filtering process. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> the conduit <b>119</b> is in variable communication with an upstream cavity <b>108</b> of the chamber <b>102</b> and a downstream cavity <b>109</b> of the chamber <b>102</b>, i.e. the filter <b>101</b> may be arranged to divide the chamber <b>102</b> into an upstream cavity <b>108</b> and a downstream cavity <b>109</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> the conduit <b>119</b> is connected to both the upstream cavity <b>108</b> and the downstream cavity <b>109</b>. The pump <b>123</b> is arranged to pressurize the amniotic fluid to flow from the upstream cavity <b>108</b> to the downstream cavity <b>109</b>, or to flow from the downstream cavity <b>109</b> to the upstream cavity <b>108</b>. The latter case may be advantageous in a situation in which a momentary reversed flow is desired, e.g. to clear out clogging or occlusion of the filter <b>101</b>. In such case, valves <b>120</b>, <b>120</b>&#x2032;, <b>121</b>, <b>121</b>&#x2032;, as schematically indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> are operated to provide the desired flow directions. E.g. for a reversed flow, valves <b>120</b> and <b>121</b>&#x2032; may be open and valves <b>120</b>&#x2032; and <b>121</b> may be closed. Valves <b>121</b>, <b>121</b>&#x2032;, may be open and valves <b>120</b>, <b>120</b>&#x2032;, may be closed in a normal filtering mode. The upstream cavity <b>108</b> may be pressurized by also opening valve <b>120</b>&#x2032; in such filtering mode.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0063">The filter <b>101</b> may comprise a first filter element <b>101</b><i>a </i>and a second filter element <b>101</b><i>b </i>arranged between the first filter element <b>101</b><i>a </i>and the fluid outlet <b>104</b>, as schematically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. The second filter element <b>101</b><i>b </i>may have a mesh or pore size which is smaller than a mesh or pore size of the first filter element <b>101</b><i>a</i>. This allows effective filtering of particulate matter of gradually smaller dimensions. The risk of filter occlusion is thus reduced. This allows for a more reliable and robust filtering process of the amniotic fluid. An improved filtering of amniotic fluid containing a greater range in the size of particulate matter is also provided. Further, a larger fraction of the stem cells in the amniotic fluid may be obtained since the stem cells are not lost in clogged pores. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> two filter elements <b>101</b><i>a</i>, <b>101</b><i>b</i>, it should be understood that any plurality of filter elements may be arranged in sequence in the chamber <b>102</b>, with gradually decreasing mesh or pore size, in the direction of fluid flow from the fluid inlet <b>103</b> to the fluid outlet <b>104</b>, for an effective filtering of particulate matter of gradually decreasing dimensions. The first and second filter elements <b>101</b><i>a</i>, <b>101</b><i>b</i>, may be separated by a distance (d) along a direction amniotic fluid flow from the fluid inlet <b>103</b> to the fluid outlet <b>104</b>, as schematically indicted in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. The motion of the amniotic fluid between the first and second filter elements tola, <b>101</b><i>b</i>, which in some case may involve turbid flow, may provide for further reducing the risk of unwanted build-up of particles on the first and second filter elements <b>101</b><i>a</i>, <b>101</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0059" num="0064">The filter <b>101</b> may comprise a mesh having a mesh size in the range of 20-2000 pm. In another example, the filter <b>101</b> comprises a mesh having a mesh size in the range of 100-500 pm. This allows particularly effective filtration of particulate matter from the amniotic fluid. Turning again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the first filter element <b>101</b> a may comprise a mesh having a mesh size in the range of 500-1000 pm, and the second filter element <b>101</b><i>b </i>may comprise a mesh having a mesh size in the range of 30-150 pm. The first filter element <b>101</b><i>a </i>may thus remove larger debris, followed by removal of smaller particles with the second filter element <b>101</b><i>b</i>. This allows a particularly effective filtering of particulate matter of varying size and reliable filtering of increased volumes over longer time periods since the risk of clogging is further minimized. As previously mentioned, any plurality of filter elements may be arranged in succession in the chamber <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows three filter elements <b>101</b><i>a</i>, <b>101</b><i>b</i>, <b>101</b><i>c</i>, arranged in the chamber <b>102</b>.

The smallest mesh or pore size in such an example may be approximately 30 pm. The filter <b>101</b> may comprise a mesh such as a nylon mesh. The filter <b>101</b> may comprise a porous material having a variable pore size through the filter <b>101</b> in the direction of flow of the amniotic fluid from the fluid inlet <b>103</b> to the fluid outlet <b>104</b>. I.e. larger debris is removed at the surface of the filter <b>101</b> closest to the inlet <b>103</b> whereas particles of smaller size are removed deeper into the filter, as the amniotic fluid flows through the filter <b>101</b> in a direction towards the outlet <b>104</b> and the size of the pores get smaller. As previously mentioned, the chamber <b>102</b> may comprise an upstream cavity <b>108</b> and a downstream cavity <b>109</b>. The upstream and downstream cavities <b>108</b>, <b>109</b>, may be formed as an integrated piece to form the chamber <b>102</b>, e.g. in a molding process or by other material forming techniques. The upstream and downstream cavities <b>108</b>, <b>109</b>, may be formed as separate units which are then connected to each other to form a sealing connection, e.g. by an adhesive or by welding. The filter <b>101</b> may be attached simultaneously or subsequently with such welding process or by the aforementioned adhesive.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0066">The upstream and downstream cavities <b>108</b>, <b>109</b>, may be releasably connectable to each other at a connecting element <b>110</b>, to form a sealing connection, as schematically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. This allows opening of the chamber <b>102</b>, e.g. for replacing the filter <b>101</b>. The filter <b>101</b> may thus be releasably connectable to the chamber <b>102</b>, e.g. filter elements <b>101</b><i>a</i>, <b>101</b><i>b</i>, <b>101</b><i>c</i>, may be releasably connectable to the chamber <b>102</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. This allows facilitated customization to different applications since filter elements <b>101</b><i>a</i>, <b>101</b><i>b</i>, <b>101</b><i>c</i>, of different pore or mesh size, or different number of such filter elements may be mounted in the chamber <b>102</b>. The connecting element <b>110</b> is configured to form a sealing connection upstream and downstream cavities <b>108</b>, <b>109</b>, and may comprise an annular gasket extending around the periphery of the upstream and downstream cavities <b>108</b>, <b>109</b>. The filter <b>101</b> may comprise a cartridge of different numbers of filter elements <b>101</b><i>a</i>, <b>101</b><i>b</i>, <b>101</b><i>c</i>, with different pore sizes that could be tailored to the particular amniotic fluid sample. For example, evaluation of the amniotic fluid turbidity and degree of milkiness (level of vemix both in particle size and opaqueness) could be an indicator of the appropriate filter cartridge to use. An accompanying chart for which to compare the amniotic fluid sample with could indicate which filter cartridge to use. The upstream cavity <b>108</b> and/or the downstream cavity <b>109</b> may be funnel shaped. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>9</b></figref> show examples where both the upstream and downstream cavities <b>108</b>, <b>109</b>, are funnel shaped. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> shows an example where only the downstream cavity <b>109</b> is funnel shaped. Having a funnel shape may be advantageous for directing the flow of amniotic fluid along a desired vector of symmetry through the filter <b>101</b> and apparatus <b>100</b>. The upstream cavity <b>108</b> and/or the downstream cavity <b>109</b> may comprise a chamber wall <b>111</b><i>a</i>, <b>111</b><i>b </i>being arranged essentially in parallel with the filter <b>101</b>, i.e. perpendicular to the direction of flow of the amniotic fluid from the fluid inlet <b>103</b> to the fluid outlet <b>104</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> shows an example where chamber walls <b>111</b><i>a</i>, <b>111</b><i>b</i>, of the upstream and downstream cavities <b>108</b>, <b>109</b> are arranged essentially in parallel with the filter <b>101</b>. This minimizes the space inside the chamber <b>102</b>, while maintaining adequate filter area, to minimize the risk of introducing e.g. air that may disturb surfactant molecules, reduce the risk of infection, and reduce detrimental formation of reactive oxygen species in the amniotic cells. The chamber <b>102</b>, and/or the inlet connector <b>105</b>, and/or the outlet connector <b>106</b> may be formed from a phthalate free PVC material.

The filter may be made from any synthetic material including but not limited to cellulose acetate, cellulose nitrate (collodion), polyamide (nylon), polycarbonate, polypropylene and polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon). In one embodiment removing particulate material is done by applying apparatus <b>100</b>.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">Adherence Selection</heading><p id="p-0065" num="0070">Various terms known to one skilled in the art have been and will be used throughout the specification, for example, the terms &#x201c;express, expression, and/or expressing&#x201d; in the context of a cell surface marker are meant to indicate the presence of a particular marker on the surface of a cell, said surface marker having been produced by the cell. Surface marker expression may be used to select between different cell populations, for example, positively selecting for surface marker expression indicates the selection of a cell population that more strongly expresses a particular surface marker as compared to another cell population. Conversely, negatively selecting for cell surface marker expression indicates the selection of a cell population that more weakly expresses a particular surface marker as compared to another cell population.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0071">As explained above and elsewhere in the specifications, TAF contains various progenitor cell types. In certain examples, particular progenitor cell types may be isolated and propagated via adherence selection. For example, a vitronectin substrate, Synthemax (Merck, CORNING&#xae;, Synthemax&#xae;, II-SC SUBSTRATE, CLS3535-IEA) may be used as a coating to create a more in vivo-like environment for stem cell culture, thereby limiting maturation of the TAP-derived progenitor cells and maintaining plasticity. Synthemax is an animal-component free, synthetic, flexible vitronectin-based peptide substrate for serum or serum-free expansion of human progenitor/stem cells and other adult stem cell types. One of skill in the art will understand that the vitronectin-based peptide substrate may include a portion of a vitronectin protein, such as a particular peptide sequence of vitronectin. Alternatively, intact vitronectin protein may be used. Synthemax vitronectin substrate offers a synthetic, xeno-free alternative to biological coatings and/or feeder cell layers commonly used in cell culture and known in the art. Briefly, standard tissue-culture treated flasks may be coated with about 0.2 mL Synthemax/cm<sup>2 </sup>at 10 &#x3bc;g/mL giving a surface density of 2 pg/cm<sup>2</sup>, and incubated at 37&#xb0; C. for about 1 h, 0.5 h 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, or more than 8 h or at room temperature for about 2 h, 1 h, 4 h, 8 h or more than 8 h with surplus solution optionally being removed and replaced. In certain examples, Synthemax may be coated at a surface density of about: 1 to 5 pg/cm<sup>2</sup>, such as 2 pg/cm<sup>2, 0.1 </sup>to 10 pg/cm<sup>2, 0.5 </sup>to 4 pg/cm<sup>2, 1 </sup>to 3 pg/cm<sup>2</sup>, or about 1.5 to 2.5 pg/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0072">In other embodiments, adherence selection can be performed using a surface coated with, for example, Collagen, Fibronectin. Alternatively, adherence selection can be performed using an uncoated surface comprising a tissue-culture treated plastic. Cells purified from TAF fluid may be gently re-suspended in prewarmed xeno-free cell culture media, with the cell suspension is then added to the Synthemax-coated flasks. Media may be changed at various times after addition to the flasks, for example, after about: 2 h to 168 h, 12 h to 96 h, 24 h to 72 h, 36 h to 60 h, 42 h to 56 h, or 48 h, and then subsequently changed about: every day, every other day, every third day, every fifth day, once a week, once every two weeks or about less than once every two weeks. Through repeated removal of spent mediwn, the non-attached cells may be removed, thereby selecting the MSCs by their affinity for attachment to the Synthemax-treated surface. The cells may be cultured for a period of time, such as about, for example, 4 d, 7 d, 10 d, lid, 12 d, 13 d, 14 d, 18 d, 21 d, 28 d or longer than 21 d. Optionally, in some examples, the cells may be cultured under hypoxic conditions, hypoxia priming may alter cell metabolism during expansion, increase resistance to oxidative stress, and thereby improve the engraftment, survival in ischemic microenvironments, and angiogenic potential of transplanted MSCs. After culturing, the PO colonies (Colony forming Units&#x2014;CFUs) that have formed may be dissociated and pooled. After pooling, the remaining cells may be predominantly non-tissue specific MSCs. In certain examples, the pooled PO cells may be gently re-suspended in pre-warmed xeno-free cell culture media and re-plated on tissue-culture treated flasks without Synthemax for passaging. The pooled cells may be seeded at a seeding density of from between about: 100 to 10000 cells/cm<sup>2, 500 </sup>to 8000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>, 1000 to 5000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>, or about 2000 to 4000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>. The media may be changed about every 1 d, 2 d, 4 d, or more than four days. After a period of time, such as about 2 d, 4 d, 7 d, or more than 7 d, the cells may be dissociated and harvested. Further selective MSC isolation may be achieved as described below.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">Identification of Markers</heading><p id="p-0068" num="0073">When comparing the genetic expression profiles of TAF-MSCs and adult-type MSCs derived from adipose tissue or bone marrow by RNAseq, TAF-MSCs tend to express more of some genes present in adult-type MSCs and less of others. Identification of both positive and negative TAF-MSC specific neonatal cell-surface markers can allow for sorting of the MSCs with neonatal quality from those that have differentiated further and are of less importance as progenitor cells using e.g. ligands such as antibodies and aptamers or other selection techniques.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0074">The cell surface markers distinguishing tissue relevant cells from other MSCs may be elucidated via a bioinformatics process utilizing a tissue-specificity score algorithm. An example of an MSC tissue-specificity score algorithm is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>. Tissue-specificity may be measured as a combination of two components: a &#x2018;tissue transcriptional similarity&#x2019; also known as a similarity score and a &#x201c;tissue-specific gene expression program&#x201d; also known as a gene set score. In certain examples, the similarity score may be an Average Spearman correlation to each MSC tissue reference sample (for example a fetal lung MSC sample). In examples, the gene set score may be the average expression of genes in a tissue-specific gene set. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, in certain examples, after normalizing the similarity and gene set scores using a Z-transform to convert the input values, which is a sequence of real or complex numbers, into a complex frequency-domain representation, then combining them assigning equal weight to each score and transforming combined values using a Z-transform, the resulting output is an MSC tissue specificity score. The MSC tissue-specificity score measures the relative tissue-specificity among the input samples by measuring how many standard deviations a sample is more or less specific to a given tissue compared to the average input sample. For example, an MSC tissue-specificity score may indicate how much more a clone sample appears to have a tissue specific phenotype, such as a lung phenotype, as compared to an average clone. Such an approach allows for identification of the top X% percentile scores using a normal distribution function, effectively the top X% of clones that are most tissue-specific to the relevant tissue.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0075">In one example, for a given tissue, tissue-prioritized clones can be defined as any clone belonging to the top X% percentile score, where X is any percentage within a range having a lower end from about 0.1 to 25, such as about 1, 5, 10, 15 and 20, and an upper end from about 30 to 75, such as about: 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65 or 70. An example of TAF-MSC tissue-specificity prioritization results is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, in which thresholds at 15% and 5% are visible. Having prioritized tissue-specific clones, candidate surface marker genes may then be identified. For each tissue, two groups may be defined: tissue-prioritized and tissue-distal. A suitable analysis program may be used to make this determination, for example DEseq2 from Bioconductor.org. The tissue-prioritized group may include clones with a score in the top 15% percentile. The tissue-distal group may include clones in the bottom Y% percentile in which Y is any percentage within the range having a lower end from about 25 to 70, such as about: 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60 or 65 and an upper end from 75 to 99.9, such as about: 80, 85, 90, 95 or 99. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> shows an example of such analysis on kidney tissue. Next, differentially expressed genes between the tissue-prioritized and tissue-distal groups may be identified. Finally, the differential expression results may be annotated with surface marker gene information.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0076">In certain examples, to identify tissue-specific cell surface markers, surface marker genes with a more than a Z-fold increase, where Z is at least about: 1.5-fold, 2-fold, 2.5-fold, 3-fold, 3.5-fold, 4-fold, 5-fold, 8-fold, 10-fold, 12-fold, 15-fold or even more-fold increase in expression (log2FoldChange) in prioritized clones compared to an average clone and a Transcripts Per Kilobase Million (TPM) of more than about 500, such as more than about: 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, 3000, 5000 or even higher may be selected to give the top tissue-specific marker candidates, such as approximately the top: 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 100 or more, for example such as those shown below in Tables 3-6 and further described in more detail below. Suitable log2FoldChange and TPM values may vary even further depending on tissue type specificities depending on the abundance/absence of good markers.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0077">Applying the tissue specificity algorithms described above to identify surface markers, after adhesion selection and passaging, the TAF-MSCs cells may express various identified surface markers as shown below in Table 1, indicative of non-tissue specific TAF MSCs. One of skill in the art will understand that such surface markers may be present at various surface densities and may be upregulated or downregulated in comparison to other cell types. Therefore, such surface markers may be used to identify and isolate particular cell types. In some instances, the surface markers listed in Table 1 below may be at least 8-fold more highly expressed for TAF MSCs on average compared to other MSC cell types, particularly as compared to adult MSCs derived from bone marrow or adipose tissue. The thresholds used to generate Table 1 are as follows: X was selected as 15%, Y was selected as 50%, Z was selected as 8-fold and a TPM of more 3000 was selected. One of skill in the art will understand that the numbering used in Table 1 and all tables herein is merely used to indicate a total number of identified markers and not to indicate that one particular

suitable combinations of the markers listed in Table 1 may be used to separate TAF-MSCs from adult MSCs by selecting for specific markers from Table 1 or combinations of two, three, four, five, six or more markers from Table 1. In certain examples, TAF MSCs can be more specifically identified by identifying a combination of stronger expression, such as 8-fold or more stronger expression of any combination of the foregoing markers, e.g., TBC1D3K and/or AIF1L and/or CDHR1 and/or NKAIN4 and/or ABCB1 and/or PLVAP as compared to adult MSCs.

Hence, a marker-based selection may be needed. One example of marker-based selection is via the use of Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) may be used to purify the cell population of TAF-MSCs, FACS allows for a very high purity of the desired cell population, even when the target cell type expresses very low levels of identifying markers and/or separation is needed based on differences in marker density. FACS allows the purification of individual cells based on size, granularity and fluorescence. As will be understood by one of skill in the art, FACS may be used to select for certain cell populations that express one cell surface marker more than another cell population and vice-versa. In some examples of methods of purification, bulk methods of purification such as panning, complement depletion and magnetic bead separation, may be used in combination with FACS or as an alternative to FACS. In brief, to purify cells of interest via FACS, they are first stained with fluorescently-tagged monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), which recognize specific surface markers on the desired cell population. Negative selection of unstained cells may also allow for separation. For GMP production of cells according to some examples, FACS may be run using a closed system sorting technology such as MACSQuant&#xae; Tyto&#xae;. Samples may be kept contamination-free within the disposable, fully closed MACSQuant Tyto Cartridge. Further, filtered air may drive cells through a microchannel into the microchip at very low pressure (&#x3c;3 PSI). However, before entering the microchannel, potential cell aggregates may be held back by a filter system guaranteeing a smooth sorting process. The fluorescence detection system may detect cells of interest based on predetermined fluorescent parameters of the cells. Based on their fluorescent and scatter light signatures, target cells may be redirected by a sort valve located within the microchannel. For certain examples of methods of purification, the success of staining and thereby sorting may depend largely on the selection of the identifying markers and the choice of mAb. Sorting parameters may be adjusted depending on the requirement of purity and yield. Unlike on conventional droplet sorters, cells sorted by the MACSQuant Tyto may not experience high pressure or charge, and may not get decompressed. Therefore, such a gentle sorting approach may result in high viability and functionality of cells. Alternatively, other marker-based selection techniques may be known to the skilled person and employed here. These include, but are not limited to, Magnetic-activated cell sorting, Microfluidic based sorting, Buoyancy activated cell sorting, mass cytometry etc.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="2">Lung TAF Cell Markers</heading><p id="p-0079" num="0082">As explained above, analysis of RNAseq data from TAF-MSC clones, adult and neonatal MSC reference material as well as fetal fibroblasts and publicly available expression datasets may be used to identify and characterize TAF-MSC cells. For example, sub-populations of TAF-MSCs may be established by clustering their expression data (RNAseq) with neonatal reference samples. Such sub-populations include, but are not limited to, lung MSC, urinary tract MSC (described also as kidney MSCs in the present disclosure), and skin MSC. Gene lists of highly and lowly expressed genes for each cluster of expression data may allow for identification of surface maker genes for each cluster. Using such data comparison, sub-populations of TAF cells were compared to adult MSC cells based on their gene expressions (RNAseq) resulting in a list of neonatal-specific surface marker genes for each cluster. A number of surface markers of interest associated with lung TAF cells were identified. For example, a non-exclusive list of preferred surface markers used to identify and separate lung TAF cells are provided below. Moreover, as the number of different MSC-subtypes in TAF is limited, the selection of the tissue specific MSC may be done by firstly characterization, thereafter a stepwise negative selection/sorting of the material by taking into account the combined (multivariate) surface marker profile of the different tissue specific MSC's. One of skill in the art will understand that any such combination of these surface markers may be used for identifying and isolation of lung TAF cells from the general population of TAF-derived cells and/or TAF-MSC cells. In some examples, the below non-exclusive list of surface markers may be more highly expressed on the surface of Lung-TAF cells as compared to other cell types, such as other TAF-derived cells and/or TAF-MSC cells.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0083">As explained above, bioinformatics techniques may be used to identify tissue-specific surface markers, therefore, the surface markers identified in Table 3 may have at least a 10-fold increase in expression on prioritized clones compared to the average TAF-MSC clone (optionally with TPM threshold &#x3e;2000).</p><p id="p-0081" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00003" num="00003"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="left"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 3</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>1.

As described elsewhere herein, Lung TAF MSCs may be suitable for the treatment of a variety of acute and/or chronic respiratory diseases. Additionally, Lung TAF MSCs and TAF MSCs generally are also known to be smaller than conventional MSCs, thereby making them more suitable for intravenous dosed treatments. &#x201c;Morphology and size of stem cells from mouse and whale: observational study&#x201d; by Hoogdujin et al. and &#x201c;The size of mesenchymal stem cells is a significant cause of vascular obstructions and stroke.&#x201d; by Ge et al. provide further details regarding the relative size of MSCs and their potential reduced role in vascular obstructions or stroke.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0090">For example, Lung TAF MSCs may have an anti-inflammatory effect on other cell types, such as cells found within various organs and tissues such as the lung. Therefore, incorporation of Lung TAF MSCs within the lung of a patient suffering from an acute and/or chronic respiratory disease may reduce inflammation. Lung TAF MSCs may be particularly beneficial to patients suffering from ARDS caused by COVID-19 because the Lung TAF MSCs may reduce the magnitude of the dangerous &#x201c;cytokine storm&#x201d; induced in COVID-19 patients. Additionally, in some examples, Lung TAF MSCs express lower levels of the ACE/ACE2 receptor as compared to adult bone marrow and adipose MSCs, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 may be less likely to infect Lung TAF MSCs as compared to other MSCs. Further, TAF MSCs (including lung TAF MSCs) have been shown to reduce cytokine responses such as IL-6, IL-18 and TNF-a etc., as well as generally lower the activation and proliferation of lymphocytes (T-cell, macrophages etc) and increase levels of several growth factors.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0091">FIGS. 17A-17D show an example of the results from a proof-of-principle study on the potential use of Lung TAF MSCs for treatment, performed using neonatally sorted TAF MSCs expressing MSC lung cell surface markers including CD248, DDR1, and LRRC38 (called &#x201c;LBX-THX-001 cells&#x201d;). The purpose of the study was to investigate the effects of LBX-THX-001 cells in a bleomycin induced lung fibrosis model in male rats. Two cell concentrations (2 M cell/kg and 5 M cells/kg) and two types of vehicles for the cells were tested (PBS and CryoStor CS-10).</p><p id="p-0090" num="0092">The development of fibrosis in rat lung after exposure to bleomycin is well documented in the literature and a frequently used model for studying the pathology of lung fibrosis and also the effect of different treatments. The number of LBX-THX-001 cells injected were chosen to be relevant for a possible human therapy. The number of cells were therefore chosen to reflect cell numbers used in previous studies on rats (8-20 M cells/kg) and humans (0.5-2 M cells/kg).</p><p id="p-0091" num="0093">An intra-tracheal instillation of bleomycin (1000 U/rat) to 34 male SD-rats was used to induce lung fibrosis in the rats. During the first week, the rats were monitored and weighed daily and thereafter twice/week until termination of the study. At day 4 post bleomycin challenge, the LBX-THX-001 cells were administered by an intra-venous (i.v.) injection. The injection volume was 194-535 &#x3bc;L (maximal tolerated injection volume 1 mL/kg). The response to the intra-tracheal instillation of bleomycin was as expected based on previous experience for the model with weight loss during the first days after instillation and thereafter recovery. There were no significant differences in weight loss between the bleomycin group and the treatment groups.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0094">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>A-D</figref>, bleomycin instillation induced fibrotic change in the lung. The histopathological evaluation concluded pathological changes in the bleomycin group both with regard to percent of parenchyma affected and after scoring using the modified Ashcroft scale. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>A-D</figref>, the group treated with LBX-THX-001 cells (2 million cells/kg) 4 days post Bleomycin showed significantly less fibrosis in their lungs compared to the bleomycin group. This was seen both in the histopathological evaluation using the read-out &#x201c;percent parenchyma affected&#x201d; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>A-B</figref>) and the fibrosis scoring Ashcroft modified scale (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>A-D</figref>). No human MSCs could be detected in rat lungs at termination (after 28 days). The results of this proof-of-principle study demonstrate that treatment via lung TAF MSCs improved lung recovery outcomes, therefore such cells may be highly relevant for respiratory disease such as SARS and COVID-19 induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), interstitial pneumonia, and sepsis.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> depicts a method <b>500</b> for the treatment of patients with ARDS (such as caused by COVID-19) or any other suitable acute or chronic respiratory disease.

MSCs (such as Lung TAF MSCs) are well known to home to the appropriate organ and/or tissue, therefore after administration the Lung TAF MSCs will home to the lung. For the intravenous drip, the Lung TAF MSCs may be suspended in any suitable fluid, such as normal saline, for example about 25 ml, 50 ml, 100 ml, 150 ml, 200 ml, 250 ml, or 300 ml of saline. The total number of cells to be administered may range from about 500,000 to 8,000,000 cells per kg (kg of patient), about 1,000,000 to 6,000,000 cells per kg, or about 2,000,000 to 4,000,000. In certain examples, 1,000,000 cells per kg patient may be administered. The window period for Lung TAF MSCs transplantation may be any suitable time, for example after diagnosis, before diagnosis if risk factors indicate a benefit for treatment, and/or once symptoms are worsening even while undergoing other treatment. Administration of the cells may be performed over the course of approximately about 10-60 minutes, such as about 20-50 minutes, about 30-40 minutes or about 40 minutes. The speed of administration may be about 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, or more drops per minute. Administration of the cells may involve multiple treatments, such as 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 or 10 or more injections over a suitable time frame such as over the course of 8 hours, 24 hours, 2 days, 4 days, 7 day, 14 days or more than 14 days. Once the Lung TAF MSCs have been administered intravenously (or via any suitable method), the Lung TAF MSCs home to the lungs of the patient as explained in &#x201c;Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Based Therapy of Inflammatory Lung Diseases: Current Understanding and Future Perspectives&#x201d; by Harrell et al. In some examples, once the Lung TAF MSCs are introduced to the lung, the Lung TAF MSCs may reduce inflammation <b>514</b> in the lung and aid in repairing damaged tissue.
