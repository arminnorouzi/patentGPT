Therefore, 802.11ax standard workers extend a working range of 802.11ax devices from 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz to 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz in the 802.11ax project authorization requests (PAR).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the next-generation Wi-Fi extremely high throughput (EHT) protocol of IEEE 802.11ax, in addition to using a continuous ultra-large bandwidth of the new frequency band of 6 GHz, discontinuous multi-links may also be aggregated by using a multi-link cooperation technology to form an ultra-large bandwidth. Correspondingly, a multi-link device (MLD) appears, and frequency bands on which the multi-link device operates are all or a part of sub 1 GHz, 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, 6 GHz, and a high frequency of 60 GHz.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For various reasons, channel state information on some links of the multi-link device is lacked. After a station (STA) or an access point (AP) on a link on which channel state information is lacked changes from a sleep state to an awake state, the station or the AP needs to wait for a NAVSyncDelay time period before the station or the AP preempts a channel. Alternatively, a STA or an AP that changes from a sleep state to an awake state needs to receive a data packet including NAV information, and waits for expiration of the NAV information before the STA or the AP starts to preempt a channel. In this way, a delay in sending data by the STA or the AP is relatively large, and power consumption of the STA or the AP is wasted.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Embodiments of this application provide a multi-link communication method and an apparatus.

STA MLD in an Energy Saving Mode</p><p id="p-0037" num="0035">One or more STAs in a STA MLD may be in an energy saving mode, and STAs operating on different links in the STA MLD cannot always listen to a channel state information. Consequently, a STA that does not listen to a channel state information loses channel state information of a link of the STA. When the STA changes from a sleep state to an awake state, the STA needs to wait for a NAVSyncDelay time period before the STA starts to preempt a channel, or the STA receives a frame that can set an NAV for the STA, and can preempt a channel only after the NAV expires.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0036">The embodiments of this application provide multi-link communication methods 1.1 and 1.2. A STA in the STA MLD sends an information frame on a link corresponding to the station, and the information frame is used to indicate a STA in the awake state in the STA MLD. An AP MLD receives the information frame, and sends a downlink message frame on one or more links corresponding to a part of or all of STAs in the awake state in the STA MLD, to assist the part of or all of the stations in fast accessing a channel without waiting for the NAVSyncDelay time period, or receiving the frame that can set the NAV for the part or all of the stations. In this way, time efficiency of accessing the channel by the awake STA is improved, and power consumption of the awake STA is reduced.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0037">1.1. A multi-link communication method, including the following steps.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0038">S<b>110</b>: A station in a station multi-link device sends an information frame on a link corresponding to the station, where the information frame is used to indicate one or more stations in an awake state in the station multi-link device.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0039">In step S<b>110</b>, the station in the awake state in the station multi-link device includes a station that changes from a sleep state to the awake state.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0040">In step S<b>110</b>, the information frame carries an association identifier (association identifier, AID) of the station in the awake state, or the information frame carries a link identifier bitmap corresponding to the station in the awake state, or the information frame carries a link identifier corresponding to the station in the awake state, to indicate the station in the awake state in the station multi-link device. Each bit of the link identifier bitmap corresponds to a link or a station on a link. If the bit is set to a first value, for example, 1, it indicates that a station on a corresponding link is awake. If the bit is set to a second value, for example, 0, it indicates that a station on a corresponding link is not awake. The link identifier may be an identification number, an operation set and a channel number, a MAC address of a station, or a combination thereof. The link identifier is formed as follows. For example, when a AP multi-link device establishes a BSS, a management frame, for example, a beacon frame, sent by the AP multi-link device carries an element, including a plurality of link identification information fields, and each link identification information field includes a link identifier and one or more of a MAC address, an operation set, and a channel number. Alternatively, in a multi-link establishment process, a AP multi-link device and the station multi-link device negotiate a plurality of link identification information fields. In subsequent communication, the AP multi-link device or the station multi-link device uses the link identifier, including one or more attributes of the MAC address of the station, the working operation set, and the channel number, to represent a station or a logical station in the multi-link device. The MAC address may also be replaced with an association identifier of the AP multi-link device associated with the station.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0041">The information frame may be a PS-Poll frame or a QoS null data frame. For example, in an APSD (automatic power save delivery) energy saving mechanism including unscheduled APSD and scheduled APSD, the information frame may further carry the link identification bitmap in a trigger frame (which is the QoS null data frame in the mechanism), to indicate one or more stations in the awake state in the station multi-link device.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0042">In step S<b>110</b>, optionally, the information frame does not indicate whether the station in the awake state has an uplink service or a downlink service.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0043">In step S<b>110</b>, optionally, the information frame can further carry an uplink/downlink indication field, and the uplink/downlink indication field is used to indicate whether the station in the awake state has the uplink service or the downlink service. For example, the information frame indicates that a STA 2 and a STA 3 in the STA MLD are in the awake state, and the information frame may further carry an uplink/downlink indication field corresponding to the STA 2. The uplink/downlink indication field may be 1 bit. If the uplink/downlink indication field corresponding to the STA 2 is set to a first value, for example, 1, it indicates that the STA 2 has an uplink service to be sent; if the uplink/downlink indication field corresponding to the STA 2 is set to a second value, for example, 0, it indicates that the STA 2 has a downlink service to be received; if the STA 2 has both an uplink service and a downlink service, the uplink/downlink indication field is preferably set to a second value, or certainly may be set to a first value. The uplink/downlink indication field may alternatively be 2 bits. In addition to the foregoing first two cases, a third value may be added. If the uplink/downlink indication field corresponding to the STA 2 is set to the third value, it indicates that the STA 2 has both a downlink service to be received and an uplink service to be sent.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0044">S<b>111</b>: A part of or all of stations in the awake state in the station multi-link device receive, on one or more links corresponding to the part of or all of the stations, a downlink message frame sent by an access point multi-link device.

Method 2: The information frame in S<b>110</b> further carries the uplink/downlink indication field.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0047">In step S<b>111</b>, if the uplink/downlink indication field indicates that the one or more stations have a downlink service, the access point multi-link device sends the downlink service on a corresponding link; if the uplink/downlink indication field indicates that the one or more stations have an uplink service, the access point multi-link device sends a synchronization frame on a link corresponding to the one or more stations; if the uplink/downlink indication field indicates that the one or more stations have both an uplink service and a downlink service, the access point multi-link device first sends the downlink service on a corresponding link, or the access point multi-link device first sends a synchronization frame on a corresponding link, to assist the one or more stations in sending the uplink service on the corresponding link.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0048">In step S<b>111</b>, the synchronization frame is used to assist the station in the awake state in sending the uplink service. A method for sending a synchronization frame complies with an existing sending mechanism, for example, an EDCA channel preemption mechanism. For example, a trigger frame in 802.11ax is used to directly schedule the station in the awake state to send the uplink service. For another example, a data frame (including a QoS null frame), a CTS (clear to send) frame, a CTS to self frame, an RTS (Request to Send) frame, a CF-End frame, or the like is used, where value of duration field of the QoS null frame, the CTS frame, and the CTS to self frame are set to 0, and a duration field length of the RTS frame is equal to a sum of transmission time periods of an SIFS and a CTS frame. For example, a STA in the STA MLD notifies the AP MLD that the STA 2 in the STA MLD changes from the sleep state to the awake state, and an AP 2 in the AP MLD sends a synchronization frame on a link 2, where the synchronization frame is a trigger frame, and is used to directly schedule the STA 2 to send the uplink service, the scheduling may be single-user uplink transmission scheduling, or multi-user uplink transmission scheduling, for example, OFDMA and MU-MIMO, where a multi-user object includes the STA 2. After an SIFS time interval, the STA 2 in the STA MLD sends the uplink service on a frequency resource indicated by the trigger frame. For another example, a STA in the STA MLD notifies the AP MLD that the STA 2 in the STA MLD is in the awake state, and an AP 2 in the AP MLD sends a synchronization frame to the STA 2 on a link 2, where the synchronization frame is the RTS frame. The STA 2 in the STA MLD replies the CTS frame after an SIFS interval, and then sends the uplink service. For another example, a STA in the STA MLD notifies the AP MLD that the STA 2 in the STA MLD is in the awake state, and an AP 2 in the AP MLD sends a synchronization frame to the STA 2 on a link 2, where the synchronization frame is the CF-End frame. After receiving the CF-End frame, the STA 2 in the STA MLD obtains a channel transmission opportunity through channel contention, and then sends the uplink service.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0049">It should be noted that before the AP MLD sends the synchronization frame on a link on which the awake station works, if the AP MLD detects that a channel is busy and a busy time period exceeds a NAVSyncDelay, the AP MLD does not need to send the synchronization frame. Specifically, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the channel busy time period refers to a time period from a time point when the AP MLD receives a PS-Poll frame or another frame with the same function sent by a STA 1 to a time point when the AP MLD obtains a chance for sending the synchronization frame. Alternatively, the channel busy time period refers to a time period from a time point when the AP MLD sends a response acknowledgment frame to a time point when the AP MLD obtains a chance for sending the synchronization frame, where the response acknowledgment frame is of the AP MLD to a received PS-Poll frame or another received frame with the same function.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0050">Alternatively, the channel busy time period refers to a time period from a time point when the AP MLD sends a response acknowledgment frame to a time point when the AP MLD obtains a transmission opportunity of the link 2 after the AP MLD detects that the link 2 is idle.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0051">It should be understood that, after receiving the information frame, the access point multi-link device may send the downlink service on the corresponding link, or may send the synchronization frame on the one or more links corresponding to the part of or all of the stations. The access point multi-link device may send a downlink service frame/the downlink management frame and send the synchronization frame in two separate procedures or in two parts of one procedure.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is used as an example. After the AP MLD receives the information frame PS-Poll frame on a link 1, where the information frame PS-Poll indicates that the STA 2 in the STA MLD is in the awake state, for example, indicates that the STA 2 changes from the sleep state to the awake state, if the AP 2 in the AP MLD has a downlink service for the STA 2, the AP 2 in the AP MLD sends the downlink service to the STA 2 on the link 2.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is used as an example.

Consequently, the channel state information (for example, NAV information) on a link corresponding to the another STA is lost.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0063">When congestion occurs when the STA MLD sends data on a transmit link, the STA MLD needs to switch to another station to send data on a link of the another station. In this case, the another station does not know channel state information of the link. Consequently, the another station needs to wait for a NAVSyncDelay time period before starting to preempt a channel; or receives a frame that can set a NAV for the another station, and waits for ending of the NAV before starting to preempt a channel. This causes a relatively large delay in sending data by the STA that loses the channel state information, and power consumption of the STA is wasted.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0064">The MLD that does not support simultaneous transmitting and receiving may be an MLD in which all stations cannot perform simultaneous transmitting and receiving or an MLD in which a part of stations cannot perform simultaneous transmitting and receiving.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0065">In view of this, an embodiment of this application provides a multi-link communication method 2.1.
