id="p-0002" num="0001">Hydrocarbon fluids are often found in hydrocarbon reservoirs located in porous rock formations far below the earth's surface. Exploratory wells may be drilled into an unknown reservoir to obtain data regarding the subsurface structure. In order to optimize production from hydrocarbon reservoirs, various subsurface models may be created by interpreting the data obtained by the exploratory wells. Subsurface models represent the subsurface structure and may map the distribution of various subsurface fluids including water, oil, and gas.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">There are various subsurface geological traps, such as structural and stratigraphic traps, that effect the distribution of water in a hydrocarbon reservoir. Being able to model water distribution and anticipate water breakthrough, particularly for complex hydrodynamic surfaces in gas wells, is beneficial to predicting and mitigating future production problems. As such, methods that help navigate the complex subsurface geological traps and types of subsurface water may be beneficial in producing reliable and accurate subsurface models.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts that are further described below in the detailed description.

However, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the disclosure may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known features have not been described in detail to avoid unnecessarily complicating the description.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Throughout the application, ordinal numbers (e.g., first, second, third, etc.) may be used as an adjective for an element (i.e., any noun in the application). The use of ordinal numbers is not to imply or create any particular ordering of the elements nor to limit any element to being only a single element unless expressly disclosed, such as using the terms &#x201c;before&#x201d;, &#x201c;after&#x201d;, &#x201c;single&#x201d;, and other such terminology.

More specifically, embodiments disclosed herein are directed to a tool to assist reservoir modelling to identify water type and a workflow for analyzing water, communicate this analysis, and rank future wells for water presence according to a defined risk matrix. Embodiments disclosed herein have application on conventional and unconventional reservoirs and mixed reservoir types.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows the subsurface structure of and fluid interactions within an exemplary hydrocarbon reservoir (<b>100</b>). The depicted hydrocarbon reservoir (<b>100</b>) has three different subsurface fluids present: a gas phase (<b>102</b>), a free water phase (<b>104</b>), and an oil phase (<b>106</b>). Conventional hydrocarbon reservoirs (<b>100</b>), such as the one depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, have a source formation (<b>108</b>), a reservoir formation (<b>110</b>), and a cap formation (<b>112</b>). A source formation (<b>108</b>) is a formation rich in organic matter that, over time, is heated sufficiently to produce hydrocarbon fluids such as the gas phase (<b>102</b>) and oil phase (<b>106</b>).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The oil phase (<b>106</b>) and gas phase (<b>102</b>) migrate from the source formation (<b>108</b>) to a more porous and permeable rock called the reservoir formation (<b>110</b>). Due to the density difference between the gas phase (<b>102</b>) and the oil phase (<b>106</b>), the gas phase (<b>102</b>) migrates and settles above the oil phase (<b>106</b>) in the reservoir formation (<b>110</b>). The cap formation (<b>112</b>) is a formation with low permeability and/or porosity such that the oil phase (<b>106</b>) and the gas phase (<b>102</b>) are prevented from migrating further and are &#x201c;trapped&#x201d; beneath the cap formation (<b>112</b>). In other embodiments, the source formation (<b>108</b>), the reservoir formation (<b>110</b>), and the cap formation (<b>112</b>) may be one and the same, these reservoirs are called unconventional hydrocarbon reservoirs.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Wells (<b>114</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>) may be drilled into the hydrocarbon reservoir (<b>100</b>). Wells (<b>114</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>) may be drilled into the formation for gathering data, producing the hydrocarbon fluids, and/or treating the formation. Each well (<b>114</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>) may be an exploration well, a production well, or an injection well. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a free water phase (<b>104</b>) may be present in the reservoir formation (<b>110</b>) alongside the gas phase (<b>102</b>) and the oil phase (<b>106</b>). In one or more embodiments, the free water phase (<b>104</b>) may have already been present in the reservoir formation (<b>110</b>) prior to the oil phase (<b>106</b>) and the gas phase (<b>102</b>) migrating from the source formation (<b>108</b>). In other embodiments, the free water phase (<b>104</b>) may have migrated from elsewhere, and/or the free water phase (<b>104</b>) may have been artificially introduced due to injection of water using the injection wells.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">When an oil phase (<b>106</b>), gas phase (<b>102</b>), and free water phase (<b>104</b>) are all present in the reservoir formation (<b>110</b>), the phases migrate and settle due to density differences such that the free water phase (<b>104</b>) may be located beneath the oil phase (<b>106</b>) and the oil phase (<b>106</b>) may be located beneath the gas phase (<b>102</b>). Therefore, there are various &#x201c;contacts&#x201d; within the hydrocarbon reservoir (<b>100</b>) that distinguish the locations of the different subsurface fluids. The gas water contact (GWC) (<b>116</b>) is the location or &#x201c;surface&#x201d;, in the hydrocarbon reservoir (<b>100</b>), above which predominantly the gas phase (<b>102</b>) occurs and below which predominately the free water phase (<b>104</b>) occurs. The gas phase (<b>102</b>) and the free water phase (<b>104</b>) are miscible, so the GWC (<b>116</b>) is not necessarily sharp, and a transition zone (<b>118</b>) exists between the gas phase (<b>102</b>) and the free water phase (<b>104</b>), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The free water level (FWL) (<b>120</b>) is located near the base of the transition zone (<b>118</b>) and is a location or &#x201c;surface&#x201d; below which &#x2dc;100% of the free water phase (<b>104</b>) occurs.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The gas oil contact (GOC) (<b>122</b>) is the location or &#x201c;surface&#x201d;, in the hydrocarbon reservoir (<b>100</b>), above which predominantly the gas phase (<b>102</b>) occurs and below which predominately the oil phase (<b>106</b>) occurs. The oil water contact (OWC) (<b>124</b>) is the location or &#x201c;surface&#x201d;, in the hydrocarbon reservoir (<b>100</b>), above which predominantly the oil phase (<b>106</b>) occurs and below which predominately the free water phase (<b>104</b>) occurs. In some embodiments of a hydrocarbon reservoir (<b>100</b>), the free water phase (<b>104</b>) enters the reservoir formation (<b>110</b>) from a formation, like a sandstone, located below the reservoir formation (<b>110</b>).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Exploratory wells (<b>114</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>) may be drilled into a gas reservoir (<b>100</b>), as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, to gather more data about the reservoir (<b>100</b>). These wells (<b>114</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>) may encounter the free water phase (<b>104</b>), the gas phase (<b>102</b>), or both the free water phase (<b>104</b>) and the gas phase (<b>102</b>). When a well (<b>114</b><i>a</i>) is drilled into a reservoir (<b>100</b>) and only the free water phase (<b>104</b>) is encountered, the well (<b>114</b><i>a</i>) may be called a WUT (water up to) well (<b>114</b><i>a</i>). When a well (<b>114</b><i>b</i>) is drilled into the reservoir (<b>100</b>) and only the gas phase (<b>102</b>) is encountered, the well (<b>114</b><i>b</i>) may be called a GDT (gas down to) well (<b>114</b><i>b</i>). In cases where the well (<b>114</b><i>c</i>) encounters the free water phase (<b>104</b>) and the gas phase (<b>102</b>), data gathered from the well (<b>114</b><i>c</i>) may be used to determine the GWC (<b>116</b>). The data gathered from the WUT wells (<b>114</b><i>a</i>), GDT wells (<b>114</b><i>b</i>), and the GWC (<b>116</b>) wells (<b>114</b><i>c</i>) may be used to help produce a difference map. A difference map maps the GWC (<b>116</b>) surface throughout the reservoir (<b>100</b>). This allows for indication of the &#x201c;top pay zone&#x201d; which is the primary zone where the gas phase (<b>102</b>) is located. An accurate location of the top pay zone helps in development of the reservoir (<b>100</b>) because production wells (<b>114</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>) may be designed to target the hydrocarbon producing zone rather than the water producing zones.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Embodiments disclosed herein present a method that may be used to produce reliable and accurate subsurface difference maps that model and condition the free water phase (<b>104</b>) distribution in a reservoir (<b>100</b>). Herein, the reservoir (<b>100</b>) may be similar to the reservoir (<b>100</b>) depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> or the reservoir (<b>100</b>) may be a gas reservoir (<b>100</b>) having only a free water phase (<b>104</b>) and a gas phase (<b>102</b>).</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b><i>a</i>-<b>2</b><i>c </i></figref>depict flowcharts in accordance with one or more embodiments.

To determine if the FWL (<b>120</b>) is observable, the capillary pressures within the reservoir (<b>100</b>) are integrated with a height function and interpreted with a log analysis. If the FWL (<b>120</b>) is deemed observable, the reservoir (<b>100</b>) may be analyzed further by progressing to S<b>202</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">If the FWL (<b>120</b>) is not observable, the reservoir (<b>100</b>) may no longer be analyzed using the disclosed method, and the process ends. There are methods to predict the FWL (<b>120</b>), when the FWL (<b>120</b>) is not observable, by analyzing various tools such as a modular dynamics tester tool, a reservoir dynamics tester tool, and an express pressure tool. However, in order for the most accurate subsurface difference maps to be produced by the method outlined in this disclosure, the FWL (<b>120</b>) must be observable, not predicted. Conventional hydrocarbon reservoirs (<b>100</b>) with high porosity are most likely to have an observable FWL (<b>120</b>) whereas tight reservoirs (<b>100</b>) are most likely to not have an observable FWL (<b>120</b>).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Returning to S<b>200</b>, when the FWL (<b>120</b>) is deemed observable, the reservoir (<b>100</b>) may be further analyzed by determining whether the pressure trend (<b>330</b>) of the free water phase (<b>104</b>) follows the same pressure trend (<b>330</b>) as the water in the rest of the reservoir (<b>100</b>) (S<b>202</b>). In connection with this determination, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>b </i></figref>are graphs of depth (<b>332</b>) vs pressure (<b>334</b>).
