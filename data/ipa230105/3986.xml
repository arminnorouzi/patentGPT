In addition, the imaging apparatus works with a liquid immersion medium, that is, the type of medium that biological specimens used in microscopic investigations typically should be maintained in. The imaging apparatus provides a catadioptric system that incorporates one mirror and has very large numerical apertures and field sizes while still providing the degrees of freedom needed to achromatize to a significant extent (which is important for fluorescence imaging). The imaging apparatus is a catadioptric system in which a large fraction of the optical power comes from a mirror element that is at or near a monocentric condition with the image surface and system stop; that is, the chief rays are nearly normal to the surface of the mirror element. The chief rays are a set of imaging rays from all points in the object that intersect the system stop at its center, as discussed in more detail below. This serves to dramatically lessen the field-dependent aberrations that would otherwise accompany any refractive surface operating at such large etendues and optical powers. The imaging apparatus also includes non-monocentric lens elements that correct the chromatic aberrations and allow the image surface to be flat.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an optical block diagram of an imaging apparatus including a light collection apparatus that is catadioptric and includes at least one reflective optical element;</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an optical block diagram of a dioptric light collection apparatus that is an example of a fully monocentric imaging system;</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is an optical block diagram of an implementation of the imaging apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and including a sample apparatus and an interrogation system;</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a block diagram of an optical microscope that includes an implementation of the imaging apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> as well as a control system and an interrogation system;</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a block diagram of an implementation of the interrogation system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> that includes a light apparatus and an optical arrangement and creates and scans a beam array of a plurality curved asymmetric Bessel-like excitation (CABLE) beams;</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is an optical block diagram of an implementation of the imaging apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is an optical block diagram of an implementation of the light collection apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is an optical block diagram of an implementation of the imaging apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and including an interrogation system;</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref> is a schematic diagram showing optical aspects of an implementation in which the interrogation system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> produces one or more light beams directed toward a sample location by way of the reflective optical element;</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref> is a schematic diagram showing optical aspects of an implementation in which the interrogation system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> produces one or more light beams directed toward a sample location without interacting with the reflective optical element;</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is an optical block diagram of an implementation of the light collection apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> including an optical lens system that includes six lenses arranged relative to a sample location;</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref> is a table showing simulated bandpass filter cutoff wavelengths used and peak emission wavelengths for each fluorophore that can be present in the sample at the sample location;</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref> is a table showing refractive index and Abbe number values of different compositions of immersion fluid in which the sample location is situated;</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref> is a graph of Strehl ratios calculated under different imaging conditions, where colors correspond to different field locations: blue/light blue&#x2014;

The imaging apparatus <b>100</b> includes a light collection apparatus <b>101</b> that is catadioptric, which means that the light collection apparatus <b>101</b> includes at least one refractive optical element and at least one reflective optical element arranged along an imaging axis IA that passes through a sample location <b>110</b> within an interrogation volume <b>115</b>. Thus, the light collection apparatus <b>101</b> collects and shapes light using a catadioptric optical arrangement. The imaging axis IA extends along a Z axis of a Cartesian coordinate system X, Y, Z. The imaging apparatus <b>100</b> can be designed to be rotationally symmetric about the Z axis and extending in each of the X, Y, and Z directions. The sample location <b>110</b> is configured to receive a sample to be imaged by the imaging apparatus <b>100</b>. The sample can have an extent along one or more of the X, Y, and Z directions.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The reflective optical element is a mirror <b>105</b> positioned along the imaging axis IA on a first side Z<b>1</b> of the interrogation volume <b>115</b>. In the following implementations, the mirror <b>105</b> has positive optical power and is converging, and thus, has a reflecting surface that curves toward the sample location <b>110</b> as it extends transversely or radially from the imaging axis IA. A large fraction (for example, most) of the positive optical power of the light collection apparatus is provided by the mirror <b>105</b>. The first side Z<b>1</b> of the interrogation volume <b>115</b> is the side extending along the positive Z axis away from the interrogation volume <b>115</b>.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The refractive optical element is an optical lens system <b>120</b> that optically interacts with the sample location <b>110</b> and the mirror <b>105</b>. The optical lens system <b>120</b> can include one or more components on the first side Z<b>1</b> of the interrogation volume <b>115</b> and one or more components on a second side Z<b>2</b> of the interrogation volume <b>115</b>, the second side Z<b>2</b> of the interrogation volume <b>115</b> being the side extending along the negative Z axis away from the interrogation volume <b>115</b>. The mirror <b>105</b> and the optical lens system <b>120</b> make up a light collection apparatus <b>101</b> that is diffraction limited and has a field of view of at least 8 millimeters (mm), at least 10 mm, or at least 12 mm in diameter.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In some implementations, a working distance between the sample location <b>110</b> and any element of the optical lens system <b>120</b> or the mirror <b>105</b> is at least 20 mm. In some implementations, each of the mirror <b>105</b> and the optical lenses within the optical lens system <b>120</b> is spherical. Moreover, aspherical surfaces are not required in the light collection apparatus <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In various implementations, the light collection apparatus <b>101</b> has a numerical aperture (NA) of at least 0.8, at least 0.9, or at least 1.0 for a field of view (FOV) of at least 8 mm, at least 10 mm, or at least 12 mm in diameter for light emitted from the sample location <b>110</b> having a wavelength within the range of 400-800 nanometers (nm). In some implementations, the light collection apparatus <b>101</b> is diffraction limited for light having a wavelength within the range of 500-800 nm at 81-90% light transmission efficiency.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">The optical lens system <b>120</b> includes a plurality of optical lenses arranged along the imaging axis IA on one or more of the first and second sides Z<b>1</b>, Z<b>2</b>. At least one of the optical lenses in the optical lens system <b>120</b> is a multiplet optical lens <b>121</b>. Moreover, there can be more than one multiplet optical lens <b>121</b> in the optical lens system <b>120</b>. Each multiplet optical lens <b>121</b> can be a doublet lens or a triplet lens. For example, the optical lens system <b>120</b> can include a plurality of singlet optical lenses, a plurality of doublet optical lenses, and at least one triplet optical lens, as discussed in greater detail below. The optical lenses within the optical lens system <b>120</b> can be arranged so that, over every optical surface within the system <b>120</b>, all light rays in normal operation have a maximum exit angle in air, with respect to the surface normal of each lens, within a range of 30&#xb0;-45&#xb0; or 35&#xb0;-40&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">One or more of the optical lenses in the optical lens system <b>120</b> and the mirror <b>105</b> can be movable and/or adjustable along the imaging axis IA. This axial movement of the mirror <b>105</b> and the lenses within the optical lens system <b>120</b> can be accomplished using high precision recirculating ball bearing guideways.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The imaging apparatus <b>100</b> also includes a detection system <b>125</b> external to the interrogation volume <b>115</b>. The detection system <b>125</b> is configured to detect light <b>126</b> emitted from the sample location <b>110</b> and collected by the light collection apparatus <b>101</b>, that is, the mirror <b>105</b> and the optical lens system <b>120</b>. The light <b>126</b> can be fluorescence emitted from the sample at the sample location <b>110</b>. The detection system <b>125</b> is configured to image the light <b>126</b> emitted from the sample at the sample location <b>110</b> at the diffraction limit of the numerical aperture of the light collection apparatus <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">The imaging apparatus <b>100</b> enables high-resolution imaging of large volumes within the sample, which further enables new types of experiments and observations to be performed on the sample. For example, the imaging apparatus <b>100</b> enables rapid imaging of large, chemically cleared or expanded tissues and organs with sub-cellular resolution and without the need for physical sectioning (for example, for high-resolution structural imaging of the entire mouse brain), whole-brain live imaging of neuronal activity in large model organisms (such as the mouse), or simultaneous imaging of groups of freely behaving, interacting animals at the single-cell level (for example, for simultaneous whole-brain imaging across all individuals in a group of interacting larval zebrafish or <i>Drosophila</i>).</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">The imaging apparatus <b>100</b> avoids fundamental limitations of traditional lens objectives because it includes a catadioptric light collection apparatus <b>101</b>, as described herein, for light-based image formation. Specifically, the mirror <b>105</b> replaces a traditional lens objective. Unlike a traditional lens objective, the mirror <b>105</b> can provide both high spatial resolution (by offering a high numerical aperture) and access to a large field of view. Thus, the light collection apparatus <b>101</b> achieves high performance with respect to both parameters at the same time. This is because the light collection apparatus <b>101</b> is less impacted by the scaling laws of optical aberrations and errors as etendue is increased.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Conventional scaling constraints arising from optical aberrations in traditional lens objectives can be overcome in the light collection apparatus <b>101</b>, thus enabling high numerical apertures over a much larger field of view than previously possible. For example, the imaging apparatus <b>100</b> can provide a numerical aperture of 1.0 in which the sample interrogation volume <b>115</b> is water, a field of view of 12 millimeters (mm), a working distance of 25 mm, and diffraction-limited performance for 500-715 nanometers (nm) at 81-90% light transmission efficiency. Compared to state-of-the-art optics, such as the Mesolens with a numerical aperture of 0.47 and a field of view of 6 mm, the imaging apparatus <b>100</b> improves optical throughput 18-fold (quantified as the number of resolvable elements simultaneously transmitted by the apparatus <b>100</b>).</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Moreover, the imaging apparatus <b>100</b> is not limited by the speed of the camera (or cameras) within the detection system <b>125</b>, and because the imaging apparatus <b>100</b> has such a large-field of view, this also provides an opportunity for a dramatic speed-up in the imaging of large specimens through, for example, multiplexing of the detection process with a camera array that parallelizes image acquisition across the field of view. An implementation of the imaging apparatus <b>100</b> using a camera array consisting of 10 sCMOS cameras, offering an imaging speed of at least 1.0&#xd7;10<sup>10 </sup>voxels per second or in some cases, 1.4&#xd7;10<sup>10 </sup>voxels per second, is discussed below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>10</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">As mentioned above, the mirror <b>105</b> provides a very large fraction of the positive optical power of the light collection apparatus <b>101</b>. The mirror <b>105</b> can be monocentric, which means that it is arranged in a condition of monocentricity or near-monocentricity with the surface of the object (that is, the sample or specimen) being imaged at the sample location <b>110</b> and with the system stop SS. To put it another way, the mirror <b>105</b> can be field symmetric, which means that the set of rays that emanate from any field point in the object (sample) interact equivalently with the mirror as the set of rays coming from any other field point, or nearly field symmetric, which indicates a slight deviation from this condition. The system stop SS can be defined as the aperture stop or lens ring within the light collection apparatus <b>101</b> that physically limits the solid angle of rays (from the light <b>126</b>) passing through the apparatus <b>101</b> from an on-axis object point. The system stop SS therefore limits the brightness of an image that is formed at the detection system <b>125</b> from the light <b>126</b>. The system stop SS can be an aperture stop, or it can be at a surface of one of the lenses within the optical lens system <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">In general, a fully monocentric optical system is a system in which every optical surface, including the object and image surfaces, share a common center of curvature, located at the system stop. The light collection apparatus <b>101</b> can be a fully monocentric or nearly monocentric optical system. By way of discussion and comparison, an example of a fully monocentric imaging system that uses a dioptric light collection apparatus <b>202</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Unlike the light collection apparatus <b>101</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the dioptric light collection apparatus <b>202</b> includes only refractive optical elements R<b>1</b>, R<b>2</b> arranged between an object space OS and an imaging space IS. Due to the symmetry of the system with respect to the field variable, which corresponds to the fact that the chief ray CR of the system has a normal incidence on every optical surface (of each of the optical elements R<b>1</b>, R<b>2</b>), there are no field dependent aberrations of the system at all. Only spherical aberration and axial chromatic aberration can exist in such a system, and the size of the field itself is not limited in the usual way by the field-dependent aberrations, but instead is limited either by cosine foreshortening of the system stop, which gives it an effective width of zero at a 90 degree field angle, or by the overlap of optical surfaces on both sides of the stop which extend beyond being hemispheres.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">One important metric of any optical system is its etendue. For a conventional optical system such as a microscope (into which the imaging apparatus <b>100</b> can be integrated), etendue is equal to the area of the field of view (FOV) times the numerical aperture (NA) available in that FOV squared. Light can propagate through an optical system with significant aberrations, and thus contribute to the simple transmission of light energy or imaging that is not diffraction limited. In light microscopy, however, where the fundamental goal is the acquisition of images of high quality and resolution of the sample (at the sample location <b>110</b>), diffraction limited imaging can be important and/or needed, and thus, in calculating the etendue, only the FOV and NA that can be transmitted with correspondingly low aberrations is considered. If it is assumed that the imaging apparatus <b>100</b> is diffraction limited and the etendue in question is diffraction limited etendue, then the etendue of the imaging apparatus <b>100</b> is proportional to the number of individually resolvable image elements (resels) that can be transmitted through the apparatus <b>100</b>, for a given wavelength of light.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">The detection system <b>125</b> uses one or more digital image sensors (or cameras). Each sensor, or the array of sensors, can have many more pixels than the supported resels of the human eye and a conventional objective. It can therefore be advantageous to develop the light collection apparatus <b>101</b> (and the imaging apparatus <b>100</b>) with a higher etendue to match the level of resolution desired at the detection system <b>125</b> for the particular sample to be imaged. The imaging apparatus <b>100</b> is designed in a manner that provides for higher etendue than would be obtained in conventional microscope objectives.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Moreover, designing an optical system in which all aberrations are held to small fractions of the wavelength of the light <b>126</b> becomes more and more difficult as the etendue is increased. Within microscope objectives that are dioptric (utilizing only light refraction at lens surfaces), and which support the large numerical aperture that is necessary for high-resolution imaging, only lens surfaces that satisfy certain narrow conditions can be utilized for the high-powered tip elements (generally the 1-4 positive meniscus lenses that contribute the majority of the positive power of the lens). For example, one condition is the aplanatic condition, and another condition is the concentric condition. In the aplanatic condition (in which the ratio of the marginal ray slope to the refractive index surrounding the ray is constant across the lens surface), significant optical surface power is possible without the introduction of any spherical aberration, coma, or astigmatism, but this is only possible if the object surface is immersed in the same index of refraction as the lens material. In the concentric condition (marginal ray has zero angle of incidence at surface), no spherical aberration or coma are introduced, but also no optical power is possible. In high-NA, dioptric microscope objectives, one or more aplanatic, or nearly-aplanatic surfaces are used in the tip elements, and usually one or more nearly-concentric surfaces are used in the tip elements as well. Although these conditions can work at a level of etendue that exceeds those of typical dioptric objectives, for example with the Mesolens at an etendue of 6.2 mm<sup>2</sup>, it can be at the expense and inconvenience of significant physical up-scaling of the lens dimensions, and increased element counts.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">The imaging apparatus <b>100</b> achieves a more dramatic increase in etendue without requiring unwieldy lens sizes and numbers, and thus provides an alternate, effective high etendue optical design strategy.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, in some implementations, the imaging apparatus <b>100</b> is an imaging apparatus <b>300</b> that additionally includes a sample apparatus <b>330</b> and an interrogation system <b>340</b>.

The light that is collected and imaged by the light collection apparatus <b>1001</b>, upon exiting the sample <b>1035</b>, first traverses the lens <b>1020</b>_<b>1</b> that forms one of the walls of the immersion fluid chamber, then crosses a small air gap before impinging upon the concave mirror <b>1005</b>. The concave mirror <b>1005</b> provides a large proportion of the positive optical power of the light collection apparatus <b>1001</b>, and is arranged nearly monocentrically with the system stop SS. Because of this near-monocentricity, the chief rays CR of the collected light <b>1026</b> have an angle-of-incidence on the mirror <b>1005</b> that is close to zero, and thus all field-dependent aberrations that result from the mirror <b>1005</b> are naturally small.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">After reflecting from the mirror <b>1005</b>, the imaged light <b>1026</b> traverses the lens <b>1020</b>_<b>1</b> again and reenters the interrogation volume <b>1015</b>. Passing through in a reversed direction, some of the light <b>1026</b> is occluded by the sample <b>1035</b>, or aberrated (in the case of a thin or highly transparent sample <b>1035</b>). However, since the beam size of the light <b>1026</b> passing through the interrogation volume <b>1015</b> is large, the amount of light <b>1026</b> occluded by the sample <b>1035</b> is small.

The small deviations from monocentrism present in the mirror <b>1005</b>, larger deviations in the lens <b>1020</b>_<b>1</b>, and the large deviation in the immersed surface IS of the lens <b>1021</b>_<b>1</b> require the corrective action of lenses <b>1021</b>_<b>2</b>, <b>1021</b>_<b>3</b>, <b>1021</b>_<b>4</b>, <b>1020</b>_<b>2</b>, and the small deviation from monocentrism seen in the mirror <b>1005</b> itself is a result of simultaneously optimizing all of the optics together for aberration minimization, as is usually done during optical design.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">The system stop SS in the light collection apparatus <b>1001</b> is located on a surface of lens <b>1021</b>_<b>2</b>.

The window <b>1022</b> could be used as an interference or absorption filter for unwanted light (such as excitation light in fluorescence microscopy).</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, in some implementations, after exiting the lens <b>1020</b>_<b>2</b>, the light <b>126</b> passes through an environmental window <b>322</b>. The detection system <b>125</b> is highly sensitive to the refractive index of the immersion fluid <b>1018</b> due to the long path length of the imaging light through the immersion fluid <b>1018</b>. Also, fluids such as water tend to experience much higher variability of refractive index with temperature. Therefore, the temperature and temperature gradients of the immersion fluid <b>1018</b> can be controlled, requiring that the optics within the detection system <b>125</b> be kept in a climate-controlled chamber (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). The environmental window <b>322</b> separates the interior of this climate-controlled chamber from the exterior (outside lab space).</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">A second result of the sensitivity of the detection system <b>125</b> to the refractive index of the immersion fluid <b>1018</b> is that small changes in the composition of the immersion fluid <b>1018</b> can non-trivially affect the imaging performance at the detection system <b>125</b>. Allowing some variability in the immersion fluid <b>1018</b> is desirable, as different sample preparations require different immersion compositions for optimal clearing and imaging performance. For example, different preparations of expanded tissue can be imaged optimally with varying amounts of phosphate or saline sodium citrate buffer present, which can raise the refractive index of water from 1.333 (at the d-line, 587 nm) to 1.343, and this change can be significant depending on the design of the detection system <b>125</b>. To accommodate these changes in this design, the mirror <b>1005</b>, the lenses <b>1021</b>_<b>1</b> and <b>1021</b>_<b>2</b> (as a set), and the lens <b>1021</b>_<b>3</b> are configured to move small amounts axially (along the imaging axis IA) depending on the composition of the immersion fluid <b>1018</b>, allowing the recovery of diffraction limited performance through small changes in aberration balancing.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">One imaging criterion that can be used to optimize the optical design of the light collection apparatus <b>1001</b> is the root-mean-squared optical path difference (RMS OPD) across several different variables. The first variable is the field position. The second variable is a fluorophore variable. Specifically, chromatic performance is evaluated separately over the weighted bandwidths of four different exemplary fluorophores: eGFP, mOrange, mCherry, and mPlum. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref> shows the simulated bandpass filter cutoff wavelengths used, and the peak emission wavelength of each fluorophore.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">The third variable is the composition of the immersion fluid <b>1018</b> in which performance was evaluated using the refractive indices of different compositions for the immersion fluid <b>1018</b> such as water, phosphate buffered saline (1&#xd7;PBS), and two different concentrations of saline sodium citrate buffer (2&#xd7;SSC and 5&#xd7;SSC). The refractive indices of these immersion fluids <b>1018</b> can be measured at a plurality (for example, 13) wavelengths in a wavelength range (such as a wavelength range 435-715 nm) using a custom-built refractometer with accuracy better than 0.0001. This data can be input into the optical design software Zemax OpticStudio to use these materials for optical design. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref> shows the refractive index and Abbe number values of these buffers at the d-line. Final evaluation of nominally built system performance can be made by calculating Huygens Strehl ratios under several imaging conditions using Zemax OpticStudio. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A and <b>12</b>B</figref> show the results for the nominal system design.

Although during optimization, different fluorophores are evaluated separately, the light collection apparatus <b>1001</b> can perform well across larger wavelength ranges that are weighted evenly. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>A and <b>13</b>B</figref> show the results under these wavelength conditions. Finally, although no optimization was performed at wavelengths under 500 nm, it was found that performance of the light collection apparatus <b>1001</b> at or near the diffraction limit is possible for fluorophores with emission wavelengths down to 435 nm, as long as the immersion fluid <b>1018</b> compensators (the mirror <b>1005</b>, the lenses <b>1021</b>_<b>1</b> and <b>1021</b>_<b>2</b>, and the lens <b>1021</b>_<b>3</b>) are allowed to move to accommodate these wavelengths (vs. their positions at wavelengths 500-715 nm), and somewhat smaller bandpass widths are used (20-40 nm).</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>A and <b>14</b>B</figref>, an implementation <b>1430</b> of the sample apparatus <b>330</b> is shown.
