The opening is defined with reference to certain geometrical parameters and the discharge viscosity of the liquid is between 20 mPa s and 3000 mPa s.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">WO 2019/109040 A1 describes a system for applying a coating composition to a substrate using an applicator having a high application efficiency. The process comprises an applicator having a high application efficiency which defines a nozzle. The coating composition comprises a carrier and a binder. The coating composition has a viscosity of about 0.002 Pa*s to about 0.2 Pa*s, a density of about 838 kg/m<sup>3 </sup>about 1557 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, a surface tension of about 0.015 N/m to about 0.05 N/m and a relaxation time of about 0.0005 s to about 0.02 s. The applicator having a high application efficiency is configured such that it discharges the coating composition through the nozzle opening onto the substrate to form a paint layer. At least 80% of the droplets of the coating composition discharged from the applicator having a high application efficiency come into contact with the substrate.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">U.S. Pat. No. 7,927,669 B2 discloses a process for applying coatings, in particular paints, to surfaces with an apparatus comprising a metering head comprising at least one nozzle controllable by a control signal. The process comprises the steps of: moving a substrate with a surface to be coated along this surface relative to the metering head and/or moving the metering head relative to a surface to be coated of a substrate and applying a fluid coating material to the surface through the nozzle in response to at least one control signal generated by a processor.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention has for its object to provide a digital printing process with which coating compositions&#x2014;rather than inks&#x2014;may be processed.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">This object is achieved by a process as claimed in claim <b>1</b>. Advantageous developments are specified in the subsidiary claims. They may be combined as desired unless the opposite is clear from the context.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a process for coating a substrate comprising the step of dropletwise application of a coating composition from a nozzle onto a substrate the nozzle has a closable opening which allows or prevents discharge of a droplet of the coating composition under instructions from a control unit.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is provided that the coating composition is applied more than once on less than 30% of the surface area of the substrate, that when the opening of the nozzle is closed a pressure of &#x2265;1.2 bar to &#x2264;3.5 bar acts upon the coating composition and that the opening of the nozzle has a diameter of &#x2265;80 &#x3bc;m to &#x2264;250 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is further provided that the coating composition comprises a reactive resin, a hardener for the resin and a solvent, in which coating composition resin and hardener are altogether present in a proportion of &#x2265;20% by weight based on the total weight of the coating composition and that the coating composition has a viscosity at 20&#xb0; C. measured according to EN ISO 3219/A3 at a shear rate of 1000/s of &#x2265;20 mPa s to &#x2264;80 mPa s.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The process according to the invention makes it possible to apply individual droplets of a solvent-based two-component paint formulation (2K paint formulation) to a substrate, wherein the droplets combine to form an uninterrupted layer on the substrate. Evaporation of the solvent then affords an uninterrupted coating on the substrate. It has surprisingly been found that coatings meeting the quality requirements are obtainable efficiently and economically within the parameters provided according to the invention. Standard formulations for the paints may even be used. Application may be followed by hardening of the coating by customary processes.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The coating process comprises the closable opening of the nozzle as a variant of the so-called drop-on-demand printing process, especially as a coating process performed using valvejet printers. The opening of the nozzle may be opened or closed for example using a magnetically operated plunger. The frequency with which the opening of the nozzle is opened and closed again may preferably be in the range from 800 Hz to 4000 Hz.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">It will be appreciated that a plurality of such nozzles may be used. They may be arranged together on a movable printing head. The control unit is typically arranged in the apparatus used for the process such as a valvejet printer and may for example comprise a raster image processor (RIP).</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The process according to the invention is suitable to be performed as a so-called single-pass process. This is to be understood as meaning that the smallest possible surface area of the substrate is provided with the coating composition more than once. According to the invention it is provided that the coating composition is applied more than once to less than 30% of the surface area of the substrate. It is preferable when less than 20% of the surface area and particularly preferably less than 10% of the surface area is concerned. Ideally each surface area section of the substrate to be printed is printed with the coating composition only once with the exception of technically unavoidable overlaps and imprecisions.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Compared to spraying processes for application of paints the process according to the invention differs inter alia in that larger droplets are discharged. The droplets are precisely placed as a consequence of the process. Furthermore, markedly less solvent evaporates in the short flight path of the droplet between the nozzle and the substrate. The solvent which still remains in the formulation can therefore ensure a reduction in the viscosity of the formulation on the substrate such that a continuous film can be formed from the individual droplets.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In terms of machine parameters the inventors have found that when the opening of the nozzle is closed a pressure of &#x2265;1.2 bar to &#x2264;3.5 bar should act upon the coating composition. This may be considered the &#x201c;operating pressure&#x201d; of a valvejet printer and is more easily determinable than a pressure when the nozzle is open during discharge of material. Preferred pressures are &#x2265;1.2 bar to &#x2264;3 bar and particularly preferably &#x2265;1.4 bar to &#x2264;2.5 bar.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The inventors have further found that the opening of the nozzle should have a diameter of &#x2265;80 &#x3bc;m to &#x2264;250 &#x3bc;m. Preferred diameters are &#x2265;100 &#x3bc;m to &#x2264;200 &#x3bc;m, particularly preferably &#x2265;120 &#x3bc;m to&#x2264;150 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The type of substrate is not subject to any particular limitations. The substrate may be planar or curved. The process according to the invention may also process relatively large substrates, for example with areas of more than 1 m<sup>2</sup>, more than 10 m<sup>2 </sup>or more than 100 m<sup>2</sup>. Suitable materials may include aluminum, steel or polymers. The substrate may be part of a finished assembly such as a machine housing or may be in the form of a semifinished product such as a tape, roll or sheet material.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The coating composition comprises a reactive resin, a hardener for the resin and a solvent and may therefore be considered a 2K composition. These compositions are only prepared before application since on account of the reaction of the resin with the hardener only a limited processing time exists. Typical reactions of the resin with the hardener are crosslinking reactions to form covalent bonds. It will be appreciated that the composition may also contain further components such as reactive diluents or additives. Solids-containing coating compositions may thus also be processed. The d90 value of the particle size distribution for these particles is preferably &#x2264;5 &#x3bc;m. The coating composition may be conceived as a basecoat, color coat or topcoat.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The proportion of resin and hardener of altogether &#x2265;20% by weight further distinguishes the composition from binder-containing inkjet inks In such inks the proportion of the binder is markedly lower. Based on the total weight of the coating composition the total proportion of resin and hardener is preferably &#x2265;30% by weight and more preferably &#x2265;40% by weight.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The viscosity provided for according to the invention likewise distinguishes the composition from binder-containing inkjet inks; it is markedly lower in the latter. Preferred viscosities are &#x2265;25 mPa s to &#x2264;70 mPa s and particularly preferably &#x2265;30 mPa s to &#x2264;65 mPa s.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The process may be performed such that the desired wet paint film thickness based on the employed paint quantity is produced with a material yield of &#x3e;90%, preferably &#x3e;95% and very particularly preferably 98% since there is no overspray and no significant evaporation of solvent or components on the way to the substrate.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The process may further be performed such that the desired dry paint film thickness is 1.5 times, preferably 1.7 times and very particularly 2 times less than the wet paint film thickness.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The process may further be performed such that a solvent-based paint to be applied loses less than 20%, preferably less than 10% and very particularly less than 5% of its solvent on the way to the substrate, thus allowing the necessary solvent evaporation process to take place in a controlled manner on the substrate, thus obtaining reduced environmental impacts and improved surface qualities compared to conventional spray application processes.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">A coating layer obtained by the process according to the invention may after a single run (single-pass printing) have a dry paint film thickness (dry film thickness, DFT) in the range from 0.015-0.080 mm, preferably 0.02 to 0.06 mm and very particularly preferably 0.025 to 0.05 mm.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In one embodiment the following parameters are chosen such that according to the following formula the calculated index K&#x2265;is 0.4 to &#x2264;4:</p><p id="p-0031" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mi>K</mi>  <mo>=</mo>  <mfrac>   <mrow>    <msup>     <mrow>      <mo>(</mo>      <mfrac>       <mi>R</mi>       <mrow>        <mn>5</mn>        <mo>&#x2062;</mo>        <mn>0</mn>       </mrow>      </mfrac>      <mo>)</mo>     </mrow>     <mn>2</mn>    </msup>    <mo>&#x2062;</mo>    <msup>     <mrow>      <mo>(</mo>      <mfrac>       <mi>p</mi>       <mn>2</mn>      </mfrac>      <mo>)</mo>     </mrow>     <mn>2.5</mn>    </msup>    <mo>&#x2062;</mo>    <msup>     <mrow>      <mo>(</mo>      <mfrac>       <mi>d</mi>       <mrow>        <mn>1</mn>        <mo>&#x2062;</mo>        <mn>2</mn>        <mo>&#x2062;</mo>        <mn>0</mn>       </mrow>      </mfrac>      <mo>)</mo>     </mrow>     <mn>2</mn>    </msup>    <mo>&#x2062;</mo>    <mrow>     <mo>(</mo>     <mfrac>      <mi>S</mi>      <mrow>       <mn>4</mn>       <mo>&#x2062;</mo>       <mn>5</mn>      </mrow>     </mfrac>     <mo>)</mo>    </mrow>   </mrow>   <msup>    <mrow>     <mo>(</mo>     <mfrac>      <mi>&#x3b7;</mi>      <mrow>       <mn>5</mn>       <mo>&#x2062;</mo>       <mn>0</mn>      </mrow>     </mfrac>     <mo>)</mo>    </mrow>    <mn>3</mn>   </msup>  </mfrac> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0032" num="0030">where:</p><p id="p-0033" num="0031">R: spatial resolution of application of coating composition in dots per 2.54 cm</p><p id="p-0034" num="0032">p: pressure acting on coating composition when opening of nozzle is closed in bar</p><p id="p-0035" num="0033">d: diameter of closable opening of nozzle in &#x3bc;m</p><p id="p-0036" num="0034">S: proportion of nonvolatile constituents of coating composition in % by weight based on total weight of coating composition according to ISO 3251, 120 min, 100&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0035">&#x3b7;: viscosity at 20&#xb0; C. measured according to EN ISO 3219/A3 at a shear rate of 1000/s in mPa s.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0036">This empirically determined formula results from statistical analyses of the test results carried out by the inventors and allows optimized adjustment of the remaining parameters when some of the parameters are known.
