The camera module has a fixed position and is disposed opposite to a reflective surface of the optical reflection component, which is disposed in a transparent portion of the housing. The reflective surface is positioned at an angle with respect to the input axis of the camera module to reflect light received through the transparent housing portion to the camera module. The camera module captures an image by detecting the light reflected to it by the reflective surface. The first driving component drives the optical reflection component to rotate the reflective surface around the input axis of the camera module, such that the camera module captures images carried by

A video surveillance device with a single camera can monitor a limited range. To further increase a monitoring range, a multi-camera video surveillance device appears.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, the monitoring range that can be increased by the multi-camera video surveillance device is still limited, and a large quantity of cameras increase deployment difficulty. A camera video surveillance device with a fast cycle scanning function (for example, a dome camera) replaces the multi-camera video surveillance device due to advantages such as a larger monitoring range and flexible deployment of the camera video surveillance device with the fast cycle scanning function.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The dome camera is used as an example. A camera in the dome camera can rotate 360 degrees at a relatively high speed, in other words, can implement the fast cycle scanning function. Generally, when the dome camera captures an image, the camera in the dome camera needs to rotate to a specific position and shoot in a stable state.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">When the camera in the dome camera rotates, the camera, a light compensation module, and related driving components (such as a motor and a bearing) need to move together, resulting in heavy load. When the camera rotates to the specific position, due to inertia of the camera, the light compensation module, and the related driving components (such as the motor and the bearing), it takes a long time for the camera to reach the stable state. In other words, it takes a long time for the dome camera to take a snapshot when performing cycle scanning.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In conclusion, a manner in which the camera is driven to rotate in the camera video surveillance device with the fast cycle scanning function limits a snapshot speed of the video surveillance device.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">This application provides an optical system, an electronic device, and a display apparatus, to improve a snapshot speed of a camera video surveillance device with a fast cycle scanning function.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to a first aspect, an embodiment of this application provides an optical system. The optical system includes a camera module, an optical reflection component, and a first driving component. The camera module in the optical system is fixed in a position and does not rotate or move. The camera module is opposite to a front surface of the optical reflection component. The optical reflection component can reflect, to the camera module, light projected onto the optical reflection component. In this way, the camera module can capture an image by using the light reflected to the camera module. The first driving component can change a position of the optical reflection component, and drive the optical reflection component to rotate in a first direction.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">By using the foregoing optical system, the camera module is fixed in the position. A direction of the optical reflection component may be adjusted by using the first driving component, so that the camera module can capture images in all directions without rotation of the camera module. This effectively shortens a time for the camera module to shoot the image. In addition, in the entire optical system, components that need to move are the optical reflection component and the first driving component, and load is relatively small in a movement process. This helps implement efficient movement and helps the camera module to capture the images.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a possible implementation, in addition to the first driving component, the optical system may further include another driving component, to implement rotation of the optical reflection component in a direction other than the first direction. For example, the optical system further includes a second driving component, where the second driving component may drive the optical reflection component to rotate in a second direction. The first direction is different from the second direction.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">By using the foregoing optical system, the optical reflection component can rotate in a plurality of different directions, so that the optical reflection component can reflect light in the different directions, so that the camera module can capture images in a plurality of directions, and a shooting range is larger.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In a possible implementation, the camera module may be fixedly disposed in a horizontal direction (a direction perpendicular to a gravity direction), or may be fixedly disposed in a gravity direction.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">By using the foregoing optical system, the camera module is disposed in a fixed direction, and a disposition position is more flexible.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In a possible implementation, the camera module is located below the optical reflection component, or may be located above the optical reflection component. There are a plurality of positions of the camera module and there are a plurality of positions of the optical reflection component, and the camera module and the optical reflection component may be used for different scenarios. For example, when the camera module is located above the optical reflection component, the camera module can be used for a surveillance scenario, for example, traffic road surveillance. When the camera module is located below the optical reflection component, the camera module can be used for a remote conference, for example, the camera module is disposed above a display apparatus to shoot participants.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a possible implementation, there are a plurality of manners in which the first driving component drives the optical reflection component. For example, a motor may be used to drive the optical reflection component to rotate. For example, the first driving component includes a first motor and a first bearing. The first motor is configured to drive the first bearing, so that the first bearing drives the optical reflection component to rotate in the first direction.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">By using the foregoing optical system, the first driving component can drive the optical reflection component to rotate in a relatively convenient manner by using the first motor and the first bearing.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In a possible implementation, similar to the first driving component, the second driving component includes a second motor and a second bearing. The second bearing is connected to the optical reflection component. The second motor is configured to drive the second bearing, so that the second bearing drives the optical reflection component to rotate in the second direction.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">By using the foregoing optical system, the second driving component can drive the optical reflection component to rotate in a relatively convenient manner by using the second motor and the second bearing.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In a possible implementation, the first bearing may be connected to a back surface or a side surface of the optical reflection component, so that the first motor drives the optical reflection component to rotate.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In a possible implementation, the first bearing may alternatively be connected to the second motor through a connecting rod, and the optical reflection component can rotate in the two different directions through the connecting rod.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In a possible implementation, a surface form of the optical reflection component may be fixed, in other words, the optical reflection component may be a surface-form fixed reflector. A surface form of the surface-form fixed reflector is one of the following:</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">a plane, a convex surface, a concave surface, a diffraction surface, and a free-form surface.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">By using the foregoing optical system, a plurality of surface forms of the optical reflection component are selected, so that different imaging requirements of the camera module can be ensured.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In a possible implementation, the optical reflection component is a surface-form variable reflector, and the surface-form variable reflector may be one of the following:</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">a micromirror array and a liquid reflector.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">By using the foregoing optical system, the surface-form variable reflector can change a reflection surface of the surface-form variable reflector, so that the surface-form variable reflector is used for a plurality of different application scenarios, a control manner is more flexible, and an application range of the optical system is extended.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In a possible implementation, the optical reflection component may be an optical reflection component coated on one surface, in other words, only one surface can reflect light. Alternatively, the optical reflection component may be an optical reflection component coated on two surfaces, in other words, two surfaces both can reflect light. Because the two surfaces of the optical reflection component coated on two surfaces both can reflect light, when the first driving component and the second driving component drive the optical reflection component, the optical reflection component coated on two surfaces can rotate to a surface capable of reflecting light only by a relatively small angle, thereby reducing a rotation time of the optical reflection component. In addition, a range of light that can be reflected by the optical reflection component coated on two surfaces also increases, so that the shooting range of the camera module increases.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In a possible implementation, the first direction is perpendicular to the second direction. The optical reflection component can rotate in the two directions perpendicular to each other, so that the optical reflection component can rotate in all directions, thereby further ensuring the shooting range of the camera module.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In a possible implementation, the second direction may be the gravity direction. In other words, one rotation direction of the optical reflection component is the gravity direction.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In a possible implementation, the second bearing is connected to a side surface or a back surface of the optical reflection component.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">By using the foregoing optical system, the second bearing may be connected to the back surface or the side surface of the optical reflection component, so that the second motor drives the optical reflection component to rotate.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In a possible implementation, the optical system further includes a bracket, and the first driving component is connected to the camera module by using the bracket.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">By using the foregoing optical system, the first driving component can be supported, so that the optical reflection component can be driven to rotate.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In a possible implementation, the optical system further includes a housing, and the housing is located outside the camera module.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">By using the foregoing optical system, the housing is disposed outside the camera module, and can protect the camera module from damage. In a possible implementation, the optical system further includes a transparent dome cover. The transparent dome cover is connected to the housing, and is located outside the first driving component and the optical reflection component.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">By using the foregoing optical system, the transparent dome cover can protect other components in the optical system on the premise that the optical reflection component can work normally.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">According to a second aspect, an embodiment of this application provides an electronic device, including a processor and an image-shooting apparatus, where the image-shooting apparatus includes the optical system in any one of the first aspect and the possible implementations of the first aspect.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">According to a third aspect, an embodiment of this application provides an optical system. The optical system includes a camera module, an optical reflection component, and a first driving component. The camera module is opposite to a front surface of the optical reflection component. The optical reflection component can reflect, to the camera module, light projected onto the optical reflection component. In this way, the camera module can capture an image by using the light reflected to the camera module. The first driving component can change a position of the optical reflection component, and drive the optical reflection component to rotate in a first direction. The camera module may not rotate, so that a time for the camera module to shoot the image can be effectively shortened. In the entire optical system, components that need to move are the optical reflection component and the first driving component, and load is relatively small in a movement process. This helps implement efficient movement and helps the camera module to capture the image.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In a possible implementation, in addition to the first driving component, the optical system may further include another driving component, to implement rotation of the optical reflection component in a direction other than the first direction. For example, the optical system further includes a second driving component, and the second driving component may drive the optical reflection component to rotate in a second direction. The first direction is different from the second direction. The optical reflection component can reflect light in different directions, so that the camera module can capture images in a plurality of directions, and a shooting range is larger.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In a possible implementation, the camera module may be disposed in a horizontal direction (a direction perpendicular to a gravity direction), or may be disposed in a gravity direction. A disposition position of the camera module is relatively flexible, and is applicable to different application scenarios.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In a possible implementation, there are a plurality of manners in which the first driving component drives the optical reflection component. For example, a motor may be used to drive the optical reflection component to rotate. For example, the first driving component includes a first motor and a first bearing. The first motor is configured to drive the first bearing, so that the first bearing drives the optical reflection component to rotate in the first direction. The first driving component may alternatively drive the camera module to rotate in a similar manner. This manner is simpler and more convenient.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In a possible implementation, similar to the first driving component, the second driving component includes a second motor and a second bearing. The second bearing is connected to the optical reflection component. The second motor is configured to drive the second bearing, so that the second bearing drives the optical reflection component to rotate in the second direction. The second driving component may alternatively drive the camera module to rotate in a similar manner. This manner is simpler and more convenient.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In a possible implementation, the first bearing may be connected to a back surface or a side surface of the optical reflection component, so that the first motor drives the optical reflection component to rotate.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In a possible implementation, the first bearing may alternatively be connected to the second motor through a connecting rod, and the optical reflection component can rotate in the two different directions through the connecting rod.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In a possible implementation, a surface form of the optical reflection component may be fixed, in other words, the optical reflection component may be a surface-form fixed reflector. A surface form of the surface-form fixed reflector is one of the following:</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">a plane, a convex surface, a concave surface, a diffraction surface, and a free-form surface.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In a possible implementation, the optical reflection component is a surface-form variable reflector, and the surface-form variable reflector may be one of the following:</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">a micromirror array and a liquid reflector.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In a possible implementation, the optical reflection component may be an optical reflection component coated on one surface, in other words, only one surface can reflect light. Alternatively, the optical reflection component may be an optical reflection component coated on two surfaces, in other words, two surfaces both can reflect light. Because the two surfaces of the optical reflection component coated on two surfaces both can reflect light, when the first driving component and the second driving component drive the optical reflection component, the optical reflection component coated on two surfaces can rotate to a surface capable of reflecting light only by a relatively small angle, thereby reducing a rotation time of the optical reflection component. In addition, a range of light that can be reflected by the optical reflection component coated on two surfaces also increases, so that the shooting range of the camera module increases.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In a possible implementation, the first direction is perpendicular to the second direction. The optical reflection component can rotate in the two directions perpendicular to each other, so that the optical reflection component can rotate in all directions, thereby further ensuring the shooting range of the camera module.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In a possible implementation, the second direction may be the gravity direction. In other words, one rotation direction of the optical reflection component is the gravity direction.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In a possible implementation, the second bearing is connected to a side surface or a back surface of the optical reflection component.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">By using the foregoing optical system, the second bearing may be connected to the back surface or the side surface of the optical reflection component, so that the second motor drives the optical reflection component to rotate.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In a possible implementation, the optical system further includes a bracket, and the first driving component is connected to the camera module by using the bracket.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">By using the foregoing optical system, the first driving component can be supported, so that the optical reflection component can be driven to rotate.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In a possible implementation, the optical system further includes a housing, and the housing is located outside the camera module.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In a possible implementation, the optical system further includes a transparent dome cover. The transparent dome cover is connected to the housing, and is located outside the first driving component and the optical reflection component.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">According to a fourth aspect, an embodiment of this application provides an electronic device, including a processor and an image-shooting apparatus, where the image-shooting apparatus includes the optical system in any one of the second aspect and the possible implementations of the second aspect.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">According to a fifth aspect, an embodiment of this application provides a display apparatus, including the optical system in the second aspect and the possible implementations of the second aspect.

camera. The dome camera is fixedly disposed at a specific height, and a camera in the dome camera may rotate 360 degrees, to capture pedestrian traffic from various directions at a place in which the dome camera is disposed.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is a schematic structural diagram of a dome camera. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> shows main components included in the dome camera, such as a camera and two motors. The camera may rotate driven by the two motors.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In a rotation process of the camera, overall load includes most components (such as the motors and the camera) of the dome camera. The load is heavy. According to statistics, an average snapshot speed of the dome camera is 0.2 frames per second. In other words, the dome camera can shoot one frame of image every five seconds. For a video surveillance device, the snapshot speed is applicable only to a place with low pedestrian traffic. When there is large pedestrian traffic, the snapshot speed is relatively low. This results in a problem that the dome camera may miss capturing an image, and a better surveillance effect cannot be achieved.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Therefore, an embodiment of this application provides an optical system. The optical system includes a camera module that can capture an image, an optical reflection component, and a first driving component. In the optical system, the optical reflection component can reflect light to the fixedly disposed camera module. The camera module may take a snapshot by using the optical reflection component. The first driving component can drive the optical reflection component to move. In this way, the optical reflection component can reflect light in different directions, and the camera module can capture images in different directions. In the optical system, the camera module is relatively fixed, and only a direction of the optical reflection component needs to be adjusted, so that the camera module can capture the images in the different directions, and a period of time for the camera module to rotate and reach a stable state is omitted. In this way, a period of time for the camera module to shoot the images can be effectively shortened. In addition, in the entire optical system, components that need to move are the optical reflection component and the first driving component, and load is relatively small in a movement process. This helps implement efficient movement and helps the camera module to capture the images.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The following describes an optical system provided in this embodiment of this application with reference to the accompanying drawings.

A relief structure of two or more step depths is generated through etching on a surface of a conventional optical element, to form a diffractive optical element (DOE). A reflection surface of the DOE is the diffraction surface, and the DOE may be used as an optical reflection component. For a conventional lens, a refractive index of blue light is larger than a refractive index of red light. However, for the diffraction surface, the refractive index of the red light is larger than the refractive index of the blue light, so that chromatic aberration of the optical system can be corrected more conveniently. An optical reflection component with the free-form surface may be formed by using a processing procedure of discontinuous processing. The free-form surface is arbitrary, and parameters of the free-form surface are relatively complex (for example, having a plurality of curvatures). The free-form surface also has an advantage of calibrating aberration.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">The following describes impact of different optical reflection components <b>120</b> on the images captured by the camera module <b>110</b> by using a manner in which a concave-surface optical reflection component and a convex-surface optical reflection component reflect light as an example.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">(1) The surface form of the optical reflection component <b>120</b> is the concave surface</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is an optical path diagram when the surface form of the optical reflection component <b>120</b> is the concave surface.

In the optical system, the first driving component <b>130</b> may drive the optical reflection component <b>120</b> to rotate in the horizontal direction, and the second driving component <b>140</b> drives the optical reflection component <b>120</b> and the camera module <b>110</b> to rotate in the perpendicular direction.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0163">It should be noted that, when the second driving component <b>140</b> needs to drive the camera module <b>110</b> to rotate, the second driving component may include a bearing connected to the camera module <b>110</b>, to ensure that when a second motor <b>142</b> drives the optical reflection component <b>120</b> to rotate by using a second bearing <b>141</b>, the camera module <b>110</b> may also be driven to rotate by using the bearing connected to the camera module <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0164">When a conventional image-shooting component performs shooting, the conventional image-shooting component may be externally disposed above a device (for example, a display or a television screen), and the image-shooting component may rotate to implement shooting. In this manner, a shooting range of the image-shooting component is related to a rotation angle of the image-shooting component. However, a diameter of the image-shooting component when the image-shooting component rotates is equal to a length of the image-shooting component. In this case, a space (namely, a rotation space of the image-shooting component) that needs to be occupied by the image-shooting component above the device is relatively large. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, the image-shooting component is located above the device (for example, the display or the television screen), a person or an object around the device can be shot only when the image-shooting component rotates horizontally driven by a horizontal motor. The image-shooting component shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> is disposed above the device in a horizontal manner, so that the rotation space of the image-shooting component becomes larger. However, in the optical system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, because the camera module <b>110</b> is located below the optical reflection component <b>120</b>, the camera module <b>110</b> may not rotate, and the shooting range of the camera module <b>110</b> is related to the rotation range of the optical reflection component <b>120</b>. Rotation of the optical reflection component <b>120</b> in different directions can effectively extend the shooting range of the camera module <b>110</b>. A volume that needs to be occupied by the entire optical system is related to the rotation range of the optical reflection component <b>120</b>, and because the optical reflection component <b>120</b> is located above the camera module <b>110</b>, the optical reflection component <b>120</b> and the camera module <b>110</b> are vertically disposed. In this way, a horizontal width of the entire optical system can be shortened. Compared with a volume that needs to be occupied by the conventional image-shooting component disposed on the device, the volume of the optical system can be greatly reduced, making it possible to dispose the optical system inside the device.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0165">In addition, the optical reflection component <b>120</b> may rotate in the first direction and the second direction, and the rotation range is relatively large. This can effectively extend the field of view of the camera module <b>110</b> and increase the shooting range.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0166">The optical system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> may be applied to a display screen or a display, and is disposed on the top of the display screen or the display, or embedded in an upper part of the display screen or the display.
