Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Recently, in the field of semiconductor technology, various techniques have been tried for heat treatment for a thin film. The thermal treatment technology for a thin film can be classified into a traditional method using resistive heat generated in a coil of a thermal treatment furnace and a rapid thermal treatment method using a light source such as a lamp or laser.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Among them, the rapid thermal treatment method using a light source can uniformly transfer heat to a thin film in a short time. Accordingly, it is possible to provide a thin film of good quality by reducing a thermal budget that the thin film receives when thermal treatment is performed. In particular, in recent years, as the thickness of a thin film to be thermally treated continues to decrease, research on the rapid thermal treatment technique using a light source as a thermal treatment method for a thin film is being actively conducted.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a method of treating a target film according to an embodiment, a plurality of pattern structures with sidewall surfaces facing each other are provided. A target film is formed on the sidewalls of the plurality of pattern structures. A plurality of nanoparticles are distributed on the target film. The target film is thermally treated by irradiating laser light from upper sides of the plurality of pattern structures to the target film.

An amorphous dielectric layer is formed on at least the sidewall surfaces of the plurality of pattern structures. A plurality of metal particles are distributed on the amorphous dielectric layer. A first crystalline dielectric layer thermally treating the amorphous dielectric layer uses laser light. In thermally treating the amorphous dielectric layer, the laser light is irradiated onto the amorphous dielectric layer from upper sides of the plurality of pattern structures, wherein the irradiated laser light is scattered from the plurality of metal particles.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic flowchart illustrating a thermal treatment method for a target film according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> to <b>6</b></figref> are schematic cross-sectional views illustrating a thermal treatment method for a target film according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> to <b>13</b></figref> are schematic views illustrating a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b> and <b>15</b></figref> are schematic views illustrating a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device according to another embodiment of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b> to <b>23</b></figref> are schematic views illustrating a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device according to another embodiment of the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Hereinafter, embodiments of the present disclosure will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.
