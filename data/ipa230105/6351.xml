Such an IC module includes a wire for an antenna that is a conductor wire formed on a surface of an insulating substrate. The IC module can transmit and receive signals in a contactless manner by this antenna wire.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, a module substrate antenna is disclosed in which three coils with different sizes (outer dimensions as viewed in plan) are disposed inside an insulating substrate and these three coils are arranged so as to overlap each other in the stacking direction of insulating layers (see, e.g., Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2018-166160).</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, in the module substrate antenna described in Patent Document 1, the coils need to have different sizes, and the number of turns of coil patterns and the area of the coil patterns are limited. Therefore, the inductance of all the coils cannot be maximized. As a result, it is difficult to increase the combined inductance of the coils.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a module substrate antenna capable of further increasing the combined inductance of coils by reducing the parasitic capacitance of the antenna coils in addition to the above problem.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to achieve the above object, a module substrate antenna of the present invention is characterized by including first and second coils connected in parallel. The first coil is composed of a pattern in which a spiral first antenna coil pattern and a spiral second antenna coil pattern are interlayer-connected in series. The second coil is composed of a pattern in which a spiral third antenna coil pattern and a spiral fourth antenna coil pattern are interlayer-connected in series. The first antenna coil pattern, the third antenna coil pattern, the second antenna coil pattern, and the fourth antenna coil pattern are located in this order. The first to fourth antenna coil patterns are wounded so that directions of a current flowing through the first to fourth antenna coil patterns are all the same direction with respect to an axis of the coil, are wound so that the directions of a current in the first and third antenna coil patterns are the same direction with respect to a radial direction of the coil, and are wound so that the directions of a current in the second and fourth antenna coil patterns are an opposite direction to the direction of a current in the first and third antenna coil patterns with respect to the radial direction of the coil.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to the module substrate antenna of the present invention, the parasitic capacitance of the antenna coils can be reduced, and the combined inductance of the coils can be increased.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings"
