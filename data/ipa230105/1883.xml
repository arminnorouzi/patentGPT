The invention further relates to a belt tensioner for a seat belt system comprising such tensioner tube.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">A belt tensioner serves for reducing, in a case of restraint, impacts which may affect the restraint of the vehicle occupant, before the vehicle occupant starts to move forward movement and, where necessary, a load limiter starts to act. Said impacts include the so-called film reel effect (webbing that is loosely wound onto the belt reel) and the belt slack (webbing that is not tightly adjacent to the vehicle occupant). The belt tensioner reduces the belt slack and the film reel effect within a split second by tensioning the webbing. The vehicle occupant thus can take part in the vehicle deceleration at an early stage, and the conditions for the subsequent use of the load limiter are optimized.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">From DE 10 2010 051 420 A1, a generic belt tensioner for a seat belt system is known comprising a drive unit and a load transmission element which, when the drive unit is activated, acts upon a rotatably supported drive gear that is coupled or can be coupled to the axle of a belt retractor. The load transmission element is guided in a tensioner tube wound in a space-saving manner and is made from a substantially deformable material so that the load transmission element is actuated in a damped manner at the drive gear and a high torque transmission is ensured. The tensioner tube is configured so that its end facing the drive gear is substantially tangent to the drive gear. In particular, in belt retractors of this type having been installed for quite a long time, the load transmission element which was straight before mounting may happen to fail, upon exiting, to adopt a straight shape again and to impact tangentially on the drive gear again because of its long dwell time within the curved tensioner tube, but will adopt a shape that is slightly curved toward the drive gear. In this way, the engaging area of the drive member may be located slightly closer in the direction of the drive axle than intended.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Moreover, from DE 10 2014 006 499 A1, a belt tensioner comprising an elongate tensioner tube is known in which a movable piston is pressurized and drives a load transmission element interacting with a drive gear. A stop against which the piston abuts in its stop position is provided at the exit end of the tensioner tube.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is the object of the invention to improve, in a generic belt tensioner, interaction between the load transmission element and the drive gear.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">This object is achieved by a wound tensioner tube comprising the features of claim <b>1</b> and by a belt tensioner comprising the features of claim <b>8</b>. Advantageous and useful configurations of the tensioner tube according to the invention and of the belt tensioner according to the invention are stated in the related subclaims.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The wound tensioner tube according to the invention for guiding a load transmission element has an elongate inwardly protruding projection in the tube section adjacent to the exit end the longitudinal axis of which is inclined against the longitudinal axis of the tube section.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Said elongate projection interacts, when the load transmission element exits, with the latter such that a curvature of the load transmission element caused by a long dwell time inside the curved tube is counteracted and a largely tangential introduction of the load transmission element into the drive gear is ensured. The clearance diameter of the tensioner tube in the area of the elongate projection is smaller than the outer diameter of the load transmission element so that, when the load transmission element exits, the projection digs into the latter and effectuates a largely positive guiding.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The inclination of the elongate projection based on the tangent to the drive gear advantageously ranges from 5&#xb0; to 20&#xb0; and particularly advantageously is about 15&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The elongate projection can be favorably produced, in terms of manufacture, by impressing or embossing the outer surface of the tensioner tube.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Safe and low-loss guiding of the load transmission element is advantageously achieved when the elongate projection has a substantially V-shaped cross-section.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Low-loss guiding is advantageously achieved when only one single elongate projection is formed in the tensioner tube.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The guiding of the load transmission element and a compensation of the curvature upon exiting the tensioner tube is achieved with low loss in a particularly advantageous manner, when the elongate projection is formed laterally on the tube section such that it is provided in a central region between the side close to the drive gear and the side distant from the drive gear of the tube section.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Further features and advantages of the invention will be evident from the following description and from the attached drawings which are referred to, and wherein:</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an exploded view of a belt retractor comprising a belt tensioner according to the invention;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a sectional view of the assembled belt retractor;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a detail view of a tensioner tube according to the invention;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a section across the tensioner tube according to the invention along the line IV-IV.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the substantial components of a belt retractor comprising a pyrotechnically driven belt tensioner are illustrated. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows the belt retractor in the assembled state.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In a retractor frame <b>10</b>, a belt reel <b>12</b> onto which webbing can be wound and from which webbing can be unwound is rotatably supported.

The components of the belt tensioner are accommodated at least partly in a tensioner case <b>22</b> that is mounted on the retractor frame <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Further, a stop disk <b>24</b>, a coil spring <b>26</b> disposed therein and a cover <b>28</b> are attached to the drive gear <b>14</b>.

The tensioner tube <b>18</b> has a first open end <b>30</b> that is tightly connected to the pyrotechnic drive unit. At the other tube end of the tensioner tube <b>18</b>, the exit end <b>32</b> is formed which is disposed immediately adjacent to the drive gear <b>14</b>, i.e., the exit end <b>32</b> is directed toward the drive gear <b>14</b>. Accordingly, the outer part <b>44</b> distant from the drive gear of the tube section protrudes beyond the center of the drive gear.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The load transmission element <b>20</b> is movably disposed in the tensioner tube <b>18</b>. A pressure chamber is formed in the tensioner tube between the pyrotechnic drive unit and the load transmission element <b>20</b>. The outer diameter of the load transmission element <b>20</b> is slightly smaller than the inner diameter of the tensioner tube.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Between the first end <b>30</b> and the exit end <b>32</b> the tensioner tube is wound, with the tube section of the tensioner tube adjacent to the exit end being straight and extending tangentially to the drive gear. The longitudinal axis L of the tube section <b>34</b> forms a tangent T to the drive gear <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the tube section <b>34</b>, an elongate projection <b>36</b> is configured in the form of an impression directed to the interior of the tube. Said elongate projection <b>36</b> has a V-shaped cross-section. The longitudinal axis I of the elongate projection <b>36</b> is inclined outwardly in relation to the tangent T, viz. at an angle &#x3b1; of about 15&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The elongate projection <b>36</b> is formed at the lateral surface of the tube section <b>34</b> facing away from the open end <b>30</b>. Accordingly, the longitudinal axis L of the tube section <b>34</b> and the longitudinal axis I of the elongate projection <b>36</b> form a first plane X. A second plane Y is formed by the outer axis <b>40</b> close to the drive and the outer axis <b>42</b> distant from the drive of the tube section <b>34</b>. The two planes X and Y enclose an angle &#x3b2; of 90&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the case of restraint, the pyrotechnic drive unit is activated and generates compressed gas which expands in the pressure chamber located between the drive unit and the load transmission element <b>20</b>. Thus, the load transmission element <b>20</b> is pressurized inside the tensioner tube <b>18</b> so that the load transmission element <b>20</b> is moved away from the igniter <b>16</b>. The load transmission element <b>20</b> exits the tensioner tube <b>18</b> through the exit end <b>32</b> and engages in the drive gear <b>14</b>. Thus, the drive gear <b>14</b> is made to rotate. The drive gear <b>14</b> in turn makes the belt reel <b>12</b> coupled to the drive gear <b>14</b> to rotate in the winding direction of the webbing, and webbing is wound onto the belt reel <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">When the load transmission element <b>20</b> exits the tensioner tube, it is guided by the elongate projection <b>36</b> in the direction of the outer part <b>44</b> distant from the drive so that the load transmission element is guided along the tube wall distant from the drive and a tangential run-in is ensured.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-001-8" num="001-8"><claim-text><b>1</b>-<b>8</b>.
