The number of cardiovascular deaths is expected to increase to approximately 24 million annually by 2030. The direct and indirect annual costs total more than $316 billion dollars. This exceeds the entire gross domestic product (GDP) of all the world's countries except the top 30 countries.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Statins have been a cornerstone therapy for fighting heart disease for nearly three decades. The totality of evidence for reducing cardiovascular disease events is second to none in all of medicine. Statins are still the most prescribed class of medicine.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Despite the fact that many statins will be generically available off patent in the United States and other markets by 2017, it is expected that prevalence of cardiovascular disease will continue. That is, that heart disease will remain. The next-generation is showing clear signs they are going to develop cardiovascular disease at high prevalence levels and need help. Although novel therapies are materializing to address cardiovascular disease, it is expected that such novel therapies will be combined with statins, not replace them. Thus, it is expected that statins will remain a cornerstone therapy for cardiovascular disease for the foreseeable future.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Unfortunately, long-term trends demonstrate many people avoid prescription medications, including statins. One approach to making statins more available is to make then available without a prescription, e.g., over the counter (&#x201c;OTC&#x201d;). However, because statins cause serious adverse effects in certain patients, the population receiving the drug should be carefully selected and monitored. Ramkumar S. et al., Acta Cardiol. Sin., 32(6):631-39 (2016). This is why statin distribution has traditionally been regulated through exclusive prescription access. In order to ensure the safety of OTC distribution of statins, prospective patients must effectively self-select themselves for the drug. Recent studies, however, found that many prospective patients do not pay consistent attention to guidelines printed on the packaging of OTC drugs, to ensure safe and responsible use. PR Newswire Association, &#x201c;Americans Should Pay More Attention to Over-the-Counter (OTC) medicine Labels According to New Survey&#x201d;, October 15 (2015) (citing McNeil Consumer Healthcare research). According to these studies, 40% of prospective patients consider the directions as just guidelines and 80% of patients do not re-read the label of an OTC medicine they have used before. Even more troubling, only 58% of men surveyed found it very important to pay attention to restrictions on an OTC label.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Currently, there are two regulatory pathways for legal marketing of an OTC drug in the United States. In the first pathway, marketing occurs in compliance with an OTC drug monograph, that sets regulatory standards for non-prescription drugs that are not covered by human drug applications, e.g., a New Drug Application (NDA) or Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA). An OTC monograph is created as a result of a three phase OTC drug review by the FDA. In phase I of the review, an advisory review panel determines whether ingredients in the proposed OTC composition could be generally recognized as safe and effective for use in self-treatment. In the second pathway, marketing occurs under the authority of an approved product-specific new drug application (NDA), or an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA). In order to support an over-the-counter label for a drug for which regulatory approval is being sought through an NDA, a consumer research study is required to assess the consumer's ability to select and deselect themselves as appropriate users of the drug, based on the proposed labeling for the drug. Oliver, A., Regulatory Rapporteur, 10(3):4-9 (2013), which is incorporated by reference herein.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, attempts at switching distribution of cardiovascular drugs having potentially far-reaching benefits for societal health, from prescription-only to an OTC model, have repeatedly failed, in large part due to concerns over inappropriate patient selection and medication. Possibly the best documented cases relate to statins used to treat high cholesterol.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">For instance, Merck has had at least three applications for sale of over the counter lovastatin rejected by the FDA, in 2000, 2005, and 2007. In 2005, their proposal to permit over the counter sales of lovastatin was rejected by an expert advisory panel at the FDA in 2005. The panel was concerned by a marketing study performed to support the proposal in which approximately one third of 3316 customers who were offered the drug over the counter decided they would purchase the drug. After reviewing the data, the panel concluded that 45% of the purchases would have been inappropriate for a variety of reasons, including the age of the subject, the subject's lack of knowledge about their condition, and contraindications associated with their condition. Dyer O., BMJ, 330(7484):164 (2005). In 2007, the board again concluded that the ability of consumers to appropriately self-select and to adequately comply with chronic MEVACOR&#xae; therapy without the intervention of a physician had not been demonstrated. Division of Metabolic and Endocrine Drug Products, 2005, &#x201c;NDA 21-213 Non-prescription MEVACOR&#xae; 20 mg Joint Advisory Committee Meeting.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Similarly, Pfizer announced in 2011 its intention to switch LIPITOR&#xae; from prescription-only to OTC status. Sett OTC bulletin, 16 Nov. 2011, page 7. However, they abandoned their attempt in 2014 when a phase 3 &#x201c;actual use&#x201d; trial, intended to simulate the OTC use of LIPITOR&#xae; (atorvastatin calcium) 10 mg, failed to meet its primary objectives on the basis that patient compliance with the direction to check their low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level and, after checking their LDL-C level, take appropriate action based on their test results was unsatisfactory.

This is despite that nearly 40 million adults in the U.S. who are eligible for cholesterol-lowering medications, under the current guidelines, are not taking anything.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The information disclosed in this Background section is only for enhancement of understanding of the general background of the invention and should not be taken as an acknowledgment or any form of suggestion that this information forms the prior art already known to a person skilled in the art.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Given the above background, systems and methods are needed for qualifying a human subject for delivery of a statin pharmaceutical composition over-the-counter to lower cholesterol, e.g., thereby, treating or preventing heart disease.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present disclosure addresses the need in the art for systems and methods configured for qualifying a human subject for an over-the-counter provision of a statin pharmaceutical composition (e.g., a rosuvastatin pharmaceutical composition such as rosuvastatin calcium) in order to treat or prevent heart disease, e.g., by lowering cholesterol. In the present disclosure, systems and methods are provided for an over-the-counter provision of a statin pharmaceutical composition to a subject. An information set is obtained from the subject and applied to an algorithm. The algorithm runs the information set against a first plurality of filters. When a filter in the first plurality is fired, the subject is deemed not qualified for a statin treatment. The algorithm also runs the information set against a second plurality of filters. When a respective filter in the second plurality is fired, the subject is provided with a corresponding warning. The method proceeds to a fulfillment process when no filter in the first plurality is fired and the subject has acknowledged each warning associated with each fired filter in the second plurality of filters. The fulfillment process stores the composition order, communicates a drug facts label for the statin pharmaceutical composition to the subject, and authorizes, upon subject confirmation that the label has been read, provision of the statin pharmaceutical composition to the subject.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Accordingly, one aspect of the present disclosure provides a method for qualifying a subject for an over-the-counter provision of a statin pharmaceutical composition. The method includes providing an assessment survey of the subject in order to obtain a first information set. In some embodiments, the first information set include one or more of: a sex of the subject, an age of the subject, when the subject is female&#x2014;whether the subject is pregnant or breastfeeding, whether the subject is taking one or more compositions that interact (e.g., via a pharmacokinetic interaction and/or a pharmacodynamic interaction) with the statin pharmaceutical composition, whether the subject has ever had a cardiac event, a cholesterol level of the subject (e.g., a total cholesterol level, a LDL cholesterol level, and a HDL cholesterol level), a triglyceride level of the subject, a blood pressure of the subject (e.g., a systolic blood pressure of the subject and/or a diastolic blood pressure of the subject), whether the subject has a liver condition, an alcohol consumption status of the subject, and whether the subject has had an adverse reaction to a cholesterol-lowering composition.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The method also includes applying an algorithm to the first information set. The algorithm runs all or a portion of the first information set against a first plurality of assessment filters. When a respective filter in the first plurality of assessment filters is fired, the subject is deemed not qualified for a statin treatment. The method is then terminated accordingly without authorizing provision of the statin pharmaceutical composition to the subject. In some embodiments, the first plurality of assessment filters includes one or more of an age filter, a pregnancy filter, a severe drug interaction filter, a cardiac event filter, a total cholesterol filter, a HDL cholesterol filter, a LDL cholesterol filter, a triglyceride level filter, a blood pressure filter, an atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk pooled cohort equation filter, and a liver condition filter.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The algorithm also runs all or a portion of the first information set against a second plurality of assessment filters. When a respective filter in the second plurality of assessment filters is fired, the subject is provided with a warning corresponding to the respective filter. In some embodiments, the second plurality of assessment filters includes one or more of an alcohol consumption filter, a first adverse reaction filter, and a moderate drug interaction filter. However, unlike filters in the first plurality of assessment filters, filters in the second plurality of assessment filters do not automatically terminate the process without provision of the statin pharmaceutical composition to the subject.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The method continues by obtaining acknowledgment from the subject for the warning issued to the subject by any filter in the second plurality of assessment filters. In some embodiments, acknowledgment from the subject is a written acknowledgement, a verbal acknowledgment, or an electronic acknowledgment such as an electronic signature.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The method continues by proceeding with a fulfillment process when no filter in the first plurality of filters has been fired and the subject has acknowledged each warning associated with each filter in the second plurality of filters that was fired.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some embodiments, the fulfillment process includes storing an indication in a subject profile of an initial order for the statin pharmaceutical composition, communicating an over-the-counter drug label for the statin pharmaceutical composition, and authorizing, upon confirmation from the subject that the over-the-counter drug label has been received and read, provision of the statin pharmaceutical composition to the subject.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some embodiments, the statin pharmaceutical composition includes an active ingredient of rosuvastatin or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof (e.g., rosuvastatin calcium, etc.) In some embodiments, the statin pharmaceutical composition includes an active ingredient of rosuvastatin calcium. In some embodiments, the statin pharmaceutical composition includes an active ingredient selected from the group consisting of atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin as an active ingredient.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In one aspect, the present disclosure provides a method for re-qualifying a subject for an over-the-counter provision (e.g., a subject who was previously qualified to receive a provision of the statin pharmaceutical composition) of the statin pharmaceutical composition (e.g., which is optionally performed in conjunction with a method for qualifying the subject for an initial order of the statin pharmaceutical composition). The method includes providing a re-assessment survey of the subject in order to obtain a second information set. In some embodiments, the second information set includes one or more of whether the subject has had a documented cardiac event since receiving their last provision of the statin pharmaceutical composition, when the subject is female&#x2014;whether the subject is pregnant or breastfeeding, whether the subject is taking one or more compositions that interact with the statin pharmaceutical composition, whether the subject has experienced liver problems since receiving their last provision of the statin pharmaceutical composition, whether the subject has experienced a muscle irregularity since receiving their last provision of the statin pharmaceutical composition, and an alcohol consumption status of the subject.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The method also includes applying an algorithm to the second information set. The algorithm runs all or a portion of the second information set against a first plurality of re-assessment filters. When a respective filter in the first plurality of re-assessment filters is fired, the subject is deemed not qualified for a statin treatment. Accordingly, the method is terminated without authorizing re-provision of the statin pharmaceutical composition to the subject. In some embodiments, the first plurality of re-assessment filters includes one or more of a cardiac event filter, a cholesterol status filter, when the subject is female&#x2014;a pregnancy filter, a severe drug interaction filter, a liver condition filter, and a muscle irregularity filter.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The algorithm also runs all or a portion of the second information set against a second plurality of re-assessment filters.

Although hypercholesterolemia can be effectively treated and/or prevented using established pharmaceutical compositions, access to these drugs is hindered by to the requirement for a prescription, as many individuals do not have adequate access and/or avoid the healthcare system for a variety of reasons. Accordingly, many people are not managing their hypercholesterolemia or conditions related to hypercholesterolemia appropriately. While over-the-counter alternatives to these prescription pharmaceuticals would increase access to these compositions, thereby improving population management of hypercholesterolemia and conditions related to hypercholesterolemia around the world, patients often have difficulty self-selecting themselves for an appropriate over-the-counter medication. Because inappropriate use of these drugs can result in ineffective treatment and/or serious side-effects, better systems and methods for selecting for, and treating patients with, other-the-counter hypercholesterolemia medications are needed. The present disclosure provides, among other aspects, methods, systems, and computer readable media that solve these problems.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Reference will now be made in detail to implementations, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. In the following detailed description of implementations, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">It will also be understood that, although the terms first, second, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, these elements should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element from another. For example, a first filter could be termed a second filter, and, similarly, a second filter could be termed a first filter, without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. The first filter and the second filter are both filters, but they are not the same filter.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The terminology used in the present disclosure is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the invention. As used in the description of the invention and the appended claims, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will also be understood that the term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; as used herein refers to and encompasses any and all possible combinations of one or more of the associated listed items. It will be further understood that the terms &#x201c;comprises&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; when used in this specification, specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As used herein, the term &#x201c;if&#x201d; may be construed to mean &#x201c;when&#x201d; or &#x201c;upon&#x201d; or &#x201c;in response to determining&#x201d; or &#x201c;in response to detecting,&#x201d; depending on the context. Similarly, the phrase &#x201c;if it is determined&#x201d; or &#x201c;if [a stated condition or event] is detected&#x201d; may be construed to mean &#x201c;upon determining&#x201d; or &#x201c;in response to determining&#x201d; or &#x201c;upon detecting [the stated condition or event]&#x201d; or &#x201c;in response to detecting [the stated condition or event],&#x201d; depending on the context.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">As used herein, the term &#x201c;over-the-counter&#x201d; means to provide by retail purchase, subject to the constraints disclosed herein, but without a prescription or license from a physician or medical practitioner.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">As used herein, the term &#x201c;pharmaceutical compound&#x201d; refers to any physical state of a material. Pharmaceutical compounds include but are not limited to capsules, tablets, liquids, topical formulations, and inhaled formulations.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">As used herein, the term &#x201c;contraindication&#x201d; refers to a condition that makes a treatment, e.g., over-the-counter use of a statin pharmaceutical composition, inadvisable. Contraindications include physical characteristics of a subject, e.g., pregnancy or liver conditions, and contemporaneous drug use, e.g., statin pharmaceutical composition use. In the present context, identification of a contraindication fires a filter in a first plurality of filters, which prevents authorizing provision of a statin pharmaceutical composition, in accordance with some implementations of the methods, systems, and software disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As used herein, the term &#x201c;risk factor&#x201d; refers to a condition that makes a treatment, e.g., over-the-counter use of a statin pharmaceutical composition, possibly inadvisable. Risk factors include physical characteristics of a subject, e.g., a blood pressure reading, and contemporaneous drug use, e.g., use of a cholesterol-lowering composition. In the present context, identification of a risk factor fires a filter in a second plurality of filters, which prevents authorizing provision of a statin pharmaceutical composition without confirmation that the subject has discussed the risk factor with a medical professional, in accordance with some implementations of the methods, systems, and software disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">As used herein, &#x201c;drug interactions,&#x201d; e.g., with a statin pharmaceutical composition, include pharmacokinetic drug interactions and pharmacodynamics drug interactions. Generally, a pharmacokinetic drug interaction is an interaction between two drugs (e.g., a statin and a second drug) that result in alterations in the absorption, transport, distribution, metabolism, and/or excretion of either drug. Generally, a pharmacokinetic drug interaction is an interaction between two drugs (e.g., a statin and a second drug) that result in a direct change in the effect or either drug. For a more comprehensive summary of pharmacokinetic drug interactions and pharmacodynamics drug interactions, see, Cascorbi, I, Dtsch Arztebl Int., 109(33-34):546-55 (2012), the content of which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the context of the present disclosure, classification of a condition as either a contraindication or a risk factor is specific to a particular identity and dose of a statin pharmaceutical composition being authorized for over-the-counter use. Classification of a particular condition, e.g., contemporaneous statin pharmaceutical composition use, may vary between different statin pharmaceutical compositions (e.g., it may be classified as a contraindication for a first statin, a risk factor for a second statin, and/or neither for a third statin). Likewise, a particular condition may be classified as a contraindication for use of a particular statin at a first over-the-counter dosage, classified as a risk factor for the same particular statin at a second (e.g., lower) over-the-counter dosage, and/or classified as neither for the same particular statin at a third (e.g., lowest) over-the-counter dosage.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">As used herein, whether a subject &#x201c;has developed&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;has experienced&#x201d; a condition since receiving their last provision of a statin pharmaceutical composition refers to both conditions that are new to the subject, i.e., a condition that the subject did not have at the time they received their last provision of the statin pharmaceutical composition, and conditions that have been newly diagnosed, regardless of whether the condition existed when the subject received their last provision of the statin pharmaceutical composition, e.g., a condition that the subject was not aware of when they received their last provision of the statin pharmaceutical composition.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The term &#x201c;salt(s)&#x201d; includes salts of the compounds prepared by the neutralization of acids or bases, depending on the particular ligands or substituents found on the compounds described herein. When compounds of the present disclosure contain relatively acidic functionalities, base addition salts can be obtained by contacting the neutral form of such compounds with a sufficient amount of the desired base, either neat or in a suitable inert solvent. Examples of base addition salts include sodium, potassium calcium, ammonium, organic amino, or magnesium salt, or a similar salt. Examples of acid addition salts include those derived from inorganic acids like hydrochloric, hydrobromic, nitric, carbonic, monohydrogencarbonic, phosphoric, monohydrogenphosphoric, dihydrogenphosphoric, sulfuric, monohydrogensulfuric, hydriodic, or phosphorous acids, and the like, as well as the salts derived from relatively nontoxic organic acids like acetic, propionic, isobutyric, butyric, maleic, malic, malonic, benzoic, succinic, suberic, fumaric, lactic, mandelic, phthalic, benzenesulfonic, p-tolylsulfonic, citric, tartaric, methanesulfonic, and the like. Certain specific compounds of the present invention contain both basic and acidic functionalities that allow the compounds to be converted into either base or acid addition salts. Hydrates of the salts are also included.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In one aspect of the present disclosure, a survey (e.g., an assessment survey and/or a re-assessment survey) of a subject is provided to obtain an information set in order to determine if the subject qualifies for an over-the-counter (OTC) provision of a statin pharmaceutical composition for lowering cholesterol, e.g., thereby, treating or preventing an atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The information set is used as the basis for running filters in a first plurality of filters. If the triggering conditions of any of the filters in the first plurality of filters are fired, the subject does not qualify for the OTC statin pharmaceutical composition. In some embodiments, the information set is also used as the basis for running filters of a second plurality of filters. If the triggering conditions of any of the filters in the second plurality of filters are fired, the subject is provided with warning messages associated with the respective filters of the second plurality of filters that have been fired. If none of the filters in the first plurality of filters are fired and the subject successfully addresses the warning messages associated with the respective filters of the second plurality of filters that have been fired a fulfillment process is initiated for an OTC provision of the statin pharmaceutical composition.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example of an integrated system <b>48</b> for providing one or more surveys (e.g., an assessment survey and/or a re-assessment survey) of one or more subjects in order to qualifying the subjects for an OTC provision of a statin pharmaceutical composition.

For instance, in some embodiments, an assessment survey question is queried for lovastatin qualifying surveys but not for simvastatin qualifying surveys (e.g., the assessment survey question is not relevant for simvastatin). The skilled artisan will recognize that different statins carry different risk and drug interaction profiles. Accordingly, assessment survey information set (e.g., first information set) required for qualifying a subject for access to one statin with a known adverse drug interaction may not be necessary for qualifying the same subject for access to a second statin.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0142">Accordingly, it is contemplated that the characteristics elicited by the assessment survey questions <b>208</b> include any subset of survey results provided in Table 1.

For example, with reference to the workflow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, in some embodiments, the device transmits questions relating to all of the assessment filters of the first plurality of assessment filters, all of the assessment filters of the second plurality of assessment filters, or all of the assessment filters in the workflow (e.g., as a virtual assessment survey where all of the questions are displayed in a single user interface, or as a series of questions displayed in consecutive user interfaces). After receiving answers to all of the assessment survey questions, the device then applies an algorithm to run assessment information set against the assessment filters (e.g., sequentially or concurrently) to determine whether the subject is qualified to receive a provision of the statin pharmaceutical composition. In alternative embodiments, the device transmits questions relating to relating to a subset of assessment filters of the first category class, e.g., for which it could not obtain answers to the questions from an electronic database associated with the subject such as electronic health record of the subject, and/or relating to a subset of assessment filters of the second category class, e.g., that it could not obtain answers to the questions from an electronic database associated with the subject (e.g., as a virtual assessment survey where such unanswered questions are displayed in a single user interface, or as a series of questions displayed in consecutive user interfaces). After receiving answers to all of the survey questions, the device then applies the answers to all of the filters (e.g., sequentially or concurrently) to determine whether the subject is qualified to receive provision of the statin pharmaceutical composition.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0144">In some embodiments, the assessment survey and/or the re-assessment survey is conducted in a serial fashion, e.g., by transmitting a first question or a first group of survey questions (e.g., associated with a single respective filter) to the subject, receiving an answer to the single survey question or small group of survey questions, and applying an algorithm by running the answer or answers through a filter, prior to transmitting a second question or second group of questions to the subject. For example, with reference to the workflow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, in some embodiments the device transmits a first assessment question to the subject, relating to the cardiac event history of the subject (e.g., question <b>650</b> &#x2018;Have you ever had any of the following: A heart attack, stroke, or an operation or procedure on your heart?Developed peripheral artery disease (PAD)?&#x2019; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C</figref>). After receiving the answer to the survey question (e.g., &#x2018;yes or no&#x2019;), the device applies the algorithm to the answer by running the answer through a cardiac event filter (<b>816</b>). If the cardiac event filter is fired (e.g., in response to a &#x201c;yes&#x201d; answer), the device terminates (<b>805</b>) the process, and optionally provides the user with a message relating to why they are being denied a provision of the statin pharmaceutical composition, a suggestion for following-up with a medical professional (e.g., as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>, when the survey answers indicate that the subject has had a history of cardiac events (<b>816</b>), the device optionally terminates the process (<b>805</b>) and advises that the subject seek guidance from a professional medical practitioner), and/or a suggestion to make a lifestyle change (e.g., when the survey answers indicate that the subject has slightly elevated blood pressure (<b>832</b> and/or <b>834</b>), the device terminates the process (<b>803</b>) and advises that the subject improve their diet or exercise routine which is consistent with current blood pressure treatment guidelines), to treat or manage their blood pressure. In other embodiments, the assessment survey and/or the reassessment survey is completed prior to applying any of the answers to the corresponding algorithm.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0145">In some embodiments, one or more survey questions are not transmitted to a respective subject in accordance with a result to a previous survey question. For instance, in some embodiments where the ASCVD risk calculation is bypassed by an indication that the subject has a history of ASCVD (e.g., bypass mechanism <b>8443</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>E</figref>), if an assessment survey result indicates that a subject has a history of ASCVD (e.g., at step <b>816</b> and/or <b>818</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>), one or more assessment survey questions related to an ASCVD pooled cohort equation filter are bypassed (e.g., not transmitted to the user) because the ASCVD pooled cohort filter can be bypassed.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0146">As described in detail below, the methods disclosed herein include steps of applying information collected about a subject to a plurality of filters designed to identify contraindications&#x2014;which render the subject unsuitable for treatment with the statin pharmaceutical composition generally or at least in the self-care environment (i.e., without physician supervision)&#x2014;and risk factors&#x2014;which render administration of the statin pharmaceutical composition unnecessarily risky without further physician consultation. The contraindication and risk factors described herein are non-exhaustive, as the skilled artisan will know of other possible contraindications or risk factors for a particular statin pharmaceutical composition. Moreover, as medical research progresses, new contraindications or risk factors may be discovered. Or, similarly, the classification of existing contraindications or risk factors may change with additional medical research or consideration. For example, a factor considered to be a contraindication may be reclassified as a risk factor, over time, or vice-a-versa.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0147">Further, a contraindication for one statin pharmaceutical composition may only be a risk factor, or neither, for a different statin pharmaceutical composition, for example, based on different mechanisms, interaction, pharmacokinetic, and/or pharmacodynamics properties of the respective active ingredients. Similarly, a factor that is a contraindication or risk factor for a particular statin pharmaceutical composition when administered at one dose, e.g., a high, moderate, or low dose, may be classified differently when administered at a different dose. For example, a contraindication for a statin pharmaceutical composition administered at a high dose may only be a risk factor, or neither, when administered at a low dose. This is particularly true when the risk factor, e.g., a drug interaction, changes the bioavailability of the active ingredient by a certain factor, such that the bioavailability following high dose administration, but not low dose administration, would increase beyond a safe threshold.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0148">Blocks <b>4012</b>-<b>4132</b>. Referring to block <b>4012</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, the method includes applying an algorithm to the information set obtained through, at least in part, the assessment survey. Referring to block <b>4014</b>, all or a portion of the information set is run against a first plurality of assessment filters <b>214</b>-<b>1</b>. As previously described, the first plurality of assessment filters <b>214</b>-<b>1</b> includes a subset of filters <b>216</b>. When a respective filter in the first plurality of assessment filters <b>214</b>-<b>1</b> is fired (e.g., in accordance with a determination that a portion of the information set indicates that a triggering condition <b>218</b> has been met), the subject is deemed not qualified for provision of the statin pharmaceutical composition and the method is terminated without provision of the statin pharmaceutical composition.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0149">For example, in some embodiments, the device transmits a prompt to provide information about a possible contraindication for statin use (e.g., prompt <b>650</b> &#x201c;Have you ever had a heart attack, stroke, or an operation on your heart?,&#x201d; as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>), receives a response to the prompt, and then applies an algorithm to the response provided by the subject (e.g., through a pregnancy filter as described below). When the response indicates that a triggering condition has been met (e.g., the subject is pregnant), the filter is fired and the method is terminated without authorizing provision of the statin pharmaceutical composition to the subject. In some embodiments, the device transmits a message explaining why authorization of the statin pharmaceutical composition was denied. In some embodiments, the device transmits a message suggesting the subject consult with a medical professional, e.g., when the subject is deemed to need a stronger dosage of the statin pharmaceutical composition than available via the system and/or when the subject is deemed to be experiencing a medical emergency. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> illustrates an example message <b>652</b> provided to a subject who clinked &#x201c;Yes&#x201d; in response to prompt <b>650</b>, informing them that users with a history of cardiac events can have adverse effects to statin therapy, and advising them to consult with a clinician to discuss whether statin therapy would benefit them.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0150">In some embodiments, e.g., when the method is terminated without provision of the statin pharmaceutical composition, e.g., after a filter of the first type, the subject is prevented from attempting to re-qualify for the statin pharmaceutical composition for a predetermined period of time (e.g., 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, one year, two years, etc.).

For example, in some embodiments, a characteristic associated with a particular survey result will be informative if qualifying a subject for one particular statin pharmaceutical composition but not for another statin pharmaceutical composition. In some embodiments, one or more of the filters <b>216</b> provided in Table 2 is implemented as a second type filter (e.g., included in a second plurality of assessment filters), as described below, which generates a warning to the user and/or requires the user confirm they have discussed an underlying risk triggering the filter with a medical professional, e.g., instead of automatically terminating the process without authorizing provision of the statin pharmaceutical composition. For example, in some cases, the decision to implement one of the filters listed in Table 2 as a second type filter will be based on a consideration specific to a particular statin compound and/or dosage of the statin compound. Similarly, in other cases, the decision to implement one of the filters listed in Table 2 as a second type filter will be based on a change in health and/or regulatory guidelines.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0155">In some embodiments, the device is configured to conditionally bypass one or more of the filters <b>216</b> in the first plurality of assessment filters <b>214</b>. For example, as illustrated in example implementation <b>800</b>, when the device determines the subject is a male (e.g., as illustrated in step <b>806</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>) the pregnancy filter applied at step <b>810</b> is bypassed because it is not possible for the subject to become pregnant.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0156">In some embodiments, where a filter is conditionally bypassed, one or more supplemental filters may be used to better refine which subjects are qualified for provision of the statin pharmaceutical composition. For example, as illustrated in example implementation <b>800</b>, when the device determines the subject is a younger male with a family history of premature heart disease (e.g., as illustrated in steps <b>818</b> and <b>822</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>), filters relating to the calculation of an ASCVD risk (e.g., the cholesterol filters, triglyceride filter, blood pressure filters, and pooled cohort equation filters at steps <b>824</b>-<b>850</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>) are bypassed because the ASCVD pooled cohort equation cannot calculate an ASCVD risk for younger subjects. In some embodiments, this is a better option than merely excluding all younger subjects, because those with a family history of premature heart disease are more likely to develop premature heart disease themselves. However, it may be desirable to evaluate these subjects for signs of premature heart disease. For instance, as illustrated in steps <b>826</b>-<i>s </i>and <b>830</b>-<i>s</i>, supplemental LDL cholesterol and trigyceride filters are implemented as a replacement to similar bypassed filters. In this example, the supplemental LDL cholesterol filter sets a higher floor LDL cholesterol threshold of 160 mg/dL, rather than 70 mg/dL as used in the bypassed LDL cholesterol filter at step <b>826</b>. The higher threshold in the supplemental filter helps to eliminate subjects that have a family history of premature heart disease, but do not show indications of developing premature heart disease themselves.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0157">Age Filter</p><p id="p-0141" num="0158">Referring to blocks <b>4016</b>-<b>4026</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, in some embodiments the first plurality of assessment filters <b>214</b>-<b>1</b> includes an age filter (e.g., age filter <b>216</b>-<b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> and/or filter <b>1</b><i>a </i>in Table 2). In some embodiments, the age assessment filter is configured to be fired when the information set indicates that the subject fails to satisfy an age threshold (e.g., when the subject is too young) to receive the statin pharmaceutical composition. Generally, the age threshold will be set on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis (e.g., a first subject in one geographic region is of age to receive the statin pharmaceutical composition while a second subject in another geographic region of the same age is not permitted to receiving the statin pharmaceutical composition). In some embodiments, the age threshold is 16 years of age. In some embodiments, the age threshold is 18 years of age. In some embodiments, the age threshold is 20 years of age. In some embodiments, the age threshold is at least 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, or more years of age.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0159">In some embodiments, e.g., as in the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the age threshold is set independently for men and women. For instance, in some embodiments, a first age threshold is set for men, e.g., considering generally a safe age of maturity for administration of the statin pharmaceutical agent, requiring the subject be at least 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, or older. Similarly, in some embodiments, a second age threshold is set for women, considering whether the woman is of child-bearing age, e.g., requiring that a woman is at least 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, or older to be qualified for the statin pharmaceutical composition. Accordingly, in some embodiments, where an age threshold is set in order to exclude women of child-bearing age from a provision of the statin pharmaceutical agent, a pregnancy filter is excluded from the workflow. However, in some embodiments, a pregnancy filter is still included, despite use of a more restrictive age threshold for women.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0160">In some embodiments, the age filter is also configured to be fired when the first information indicates the subject fails to satisfy a ceiling age threshold (e.g., when the subject is too old). In some embodiments, the ceiling age threshold is 70 years old. In some embodiments, the ceiling age threshold is 75 years old. In some embodiments, the ceiling age threshold is 80 years old. In other embodiments, the ceiling age threshold is at least 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, or older.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0161">In some embodiments, e.g., when implemented as a first type of filter, when the age filter is fired, the subject is not permitted to obtain provision of the statin pharmaceutical composition pharmaceutical composition over-the-counter (e.g., the method is terminated without authorizing provision of the statin pharmaceutical composition to the subject). In some embodiments, e.g., when implemented as a second type of filter, when the age filter is fired, the subject is issued a warning associated with the filter, but is eligible to obtain provision of the statin pharmaceutical composition pharmaceutical composition over-the-counter upon satisfying the acknowledgement criteria associated with the warning (e.g., by confirming that they have discussed the risk factor with a medical professional and/or the medical professional has advised that the subject should take a statin pharmaceutical agent despite the risk factor).</p><p id="p-0145" num="0162">In some embodiments, age is also considered in combination with other characteristics of the subject in the information set. For example, in some embodiments, as illustrated at steps <b>818</b>-<b>820</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>, when the subject has not experienced a cardiac event and does not have a family history of premature cardiac disease, the device considers whether the subject is still relatively young, e.g., aged 20-39, and terminates (<b>803</b>) the process by firing a filter in the first class of filters. In some implementations of workflow <b>800</b>, the process is terminated at this step because the pooled cohort equation used to evaluate the subject's ASCVD risk (e.g., a 10-year risk estimate for a hard ASCVD event using the pooled cohort equations provided in Goff, D C Jr. et al., Circulation (<b>2013</b>) performed at step <b>844</b>) cannot be applied to younger subjects. Accordingly, when the subject does have a family history of premature coronary disease and is still relatively young, the system bypasses the pooled cohort equation filter at step <b>822</b>. Similarly, as illustrated at steps <b>844</b>-<b>450</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>E</figref>, in some embodiments, when the subject has a moderate ASCVD risk and is diabetic, the system evaluates whether the subject is older, e.g., at least 50 years old if a male and at least 60 years old if a female, and terminates the process (<b>805</b>) because of increased risks associated with statin use in older diabetics.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0163">While these particular steps consider the age of the subject, they are not necessarily tied to a dedicated age filter. Rather, they function to more finely define which subjects would most benefit from statin therapy. For example, by facilitating eligibility for younger patients with a family history of premature coronary disease, who would otherwise not be eligible because of the limitations of the particular pooled cohort equation filter, and by safeguarding older diabetic patients that are at higher risk for adverse events.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0164">Accordingly, in some embodiments, one or more of these supplemental age considerations are not included in the system, for instance, if all younger patients are disqualified by an age-specific filter (e.g., at step <b>808</b>), if all diabetic patients are excluded or included, or if a pooled cohort equation that can be applied to younger subjects are used. Alternatively, some or all of the supplemental age considerations can be integrated as part of the age filter, e.g., at step <b>808</b>.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0165">Pregnancy Filter</p><p id="p-0149" num="0166">Referring to blocks <b>4028</b>-<b>4030</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, in some embodiments the first plurality of assessment filters includes a pregnancy filter (e.g., pregnancy filter <b>216</b>-<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> and/or filter <b>2</b><i>a </i>in Table 2). The pregnancy filter is configured to be fired at least when the first information set indicates the subject is pregnant or breastfeeding. In some embodiments, the pregnancy filter is also configured to be fired when the subject is planning to become pregnant.

For example, in some embodiments, a waist circumference of at least 40 inches indicates that a man has a metabolic syndrome while a waist circumference of at least 35 inches indicates that a woman has a metabolic syndrome (e.g., where the predetermined threshold is set at 40 inches for men and 35 inches for women). In some embodiments, the predetermined threshold for men's waist circumference is at least 38 inches, at least 39 inches, at least 40 inches, at least 41 inches, or at least 42 inches. In some embodiments, the predetermined threshold for women's waist circumference is at least 33 inches, at least 34 inches, at least 35 inches, at least 36 inches, or at least 37 inches.</p><p id="p-0239" num="0260">In some embodiments, an HDL cholesterol level of less than 40 mg/dL is an indicator that the subject has a metabolic syndrome. In other embodiments, an HDL cholesterol level of less than 50 mg/dL, less than 45 mg/dL, less than less than 40 mg/dL, less than 35 mg/dL, or less than 30 mg/dL, is an indication that the subject has a metabolic syndrome.</p><p id="p-0240" num="0261">In some embodiments, a triglyceride level of greater than 150 mg/dL is an indicator that the subject has a metabolic syndrome. In other embodiments, a triglyceride level of greater than 125 mg/dL, greater than 150 mg/dL, greater than 175 mg/dL, or greater than 200 mg/dL, is an indicator that the subject has a metabolic syndrome.</p><p id="p-0241" num="0262">In some embodiments, an HDL cholesterol level of less than 50 mg/dL is an indicator that the subject has a metabolic syndrome. In some embodiments, an HDL cholesterol level of less than 40 mg/dL is an indicator that the subject has a metabolic syndrome. In other embodiments, an HDL cholesterol level of less than 55 mg/dL, less than 45 mg/dL, or less than 35 mg/dL is an indicator that the subject has a metabolic syndrome. In some embodiments, the threshold for an HDL cholesterol level that is an indicator of metabolic syndrome is determined differently for men and women. For example, in some embodiments, an HDL cholesterol level of less than 40 mg/dL indicates that a man has a metabolic syndrome while an HDL cholesterol level of less than 50 mg/dL indicates that a woman has a metabolic syndrome. In some embodiments, the threshold for men's HDL cholesterol level is less than 50 mg/dL, less than 45 mg/dL, less than 35 mg/dL, or less than 30 mg/dL. In some embodiments, the threshold for women's HDL cholesterol level is less than 60 mg/dL, less than 55 mg/dL, less than 45 mg/dL, or less than 40 mg/dL.</p><p id="p-0242" num="0263">In some embodiments, a subject's blood pressure is an indicator that the subject has metabolic disease when either the subject's systolic blood pressure or the subject's diastolic blood pressure is above a predetermined threshold. In some embodiments, the predetermined threshold for a systolic blood pressure is at least 130 mm Hg. In other embodiments, the predetermined threshold for a systolic threshold is at least 120 mm Hg, at least 125 mm Hg, at least 135 mm Hg, or at least 14 mmHg. In some embodiments, the predetermined threshold for a diastolic blood pressure is at least 85 mmHg. In other embodiments, the predetermined threshold for a diastolic blood pressure is at least 75 mm Hg, at least 80 mm Hg, at least 90 m Hg, or at least 95 Hg. Generally, if both of a subject's systolic and diastolic blood pressures satisfy a predetermined threshold, a single indicator of metabolic disease is counted. However, in other embodiments, each would be counted as a separate indicator.</p><p id="p-0243" num="0264">In some embodiments, a fasting glucose level of at least 100 mg/dL is an indicator that the subject has a metabolic syndrome. In other embodiments, a fasting glucose level of greater than 80 mg/dL, greater than 90 mg/dL, greater than 110 mg/dL, or greater than 120 mg/dL, is an indicator that the subject has a metabolic syndrome.</p><p id="p-0244" num="0265">Referring to block <b>4134</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>J</figref>, in some embodiments the method also includes using the algorithm to run all or a portion of the information set against a second plurality of assessment filters <b>220</b>-<b>1</b>.

For example, in some embodiments, a characteristic associated with a particular survey question will be informative when qualifying a subject for one particular statin but not for another statin. For instance, a re-assessment survey question is queried for simvastatin qualifying re-assessment surveys but not for rosuvastatin qualifying re-assessment surveys (e.g., the assessment survey question is not relevant for rosuvastatin). The skilled artisan will recognize that different statin pharmaceutical compositions carry different risk and drug interaction profiles. Accordingly, survey information required for qualifying a subject for access to one statin pharmaceutical composition with a known adverse drug interaction may not be necessary for qualifying the same subject for access to a second statin pharmaceutical composition.</p><p id="p-0290" num="0309">Accordingly, it is contemplated that the characteristics elicited by the re-assessment survey questions include any sub-set of the information set provided in Table 5. For brevity, all possible combinations of the characteristics provided in Table 5 are not specifically delineated here. However, the skilled artisan will easily be able to envision any particular subset of survey questions designed to elicit responses to any subset of characteristics provided in Table 5. Likewise, the skilled artisan may know of other survey questions, not provided in Table 5, that may be combined with any subset of the survey questions provided in Table 5 to form the re-assessment survey questions used in the methods described herein.</p><p id="p-0291" num="0310">In some embodiments, the assessment survey and/or the re-assessment survey is conducted by transmitting a plurality of respective questions to the subject, e.g., some or all of the respective survey questions, and receiving answers to the plurality of respective survey questions before applying any of the answers to respective filters. For example, with reference to the workflow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, in some embodiments, the device transmits questions relating to all of the re-assessment filters of the first plurality of re-assessment filters, all of the re-assessment filters of the second plurality of re-assessment filters, or all of the re-assessment filters in the workflow (e.g., as a virtual re-assessment survey where all of the questions are displayed in a single user interface, or as a series of questions displayed in consecutive user interfaces). After receiving answers to all of the re-assessment survey questions, the device then applies an algorithm to run assessment information set against the re-assessment filters (e.g., sequentially or concurrently) to determine whether the subject is re-qualified to receive a provision of the statin pharmaceutical composition. In alternative embodiments, the device transmits questions relating to a subset of re-assessment filters of the first category class, e.g., for which it could not obtain answers to the questions from an electronic database associated with the subject such as electronic health record of the subject, and/or relating to a subset of re-assessment filters of the second category class, e.g., that it could not obtain answers to the questions from an electronic database associated with the subject (e.g., as a virtual re-assessment survey where such unanswered questions are displayed in a single user interface, or as a series of questions displayed in consecutive user interfaces). After receiving answers to all of the survey questions, the device then applies the answers to all of the filters (e.g., sequentially or concurrently) to determine whether the subject is re-qualified to receive provision of the statin pharmaceutical composition.</p><p id="p-0292" num="0311">In some embodiments, the assessment survey and/or the re-assessment survey is conducted in a serial fashion, e.g., by transmitting a first question or a first group of survey questions (e.g., associated with a single respective filter) to the subject, receiving an answer to the single survey question or small group of survey questions, and applying an algorithm by running the answer or answers through a filter, prior to transmitting a second question or second group of questions to the subject. For example, with reference to the workflow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, in some embodiments the device transmits a first re-assessment question to the subject, relating to contraindicated drugs. After receiving the answer to the survey question, the device applies the algorithm to the answer by running (<b>922</b>) the answer through a severe drug interaction filter cardiac event filter. If the severe drug interaction filter is fired, the device terminates (<b>909</b>) the process, and optionally provides the user with a message relating to why they are being denied a provision of the statin pharmaceutical composition, a suggestion for following-up with a medical professional, and/or a suggestion to make a lifestyle change. In other embodiments, the assessment survey and/or the reassessment survey is completed prior to applying any of the answers to the corresponding algorithm.</p><p id="p-0293" num="0312">In some embodiments, one or more survey questions are not transmitted to a respective subject in accordance with a result to a previous survey question. For instance, in some embodiments the pregnancy filter is bypassed because the subject is male (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>) and, consequently, one or more re-assessment survey questions related to pregnancy are bypassed (e.g., not transmitted to the user).</p><p id="p-0294" num="0313">As described in detail below, the methods disclosed herein include steps of applying information collected about a subject to a plurality of filters designed to identify contraindications&#x2014;which render the subject unsuitable for treatment with the statin pharmaceutical composition generally or at least in the self-care environment (i.e., without physician supervision)&#x2014;and risk factors&#x2014;which render administration of the statin pharmaceutical composition unnecessarily risky without further physician consultation. The contraindication and risk factors described herein are non-exhaustive, as the skilled artisan will know of other possible contraindications or risk factors for a particular statin pharmaceutical composition. Moreover, as medical research progresses, new contraindications or risk factors may be discovered. Or, similarly, the classification of existing contraindications or risk factors may change with additional medical research or consideration. For example, a factor considered to be a contraindication may be reclassified as a risk factor, over time, or vice-a-versa.</p><p id="p-0295" num="0314">Further, a contraindication for one statin pharmaceutical composition may only be a risk factor, or neither, for a different statin pharmaceutical composition, for example, based on different mechanisms, interaction, pharmacokinetic, and/or pharmacodynamics properties of the respective active ingredients. Similarly, a factor that is a contraindication or risk factor for a particular statin pharmaceutical composition when administered at one dose, e.g., a high, moderate, or low dose, may be classified differently when administered at a different dose. For example, a contraindication for a statin pharmaceutical composition administered at a high dose may only be a risk factor, or neither, when administered at a low dose. This is particularly true when the risk factor, e.g., a drug interaction, changes the bioavailability of the active ingredient by a certain factor, such that the bioavailability following high dose administration, but not low dose administration, would increase beyond a safe threshold.</p><p id="p-0296" num="0315">Referring to blocks <b>5012</b> and <b>5014</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, the method includes applying an algorithm to the information set obtained through, at least in part, the re-assessment survey.

If the subject's answer indicates their LDL cholesterol level is intermediately elevated (e.g., between 160 mg/dL and 190 mg/dL), the device creates a record (<b>813</b>-<b>3</b>) indicating that the user has a risk enhancing factor.</p><p id="p-0366" num="0383">When the LDL cholesterol filter is not fired, the device proceeds by prompting the subject to provide information about their HDL cholesterol level and then applies (<b>828</b>) the answer to an HDL cholesterol filter (e.g., filter <b>216</b>-<b>7</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> and/or filter <b>7</b><i>a </i>in Table 2). When the HDL cholesterol filter is fired (e.g., when the subject indicates an HDL cholesterol level of less than 20 mg/dL or at least 100 mg/dL), the device terminates (<b>803</b>) the qualification process without authorizing provision of the statin pharmaceutical composition and, optionally, transmits advice to the user as to why they should not take statin pharmaceutical composition. If the subject's answer indicates their LDL cholesterol level is intermediately decreased (e.g., between 20 mg/dL and 40 mg/dL), the device creates a record (<b>815</b>-<b>1</b>) indicating that the user has an indicator of metabolic disease.</p><p id="p-0367" num="0384">When the HDL cholesterol filter is not fired, the device proceeds by prompting the subject to provide information about their triglyceride level and applies (<b>830</b>) the answer received from the subject to a triglyceride level filter (e.g., filter <b>216</b>-<b>8</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> and/or filter <b>8</b><i>a </i>in Table 2). When the triglyceride level filter is fired (e.g., when the subject indicates a triglyceride level of at least 500 mg/dL), the device terminates (<b>805</b>) the qualification process without authorizing provision of the statin pharmaceutical composition and, optionally, transmits advice to the user as to why they should not take statin pharmaceutical composition and/or to discuss taking a statin pharmaceutical composition with a medical professional. If the subject's answer indicates their triglyceride level is intermediately elevated (e.g., between 175 mg/dL and 500 mg/dL), the device creates a record (<b>813</b>-<b>4</b>) indicating that the user has a risk enhancing factor. If the subject's answer indicates their triglyceride level is slightly elevated (e.g., between 150 mg/dL and 175 mg/dL), the device creates a record (<b>815</b>-<b>2</b>) indicating that the user has an indicator of metabolic disease.</p><p id="p-0368" num="0385">When the triglyceride filter is not fired, the device proceeds by prompting the subject to provide information about blood pressure and applies (<b>832</b>) the answer received from the subject to a blood pressure filter (e.g., filter <b>216</b>-<b>9</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> and/or filter <b>9</b><i>a </i>in Table 2). When the blood pressure filter is fired (e.g., when the answer indicates the subject has a systolic blood pressure of less an 90 mmHg or greater than 180 mmHg, or the subject has a diastolic blood pressure of greater than 120 mmHg), the device terminates (<b>803</b>) the qualification process without authorizing provision of the statin pharmaceutical composition, and, optionally, transmits advice for the subject as to why they should not use a statin pharmaceutical composition and/or to seek immediate medical attention for hypertensive crisis (e.g., when the subject indicates they have a systolic blood pressure of greater than 180 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure of greater than 120 mmHg). If the subject's answer indicates their systolic blood pressure or diastolic blood pressure is moderately elevated (e.g., a systolic blood pressure of between 130 mmHg and 180 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure of between 85 mmHg and 120 mmHg), the device creates a record (<b>815</b>-<b>3</b>) indicating that the user has an indicator of metabolic disease.</p><p id="p-0369" num="0386">When the blood pressure filter is not fired, the device proceeds with the qualification process, prompting the subject to provide information about whether they are currently taking blood pressure medication (<b>836</b>), whether they have diabetes (<b>840</b>), and their history of smoking (<b>842</b>). If the subject's answers indicate they are currently taking a blood pressure medication, and the subject did not have a blood pressure indicative of metabolic disease (e.g., no record was created (<b>815</b>-<b>3</b>), as described above), the device creates a record (<b>815</b>-<b>3</b>) indicating that the user has an indicator of metabolic disease. The device then calculates an atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) event risk for the subject (e.g., based on the answers to previous prompts, including characteristics discussed above with respect to Table 3) and applies (<b>844</b>) the calculated risk to an ASCVD pooled cohort equation filter (e.g., filter <b>216</b>-<b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> and/or filter <b>10</b><i>a </i>in Table 2).

The device prompts the subject to indicate whether they have diabetes and then evaluates (<b>846</b>-<i>a</i>) the answer in view of the subject's gender (<b>848</b>-<i>a</i>) and age (<b>850</b>-<i>a</i>). When the device determines the subject has an increased risk of an ASCVD event, the device fires the ASCVD pooled cohort equation filter and the device terminates (<b>805</b>) the qualification process without authorizing provision of the statin pharmaceutical composition and, optionally, transmits advice to the user to discuss taking a statin pharmaceutical composition with a medical professional.</p><p id="p-0372" num="0389">Alternatively, when the device has followed bypass path B, the device bypasses the total cholesterol filter, the LDL cholesterol filter, the HDL cholesterol filter, the triglyceride filter, the blood pressure filter, and the ASCVD pooled cohort equation filter, as described above. Rather, the device proceeds by prompting the subject to provide information about their LDL cholesterol level and then applies (<b>826</b>-<i>b</i>) the answer to an alternate LDL cholesterol filter (e.g., an alternate version of filter <b>216</b>-<b>6</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> and/or filter <b>6</b><i>a </i>in Table 2). When the alternative LDL cholesterol filter is fired (e.g., when the subject indicates an LDL cholesterol level of less than 70 mg/dL or at least 190 mg/dL), the device terminates (<b>803</b> or <b>805</b>) the qualification process without authorizing provision of the statin pharmaceutical composition and, optionally, transmits advice to the user as to why they should not take statin pharmaceutical composition and/or to discuss taking a statin pharmaceutical composition with a medical professional (e.g., where their LDL cholesterol level is at least 190 mg/dL). When the alternative LDL cholesterol filter is not fired, the device proceeds by prompting the subject to provide information about their triglyceride level and applies (<b>830</b>-<i>b</i>) the answer received from the subject to a triglyceride level filter (e.g., an alternate filter <b>216</b>-<b>8</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> and/or filter <b>8</b><i>a </i>in Table 2). When the alternate triglyceride level filter is fired (e.g., when the subject indicates a triglyceride level of at least 500 mg/dL), the device terminates (<b>805</b>) the qualification process without authorizing provision of the statin pharmaceutical composition and, optionally, transmits advice to the user as to why they should not take statin pharmaceutical composition and/or to discuss taking a statin pharmaceutical composition with a medical professional.</p><p id="p-0373" num="0390">When the ASCVD pooled cohort equation filter or alternate triglyceride level filter is not fired, the proceeds with the qualification process, prompting the subject to indicate whether they have had a liver condition and then applies (<b>852</b>) the answer received from the subject to a liver condition filter (e.g., filter <b>216</b>-<b>11</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> and/or filter <b>11</b><i>a </i>in Table 2). When the liver condition filter is fired (e.g., when the answer indicates the subject has had a liver condition), the device the terminates (<b>803</b>) the qualification process without authorizing provision of the statin pharmaceutical composition and, optionally, transmits advice to the user as to why they should not take statin pharmaceutical composition.</p><p id="p-0374" num="0391">When the liver condition filter is not fired, the device proceeds with the qualification process, prompting the subject to indicate whether they have a kidney problem and applies (<b>854</b>) the answer received from the subject to a kidney disorder filter (e.g., filter <b>5</b><i>b </i>in Table 4). When the kidney disorder filter is fired (e.g., when the answer indicates the subject has had a kidney problem), the device initiates (<b>811</b>-<b>1</b>) an override procedure (e.g., creating a record indicating that the user must confirm they have discussed taking a statin pharmaceutical composition with a health care provider).</p><p id="p-0375" num="0392">The device proceeds with the qualification process, prompting the subject to indicate their alcohol consumption status and applies (<b>856</b>) the answer received from the subject to alcohol consumption filter (e.g., filter <b>222</b>-<b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> and/or filter <b>1</b><i>b </i>of Table 4). When the alcohol consumption filter is fired (e.g., when the answer indicates the subject consumes alcoholic drinks at a frequency above a ceiling frequency), the device initiates (<b>811</b>-<b>2</b>) an override procedure (e.g., creating a record indicating that the user must confirm they have discussed taking a statin pharmaceutical composition with a health care provider).</p><p id="p-0376" num="0393">The device proceeds with the qualification process, prompting the subject to indicate whether the subject has had an adverse reaction to a cholesterol lowering drug and applies (<b>858</b>) the answer received from the subject to an adverse reaction filter (e.g., filter <b>222</b>-<b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> and/or one of filters <b>2</b><i>b </i>and <b>4</b><i>b </i>in Table 4). When the adverse reaction filter is fired (e.g., when the answer indicates the subject has had an adverse reaction to a cholesterol lowering medication), the device initiates (<b>811</b>-<b>3</b>) an override procedure (e.g., creating a record indicating that the user must confirm they have discussed taking a statin pharmaceutical composition with a health care provider).</p><p id="p-0377" num="0394">The device proceeds with the qualification process, prompting the subject to indicate if they are taking a composition that interacts with the statin pharmaceutical composition, and/or evaluates previous answers about the medications the subject is taking, and then applies (<b>860</b>) the answer received from the subject to a moderate drug interaction filter (e.g., filter <b>222</b>-<b>3</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> and/or filter <b>3</b><i>b </i>in Table 4). When the moderate drug interaction filter is fired (e.g., when the answer indicates the subject is taking a medication that constitutes a risk factor for co-administration of the statin pharmaceutical composition), the device initiates (<b>811</b>-<b>4</b>) an override procedure (e.g., creating a record indicating that the user must confirm they have discussed taking a statin pharmaceutical composition with a health care provider).</p><p id="p-0378" num="0395">The device then proceeds by evaluating whether the subject has risk enhancing factors sufficient to justify treatment with the statin pharmaceutical composition.

When the subject's information collected to that point does not indicate the subject has a risk enhancing factor, justifying statin therapy, the device begins determining if the subject has other risk enhancing factors.</p><p id="p-0379" num="0396">For instance, the device evaluates (<b>864</b>-<i>a</i>) whether the subject has metabolic syndrome based on the subject's previous answers (e.g., relating to HDL cholesterol level, triglyceride level, and blood pressure). When it's determined the subject has metabolic syndrome, the device creates a record (<b>813</b>-<b>5</b>) indicating that the user has a risk enhancing factor, and proceeds along pathway J. If not, the device evaluates (<b>864</b>-<i>b</i>) whether the subject has at least two indicators of metabolic syndrome based on the subject's previous answers. When it's determined the subject has at least two indicators of metabolic syndrome, the device determines (<b>866</b>) whether the subject is a male or female, prompts the user to indicate their waist size, and evaluates (<b>868</b>) the answer. When the answer indicates the subject has a waist size indicative of metabolic syndrome, the device creates a record (<b>813</b>-<b>5</b>) indicating that the user has a risk enhancing factor, and proceeds along pathway J.</p><p id="p-0380" num="0397">Similarly, the device prompts the subject to indicate whether they have an inflammatory disease and evaluates (<b>870</b>) the answer received from the subject.

When the answer indicates the subject has experienced preeclampsia, the device creates a record (<b>813</b>-<b>7</b>) indicating that the user has a risk enhancing factor, and proceeds along pathway J. Optionally, the device then prompts the subject to indicate whether they have experienced premature menopause and evaluates (<b>874</b>) the answer received from the subject. When the answer indicates the subject has premature menopause, the device creates a record (<b>813</b>-<b>8</b>) indicating that the user has a risk enhancing factor, and proceeds along pathway J.</p><p id="p-0382" num="0399">Similarly, the device determines (<b>878</b>) whether the subject knows their C-reactive protein and/or coronary artery calcium levels. When the scores are known, the device prompts the user to indicate their C-reactive protein level and evaluates (<b>880</b>) the answer received from the subject. When the answer indicates the subject has elevated C-reactive protein levels, the device creates a record (<b>813</b>-<b>9</b>) indicating that the user has a risk enhancing factor, and proceeds along pathway J. Optionally, the device then prompts the user to indicate their coronary artery calcium level and evaluates (<b>882</b>) the answer received from the subject. When the answer indicates the subject has a sufficiently elevated coronary artery calcium level score (e.g., any coronary artery calcium for an older subject or significantly elevated coronary artery calcium levels in younger subjects), the device creates a record (<b>813</b>-<b>10</b>) indicating that the user has a risk enhancing factor, and proceeds along pathway J.</p><p id="p-0383" num="0400">When the risk enhancing factor filter is fired (e.g., when the answers indicate the subject still does not have sufficient risk enhancing factors to justify statin therapy), the device the terminates (<b>805</b>) the qualification process without authorizing provision of the statin pharmaceutical composition and, optionally, transmits advice to the user as to why they should not take statin pharmaceutical composition.</p><p id="p-0384" num="0401">When the risk enhancing factor filter is not fired, the device proceeds along pathway J by prompting the subject to confirm the answers they have provided (<b>884</b>).

the methods, systems, and software described herein for various statin pharmaceutical compositions. However, these examples do not imply that these are the only useful implementations of the methods, systems, and software described herein for each individual statin pharmaceutical agent. The skilled artisan will know how to change each of these implementations according to their particular goals and desired safety profiles, e.g., based on the identity and/or dosage of the statin active ingredient. For instance, kidney disease filters are not included in some of the examples given below. However, in some embodiments the skilled artisan may be motivated to add such a filter to a particular system. For instance, while renal impairment is not a classical risk factor for low dose pravastatin pharmaceutical compositions, severe renal impairment is a known predisposition factor for myopathy and, thus, the skilled artisan may choose to implement a kidney disease filter in a system for qualifying patients to receive OTC pravastatin.</p><p id="p-0481" num="0496">Example 1: A computer system is prepared for qualifying a human subject for delivery of a rosuvastatin pharmaceutical composition (e.g., low-dose CRESTOR) over the counter to treat or prevent an atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (e.g., by lowering cholesterol).</p><p id="p-0482" num="0497">The computer system includes instructions for conducting a survey of the subject, to obtain an age of the subject, a gender of the subject, if the subject is female, whether they are (i) pregnant, (ii) breastfeeding, or (iii) planning to become pregnant, a race of the subject, whether the subject is taking one or more medications that interact with the statin pharmaceutical composition (e.g., cyclosporine, warfarin, colchicine, lipid-lowering medications such as fibrates, and/or an anti-viral protease inhibitors), whether the subject has ever had an atherosclerotic cardiovascular event or had a heart procedure, whether the subject has a family history of premature ASCVD events, a total cholesterol level of the subject, an LDL cholesterol level of the subject, an HDL cholesterol level of the subject, a triglyceride level of the subject, a systolic blood pressure of the subject, a diastolic blood pressure of the subject, whether the subject is taking a medication for high blood pressure, whether the subject has diabetes, whether the subject is a smoker, whether the subject has or has ever had liver disease, whether the subject has or has ever had kidney disease, an alcohol consumption status of the subject, and whether the subject has ever has an adverse reaction to a cholesterol lowering medication.</p><p id="p-0483" num="0498">The computer system runs survey results against a first series of filters that each prevents authorization for delivery of the OTC rosuvastatin where the subject's survey results identify a contraindication for the OTC rosuvastatin.
