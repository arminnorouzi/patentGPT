Removal of reverse torque from rotary generators associated with converting mechanical energy into electrical power may provide an opportunity for an electrically powered, highly efficient power generation plant. Removal of reverse torque allows an alternating current (AC) or direct current (DC) generator to operate with a significant increase in efficiency, thereby driving the generator of a power generation plant with a smaller electric motor.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0009">The World's first known electrical generator was Faraday's disk dynamo. Michael Faraday discovered the operating principle of electromagnetic generators in the years 1831-1889. His observations were later reduced into a principle called Faraday's Law written by James Clerk Maxwell. The Law states that an electromagnetic force is generated in an electrical conductor that encircles a varying magnetic flux. Faraday built the first magnetic rotary induction generator called a Faraday Disc. This first generator was a type of homo-polar generator, using a copper disc rotating between poles of a horseshoe magnet. This generator produced a small DC voltage, but high amperage. The Faraday dynamo or uni-pole (or uni-polar) generator, however, did not lend itself well to practical commercial development because of the nature of its output, i.e., very low DC voltage at extremely high current. The Faraday generator does lend itself well, however, to the study of the mechanisms of reverse torque in electrical induction machines.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0010">Conventional generators in use today require by common definition, 1 horsepower (HP) of kinetic energy input to generate 746 watts (W) of electrical energy. This relationship of mechanical horsepower to electrical watts involves derived units of power which have evolved from observations and measurements on physical and electrical machines (as well as horses).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0011">The term &#x201c;watt&#x201d; was named after James Watt, a Scottish scientist, for his work on improving the steam engine and quantifying the power of the steam engine. The unit &#x201c;watt&#x201d; was recognized by the Second Congress of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1889, concurrent with the start of commercial power production. The dynamo was the first electrical generator capable of delivering power to industry and is still an important generator in use even to this day. The dynamo uses a particular machine design and electromagnetic principles to convert mechanical rotation of magnetic poles into an alternating electric current. The first commercial power plants, which were operated in Paris in the 1870's, were designed by Zenobe Gramme. The use of electric generators made it desirable to establish a common unit for electrical power in order to conventionalize this newly evolving energy source. The watt is a derived unit of power (i.e., an algebraic combination of base units). The watt is now an approved unit of the International System of Units (SI).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0012">As defined, 1 watt is the rate at which work is done when an object's velocity is held constant at 1 meter per second against a constant opposing force of 1 Newton.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>W=J/S=N&#xb7;M/S=Kg&#xb7;M</i><sup>2</sup><i>/S</i><sup>3 </sup><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0011" num="0013">J=Joule M=Meter N=Newton Kg=Kilogram</p><p id="p-0012" num="0014">Joule=Work done when a force of 1 Newton is displaced through a distance of 1 Meter</p><p id="p-0013" num="0015">1 Joule=1 watt-second, 10<sup>7 </sup>ergs=0.2390 calories or 0.738 foot-pound (ft-lb).</p><p id="p-0014" num="0016">Therefore, if one mechanical horsepower is equal to 550 ft-lb per second (or 33,000 ft-lb per minute), then by definition of the watt being 0.738 ft-lb per second, 1 HP=550 ft-lb per second/0.738 ft-lb per second=745.257 W, and by definition, the electrical watt is the rate at which work is done when 1 ampere (A) of current flows through an electric potential difference of 1 volt (V):</p><p id="p-0015" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>W=V&#xd7;A </i><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0016" num="0017">745.257 watts=27.299 V&#xd7;27.299 A or any combination of amps and volts in which the product is equal to 745.257 watts. Therefore, by definition and derivation, 1 HP=746 watts.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0018">The original work on which these units hinge was performed by James Watt who introduced the term &#x201c;horsepower&#x201d; when he wanted to explain how powerful his steam engines were compared to horses. After some tests (not with engines, rather with horses), he established that, on average, the horses being used could pull coal up a mine shaft at the rate of 22,000 ft-lb per minute. For whatever reason, he decided to raise this number by 50% and arrived at a number which is commonly accepted as 33,000 ft-lb per minute. So, if an engine or any rotary machine may push 33,000 lbs. of something 1 foot in 1 minute, the machine is considered a 1 HP engine.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0019">As noted above, a conventional generator requires, by definition, 1 HP to generate 746 watts plus enough additional horsepower to turn the physical mechanisms of the rotor at proper speed to maintain the desired frequency. The horsepower required to spin the mechanism is usually about 0.2 HP in a conventional generator to generate 746 watts for a total 1.2 HP needed to generate the 746 watts, although only 0.2 HP of that energy is used to actually generate the electrical power. The remaining 1 HP, which is equal to 746 watts, is required to overcome the reverse torque or so-called &#x201c;back electromotive force&#x201d; (back EMF).</p><p id="p-0019" num="0020">The back EMF or reverse torque of rotary generators in use today can best be described by reference to &#x201c;Lenz's Law.&#x201d; It, in summary, states that when an EMF is generated by a change in magnetic flux, according to Faraday's Law, the polarity of the induced EMF is such that it produces a current whose magnetic field opposes the magnetic flux which produces it. The induced magnetic field inside a loop of wires acts to keep the magnetic flux in the loop constant. If the magnetic field B is increasing, the induced magnetic field acts in equal and opposite direction to it; if it is decreasing, the induced magnetic field acts in the direction of the applied field with equal force. In conventional generators, the rotor is stationed inside the coil loops of the stator and rotates to generate a current in the stator which in turn generates a magnetic field which is equal in force and opposite in polarity to magnetic field B. Thus, reverse torque is a product of the design or design flaw of conventional generators.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0021">In the case of the generator of the current disclosure, the rotors are solid state and do not rotate, the magnetic poles rotate and, therefore, there is no reverse torque or pole to pole magnetic drag between the rotor and the stator. This induced pole in the stator iron is induced by current flow and is not responsible for a current flow, as is evidenced by the fact that the generator reaches full voltage prior to current going to an electrical load.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0022">In a conventional generator, due to the reverse torque, about 85% more mechanical energy is required to turn the rotor than is required to generate power. However, in the case of the current disclosure, the generator only requires energy to excite the rotor to generate the rotating magnetic poles. Therefore, the system and method take the power required and cycles it back to drive the generator and the remaining power is usable electric power to be used for whatever purpose is required, such as powering the electric motor disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0023">The Lenz losses, as noted above, are related to inductive coupling between the rotor standing poles and the stator induced poles. In addition to our current work and observations on reduction of reverse torque, Nikola Tesla published an article entitled &#x201c;Notes on an Unipolar Dynamo&#x201d;, Nikola Tesla, The Electrical Engineer, N.Y. Sep. 2, 1891. Tesla reported upon a modification of the Faraday Dynamo design. Tesla's design varied in two major ways:<ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0024">1. First, he used a magnet that was bigger in diameter than the disc, so that the magnet completely covered the disc.</li>        <li id="ul0003-0002" num="0025">2. Second, he divided the disc into sections with spiral curves out from the center of the outside edge.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0023" num="0026">The Tesla modification caused the current to make a full trip around the outside edge of the disc. Because the current is flowing in a large circle at the rim of the disc, the magnetic field created does not work against the field magnet. This modification eliminated the biggest problem of electric power generation, i.e., the reaction to every action or as is commonly called, reverse torque or back EMF.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0027">This design change and its effect on reverse torque were accomplished by geometric isolation of the standing pole from the induced pole of the machine. In the case of the current disclosure, the rotor is static, i.e., not rotating, and, therefore, reverse torque is not an issue. The induced pole is induced by current flow which is generated by the standing pole. As noted above, the induced pole is not responsible for current flow or power generation in the induced coils. This design change removes Lenz losses produced by the induced stator poles attracting and repelling polar coupling between the stator poles and the rotor poles.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0028">The generator's solid state rotor, disclosed herein, is virtually free of reverse torque due to four design changes when compared to the standard electric rotary generator:<ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0029">1. The rotor has no moving parts.</li>        <li id="ul0005-0002" num="0030">2. The rotor does not rotate in the stator cavity.</li>        <li id="ul0005-0003" num="0031">3. The magnetic poles rotate in proper frequency and sequence to generate the desired electric power output.</li>        <li id="ul0005-0004" num="0032">4. The rotor can be used to retrofit any conventional generator&#x2014;single-phase, two-phase, or three-phase.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0026" num="0033">Consistent with the present disclosure, apparatus and methods are provided for an electric generator with reduced reverse torque and for an electric drive motor, which can be powered by the generator, to drive the fan of a turbofan jet engine or the propeller rotated by an electric engine of an aircraft. The high efficiency power plant allows the utilization of an electric jet engine or propeller electric engine. Without the availability of an abundant on-board electric power supply, global flight powered solely by electricity is difficult to impossible. However, with the on-board power supply discussed below, unlimited electric energy is available to power all needs of the aircraft.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0034">The electric generator of the present disclosure utilizes a solid state rotor that does not rotate which allows for power generation without reverse torque or the usual energy required to rotate the rotor inside the stator of the generator. Only the magnetic poles of the disclosed rotor rotate to generate the power.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0035">As noted above, both propeller driven and jet driven aircraft may be powered with the generator of the current disclosure. The propeller driven aircraft will operate by replacing the fossil fuel turbine or the internal combustion engine with an electric drive motor.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0036">In order to operate with electric power, the jet engine must be redesigned. The turbofan jet is the most widely used jet engine in use today. This engine is very functional but burns massive amounts of jet fuel and pollutes the environment. In addition, the aircraft must carry massive amounts of jet fuel onboard in order to fly using one or more jet engines.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0037">In the case of the electric turbofan jet engine of the current disclosure, the electric power source requires no fuel or recharge. The engine is quieter and non-polluting. In addition, the aircraft does not need to carry a heavy load of explosive fuel.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0038">The fan blades of the turbofan jet engine disclosed herein are driven by an electric motor in which the rotor is a part of the fan as well as by the drive from the high pressure turbine. A large set of fan blades is set right in front of the inlet to the jet engine. The fan works like a propeller in that it pushes large amounts of air backward which in turn pushes the engine and, thus, aircraft forward. The air that is pushed backward is divided. A portion of the air which is pushed back goes into the engine and some of the air bypasses the engine. The fan shaft is attached to the turbojet, and the high pressure turbine drives the fan as well as the low pressure compressor. The air that is blown out the back of the engine also pushes the engine and aircraft forward while simultaneously driving the fan which also functions as a propeller.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0039">A turboprop engine of works in the same manner as that of a turbofan jet engine except the fan is replaced by a propeller with the propeller being placed outside of the air inlet. Air is taken in through the inlet and thrust into the engine bypass as well as into the engine proper. The air in the engine is first compressed by the low pressure compressor. The low pressure compressor is driven by the built-in electric motor disclosed herein and the low pressure turbine. The propeller is driven by the built-in electric motor and the low pressure turbine. The low pressure turbine is driven by the jet stream of hot gases from the hot section of the engine. Air flows from the low pressure compressor into the high pressure compressor which compresses the air before it flows into the hot section of the engine. The high pressure compressor is powered by the high pressure turbine. The high pressure turbine and the low pressure turbine are driven by the blast of hot gases from the engine's hot section out to the rear of the jet engine.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0040">The compressed air is fed into the hot section of the engine where it is expanded by heat from an electrical heating system, for example, high resistance calrod units, contained inside the hot section. The thrust of this engine is controlled by the motor built into the fan structure, the current flow through the calrods and thrust control flaps in the walls of the hot section.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0034" num="0041">The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute part of this specification, and together with the description, illustrate and serve to explain the principles of various exemplary embodiments.

In accordance with various exemplary embodiments discussed and described herein by way of brief summary, an exemplary all-electric turbofan jet engine is powered by an exemplary electric motor which is powered by an exemplary solid state electric power plant is presented.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an exemplary turbofan jet engine attached to the fuselage of, for example, a small, twin jet aircraft.

As illustrated, the inward poles of the stators are of a first polarity (e.g., south pole).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0052">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, outer cowling <b>1</b> and fan <b>2</b> and its fan blades <b>2</b> are removed from the engine, revealing exemplary wound stator pole irons <b>6</b>-<b>13</b> with their coil windings <b>14</b>-<b>21</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and exemplary rotor member <b>22</b> with rotor poles <b>23</b>-<b>26</b> of the exemplary electric motor <b>2</b><i>a </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. Rotor poles <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> facing outward toward the stator pole irons are of a first polarity (e.g., south pole) whereas rotor poles <b>23</b> and <b>25</b> facing outward are of a second polarity (e.g., north pole). The rotor magnets can be either permanent magnets or electromagnets.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0053">The stator pole irons are activated in sequence such that they spin rotor member <b>22</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. When activated, winding coils <b>14</b>-<b>21</b> are sequentially activated making stator pole irons <b>6</b>-<b>13</b> a first polarity (south pole) facing the rotor member. The stator poles are powered with DC power from the exemplary onboard solid state power generator discussed below. The stator pole irons are excited sequentially for 0.75 milliseconds with a 0.75 collapse time. In order to reach a spin velocity of 20,000 rpm's, the following sequence is employed: Pole irons <b>6</b> and <b>10</b> are excited with DC current from a solid state excitation system, pole irons <b>7</b> and <b>11</b> are excited 0.375 milliseconds after pole irons <b>6</b> and <b>10</b>, pole irons <b>8</b> and <b>12</b> are excited 0.375 milliseconds after pole irons <b>7</b> and <b>11</b>, pole irons <b>9</b> and <b>13</b> are excited 0.375 milliseconds after pole irons <b>8</b> and <b>12</b> are excited, and then pole irons <b>6</b> and <b>10</b> are again excited 0.375 milliseconds following pole irons <b>9</b> and <b>13</b>. This timing sequence allows rotational speeds of 20,000 rpm's. The times given above are exemplary. Appropriate timing changes are programmed into a programmable logic controller (PLC), for example, which controls the DC excitation system for variable speeds of fan <b>3</b> and low pressure compressor <b>27</b> in turbofan jet engine shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0054">The engine includes a fan placed in the intake of the engine draws air in by the pitch and speed of the fan, thereby forming backward thrust. The exemplary engine disclosed herein also includes a high efficiency electric drive motor which can drive the fan at variable speeds. Furthermore, air pulled into the intake of the engine by the fan is divided into two columns, one air column bypasses the jet intake and is bypassed around and out through the jet nozzle to provide thrust and the remaining intake air is taken in through the low pressure compressor. The air taken in through the intake is chilled and compressed by the low pressure compressor and pushed back into the high pressure compressor. The airflow into the high pressure compressor is compressed and pushed into the hot section of the engine containing heating rods or other electrical heating mechanisms where the compressed air expands due to the heat inside the hot section. The heat expanded air in the hot section drives the high pressure turbine which, in turn, drives the high pressure compressor and expanded air then flows through the low pressure turbine and out through the jet nozzle which results in thrust. The low pressure turbine drives the low pressure compressor and the fan. The thrust intensity can be controlled by the fan drive motor, the heat intensity of the hot section, and the thrust control flaps of the engine.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0055">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, high pressure compressor <b>30</b> is powered by the compressed gas in hot section <b>35</b> when the gas is expanded by the heat from the heating system, for example, exemplary high resistance heat rods or calrods <b>36</b>. The expanded gas drives high pressure turbine <b>32</b> and low pressure turbine <b>34</b> and is then jetted out through nozzle <b>33</b> to provide thrust. High pressure turbine <b>32</b> drives high pressure compressor <b>30</b>.

The rotor creates rotating magnetic poles and generates electric power without rotating itself. Since the rotor is stationary there is no energy consuming interaction with the magnetic poles formed in the stator when the generator is connected to an electric load. Nor does the rotor require energy to spin the physical mechanism at the proper frequency.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0057">Shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> and more fully described in the PCT Application entitled &#x201c;Solid State Multi-Pole and Uni-Pole Electric Generator Rotor for AC/DC Electric Generators&#x201d; (PCT Appln. No. PCT/EP2017/079687, filed Nov. 17, 2017) is an exemplary high efficiency electric power generator <b>37</b> with 3-phase windings lapped clockwise. This redesign of the generator rotor is accomplished by, for example, but not limited to, cutting laminates from electrical steel in the desired diameter with salient pole pieces of equal number, size, and distribution. Exemplar rotor pole pieces <b>1</b>-<b>16</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> are wound with the desired and appropriate magnet wire. The magnet wire coils are each terminated in two leads which are wired to a PLC controlled excitation system. The excitation system allows sequential excitation of alternating polarity such that separated and discrete magnetic poles rotate around the periphery of the rotor parallel to the surface of the rotor, thereby generating voltage and amperage in the field coils of stator <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0058">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, each wound salient poles in a first polarity <b>38</b> and a second polarity <b>39</b> are excited in a sequential fashion such that four discrete magnetic poles are rotated parallel to the surface of the stator <b>40</b> at the desired speed in order to generate power without experiencing reverse torque on the rotors. Generator <b>37</b> is shown attached to base <b>41</b>. As noted above, the rotor remains stationary while the discrete magnetic poles rotate at the desired frequency. The high efficiency generator does not require energy to spin the rotor or to overcome reverse torque. Furthermore, it can produce the same amount of electric energy as a conventional generator with the same specifications. Additionally, as described more fully in the above referenced PCT Application, some of the energy produced by the generator can be taken back through a battery interface and used to excite the rotor pole windings.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0059">The onboard electric power generator disclosed herein can provide energy for every electrical demand of an aircraft, including the energy required to move it in space either by use of a propeller or a jet engine. In the case of a propeller driven aircraft, the generator provides electric power to an electric drive motor which turns the propeller through a gear mechanism. And in the case of a turbofan jet engine, as discussed above, the generator provides power to an electric fan drive motor which turns the fan of the engine.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
