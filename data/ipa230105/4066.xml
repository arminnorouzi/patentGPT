To reduce the space occupied by a camera module on an electronic device and provide more performance space for the industrial design of the entire electronic device, a concept of a detachable camera module comes into being. The detachable camera module, that is, the electronic device is only equipped with a camera module that is detachable and can operate independently to implement original functions of a camera such as rear shooting and front shooting.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the related art, an independent power supply manner is usually used in the detachable camera module, that is, a battery is arranged in the camera module. In the power supply manner, to increase an operating time of the detachable camera module, a battery capacity needs to be increased. As a result, a volume of the detachable camera module is increased, which is not conducive to carrying and mounting, and affects the appearance performance of the detachable camera module. To reduce the volume of the detachable camera module to ensure the appearance performance, the battery capacity should be sacrificed, which may affect the operating time of the camera module.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Embodiments of this application provide a power supply circuit and a power supply method for a camera module and an electronic device.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to a first aspect, a power supply circuit of a camera module is provided, where the camera module is detachably connected to a body of an electronic device, a power source module is arranged in the body, and the power supply circuit includes:</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">a first power supply pin and a second power supply pin, where the first power supply pin and the second power supply pin are separately arranged on the body;</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">a power supply pin and a ground pin, where the power supply pin and the ground pin are separately arranged on the camera module, the power supply pin is in contact with one of the first power supply pin and the second power supply pin, and the ground pin is in contact with the other of the first power supply pin and the second power supply pin in a case that the camera module is mounted at a preset position of the body;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">a first switch, where a first end of the first switch is connected to the first power supply pin, a second end of the first switch is connected to the power source module, a third end of the first switch is connected to a ground end, and the first switch is configured to control connection between the first power supply pin and the power supply module, and to control connection between the first power supply pin and the ground end;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">a second switch, where a first end of the second switch is connected to the second power supply pin, a second end of the second switch is connected to the power source module, a third end of the second switch is connected to the ground end, and the second switch is configured to control connection between the second power supply pin and the power supply module, and to control connection between the second power supply pin and the ground end; and</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">a processor, where the processor is separately connected to the first switch and the second switch, and the processor is configured to control on-off of the first switch and the second switch.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to a second aspect, an electronic device is provided, including:</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">a body, where a power source module is arranged in the body;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">a camera module detachably connected to the body; and</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">a circuit according to the first aspect.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to a third aspect, a power supply method for a camera module, applied to the electronic device according to the second aspect, the method including:</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">receiving a shooting start instruction;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">obtaining a shooting mode of the camera module in response to the shooting start instruction;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">controlling on/off of the first switch and the second switch based on the shooting mode, to cause a power supply pin contacting with the power source pin to be conducted with the power source module and cause a power supply pin contacting with the ground pin to be conducted with the ground end; and</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">the shooting mode includes a front shooting mode and a rear shooting mode, an orientation of a camera of the camera module in the front shooting mode is the same as an orientation of a first surface of the body, an orientation of a camera of the camera module in the rear shooting mode is the same as an orientation of a second surface of the body, and the first surface is arranged opposite to the second surface.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The at least one technical solution adopted in this embodiment of this application can achieve the following beneficial effects:</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The power source pin and the ground pin are arranged on a camera module that is detachably connected to the electronic device.
