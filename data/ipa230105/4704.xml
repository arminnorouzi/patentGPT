Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">One of the advantages that the VFET has over a planar or horizontal fin FET is that the VFET can enable to easily form a one-fin semiconductor cell to achieve a higher-density semiconductor cell having at least a smaller cell width.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The one-fin semiconductor cell refers to a semiconductor cell in which a connector or a connection structure (hereafter &#x201c;connector&#x201d;) is formed around one fin or fin structure (hereafter &#x201c;fin&#x201d;), not at least two fins or fin structures, connecting the VFET to a power rail of the one-fin semiconductor cell to provide a power voltage (Vdd) or a ground voltage (Vss) to the VFET. The connector formed around the one fin, referred to as one-fin connector, can be implemented by a bottom source/drain (S/D) region of the VFET formed around the one fin, which is referred to as a one-fin bottom S/D region. Hereafter, a VFET semiconductor cell is referred to as a cell, and a one-fin semiconductor cell, an at least one-fin semiconductor cell, and an at least two-fin semiconductor cell are referred to as a one-fin cell, an at least one-fin cell, and an at least two-fin cell, respectively, for brevity.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Since a one-fin connector such as a one-fin bottom S/D region is formed around one fin in a cell, the width thereof in a cell width direction is smaller than an at least two-fin connector such as an at least two-fin bottom S/D region formed around at least two fins in a cell, respectively. Accordingly, a one-fin cell including the one-fin connector has advantages in reducing a cell width compared to an at least two-fin cell including an at least two-fin connector in designing and manufacturing a cell architecture including a plurality of cells. Herein, a bottom S/D region being formed around a fin may refer to a bottom S/D region being structured to contact or encompass a lower part of the fin.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Despite the advantages in the smaller cell width, achieving a one-fin cell is difficult due to complexity in patterning a one-fin connection structure such as a one-fin bottom S/D region connected to a power rail of the one-fin cell. Further, because of cell design rules controlling sizes of a back-end-of-line (BEOL) elements such as a metal contact line, and a middle-of-the-line (MOL) elements such as a power contact structure, design and manufacture of a cell architecture including a one-fin cell is very complicated and restricted.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Thus, in designing and placing cells in a cell layout to form a cell architecture, it is necessary to avoid disposing or placing a one-fin connection structure such as a one-fin bottom S/D region connected to a power rail of a corresponding cell.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Various embodiments of the inventive concept are directed to cell layouts, cell architectures, and methods for placing a plurality of cells in a cell layout to form a cell architecture including a plurality of VFETs.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">These embodiments may provide improved cell architectures which have a reduced cell width, and methods to achieve the improved cell architectures.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to embodiments, there is provided a cell architecture including at least a 1<sup>st </sup>cell and a 2<sup>nd </sup>cell placed next to each other in a cell width direction, wherein the 1<sup>st </sup>cell may include a one-fin connector which is formed around a fin among a plurality of fins of the 1<sup>st </sup>cell, and connects a VFET of the 1<sup>st </sup>cell to a power rail of the 1<sup>st </sup>cell, and a 2<sup>nd </sup>cell may include a connector connected to a power rail of the 2<sup>nd </sup>cell.

Each of the fins F<b>1</b> and F<b>6</b> is included in two real fin areas RFA<b>1</b> and RFA<b>2</b> formed on a substrate SUB.
