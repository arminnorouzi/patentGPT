However, there are still many problems to be overcome in the actual manufacturing process. For example, a display panel of a Micro LED includes a plurality of pixel regions. In some application scenarios, each pixel region includes a red LED chip, a blue LED chip, and a green LED chip. In the manufacturing process of the display panel of the Micro LED, the red, green and blue chips need to be transferred from their respective growth substrates to a display backboard using a transfer head, and are electrically connected with a corresponding bonding pad on the display backboard through a bonding process. The currently used bonding process generally requires heating (mostly above 150&#xb0; C.) to realize the connection between the LED chips and the display backboard using pure metal solder.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) transfer head is an important medium to realize Micro-LED transfer, and is classified into a flat-plate transfer head and a raised transfer head. The transfer head at the current stage is formed by a high-precision template method. A bulge of the prepared raised transfer head is completely supported by PDMS glue. The material of the PDMS is thermoplastic, and may withstand a certain temperature and pressure during actual use, so that the bulge is often deformed by heat and extrusion. Since the most critical factor of the raised transfer head is the flatness between the bulges, TTV (highest point height-lowest point height) is required to be &#x3c;2 um, that is, the height difference between the bulges is required to be &#x3c;2 um. The bulge of the raised transfer head is prone to irreversible deformation or damaged loss during the process of cyclic reciprocating heating and pressure. In the application, the bulge with the irreversible deformation or damaged loss is referred to as an abnormal bulge. The generation of the abnormal bulge may cause TTV changes, thereby making the raised transfer head unable to be used in the process. However, there is currently no effective means to detect whether the abnormal bulge appears on the raised transfer head.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, how to detect whether the abnormal bulge appears on the raised transfer head is an urgent problem to be solved.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In view of the above defects of the related art, embodiments of the present disclosure provide a transfer device, and a manufacturing method, a detection method and a detection device of the transfer device, which can solve the problem of how to detect whether an abnormal bulge appears on a raised transfer head in the related art.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The embodiments of the present disclosure provide a transfer device, which includes a transfer head and a colloidal crystal layer arranged on the transfer head.

with reference to the relevant drawings. The exemplary implementations of the application are shown in the drawings. However, the application may be implemented in various different forms and is not limited to the implementations described herein. On the contrary, the purpose of providing these implementations is to make the understanding of the application more thorough and comprehensive.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Unless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by those skilled in the art of the application. The terms used herein is only for the purpose of describing the exemplary implementations of the application and is not intended to limit the application.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the related art, a bulge of a raised transfer head is prone to irreversible deformation or damaged loss in the process of cyclic reciprocating heating and pressure, thereby becoming an abnormal bulge. The generation of the abnormal bulge may cause TTV changes, thereby making the raised transfer head unable to be used in the process. For example, the transfer head shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref> is provided with a plurality of bulges <b>1</b> configured to pick up a to-be-transferred chip. When the transfer head is configured to pick up and transfer the to-be-transferred chip, the bulge <b>1</b> is prone to irreversible deformation or damaged loss in the process of cyclic reciprocating heating and pressure, thereby becoming the abnormal bulge. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref>, a part of the bulge A<b>1</b> is lost, the bulge A<b>2</b> is inclined, and the bulge A<b>3</b> is deformed by pressure. These three bulges are all abnormal bulges. When the transfer head with the abnormal bulge is continued to be used, it is easy to cause chip transfer failure or transfer failure. However, there is currently no effective means to detect whether the abnormal bulge appears on the raised transfer head.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Based on this, the present disclosure provides a solution to solve the above technical problems, the details of which will be described in the subsequent embodiments.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The embodiment provides a transfer device, which includes a transfer head and a colloidal crystal layer. Herein, the transfer head includes a substrate.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The substrate is provided with a front surface and a back surface which are opposite to each other. The transfer head further includes at least one bulge arranged on a back surface of the substrate. The bulge is configured to be bonded with at least one to-be-transferred chip so as to pick up and transfer the to-be-transferred chip. The substrate in the embodiment may include, but not limited to, a bearing substrate, and the bulge of the transfer head is arranged on the back surface of the bearing substrate. In some examples, the substrate may further include a supporting substrate attached to the front surface of the bearing substrate, or at least partially embedded into the bearing substrate. The supporting substrate may be, but not limited to, a quartz substrate, a sapphire substrate, a glass substrate or a metal substrate.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The to-be-transferred chip in the embodiment may include, but not limited to, an LED chip, and the LED chip may be, but not limited to, a micro light-emitting chip. The micro light-emitting chip in the embodiment refers to um-level light-emitting chip, such as but not limited to at least one of a Mini LED chip and a Micro LED chip. Of course, the micro light-emitting chip may also be replaced with chips of other sizes according to requirements, which will not be repeated here. The chip in the embodiment is not limited to the light-emitting chip, and may also be equivalently replaced with other chips according to requirements.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In the embodiment, the number of bulges arranged on the back surface of the substrate may be flexibly set, and may be set as one bulge according to application requirements, or may be set as two or more bulges according to requirements. The spacing between the bulges may be flexibly set according to specific application requirements, for example, the spacing may be correspondingly set according to but not limited to the layout of a bonding pad in a corresponding chip bonding area on a circuit backboard.
