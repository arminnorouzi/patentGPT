To minimize this airborne dust, it is common to use abrasive discs on a tool while vacuum is drawn through the abrasive disc, from the abrasive side through the backside of the disc, and into a dust-collection system. For this purpose, many abrasives are available with holes converted into them, to facilitate this dust extraction. As an alternative to converting dust-extraction holes into abrasive discs, commercial products exist in which the abrasive is coated onto fibers of a net-type knit backing in which loops are knit into the backside of the abrasive article. The loops serve as the loop-portion of a hook-and-loop attachment system for attachment to a tool. Net type products are known to provide superior dust extraction and/or anti-loading properties, when used with substrates known to severely load traditional abrasives. However, cut and/or life performance are still lacking. Thus, there is a need for a net type product that provides enhanced cut and/or life performance while demonstrating superior dust extraction.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The drawings illustrate generally, by way of example, but not by way of limitation, various embodiments discussed in the present document.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of an abrasive article according to one example of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a side cross-sectional view of abrasive articles according to various embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic showing the step-wise construction of abrasive articles according to various embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>I</figref> are side cross-sectional views of a portion of an abrasive article according to various embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>6</b></figref> are side cross-sectional views of abrasive articles according to embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>D</figref> illustrate examples of laminated backings.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-<b>8</b>C</figref> illustrate cross-sectional views of coated abrasive articles in accordance with embodiments of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>B</figref> illustrate a laminated backing in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> illustrates a method for making a coated abrasive article in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0013" num="0012">It should be understood that numerous other modifications and examples can be devised by those skilled in the art, which fall within the scope and spirit of the principles of the disclosure.

Coated abrasive articles can include a backing having two major opposed surfaces and an abrasive layer secured to one of the major surfaces. The abrasive layer typically includes abrasive particles and a binder for securing the abrasive particles to the backing. One common construction is a backing with a resin-based binder.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">For example, phenolic resin and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film are two common materials useful for making abrasive products. However, phenolic resins do not bond well to plain, untreated polyester or PET films.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Embodiments described herein are directed to an abrasive article that not only retains the dust-extraction advantages of an abrasive on a net-type backing, but also demonstrates abrasive performance (cut and/or life) advantages of a conventional coated abrasive article. This combination of benefits (dust extraction and cut and/or life) is possible because the construction of the abrasive articles described herein allows for coating abrasive on a greater variety of backing materials, with better performance, through the application of a laminated layer between the backing material and the resin coat.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present disclosure provides articles that include a laminate that can serve as a primer layer for a backing, for example, for improving the adhesion to a make resin layer, for example, a phenolic resin layer, in an abrasive article.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of one example of an abrasive article referred to by the numeral <b>100</b>. As shown, the abrasive article <b>100</b> includes: a substrate <b>110</b> comprising strands forming first void spaces <b>270</b> between the strands (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>); and an abrasive layer <b>120</b> comprising a laminate joined to the substrate <b>110</b>; a resin joined to the laminate opposite the fabric substrate <b>110</b>; abrasive particles joined to the resin; and a plurality of void spaces extending through the laminate coinciding with void spaces in the substrate <b>110</b>. In one embodiment, substrate <b>110</b> is a fabric substrate. The plurality of void spaces extending through the laminate coinciding with void spaces in the fabric substrate <b>110</b> allow for an air flow through the article <b>100</b> at a rate of, e.g., at least 0.1 L/s (e.g. at least 0.2 L/s, at least 0.4 L/s, at least 0.6 L/s, at least 1 L/s; or about 0.1 L/s to about 1 L/s, about 0.25 L/s to about 0.75 L/s, about 0.5 L/s to about 1 L/s, about 1 L/s to about 2 L/s, about 1.5 L/s or about 3 L/s), such that, when in use, dust can be removed from an abraded surface through the abrasive article.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a relatively simple pattern that can be created with the abrasive layers <b>120</b>.

For example, abrasive articles <b>100</b> having various patterns in the abrasive layer <b>120</b> are described and illustrated in co-pending U.S. Provisional Patent 62/803,871 filed on Feb. 11, 2019. As can be seen, the abrasive layers <b>120</b> can comprise a plurality of pattern elements <b>120</b>, which may or may not be repeated across the surface of the abrasive article <b>100</b>. Each pattern element <b>120</b> can be comprised of one or more sub-elements. Different pattern elements <b>120</b> within the same abrasive article may be provided with the same or different abrasive particles <b>250</b> or other additives (for example, different abrasive grades, blends of abrasive particles <b>250</b>, fillers, grinding aids, etc.) as desired for a given application. Although the articles depicted are presented in the form of circular discs, it should be understood that abrasive articles could take any form (for example, sheets or belts).</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a cross-section of an abrasive article referred to by the numeral <b>100</b> taken on the line <b>2</b>-<b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> looking in the direction of the arrows. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the abrasive article <b>100</b> includes: a fabric substrate <b>110</b> comprising strands <b>260</b> forming first void spaces <b>270</b> between the strands <b>260</b>; a laminate <b>230</b> joined to the fabric substrate <b>110</b>; a cured resin composition <b>240</b> (e.g., the cured product of a phenolic resin) joined to the laminate <b>230</b> opposite the fabric substrate <b>110</b>; abrasive particles <b>250</b> joined to the cured resin composition <b>240</b>; and a plurality of second void spaces <b>280</b> extending through the laminate coinciding with first void spaces <b>270</b> in the fabric substrate <b>110</b>.

As used herein, the term &#x201c;at least partially embedded&#x201d; generally means that at least a portion of an abrasive particle is embedded in the cured resin composition, such that, the abrasive particle is anchored in the cured resin composition. In some embodiments, abrasive particles <b>250</b> are coated onto the laminate <b>230</b> together in the form of a slurry composition. In such embodiments, abrasive particles <b>250</b> can optionally be oriented by influence of a magnetic field prior to the resin <b>240</b>A being cured. See, for example, commonly-owned U.S. Pat.

The laminate <b>230</b> can be joined to the fabric substrate <b>110</b> by any suitable means, including by first applying a suitable adhesive layer (not shown) onto the substrate <b>110</b>, followed by applying the laminate <b>230</b>; by melting the laminate material onto the fabric substrate <b>110</b>; printing the laminate <b>230</b> onto the fabric substrate <b>110</b>; or combinations of any of the foregoing methods for joining the laminate <b>230</b> to the fabric substrate <b>110</b>. The laminate <b>230</b> functions to, among other things, provide a substantially flat landing for uncured (or partially cured) resin composition <b>240</b>A, such that uncured resin composition <b>240</b>A that is deposited on the laminate <b>230</b> remains on the surface and does not have an opportunity to, e.g., move into the spaces <b>270</b> between strands <b>260</b> of fabric substrate <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In a second step, uncured resin composition <b>240</b>A is joined to the laminate <b>230</b> opposite the fabric substrate <b>110</b>. The uncured resin composition <b>240</b>A can be joined to laminate <b>230</b> by any suitable means, including by using a (rotary) stencil/screen printing roll, flatbed screen/stencil printing or by directly printing the uncured resin composition <b>240</b>A onto the laminate <b>230</b> or by using combinations of two or more suitable methods (e.g., extrusion die coating, curtain coating, knife coating, gravure coating, and spray coating) for joining the uncured resin composition <b>240</b>A to the laminate <b>230</b> opposite the fabric substrate <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In a third step, abrasive particles <b>250</b> are joined to the uncured resin composition <b>240</b>A by any suitable method, including drop, electrostatic, magnetic, and other mechanical methods of mineral coating. For example, abrasive particles <b>250</b> can be deposited onto uncured resin composition <b>240</b>A by simply dropping the abrasive particles <b>250</b> onto the uncured resin composition <b>240</b>A; by electrostatically depositing abrasive particles <b>250</b> onto the uncured resin composition <b>240</b>A; or by using combinations of two or more suitable methods for joining the abrasive particles <b>250</b> to the uncured resin composition <b>240</b>A. In some embodiments, the abrasive particles <b>250</b> can optionally be oriented under the influence of a magnetic field prior to the resin <b>240</b>A being cured, as earlier indicated.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In a fourth step, the uncured resin composition <b>240</b>A is cured, this way abrasive particles <b>250</b> are at least partially embedded in the cured resin composition <b>240</b> and are substantially permanently attached. Uncured resin composition <b>240</b>A can be cured to form cured resin <b>240</b> by any applicable curing mechanism, including thermal cure, photochemical cure, moisture-cured or combinations of two or more curing mechanism.

Suitable materials for laminate <b>230</b> include hot-meltable materials, including polyester hot-meltable materials (e.g., HM4185 Polyester Hot Melt Adhesive available from Bostik, Wauwatosa, Wis.), polyamide, ethylene and acrylic acid (EAA) copolymer, ethyl methyl acetate or ethyl vinyl acetate. The laminate <b>230</b> may be provided, for example, in the form of a continuous non-apertured sheet, or as a continuous apertured sheet whereby apertures are provided in areas adjacent to or surrounding pattern elements.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Laminate <b>230</b> should adhere both to the mesh backing layer and to the resin layer. Failure at either layer will cause abrasive particles to delaminate from the backing. This is particularly important for extrusion lamination of a hot melt film, which results in a non-porous laminate that separates the make layer from the backing.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The composition and process for adhering the laminate to the backing layer can affect performance of the abrasive article. Some important parameters include re-opening of the laminate during curing of the make resin, sufficient adhesion of the laminate to a backing, and flatness of the laminate.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">As described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, re-opening of the laminate during curing of the make resin promotes dust collection during an abrasive operation. Laminate re-opening can be controlled by selecting a material with a melting point lower than the melting point or the degradation temperature of the resin coated above, but high enough that the laminate will not melt or wash away during resin cure and abrasive use. If the melting point of the laminate is too low it can also cause sagging of the laminate/make layer in open areas, which can cause significant surface defects with the application of the make coat. Additionally, the thickness of a laminate coating is important&#x2014;if the coating is too thick it will not open. If it is too thin, the resin may bleed through to the backing layer.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Adhesion to the mesh backing can reduce delamination of an abrasive article. Adhesion can be increased through extrusion temperature, nip pressure, die position, and the chemistry of the laminate.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Flatness of the laminate layer also improves adhesion of the resin and reduces shelling of abrasive particles from the resulting abrasive article. Previous laminated coated abrasive articles had a roughness above 30 &#x3bc;m Ra. Methods and embodiments described herein can achieve roughness values below about 20 &#x3bc;m Ra, or even as low as 10 &#x3bc;m Ra.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A and <b>7</b>B</figref> illustrate two different laminated backings. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> illustrates a poorly laminated mesh backing <b>710</b> where the laminate is not a continuous layer. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref> illustrates a laminated mesh backing <b>720</b> resulting from co-extruding a mesh backing with laminate.

However, extrusion does not result in a porous laminate. This prevents make resin from penetrating the laminate layer and contacting the mesh web after coating, and also results in a higher surface tension, making the re-opening process for the laminate layer prone to incomplete reopening and delamination if the incorrect conditions are used. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>C</figref> illustrates incomplete opening of an extruded laminated backing <b>730</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>D</figref> illustrates delamination of a make coat and abrasive particles on an extruded laminated backing <b>740</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Improving lamination re-opening, adhesion and flatness can provide an abrasive article with better feature resolution and reduce bleed-through of the resin.

In making such a coated abrasive article, the make layer, including a first binder precursor, can be applied to a major surface of the backing. Abrasive particles are then at least partially embedded into the make layer (for example, by electrostatic coating), and the first binder precursor is cured (that is, crosslinked) to secure the particles to the make layer. A size layer, including a second binder precursor, can be applied over the make layer and abrasive particles, followed by curing of the second binder precursor and possibly further curing of the first binder precursor.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Another type of coated abrasive article is formed by applying an abrasive layer, provided as a slurry comprised of binder precursor and abrasive particles, onto a major surface of a backing, and then curing the binder precursor.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">It is known to pre-treat a backing material with a primer in order to enhance adhesion between the backing and an applied layer, such as a make layer or a laminate layer. It is expressly contemplated that such pretreatments can also be applied to a backing layer of abrasive articles described herein in addition to, or prior to, application of a laminate layer. For example, a plasma or corona treatment may be applied to a backing before the laminate layer is applied. Some examples of primer treatments are described in co-owned pending PCT application IB2019/056300, filed on Jul. 23, 2019, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional 62/702,029, filed on Jul. 23, 2018, which is herein incorporated by reference.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Some examples of typical backing treatments are a backsize layer (that is, a coating on the major surface of the backing opposite the abrasive layer), a presize layer or a tie layer (that is, a coating on the backing disposed between the abrasive layer and the backing), and/or a saturant that saturates the backing. A subsize is similar to a saturant, except that it is applied to a previously treated backing.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Coating of a backing treatment composition can be performed in a variety of ways including brushing, spraying, roll coating, curtain coating, gravure coating, and knife coating. The coated backing may then be processed for a time at a temperature sufficient to dry and at least partially crosslink the coating to form the primer layer on the backing.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some embodiments, a backing material undergoes a surface treatment. Useful surface treatments include electrical discharge in the presence of a suitable reactive or non-reactive atmosphere (e.g., plasma, glow discharge, corona discharge, dielectric barrier discharge or atmospheric pressure discharge); ultraviolet light exposure, electron beam exposure, flame discharge, and scuffing. The surface treatment can be applied as the polyester film backing is being made or in a separate process. In some embodiments, the polyester film backing is surface-treated using corona discharge. An example of a useful corona discharge process is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,972,176 (Kirk et al.).</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Depending on the choice of abrasive layer and backing (treated or untreated), the abrasive layer may partially separate from the backing during abrading, resulting in the release of abrasive particles. This phenomenon is known in the abrasive art as &#x201c;shelling&#x201d;. In most cases, shelling is undesirable because it results in a loss of performance. A tie layer is sometimes disposed between the backing and the abrasive layer. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,304,224 (Harmon) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,355,636 (Harmon). A tie layer has been used to address the problem of shelling in some coated abrasive articles, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 7,150,770 (Keipert et al.)</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The primer layer can include one or more additives, if desired. In some embodiments, the primer layer useful for practicing the present disclosure, includes at least one of an organic solvent, a surfactant, an emulsifier, a dispersant, a catalyst, a rheology modifier, a density modifier, a cure modifier, a diluent, an antioxidant, a heat stabilizer, a flame retardant, a plasticizer, filler, a polishing aid, a pigment, a dye, an adhesion promoter, antistatic additives. In various embodiments, the presence or lack of certain of these additives can reduce cost, control viscosity, or improve physical properties. In some embodiments, the primer layer comprises a surfactant.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">It is expressly contemplated that a laminate layer may be applied to a coated abrasive article in addition to, or instead of, a primer layer. Applying a laminate layer to a backing can provide additional functionality to the coated abrasive article.

Generally, primers and pretreatments are applied as an aqueous or solvent-based mixture and react to form a film-like coating. They are not usually applied as part of an extruding or coating process, but instead require treatment, then drying and evaporation of the solvent. Additionally, the laminate is visible as a distinct layer, while primers and pretreatments do not result in a continuous film or phase. Primers and pretreatments will not result in a continuous phase on a mesh substrate because the viscosity is too low. The laminate is also formed of a high molecular weight polymer that is self-sealed with definable mechanical strength.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In another embodiment of an abrasive article according to the present disclosure, the abrasive layer may comprise abrasive particles dispersed in a binder, in some embodiments, a phenolic layer.

A fabric backing may include cloth (e.g., cloth made from fibers or yarns comprising polyester, nylon, silk, cotton, and/or rayon, which may be woven, knit or stitch bonded) or scrim. Many of these materials can have an uneven or rough surface.

Nonwoven abrasive articles, such as a spunbound backing, typically include an open porous lofty polymer filament structure having abrasive particles distributed throughout the structure and adherently bonded therein by an organic binder, in some embodiments, a phenolic resin as described above in any of its embodiments.

The term &#x201c;nonwoven&#x201d; refers to a material having a structure of individual fibers or threads that are interlaid but not in an identifiable manner such as in a knitted fabric. Typically, the nonwoven web comprises an entangled web of fibers. The fibers may comprise continuous fiber, staple fiber, or a combination thereof. For example, the nonwoven web may comprise staple fibers having a length of at least about 20 mm, at least about 30 mm, or at least about 40 mm, and less than about 110 mm, less than about 85 mm, or less than about 65 mm, although shorter and longer fibers (e.g., continuous filaments) may also be useful. The fibers may have a fineness or linear density of at least about 1.7 decitex (dtex, i.e., grams/10000 meters), at least about 6 dtex, or at least about 17 dtex, and less than about 560 dtex, less than about 280 dtex, or less than about 120 dtex, although fibers having lesser and/or greater linear densities may also be useful. Mixtures of fibers with differing linear densities may be useful, for example, to provide an abrasive article that upon use will result in a specifically preferred surface finish. If a carded or airlaid nonwoven is used, the filaments may be of substantially larger diameter, for example, up to 2 mm or more in diameter. The fibers may be tensilized and crimped but may also be continuous filaments such as those formed by an extrusion process (e.g. spunbond fibers).

Examples of useful draw ratios are in the range of 2.5 to 6 times in the machine, cross-machine direction, or both the machine and cross-machine directions. Larger draw ratios (for example, up to about 8 times) may also be useful if the film is oriented in only one direction. For biaxially oriented film backings, the film may be stretched equally in the machine and cross-machine directions or unequally in the machine and cross-machine directions.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In step <b>1220</b>, a laminate is applied to the backing. The laminate may be applied, in one embodiment, as a film. For example, it may be applied as a blown melty film <b>1222</b> to a backing. In another embodiment, the laminate is extruded onto a backing <b>1224</b>. Extrusion may comprise coextrusion of the laminate with the backing as well as extruding a laminate layer onto an existing backing. Other application methods are also envisioned.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The laminate may result in changed properties of the backing, once applied, as indicated in block <b>1232</b>. For example, the laminate may increase the stiffness of a backing. In another example, the laminate may increase the smoothness and/or flatness of the backing. The laminate may also provide functionality, such as anti-loading properties, as indicated in block <b>1234</b>, or anti-static properties, as indicated in block <b>1236</b>. Anti-loading and anti-static properties are achieved by increasing the conductivity of the backing, which is achieved by using a conductive material for the laminate or a conductive additive. The laminate may also promote adhesion, as indicated in block <b>1238</b>, between the make resin and the backing. The laminate may also directly or indirectly provide other benefits, as indicated in block <b>1242</b>. For example, the increased flatness of a laminated backing may reduce shelling of abrasive particles during use.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In step <b>1230</b>, a make coat may be applied. In some embodiments, the make coat is applied under conditions sufficient to cause reopening of the laminate layer to form voids, as described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>6</b></figref>. Applying the make coat may also comprise a curing step to allow the make coat to cure.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">A make coat and size coat in the abrasive articles of the present disclosure in any of their embodiments may be made from the same or different materials. Examples of these materials include amino resins, alkylated urea-formaldehyde resins, melamine-formaldehyde resins, and alkylated benzoguanamine-formaldehyde resin, acrylate resins (including acrylates and methacrylates) such as vinyl acrylates, acrylated epoxies, acrylated urethanes, acrylated polyesters, acrylated acrylics, acrylated polyethers, vinyl ethers, acrylated oils, and acrylated silicones, alkyd resins such as urethane alkyd resins, polyester resins, reactive urethane resins, epoxy resins such as bisphenol epoxy resins, isocyanates, isocyanurates, polysiloxane resins (including alkylalkoxysilane resins), reactive vinyl resins, phenolic resins (resole and novolac), and phenolic/latex resins. The resins may be provided as monomers, oligomers, polymers, or combinations thereof. The primer layer improves adhesion between the polyester backing and the make layer. In some embodiments, the make layer is an alkylated urea-formaldehyde resin, and the size layer can be made from any of the resins described above. In some embodiments, the make layer is a phenolic layer as described above in any of its embodiments, and the size layer can be made from any of the resins described above. In some embodiments, both the make layer and the size layer are made from phenolic resins, which may be combined with a latex including any of those described above in any of the ratios described above.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Suitable phenolic resins are generally formed by condensation of phenol or an alkylated phenol (e.g., cresol) and formaldehyde, and are usually categorized as resole or novolac phenolic resins. Novolac phenolic resins are acid-catalyzed and have a molar ratio of formaldehyde to phenol of less than 1:1. Resole (also resol) phenolic resins can be catalyzed by alkaline catalysts, and the molar ratio of formaldehyde to phenol is greater than or equal to one, typically between 1.0 and 3.0, thus presenting pendant methylol groups. Alkaline catalysts suitable for catalyzing the reaction between aldehyde and phenolic components of resole phenolic resins include sodium hydroxide, barium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, organic amines, and sodium carbonate, all as solutions of the catalyst dissolved in water.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Resole phenolic resins are typically coated as a solution with water and/or organic solvent (e.g., alcohol). Typically, the solution includes about 70 percent to about 85 percent solids by weight, although other concentrations may be used. If the solids content is very low, then more energy is required to remove the water and/or solvent. If the solids content is very high, then the viscosity of the resulting phenolic resin is too high which typically leads to processing problems.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Phenolic resins are well-known and readily available from commercial sources.

See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. In general, the supersize coat is the outermost coating of the abrasive article and directly contacts the workpiece during an abrading operation. The supersize coat is, in some examples, substantially transparent.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">The term &#x201c;substantially transparent&#x201d; as used herein refers to a majority of, or mostly, as in at least about 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, or at least about 70% or more transparent. In some examples, the measure of the transparency of any given coat described herein (e.g., the supersize coat) is the coat's transmittance. In some examples, the supersize coat displays a transmittance of at least 5 percent, at least 20 percent, at least 40 percent, at least 50 percent, or at least 60 percent (e.g., a transmittance from about 40 percent to about 80 percent; about 50 percent to about 70 percent; about 40 percent to about 70 percent; or about 50 percent to about 70 percent), according to a Transmittance Test that measures the transmittance of 500 nm light through a sample of 6 by 12 inch by approximately 1-2 mil (15.24 by 30.48 cm by 25.4-50.8 &#x3bc;m) clear polyester film, having a transmittance of about 98%.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">One component of supersize coats can be a metal salt of a long-chain fatty acid (e.g., a C<sub>12</sub>-C<sub>22 </sub>fatty acid, a C<sub>14</sub>-C<sub>18 </sub>fatty acid, and a C<sub>16</sub>-C<sub>20 </sub>fatty acid). In some examples, the metal salt of a long-chain fatty acid is a stearate salt (e.g., a salt of stearic acid). The conjugate base of stearic acid is C17H35COO&#x2014;, also known as the stearate anion. Useful stearates include, but are not limited to, calcium stearate, zinc stearate, and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">The metal salt of a long-chain fatty acid can be present in an amount of at least 10 percent, at least 50 percent, at least 70 percent, at least 80 percent, or at least 90 percent by weight based on the normalized weight of the supersize coat (i.e., the average weight for a unit surface area of the abrasive article). The metal salt of a long-chain fatty acid can be present in an amount of up to 100 percent, up to 99 percent, up to 98 percent, up to 97 percent, up to 95 percent, up to 90 percent, up to 80 percent, or up to 60 percent by weight (e.g., from about 10 wt. % to about 100 wt. %; about 30 wt. % to about 70 wt. %; about 50 wt. % to about 90 wt. %; or about 50 wt. % to about 100 wt. %) based on the normalized weight of the supersize coat.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">Another component of the supersize coat is a polymeric binder, which, in some examples, enables the supersize coat to form a smooth and continuous film over the abrasive layer. In one example, the polymeric binder is a styrene-acrylic polymer binder. In some examples, the styrene-acrylic polymer binder is the ammonium salt of a modified styrene-acrylic polymer, such as, but not limited to, JONCRYL&#xae; LMV 7051. The ammonium salt of a styrene-acrylic polymer can have, for example, a weight average molecular weight (Mw) of at least 100,000 g/mol, at least 150,000 g/mol, at least 200,000 g/mol, or at least 250,000 g/mol (e.g., from about 100,000 g/mol to about 2.5&#xd7;106 g/mol; about 100,000 g/mol to about 500,000 g/mol; or about 250,000 to about 2.5&#xd7;106 g/mol).</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">The supersize coat may also have a grinding aid is defined as particulate material, the addition of which to an abrasive article has a significant effect on the chemical and physical processes of abrading. In particular, it is believed that the grinding aid may: (1) decrease the friction between the abrasive particles and the workpiece being abraded; (2) prevent the abrasive particles from &#x201c;capping&#x201d;, i.e., prevent metal particles from becoming welded to the tops of the abrasive particles; (3) decrease the interface temperature between the abrasive particles and the workpiece; (4) decrease the grinding forces; and/or (5) have a synergistic effect of the mechanisms mentioned above. In general, the addition of a grinding aid increases the useful life of the coated abrasive article. Grinding aids encompass a wide variety of different materials and can be inorganic or organic.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">While grinding aids are described herein as used in the supersize layer, they may also be applied as part of the laminate layer.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">Exemplary grinding aids may include inorganic halide salts, halogenated compounds and polymers, and organic and inorganic sulfur-containing materials. Exemplary grinding aids, which may be organic or inorganic, include waxes, halogenated organic compounds such as chlorinated waxes like tetrachloronaphthalene, pentachloronaphthalene, and polyvinyl chloride; halide salts such as sodium chloride, potassium cryolite, sodium cryolite, ammonium cryolite, potassium tetrafluoroborate, sodium tetrafluoroborate, silicon fluorides, potassium chloride, magnesium chloride; and metals and their alloys such as tin, lead, bismuth, cobalt, antimony, cadmium, iron, and titanium. Examples of other grinding aids include sulfur, organic sulfur compounds, graphite, and metallic sulfides, organic and inorganic phosphate-containing materials. A combination of different grinding aids may be used.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">Preferred grinding aids include halide salts, particularly potassium tetrafluoroborate (KBF4), cryolite (Na3AlF6), and ammonium cryolite [(NH4)3AlF6]. Other halide salts that can be used as grinding aids include sodium chloride, potassium cryolite, sodium tetrafluoroborate, silicon fluorides, potassium chloride, and magnesium chloride. Other preferred grinding aids are those in U.S. Pat. No. 5,269,821 (Helmin et al.), which describes grinding aid agglomerates comprised of water soluble and water insoluble grinding aid particles. Other useful grinding aid agglomerates are those wherein a plurality of grinding aid particles are bound together into an agglomerate with a binder. Agglomerates of this type are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,498,268 (Gagliardi et al.).</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">Examples of halogenated polymers useful as grinding aids include polyvinyl halides (e.g., polyvinyl chloride) and polyvinylidene halides such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,616,580 (Dewell et al.); highly chlorinated paraffin waxes such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,676,092 (Buell); completely chlorinated hydrocarbons resins such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,784,365 (Caserta et al.); and fluorocarbons such as polytetrafluoroethylene and polytrifluorochloroethylene as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,869,834 (Mullin et al.).</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">Inorganic sulfur-containing materials useful as grinding aids include elemental sulfur, iron(II) sulfide, cupric sulfide, molybdenum sulfide, potassium sulfate, and the like, as variously disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,833,346 (Wirth), U.S. Pat. No. 3,868,232 (Sioui et al.), and U.S. Pat. No. 4,475,926 (Hickory). Organic sulfur-containing materials (e.g., thiourea) for use in the invention include those mentioned in U.S. Pat. No. 3,058,819 (Paulson).</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">It is also within the scope of this disclosure to use a combination of different grinding aids and, in some instances, this may produce a synergistic effect. The above-mentioned examples of grinding aids are meant to be a representative showing of grinding aids, and they are not meant to encompass all grinding aids.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">The supersize layer may also comprise other components and/or additives, such as abrasive particles, fillers, diluents, fibers, lubricants, wetting agents, surfactants, pigments, dyes, coupling agents, resin curatives, plasticizers, antistatic agents, and suspending agents. Examples of fillers suitable for this invention include wood pulp, vermiculite, and combinations thereof, metal carbonates, such as calcium carbonate, e.g., chalk, calcite, marl, travertine, marble, and limestone, calcium magnesium carbonate, sodium carbonate, magnesium carbonate; silica, such as amorphous silica, quartz, glass beads, glass bubbles, and glass fibers; silicates, such as talc, clays (montmorillonite), feldspar, mica, calcium silicate, calcium metasilicate, sodium aluminosilicate, sodium silicate; metal sulfates, such as calcium sulfate, barium sulfate, sodium sulfate, aluminum sodium sulfate, aluminum sulfate; gypsum; vermiculite; wood flour; aluminum trihydrate; metal oxides, such as calcium oxide (lime), aluminum oxide, titanium dioxide, and metal sulfites, such as calcium sulfite.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">The minimum film-forming temperature, also referred to as MFFT, is the lowest temperature at which a polymer self-coalesces in a semi-dry state to form a continuous polymer film. In the context of the present disclosure, this polymer film can then function as a binder for the remaining solids present in the supersize coat. In some examples, the styrene-acrylic polymer binder (e.g., the ammonium salt of a styrene-acrylic polymer) has an MFFT that is up to 90&#xb0; C., up to 80&#xb0; C., up to 70&#xb0; C., up to 65&#xb0; C., or up to 60&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">In some examples, the binder is dried at relatively low temperatures (e.g., at 70&#xb0; C. or less). The drying temperatures are, in some examples, below the melting temperature of the metal salt of a long-chain fatty acid component of the supersize coat. Use of excessively high temperatures (e.g., temperatures above 80&#xb0; C.) to dry the supersize coat is undesirable because it can induce brittleness and cracking in the backing, complicate web handling, and increase manufacturing costs. By virtue of its low MFFT, a binder comprised of, e.g., the ammonium salt of a styrene-acrylic polymer allows the supersize coat to achieve better film formation at lower binder levels and at lower temperatures without need for added surfactants such as DOWANOL&#xae; DPnP.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">The polymeric binder can be present in an amount of at least 0.1 percent, at least 1 percent, or at least 3 percent by weight, based on the normalized weight of the supersize coat. The polymeric binder can be present in an amount of up to 20 percent, up to 12 percent, up to 10 percent, or up to 8 percent by weight, based on the normalized weight of the supersize coat. Advantageously, when the ammonium salt of a modified styrene acrylic copolymer is used as a binder, the haziness normally associated with a stearate coating is substantially reduced.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">The supersize coats of the present disclosure optionally contain clay particles dispersed in the supersize coat. The clay particles, when present, can be uniformly mixed with the metal salt of a long chain fatty acid, polymeric binder, and other components of the supersize composition. The clay can bestow unique advantageous properties to the abrasive article, such as improved optical clarity and improved cut performance. The inclusion of clay particles can also enable cut performance to be sustained for longer periods of time relative to supersize coats in which the clay additive is absent.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">The clay particles, when present, can be present in an amount of at least 0.01 percent, at least 0.05 percent, at least 0.1 percent, at least 0.15 percent, or at least 0.2 percent by weight based on the normalized weight of the supersize coat. Further, the clay particles can be present in an amount of up to 99 percent, up to 50 percent, up to 25 percent, up to 10 percent, or up to 5 percent by weight based on the normalized weight of the supersize coat.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">The clay particles may include particles of any known clay material. Such clay materials include those in the geological classes of the smectites, kaolins, illites, chlorites, serpentines, attapulgites, palygorskites, vermiculites, glauconites, sepiolites, and mixed layer clays. Smectites in particular include montmorillonite (e.g., a sodium montmorillonite or calcium montmorillonite), bentonite, pyrophyllite, hectorite, saponite, sauconite, nontronite, talc, beidellite, and volchonskoite. Specific kaolins include kaolinite, dickite, nacrite, antigorite, anauxite, halloysite, indellite and chrysotile. Illites include bravaisite, muscovite, paragonite, phlogopite and biotite. Chlorites can include, for example, corrensite, penninite, donbassite, sudoite, pennine and clinochlore. Mixed layer clays can include allevardite and vermiculitebiotite. Variants and isomorphic substitutions of these layered clays may also be used.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">As an optional additive, abrasive performance may be further enhanced by nanoparticles (i.e., nanoscale particles) interdispersed (e.g., in the clay particles) in the supersize coat. Useful nanoparticles include, for example, nanoparticles of metal oxides, such as zirconia, titania, silica, ceria, alumina, iron oxide, vanadia, zinc oxide, antimony oxide, tin oxide, and alumina-silica. The nanoparticles can have a median particle size of at least 1 nanometer, at least 1.5 nanometers, or at least 2 nanometers. The median particle size can be up to 200 nanometers, up to 150 nanometers, up to 100 nanometers, up to 50 nanometers, or up to 30 nanometers.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">Other optional components of the supersize composition include curing agents, surfactants, antifoaming agents, biocides, and other particulate additives known in the art for use in supersize compositions.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">The supersize coat can be formed, in some examples, by providing a supersize composition in which the components are dissolved or otherwise dispersed in a common solvent. In some examples, the solvent is water. After being suitably mixed, the supersize dispersion can be coated onto the underlying layers of the abrasive article and dried to provide the finished supersize coat. If a curing agent is present, the supersize composition can be cured (e.g., hardened) either thermally or by exposure to actinic radiation at suitable wavelengths to activate the curing agent.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">The coating of the supersize composition onto, e.g., the abrasive layer can be carried out using any known process. In some examples, the supersize composition is applied by spray coating at a constant pressure to achieve a pre-determined coating weight. Alternatively, a knife coating method where the coating thickness is controlled by the gap height of the knife coater can be used.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">Abrasive articles according to the present disclosure may be converted, for example, into a belt, roll (e.g., tape roll), disc (e.g., perforated disc), or sheet. They may be used by hand or in combination with a machine such as a belt grinder. For belt applications, the two free ends of an abrasive sheet are joined together and spliced, thus forming an endless belt.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">The term &#x201c;about&#x201d; as used herein can allow for a degree of variability in a value or range, for example, within 10%, within 5%, or within 1% of a stated value or of a stated limit of a range.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">Unless specified otherwise herein, the term &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; as used herein refers to a majority of, or mostly, as in at least about 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 99.5%, 99.9%, 99.99%, or at least about 99.999% or more.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152">Unless specified otherwise herein, the term &#x201c;substantially no&#x201d; as used herein refers to a minority of, or mostly no, as in less than about 10%, 5%, 2%, 1%, 0.5%, 0.01%, 0.001%, or less than about 0.0001% or less.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0153">Values expressed in a range format should be interpreted in a flexible manner to include not only the numerical values explicitly recited as the limits of the range, but also to include all the individual numerical values or sub-ranges encompassed within that range as if each numerical value and sub-range were explicitly recited.
