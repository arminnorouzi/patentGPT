described herein disclose an endpoint modeling and grouping management system that can collect data from endpoint computer devices in a network. In some embodiments, agents installed on the endpoints can collect real-time information at the kernel level providing the system with deep visibility. In some embodiments, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can identify similarities in behavior in response to assessing the data collected by the agents. In some embodiments, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can dynamically model groups such as logical groups, and cluster endpoints based on the similarities and/or differences in behavior of the endpoints. In some embodiments, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system transmits the behavioral models to the agents to allow the agents to identify anomalies and/or security threats autonomously.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="116.84mm" wi="158.75mm" file="US20230007031A1-20230105-D00000.TIF" alt="embedded

description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Although several embodiments, examples and illustrations are disclosed below, it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that the invention described herein extends beyond the specifically disclosed embodiments, examples and illustrations and includes other uses of the invention and obvious modifications and equivalents thereof. Embodiments of the invention are described with reference to the accompanying figures, wherein like numerals refer to like elements throughout. The terminology used in the description presented herein is not intended to be interpreted in any limited or restrictive manner simply because it is being used in conjunction with a detailed description of certain specific embodiments of the invention. In addition, embodiments of the invention can comprise several novel features and no single feature is solely responsible for its desirable attributes or is essential to practicing the inventions herein described.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The detection of viruses, spyware, Trojan horses, ransomware, and like malicious software (collectively referred to here as &#x201c;malware&#x201d;) on computer endpoints connected to an enterprise network is a large-scale problem for information technologists that are charged with maintaining and protecting information and software programs stored on these systems. The foregoing challenge is made more complicated by today's complex enterprise networks that are no longer just confined to hardware positioned behind or within a firewall and/or data access management systems. With the development of cloud computing storage facilities and software as a service (SaaS) capabilities, and the proliferation of mobile devices, such as smart phones, laptops, tablets and other devices, all of which generally sit outside the enterprise firewall, the enterprise network comprises multiple hardware devices which communicate with the network from outside within a firewall and/or data access management systems.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Rather, the enterprise network, broadly speaking, is now an elastic network as opposed to a fixed boundary network. With an elastic network, the challenge of protecting enterprise data and/or enterprise software systems from malware is made more complicated because IT administrators need not only be concerned with protecting computing devices within the firewall and/or data access management systems but also computing devices interacting with the corporate network from outside the firewall perimeter and/or data access management systems. For example, a mobile device that is located outside the enterprise firewall and/or data access management systems, and that is infected with a virus or like malicious software can compromise enterprise data and/or the systems within the enterprise firewall and/or data access management systems, especially if the mobile device possesses authorization to traverse the firewall and access systems and data within the firewall or other cloud computing systems connected to endpoints within the firewall.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Certain anti-virus systems merely focus on detecting known viruses, malware, ransomware, and the like, and such systems provide little protection from zero-day (meaning, previously unknown) malware. Many of today's varieties of malware are configured to continuously morph themselves so as to, for example, create a new digital signature associated with their software file, to allow them to avoid detection by traditional anti-virus systems that rely on &#x201c;black listed&#x201d; digital signatures for detection of such malware. Accordingly, there is a need for a system that is configured to protect enterprise data and/or software system from both known and unknown malware, especially in computing environments where the enterprise network exists not just within a firewall and/or data access management systems but also outside the firewall and/or data access management systems in elastic edge networks or grids.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">To address the foregoing challenges, this disclosure illustrates systems, methods, and devices for automatically and dynamically controlling processes and/or network access of endpoint devices, whether such devices are positioned inside or outside the enterprise firewall and/or data access management systems. It can be advantageous to control processes and/or network access of endpoints because if an endpoint is infected, the systems disclosed herein can be configured to prevent the endpoint, and therefore also prevent the malware that is operating on the endpoint, from accessing certain network connections and/or running certain processes, all of which can control the malware and/or limit the reach of the malware and/or prevent the malware from spreading to other systems and/or manipulating enterprise data.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In other words, the systems disclosed herein can be configured to create a safe protected environment for all endpoint devices on an elastic network whether or not such endpoints reside inside and outside the enterprise firewall and/or data access management systems. In certain embodiments, the system can be configured to create a safe protected environment for endpoints in an elastic network based on analyzing behavioral characteristics of all or some of the endpoints in the elastic network to determine what data access and/or network access privileges an endpoint should be granted. In many instances, malware causes endpoints to perform processes and/or to access certain network paths that the endpoint does not typically perform or access. Accordingly, by preventing atypical performance processes and/or atypical network accesses, the system can prevent a virus, malware, ransomware, and the like from causing damage to the endpoint device and/or to the enterprise systems and data.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In some embodiments, the systems, devices, and methods disclosed herein can be designed around the concept of creating an initial &#x201c;zero-trust&#x201d; security architecture that can continuously collect endpoint data at various level of granularity within the system to persistently verify and establish the credibility of individual endpoints and the network as a whole. Existing security models are based on point-in-time authentication, and thus are unable to ensure the integrity of an endpoint device or a network in between authentications. While the systems, devices, and methods described herein can provide point-in-time authentication, in some embodiments, a key aspect of the design is the continual nature of the verification of the integrity of a network and its various endpoint devices, as well as the verification of the users' identity. In some embodiments, this verification is established through artificial-intelligence (AI) driven analysis of individual endpoint, group, and network-wide usage patterns. In some embodiments, this analysis is centered on continuous monitoring and collection of data from endpoint devices, and the determination of a baseline usage of a user, endpoint device, group, subnetwork, network segment, or the network as a whole. Once established, baseline usage can be continuously updated and compared to current usage in order to authenticate users and endpoint devices on a persistent basis. In other words, the system described herein can establish an expectation of usage for various levels of granularity, from the network level all the way down to an individual user and/or endpoint device, and then compare that expectation to a current real usage to constantly perform validation. In some embodiments, the system is capable of separately validating the integrity of both an endpoint device and a user utilizing the endpoint device.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In certain embodiments, the systems disclosed herein can be configured to install agents on endpoints. In certain embodiments, the agents can be configured to analyze processes and/or network traffic occurring on an endpoint. In certain embodiments, the agents can be configured to transmit such analysis data to a central computing server system. In certain embodiments, the central computing server system can be configured to analyze the data to determine typical network access behavior and/or typical processor behavior for the endpoint. In certain embodiments, the agent is configured to analyze the data to determine typical network access behavior and/or typical processor behavior for the endpoint, and in certain embodiments, both the agent and the central server are configured to perform such behavioral analysis of the endpoint. In certain embodiments, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are employed by the agent and/or the central server to perform such behavioral analysis. Based on such behavioral analysis, the agent and/or the central server can be configured to determine and/or model what are the typical processes and/or network access patterns for the endpoint.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In certain embodiments, the system comprises a plurality of agents operating on a plurality of endpoints within an elastic network. In certain embodiments, the plurality of agents operating on a plurality of endpoints is communicating with the central server and/or is performing the same behavioral analysis disclosed above. In certain embodiments, the systems disclosed herein are configured to group and/or model a subset of the plurality of endpoints as having the same and/or similar processing and/or network access patterns. In certain embodiments, the systems disclosed herein can be configured to automatically and/or dynamically assign to the various determined groupings of the plurality of endpoints one or more rules or sets of rules for controlling certain processes and/or network accesses on the various determined groupings of the plurality of endpoints. In some embodiments, the system, through embedded agents and/or security agents at endpoint devices, which can include, without limitation, other systems, servers, computers, virtual machines, or the like, has the ability to monitor the endpoint devices and apply policies at the individual endpoint level. In some embodiments, the embedded agents act as a continuous verification and authentication monitor, rather than as a binary, point-in-time user authentication tool.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In some embodiments, the system comprises a plurality of agents installed on endpoint devices, wherein the agents are designed to ensure security on the endpoint devices. In some embodiments, ensuring security may involve accessing the device at a base level, such that, for example, an agent can monitor substantially all activity occurring on the device. In some embodiments, uninterrupted access to endpoint activity may allow the agent to validate, over time, that the endpoint device and/or the user utilizing the endpoint device are operating within the expectations of the system and/or within the expected typical use or activity or processes for that endpoint and/or user. In some embodiments, an agent may validate, at each point in time, that no anomalous activity is occurring on an endpoint device. In some embodiments, the system can continuously monitor substantially all aspects of an endpoint device operating system, such that it can recognize anomalies occurring at any point in time, and also patterns of anomalous behavior, to determine whether an endpoint has become compromised or unsecure. Furthermore, in some embodiments, through monitoring, the system can determine whether implemented security rules are violated, implement various controls or limitations over the endpoint functions, or do any other action defined by the system or a network administrator. In some embodiments, these actions and controls are implemented at the individual endpoint level. In some embodiments, these actions or controls are implemented on a defined or undefined group of endpoints or at the entire network level. In some embodiments, a centralized system can collect data from all the agents installed on a network to identify network-wide patterns of usage, such that vulnerabilities and issues that may be difficult or impossible to identify with the data from a single endpoint can be identified by the central system. For example, a specific use or pattern of usage on one or more endpoints may not be identified as anomalous alone by the agents installed therein, but may, when combined with data from some other endpoints or substantially all endpoints of the network, nonetheless be identified as anomalous by the system. In some embodiments, the agent-based system described herein can provide a layered security solution that provides individual endpoint security as well as network-wide security.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In some embodiments, the system described herein provides low-level, cross-platform monitoring of endpoint activities. In some embodiments, the system is configured to create, define, and/or dynamically alter a set of rules that determine which endpoint activities are identified as anomalous. In some embodiments, the set of rules can be defined by machine learning aspects, pre-determined rule sets, and/or administrator management.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">It can be advantageous for the system to perform such behavioral analysis because the system can reduce the work for IT administrators and/or the system can determine such behavioral patterns better than human operators. It can be advantageous for the system to automatically and/or dynamically assign one or more rules or sets of rules to one or more endpoints because the system can reduce the work for IT administrators and/or the system can better develop and/or assign such rules to endpoints, especially in situations where the enterprise network comprises, hundreds, thousands and/or millions of endpoint devices connected to the enterprise network.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In some embodiments, another central function of the system may be the creation, generation, and implementation of access policies, which can be based around determining a baseline usage or expectation of usage. In some embodiments, the generated access policies provide an outline for the endpoints, services, servers, programs, and the like, that any given user on any given endpoint can access at any given time. In some embodiments, the access policies are synthesized through the data collected from the continuous monitoring of endpoints through agents and the determination of baseline usage of users and/or endpoint devices. In some embodiments, the aggregate of the access policies applied to each individual and/or endpoint device comprise a network access policy as a whole. In some embodiments, the access policies can be inferred or generated directly from the baseline usage of users and/or endpoint devices, and then updated manually or automatically through AI analysis. In some embodiments, because the network can be managed by individual agents installed on endpoint devices and a central server, the access policies can be implemented on any and all levels of the network.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In certain embodiments, the agents are configured to assign to the various determined groupings of the plurality of endpoints one or more rules or sets of rules for controlling certain processes and/or network accesses on the various determined groupings of the plurality of endpoints. In certain embodiments, the central server is configured to assign to the various determined groupings of the plurality of endpoints one or more rules or sets of rules for controlling certain processes and/or network accesses on the various determined groupings of the plurality of endpoints. In certain embodiments, the system is configured to use both the agents and the central server to assign to the various determined groupings of the plurality of endpoints one or more rules or sets of rules for controlling certain processes and/or network accesses on the various determined groupings of the plurality of endpoints.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In certain embodiments, the agent operating on a particular endpoint can be configured to apply the one or more rules or sets of rules to determine whether to allow or reject a network access path request coming from a program or instruction running on an endpoint. In certain embodiments, the central server can be configured to apply the one or more rules or sets of rules to determine whether to allow or reject a network access path request coming from a program or instruction running on an endpoint. In certain embodiments, it can be advantageous for the agents to determine whether to allow or reject a network access path request coming from a program or instruction operating on a particular endpoint because the system acts in a distributed manner as opposed to the central server making all determinations and potentially causing a bottleneck. Additionally, a distributed system reduces network traffic over the network and the number of requests to the central server. In some embodiments, the systems described herein comprise a machine learning component for managing and restricting access to a network. In other embodiments, AI management and restriction of access to the network is supplemented or replaced by human administrator management. In some embodiments, human administrators may manually implement general or specific rules or manage access on a system wide or endpoint-by-endpoint basis. In some embodiments, the rules, policies, and access rights of the system, regardless of how they are fashioned, can be designed to ensure security of the endpoints and the network by, for example, ensuring that no malware or other malicious software is introduced, that the integrity of the certificates are not compromised, and that there are no anomalies in usage, among others.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In some embodiments, an edge network according to various embodiments herein may comprise, and be defined by, a collection of connected endpoints. In some embodiments, the policies or rules for managing or restricting access to the network may be devised and effected manually by, for example, a network administrator. In some embodiments, the edge networking system can perform other functions, such as profiling inbound and outbound connections, installing agents unto network endpoints, and/or managing and regulating access to various systems within and outside the network. In some embodiments, the systems, devices, methods herein can identify and group one or more endpoints and manage policies for restricting and/or allowing access between endpoints, between an endpoint and outside services and systems, and between endpoint and internal services or systems.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In some embodiments, the agent-based system described herein may enable network management through enhanced data availability. Network management may include altering endpoint data access rights, user exclusion, and/or endpoint locking, among others. In some embodiments, the system may restrict any or certain inbound connections from one or more sources outside the network. In some embodiments, the monitoring, rule setting, and/or network management aspects of the system can be controlled at the individual endpoint devices, as opposed to at the network level, through installed agents.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In some embodiments, an agent as described herein can be installed on an endpoint device to access and manage incoming and outgoing traffic on the device. In some embodiments, the agent, through its access to the device systems and traffic, can continuously validate the identity and permissions of a user of the device. In some embodiments, a network is defined by endpoint devices with installed agents and the system gains visibility and access to all devices of the network through the installed agents. In some embodiments, when an agent is installed on an endpoint, substantially all communications to and from an endpoint device can be monitored and stored by the agent, such that any network management rules (e.g. access rights) can be applied regardless of the physical location of the endpoint. In some embodiments, the agent-based system described herein can monitor and store all internal communications and/or external communications. For example, the system may be configured to monitor and store activity occurring between two endpoints within the network. In some embodiments, the system has visibility to these communications through kernel-level monitoring of endpoints with installed agents. In some embodiments, the system utilizes the data access and network management policies, enforced at the individual endpoints, to define a broad-level network across of a plurality of endpoints.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Another difficulty faced by existing network security, management, and control systems is the transient nature of the network, particularly with regard to new endpoint devices accessing the network and existing endpoint devices ceasing to exist on the network. In some embodiments, the systems, devices, and methods disclosed herein solve the difficulty of a constantly expanding and/or retracting network by constructing a continuously updated mapping, visualization, and/or representation of the network construct, including various network segments and/or subnetworks. In some embodiments, the system is configured to map a plurality of endpoint devices in a software-based, distributed manner. That is, the map or visualization can be assembled based on data received from distributed software throughout the network. In some embodiments, this distributed software comprises agents installed on each endpoint device of a network. In some embodiments, the system can provide a visualization or view of the network and/or various sub-networks by aggregating data collected from the agents installed on a plurality of endpoint devices. In some embodiments, the network can comprise various subnetworks, each subnetwork comprising one or more endpoint devices. In some embodiments, the system can be configured to assemble a view of the network and/or various subnetworks based on information received from agents. In some embodiments, the map, view, or visualization of the network, constructed using data from agents installed on endpoints, can provide an overall and/or piece-by-piece view of the network and/or various subnetworks.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">A related issue to the elastic nature of modern networks discussed above is the existence of non-traditional network-connected devices. The system described herein deals with this issue by gaining visibility of these devices through the distributed agent-based endpoint network and then integrating the control and network management functionalities to directly or indirectly supervise these non-traditional devices. In some embodiments, a network, network segments, and/or subnetworks can comprise various endpoint devices, some of which may have an agent installed and some of which may have no agent installed. However, in some embodiments, by virtue of having an agent installed on one or more endpoint devices of the network, the system may have visibility, through scanning or discovery functionality, over all endpoint devices on the network and/or subnetworks. By having visibility over endpoint devices without agents installed, the system can collect data from those devices, including, but not limited to, the existence of the unmanaged devices (i.e. devices with no agent installed therein), the network communications that the unmanaged devices have sent or received to and from other endpoint devices, and the existence or nonexistence of inbound or outbound connections to the unmanaged devices. Based on this collected data, the endpoint-based network system can dynamically determine necessary actions to take regarding the preservation or termination of communications and connections between the unmanaged devices and the network as a whole, subnetworks, network segments, logical groups, physical groups, or even individual endpoints. In some embodiments, the system can be configured to include the unmanaged devices in grouping themselves, and thus apply any group-specific rules directly to the unmanaged device and its communications with other endpoint devices in the network. In some embodiments, the dynamic determination and groupings can be made by, for example, an orchestration layer as described below.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In some embodiments, the system can be configured to counter compromised vulnerable Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Some malicious software uses IoT devices for use as proxies or intermediaries for Internet requests to route malicious traffic for cyber-attacks and computer network exploitation. IoT devices, sometimes referred to as &#x201c;smart&#x201d; devices, are devices that communicate with the Internet to send or receive data. Examples of targeted IoT devices include: routers, wireless radios links, time clocks, audio/video streaming devices, Raspberry Pis, IP cameras, DVRs, satellite antenna equipment, smart garage door openers, and network attached storage devices. IoT proxy servers may be attractive to malicious cyber actors because they provide a layer of anonymity by transmitting all Internet requests through the victim device's IP address. In some embodiments, IoT devices may be particularly attractive targets because they allow access to many business websites that block traffic from suspicious or foreign IP addresses. In some embodiments, malicious software can use the compromised device's IP address to engage in intrusion activities, making it difficult to filter regular traffic from malicious traffic. In some embodiments, malicious software can use compromised IoT devices as proxies to, for example, send spam e-mails, maintain anonymity or avoid detection, obfuscate network traffic, mask Internet browsing, generate click-fraud activities, buy, sell, and trade illegal images and goods, conduct credential stuffing attacks, and sell or lease IoT botnets to other cyber actors for financial gain. In some embodiments, IoT devices may have weak authentication, unpatched firmware or other software vulnerabilities, or have easily defeated default usernames and passwords. In some embodiments, the agent-based endpoint network disclosed herein can combat attacks that occur through IoT devices by detecting, monitoring, and controlling communications from these devices into the endpoint devices.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In some embodiments, the agent-based system may provide visibility into substantially all computerized devices, including those without installed agents and/or in proximity with an endpoint device with an installed agent. In some embodiments, the system can identify and gain visibility of all devices in the same subnet, visible, or accessible network in proximity to an endpoint device. These devices may include any internet or network-connected devices, such as physical devices, vehicles, home appliances, and any other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and connectivity which enable these things to connect and exchange data In some embodiments, an installed agent may be configured to scan a visible network, which may include any sub-network, or the entire network. In some embodiments, the system can utilize discovery protocols to ascertain the existence and obtain data from all devices in or in proximity to a network. In some embodiments, the system can obtain data from these devices, including the operating system, the type of device, IP address, and MAC address, among others. In some embodiments, the system may protect the endpoint-based network from attacks that are directed through these &#x201c;unmanaged&#x201d; (i.e. no agent installed) devices by restricting network communications between unmanaged devices and network endpoints.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In some embodiments, the system may also comprise an orchestration functionality or layer, which may serve to coordinate the collection and aggregation of data from the plurality of agents. In some embodiments, this orchestration layer may increase system efficiency by directing discovery protocols, network scanning, data collection and aggregation, network visualization construction, and various other system functionalities to reduce excessive or nonessential functions. In some embodiments, the orchestration functionality can amass the data from all of the endpoints and agents of the network, network segments, and/or subnetworks to create one or more cohesive views, visualizations, asset inventories, lists, or the like, in order to provide a mapping, grouping or representation of the network, network segments, and/or subnetworks. In some embodiments, the data is collected from agents installed in physical endpoints on the network, data centers, cloud services, non-traditional devices (e.g. IoT devices, printers, etc.) or any other part of the network.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In some embodiments, the system can be configured to utilize the continuously updated mapping, visualization, and/or representation to update the network groupings, access rules, network administration, and all other facets of the security and network management functionalities. In this way, the system can dynamically react to the expansion or retraction of the network through the addition and/or departure of endpoint devices to and from the network. The system may also include non-traditional endpoint devices including IoT devices into groupings such that group access rights and rules can be applied to those devices. In the alternative, in some embodiments, non-traditional endpoint devices on the network may not be grouped, and the system may determine, based on data aggregated from the agents installed on the endpoint devices, that one or more non-traditional endpoint devices should be able to communicate with all, some, or none of the other endpoint devices of the network. In some embodiments, this determination can be based on a holistic behavioral analysis of the network, the various network segments, subnetworks, and/or individual endpoints. The level of granularity and specificity to which the system can control groupings and therefore access rights and network communications management of the endpoint devices of the network, including non-traditional endpoint devices, is not limited. Specifically, network groupings and rules can be applied to the network as a whole, to particular subnetworks or network segments, to groups of endpoints, to individual endpoints, to non-traditional endpoints, to third-party services, enterprise services, and the like, and to any and all communications between any of the above (e.g. between an individual endpoint and its own group or a separate group of endpoints). There are very few limitations on the extent and specificity of control that the system can have on grouping and controlling the endpoints of the network and the network as a whole, or in parts. In some embodiments, some devices on the network can be controlled and managed, even without installing an agent therein, by limiting the ability of those devices to communicate with other devices on the network.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In some embodiments, the system described herein is not limited by physical proximity to a network. Because agents can be installed directly on endpoints, the physical location of the endpoints does not determine whether the endpoint benefits from the security features of the flexible network system described herein.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In some embodiments, the system can be configured to access a holistic amalgamation of network connection and system activity data, including, for example, what software is being utilized at an endpoint, what data is sent and received over a network connection, the time and form of user authentication, and/or the time and form of endpoint validation, among others. Thus, in some embodiments, the security features of the system can function in connection with a complete view of endpoint activity and network communications. In some embodiments, the system can be configured to continuously monitor endpoint activity and network communications, rather than solely at the time a network connection is formed. In some embodiments, the agent-based system may be configured to ensure the integrity of a network connection, in addition to the data sent and received over that connection.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In some embodiments, the system can authenticate the sender and receiver of data over a network connection such that integrity of the network connection is ensured. In some embodiments, the system can restrict data transfer over a network connection if it identifies an illegitimate sender or receiver. In some embodiments, the system can perform this authentication and other integrity checks, through an installed agent, by parsing requests and responses sent and received by an endpoint, monitoring bandwidth usage, and/or scrutinizing contextual data (e.g. time of access), among others. In some embodiments, the agent-based system may terminate illegitimate connections.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In some embodiments, the system described herein may facilitate faster and more efficient network communications than, for example, a virtual private network (VPN). In some embodiments, the system may introduce no latency into network connections. In some embodiments, the system may perform without latency regardless of the underlying network infrastructure, because the system may not perform routing of network connections and agents are installed directly at endpoints. In some embodiments, the system is not bound by any network infrastructure limitations or overhead caused by routing network traffic.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Certain enterprise networks can use centralized servers to identify anomalies, such as malware, and/or to determine access restrictions. Identification and response to these anomalies can be delayed based on the latency to and from the centralized servers. Furthermore, these enterprise networks can be required to perform anomaly detection for hundreds of thousands of endpoints connected within its perimeters and/or connected cloud services and data centers. In some embodiments, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system disclosed herein addresses these shortcomings by enabling agents installed on the endpoints to detect anomalies, respond to security threats, enforce network policies, regulate network access, and the like. In some embodiments, the agents can regulate network access by employing AI techniques to generate access policies for an endpoint, allowing or restricting connection to, from, and/or of an endpoint and/or an asset, setting authentication criteria for a connection, establishing roles for endpoints, change and/or update policies at endpoints, and the like. In some embodiments, the agents can enforce network policies, such as shutting down and/or enabling network access, setting and/or limiting network bandwidth, generating an alert based on network bandwidth usage, locking an endpoint based on bandwidth usage, setting bandwidth policies for specified connections to particular endpoints and/or assets, controlling traffic during certain time periods such as outside of normal business working hours, deploying internet security for a particular connection and/or endpoint, and the like. In some embodiments, the agents can identify anomalies and perform actions autonomously by applying the models generated by the endpoint modeling and grouping management system.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">To enable the foregoing, in certain embodiments, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can be configured to collect data from endpoint computer devices in a network.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Enterprise networks can collect network traffic data. However, often times the network traffic data is encrypted and may not provide any visibility for activities occurring within an endpoint, within an enterprise network perimeter, within a cloud service, within a cloud data center, and the like. Furthermore, endpoints on traditional enterprise networks can connect directly with a cloud service while outside of the enterprise network perimeter, and thus, traditional enterprise networks may not have visibility on this type of traffic. In some embodiments, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system addresses these shortcomings of enterprise network technology by enabling an agent to monitor activity at the kernel level. In some embodiments, the agents can monitor data packets before encryption and/or after decryption. In some embodiments, the agents can monitor activity occurring within the endpoint. In some embodiments, the agents can monitor activity when the endpoints are outside of a traditional enterprise network perimeter. In some embodiments, the agents can monitor data packets enclosed in a layer of protection, such as a sandbox. Thus, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can provide deep visibility on the activities of endpoints connected to the endpoint modeling and grouping management system.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">In some embodiments, agents installed on the endpoints can collect real-time information on the kernel level providing the system with deep visibility to a wide range of data types, such as internal endpoint activity, encrypted data, and the like. In some embodiments, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can identify similarities in behavior by employing an artificial intelligence component on the data collected by the agents. In some embodiments, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can dynamically model groups such as logical groups, and cluster endpoints based on the behavioral similarities and/or differences identified among the activities of the endpoints. In some embodiments, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system transmits the behavioral models to the agents to allow the agents to identify anomalies and/or security threats.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">In some embodiments, the endpoint grouping and modeling systems herein can utilize various data to determine and model endpoint groupings. In some embodiments, the system can be configured to use an all-inclusive approach, wherein the system examines the data from the various endpoints as a whole. For instance, the system may survey, for example, every IP address contacted, every service utilized, and every network communication, inbound or outbound, to and from each endpoint in order to classify and group endpoints with similar characteristics. In some embodiments, the result of this classification and grouping mechanism may be to assemble a group of endpoints having similar baseline access and network communication patterns. In some embodiments, the endpoint grouping may or may not coincide with user's having similar access needs based on, for example, their job responsibilities, their location, or any other user classification. For example, software developers within an enterprise network may utilize use-case specific services like GitHub, Visual Studio, Python that may indicate to the system that this endpoint or user should be grouped with other endpoints or users with similar usage patterns (e.g. other software developers), and that the group should have limited access or communication to services or endpoints that do not match the established pattern of usage of the group or do not pair with a system-determined purpose or intent of the group's users or endpoints. In some embodiments, the grouping modeling system's analysis extends beyond the identity of the services, resources, or endpoints to which an endpoint is accessing. In some embodiments, the system may also analyze, for example, when the access occurs, how frequently access occurs, the duration of each instance of access, the amount of data transferred during each instance of access, the type of data transferred, bandwidth usage, identity of the user accessing, current processes running on the endpoint device before, and during, and after the time of access. In some embodiments, all of the above and more may be utilized to determine groupings, to establish a baseline of usage for an endpoint device and/or a grouping, and to generate and set access rights, security, and network communication protocols.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">In some embodiments, the system can be configured to generate and provide multiple unique views or visualizations of the network and its various groupings and subnetworks. For example, in some embodiments, the network can be viewed as a whole or in part based on, for instance, logical groupings, physical location of endpoints, subnetworks, network segments, device types, managed devices, unmanaged devices, similarities in inbound and outbound connections, similarities in types of applications installed, time of use of endpoint device, frequency of use, time of use of applications, type of WiFi network used, access point utilized temperature of devices, device memory usage, type of hardware, RPM of hardware, number of CPU cycles on endpoint device, third-party organizational groupings, and any other properties available to an agent or the central server.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">In some embodiments, the systems, devices, and methods described herein can be configured to integrate with other existing third-party services, deployment means, enterprise mobility management (EMM) tools, authentication software, and security protocols deployed alongside the endpoint-based network system. In some embodiments, the data and information collected by the system described herein can enable automation of third-party solutions running alongside the system within a network. For example, the system, through the discovery and grouping protocols described herein, may scan and discover an unmanaged device within an existing grouping. Having visibility of this unmanaged device may allow the system to then use existing deployment tools or means, such as, for example, Active Directory, to deploy an agent unto the unmanaged device. The tools and solutions which may be integrated with the endpoint-based network system herein is not limited, and may include any other platform running within the network environment. Specific examples include, for example, Active Directory, Jamf, Tanium, IBM Bigfix, Kaspersky, Trend Micro, Tripwire, Carbon Black, Symantec Endpoint Protection, Ivanti Endpoint, SCCM, McAfee, CrowdStrike, Trend Micro Deep Security, Avast, Shield, Norton, and the like. In some embodiments, the system can be integrated into these third-party platforms such that agents can be automatically deployed to endpoints by the existing platforms, such that specific access or network management rules developed by the system can be deployed through the third-party platforms.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Traditional enterprise networks can define their network topology and/or network perimeter based on hardware. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a traditional enterprise network perimeter based on hardware, a firewall and/or data access management systems. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a traditional enterprise network perimeter based on a firewall and/or data access management systems with external devices and cloud services.

Typically traditional enterprise networks can inspect and/or monitor inbound and outbound network traffic of the connection tunnel (such as by using intrusion detection and prevent systems (IDS) which are a commonly used network security/threat prevention procedure that examines network traffic flows). Traditional enterprise networks can monitor and inspect network traffic to detect and prevent vulnerability exploits coming from malicious inputs to a target application or service. Attackers can input malicious input to interrupt and/or gain control of an application or computing device. For example, attackers can disable an application, access all rights and permissions available to the compromised application, and the like.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">However, data available to traditional enterprise networks can be limited to network traffic to and from the external computing devices. Thus, these traditional enterprise networks can monitor and/or inspect network traffic between endpoints <b>104</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> that are within the traditional enterprise network perimeter and computing devices external to the enterprise network perimeter <b>115</b> and/or to other networks <b>118</b>. Traditional enterprise networks can also monitor and/or inspect network traffic between endpoints <b>104</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> that are within the traditional enterprise network perimeter and cloud computing systems (such as cloud services and/or cloud databases) <b>122</b>. The traditional enterprise network may not have access to network traffic internal to the endpoints within the enterprise network perimeter <b>104</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> nor traffic within an external cloud computing system. This becomes problematic in today's world where a user can be traveling from one destination to another. For example, an individual can use his or her cellphone and/or a laptop from a different location in the world than the location of their desktop. Endpoints such as a desktop can be connected to a home or work network for extended periods of time and thus, can stay within the enterprise network perimeter. However, for endpoints that are remote computing devices such as the cellphone and laptop, the endpoints can connect and disconnect from the home or work network periodically throughout the day. Thus, the endpoints can be outside the enterprise network perimeter, and thus at certain times, communicate directly with cloud data centers and/or cloud applications. The communication channels and/or network traffic may not be restricted with the same network restrictions an endpoint may have when within the perimeters of the traditional enterprise network. The endpoints may also not be protected by the same network protections available on the enterprise network. As a result, the direct communication channel to and from the endpoint may not be monitored and inspected for security threats and/or may not have any form of access provisioning applied because the endpoint can bypass these mechanisms by being outside the enterprise network perimeter.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">In addition, a single user can own several endpoints, some residing within the enterprise network perimeter (such as a work desktop) and endpoints that may not be within the enterprise network perimeter (such as a mobile phone or a laptop). Furthermore, a user's endpoint can also be continually changing, such as when a user purchases a new laptop or phone. Therefore, a user can be connected to a plurality of different networks at once and change continuously. Traditional enterprise networks can address this by allowing new devices within the perimeter to have protections and access rights. However, a shortcoming is that when malicious code connects within the enterprise network perimeter, the malicious code can have access to a large amount of data and/or operations within the enterprise network perimeter.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">Another issue with traditional enterprise networks is the rise of encryption in network traffic. Network traffic can be encrypted before transmission and decrypted upon receipt at the destination computing device. Thus, a traditional enterprise network that monitors the inbound and/or outbound network traffic may not be able to view the content and/or other important information available on the network data packet being transmitted and/or received.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Furthermore, the data available to traditional enterprise networks can often be limited to network traffic. Accordingly, these enterprise networks can have limited and/or no visibility into the operations and processes that are occurring within the transmitting computing device and the receiving computing device. For example, these enterprise networks can monitor the incoming and outgoing network traffic of a computing device but may not be able to monitor communication between applications (such as a browser on the user's space) and the CPU. Given this limited visibility, the traditional enterprise networks may not have the information necessary to effectively assess security risks, understand and assess behavior of the computing devices, and/or offer cyber security solutions at the operational level of a computing device.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Moreover, traditional enterprise networks may have limited or no visibility to activities occurring external to its perimeter (such as activity occurring on the cloud network). As mentioned herein, traditional enterprise networks have not been able to effectively regulate communication between corporate enterprise networks and cloud data centers/services. Given the widespread adoption of cloud network services by many corporations, users can access data (for example, work email, sensitive documents) via their mobile phones that can access cloud applications and/or cloud data centers directly. This direct communication tunnel from the endpoint to a cloud service may not involve the transmission of network traffic through the enterprise network, and thus may not go through the enterprise network firewall and/or data access management systems for monitoring and access restrictions. Accordingly, traditional enterprise networks may not be able to monitor and/or regulate such communication. Furthermore, a growing number of data leaks and security breaches include compromise of a large number of sensitive documents. This is at least partially due to the fact when there is a security leak into the enterprise network perimeter, the security breach not only includes the files that are stored within the enterprise network but can also include the files that are stored in the cloud data centers and/or the cloud services that are accessible by endpoints within the enterprise network. Thus, the security breach can spread to machines with the perimeter and machines within the cloud. This is becoming a growing problem as enterprises are adding more devices and more services to their corporate enterprise networks, growing the enterprise network perimeter and linking the endpoints to larger cloud data centers and more cloud services, thus providing attackers with access to more information.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">Some enterprise networks tried to solve this problem of limited visibility by placing a secure socket layer (SSL) terminator. An SSL connection can be used by applying a certificate for authentication before sending encrypted data from an endpoint to a web server. Then, the SSL terminator can intercept the encrypted network traffic and decrypt the network traffic on a separate computing device using the certificate in order to access content within the network traffic. These types of solutions, however, often raise privacy concerns. For example, users may not want to make their certificates that are used to decrypt the network traffic available to third parties.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Various embodiments described herein address one or more shortcomings of traditional enterprise networks. In some embodiments, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can achieve deep visibility of activity on the network and in the endpoint, both encrypted and non-encrypted communications, via agents installed at the endpoints. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a network perimeter using an endpoint modeling and grouping management system and agents installed on endpoints according to some embodiments. In some embodiments, an enterprise network perimeter can comprise one or more endpoints with applied network configurations. An enterprise network perimeter can comprise applying access restrictions to the one or more endpoints within the network perimeter. An enterprise network perimeter can comprise security assessment of inbound and outbound traffic to the network perimeter. In some embodiments, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system <b>140</b> can access and analyze the network traffic and/or activity data generated by the agents <b>145</b>A, <b>145</b>B, <b>145</b>C, <b>145</b>D, <b>145</b>E, <b>145</b>F, <b>145</b>I, <b>145</b>J (collectively referred to herein as agents <b>145</b>). In some embodiments, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system <b>140</b> can model and cluster groups such as logical groups of endpoints based on the network traffic and/or activity data. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a grouping of endpoints with installed agents according to some embodiments. The endpoint modeling and grouping management system can determine a grouping such as a logical grouping <b>126</b> that encompasses endpoints <b>104</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>114</b>, <b>115</b>, and <b>118</b>. The endpoint modeling and grouping management system can assess other types of data, such as active directory information to model and cluster groups such as logical groups of endpoints. In some embodiments, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system <b>140</b> can transmit the model (or the artificial intelligence software) to end points and/or agents <b>145</b> in a group such as logical group. The models can be used to assess activity on the endpoints in order to identify anomalies. In some embodiments, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system <b>140</b> can determine enforcement and data control path policies based on the modeling of groups. In some embodiments, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can employ artificial intelligence to model and cluster groups such as logical groups and/or determine enforcement and data control path policies. In some embodiments, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system <b>140</b> can be a cloud-based system. In some embodiments, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system <b>140</b> can be a system within and/or external to the enterprise network perimeter.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">In some embodiments, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can employ edge computing by optimizing cloud computing systems to perform data processing at the edges of the network, near the source of the data. In some embodiments, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can identify similarities and/or differences among the data collected from agents installed on various endpoint computer devices. In some embodiments, based on the comparison of the data collected via the agents, the endpoints can be grouped or clustered into groups such as logical groups. The models for the groups such as logical groups can be transmitted to the end points and/or the agents. In some embodiments, the models can provide an indication of baseline activity. Agents and/or endpoints can receive the models, identify baseline activity, and autonomously assess endpoint activity and/or network traffic for anomalies. Anomalies can be used to flag behavior that can indicate a security breach, such as malware or a computer virus. Thus, the agents can identify potential security breaches and react faster than traditional enterprise networks, where data can be transmitted to a cloud server for the cloud server to identify anomalies.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">In some embodiments, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can calculate similarities and/or differences between endpoint devices. In some embodiments, the similarities can be identified using a similarity measure and/or function (such as the distance between devices, or certain data packet types transmitted and received). In some embodiments, the similarities can include perimeters and/or data points indicative of behaviors of the endpoints. For example, similarities can be identified based on an assessment of the inbound and outbound network traffic, the network connections of the endpoints, the types of devices that the endpoints are associated with, the amount of network traffic on a certain network connection, and the like. The groups such as logical groups can be dynamically and automatically created based on behavioral activity in order to create network representations of the groups such as logical groups. In some embodiments, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can continually add and remove endpoints to the groups such as logical groups based on behavioral activity analysis. The endpoint modeling and grouping management system can continually change the membership of the groups such as logical groups, making the groups such as logical groups an elastic grid. In some embodiments, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can define an enterprise network perimeter based on the grouping. Thus, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can create an elastic perimeter that can virtually encompass endpoints. In some embodiments, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can define the enterprise network perimeter by grouping endpoints with similar behaviors. In some embodiments, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can create the enterprise network perimeter based on an installed agent such that each endpoint with the installed agent can be determined to be within the enterprise network perimeter regardless of the current location of the endpoint. The groups such as logical groups can be defined behaviorally, beyond the boundaries of hardware, network, endpoint, cloud, physical, or virtual datacenters. Thus, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can address one or more shortcomings of traditional enterprise networks where the perimeters can be defined by hardware connections. These traditional enterprise networks may not provide protection, access restrictions, and the like to endpoints that are outside of the enterprise network perimeter whereas the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can define its perimeter based on the installed agents, and thus can provide access restrictions, protection, and the like regardless of the location of the endpoints.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">In some embodiments, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can set policies based on groupings such as logical groupings. In some embodiments, the policies can regulate network access of the endpoints. For example, for a particular group such as logical group, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can apply certain policies to certain groups such as logical groups. For example, a group such as logical group can access certain datacenters, only access certain endpoints via virtual private network (VPN), or allow access to cloud application/servers. For example, the finance logical group can have access to certain datacenters that the engineering logical group may not have access to.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>E</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a grouping by an endpoint modeling and grouping management system, which can be configured to apply access restrictions to the grouping.

Thus, the certificates may not be needed to identify encrypted network traffic. Furthermore, the agents can collect data before being encrypted for transmission to an external communication channel and/or collect data after decryption from transmission from an external communication channel.

Thus, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can access not only network traffic, but network traffic after the data packets are decrypted for inbound transmission and/or before the data packets are encrypted for outbound transmission. The endpoint modeling and grouping management system can also access and/or monitor all activity on the kernel level, such as activity internal to the endpoint, further addressing another shortcoming of traditional enterprise networks that may be limited to inbound or outbound network traffic.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">In some embodiments, the user space <b>602</b> can comprise one or more programs <b>606</b> that are running on the endpoint, such as a browser application.

Thus, the agent <b>604</b> can be configured to collect this data passing through the library <b>626</b> before the data is transmitted to the external computing device. In some embodiments, the agent <b>604</b> can be installed on the library <b>626</b> and/or on a driver that collects data from the library <b>626</b>.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152">The agent <b>605</b> can be installed on a program <b>606</b> of the user space <b>602</b> and/or can be a driver that collects data from a program <b>606</b> on the user space <b>602</b>.

In some embodiments, the agents and/or the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can parse and/or assess collected data. For example, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can parse the URL to identify the host name of the URL and/or the https meta header. In some embodiments, one or more agents can collect cookie information, guest parameters, host parameters, and/or http parameters from endpoint activity. In some embodiments, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can monitor browsing history of one or more endpoints and determine behavioral patterns of the one or more endpoints based on the browsing history.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0155">In some embodiments, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can identify matches in certain types of collected data to determine groups. In some embodiments, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can create policies and/or enforcement data in accordance with the type of data collected. In some embodiments, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can allow for a search on the collected data generated by the agents installed at various endpoints within the elastic network (for example, analyzing for a specific indicator of compromise (IOC)). In some embodiments, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can analyze and/or match files and/or header data. Further, in some embodiments, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can be configured to match endpoints visiting a particular website at a particular time and date, identify endpoints with activity in a certain geographical region, and the like.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="2">Elastic Grid and Autonomous Anomaly Identification</heading><p id="p-0157" num="0156">In some embodiments, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can define an enterprise network perimeter based on one or more groupings. Thus, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can create an elastic perimeter that virtually encompasses endpoints. In some embodiments, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can define the enterprise network perimeter by grouping endpoints with similar behaviors. For example, an AI component of the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can identify similarities in behaviors of endpoints. In some embodiments, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can identify each endpoint installed with an agent as part of the enterprise network perimeter.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0157"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a flow diagram illustrating transmission of behavioral models to one or more agents based on analysis of data collected from the agents according to some embodiments of an endpoint modeling and grouping management system transmitting.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0158">At block <b>802</b>, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can identify endpoints to which agents can be deployed. For example, the system can determine that one or more agents need to be deployed to a computer within an enterprise network perimeter, a computer outside an enterprise network perimeter, an in-perimeter datacenter, a datacenter outside of a perimeter, and/or a cloud datacenter. In some embodiments, at block <b>804</b>, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can deploy the agents to one or more identified, detected, and/or determined endpoints.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0159">At block <b>806</b>, each of the endpoints that received agents can be configured to install the received agent. In some embodiments, each or some of the endpoints can comprise computing devices and/or memory located on an enterprise network, on a cloud system, on a remote computing device, and/or the like. For example, Endpoint <b>1</b> can be an endpoint on a computer within an enterprise network perimeter. Endpoint <b>2</b> can be an endpoint on a computer outside of an enterprise network perimeter. Endpoint <b>3</b> can be an endpoint on an in-perimeter datacenter. Endpoint <b>4</b> can be an endpoint on a datacenter outside of the perimeter, and endpoint <b>5</b> and endpoint <b>6</b> can be endpoints on cloud datacenters 1 and 2. In some embodiments, one of the endpoints in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> can be a cloud service, such as Salesforce, Office 365, Dropbox, Box, GitHub, and/or the like, wherein the system does not deploy an agent at the cloud service endpoint, but rather regulates network access to and/or from the cloud service endpoint.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0160">At blocks <b>808</b>, the agents can collect and transmit endpoint data. For example, the agents can collect data at the kernel level, identifying internal activities of the endpoints, encrypted and non-encrypted data, inbound/outbound network traffic data, network usage, application usage, processor usage, time period usage, geographic location of the endpoints, corporate department, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0161">At block <b>810</b>, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can identify one or more additional endpoints without an agent installed and deploy an agent to those endpoints. In some embodiments, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can identify an endpoint without an agent on the same computing platform as another endpoint. For example, an endpoint can have an agent installed, which can be used to identify another endpoint without an agent installed that is part of the same cloud datacenter, in-perimeter data center, out-perimeter datacenter, in-perimeter computer, and/or out-perimeter computer.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162">At block <b>806</b>, the endpoint can install the agent at additional endpoints, and at block <b>808</b>, the agent can collect endpoint data from the endpoints and transmit the data to the endpoint modeling and grouping management system. Accordingly, when an endpoint is added to the network via the agent, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can gain visibility to processing and/or activity of that endpoint by receiving data collected by the agent installed on the endpoint. Thus, the network enterprise perimeter can be defined based at least in part on the data collected by the agents that are installed on the one or more endpoints. This can improve shortcomings of certain enterprise network regimes that are configured to provide software-defined or pre-defined perimeters on a central server, a virtual router, a cloud server, or the like. This can also further improve inefficiency of some enterprise network regimes arising from having to route all traffic to a central server and have the central server respond with its assessment (for example, transmitting access regulations for each data packet). Furthermore, some enterprise network regimes can have limited visibility on encrypted network packets traveling through the network, whereas certain embodiments herein provide visibility to activity or processing at one or more endpoints as described above.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0163">At block <b>812</b>, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system assesses the data collected by the agents and identifies or determines similarities in the received endpoint data across one or more endpoints. For example, the system can determine that one or more endpoints are similar based on network usage, application usage, processor usage, time period usage, geographic location of the endpoints, corporate department, and/or the like. Further, at block <b>812</b>, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can have visibility of activity within the endpoints that have agents installed, such as network usage, application usage, processor usage, time period usage, geographic location of the endpoints, corporate department, and/or the like. For example, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can have visibility of substantially all endpoints with agents installed therein.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0164">At block <b>814</b>, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can determine groups, such as logical groups, based on identified similarities and/or differences. For example, the identified or determined similarities and/or differences can be based on similarities and/or differences in network usage, application usage, processor usage, time period usage, geographic location of the endpoints, corporate department, and/or the like. Each of the groups can comprise one or more endpoints, one or more computer systems, one or more data centers, one or more cloud services, one or more cloud data centers, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0165">At block <b>816</b>, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can generate a model for each grouping. For example, the model can be a baseline model that indicates a baseline behavior for endpoints in the group. In some embodiments, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can identify matches in certain types of collected data to determine groups. In some embodiments, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can match files and/or header data. For example, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can match endpoints visiting a particular website at a particular time and date, identify activity in a certain common geographical region, and the like.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0166">In some embodiments, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can determine a model for groups based on one or more characteristics. For example, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can create a model according to traffic at the kernel, browsing history, all access data, inbound and outbound connection in a communication protocol (including encrypted traffic), operations on the operating system, device type, processes that are running on the user space and/or other systems of the computing device, network traffic, input from a user, data storage activity, real-time processing, batch processing, multitasking, interactive processing, multiprogramming, transaction processing, multi-access operations, timesharing operations, active directory, access control lists, packet information, protocol information, port number information, packet state information, application information, VPN information, data usage, bandwidth usage, proxy usage, other types of information translated by the kernel for processing in the CPU, a subset and/or all characteristics, and the like.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0167">In some embodiments, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can generate a model to establish network access regulations. At block <b>818</b>, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can determine network access rights for one or more groups of endpoints. The endpoint modeling and grouping management system can regulate the network access restrictions of the endpoints within a particular group. For example, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can restrict and/or allow network access to a particular cloud data center, a cloud service, a part of the enterprise network, database server, network application, or other devices or services. The endpoint modeling and grouping management system can dynamically identify groups and/or automatically set access restrictions for the groups. Instead of traditional enterprise networks where IT staff are required to identify access regulations for networks with hundreds, thousands, and/or millions of endpoints connected to servers, data centers, and cloud services, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can automatically identify logical networks and generate access restrictions. The endpoint modeling and grouping management system can identify access regulations based on similarities among endpoints, for example, similarities in network usage, application usage, processor usage, time period usage, geographic location of the endpoints, corporate department, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0168">At block <b>820</b>, the endpoints receive the models generated by the endpoint modeling and grouping management system and, for example, at blocks <b>822</b> and <b>824</b>, identify baseline behavior based on the models for each group. For example, some can be assigned to logical group 1, and other can be assigned to logical group 2.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0169">In some embodiments, certain endpoints in a group typically access certain network resources, use a certain amount of bandwidth, or the like at a particular time periods (for example, a time of the day, week, month, year). In some embodiments, the system can be configured to use this information to model a baseline behavior. Based on the baseline behavior data, the system can be configured to identify a sudden increase in network data usage and/or odd time periods when network paths are being accessed from an endpoint within the elastic network. For example, the system can be configured to identify when an endpoint is utilizing abnormal network data bandwidth in order to upload and/or download data from a cloud service, wherein such usage represents a big spike above the normal baseline use, and upon identification of such abnormal network usage patterns, the system can be configured to flag the endpoint to a user as a concern and/or automatically and/or immediately restrict network usage for the endpoint acting abnormally. The endpoint modeling and grouping management system can perform such analysis to identify data leaks. Such an approach overcomes the shortcomings of traditional data leak prevention products that can be focused on identifying fixed strings on a network and/or can be focused on device control (such as preventing a device from accessing or copying a file). Focusing on fixed strings and/or device control cannot effectively be applied to an elastic enterprise network with connectivity to mobile devices and to cloud services located outside the firewall.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0170">In some embodiments, the baseline behavior for each group such as logical group can be used to identify abnormal behavior. For example, identifying abnormal behavior can include behavior at a certain time period, types of data packets, an amount of data, encryption techniques used, inbound/outbound network traffic, connection attempts to and from certain external devices, and the like. At block <b>826</b>, the agents can collect endpoint data, and at blocks <b>828</b> the agents can identify abnormal behavior from the baseline identified in the models. Thus, the models that were sent by the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can enable the endpoints to act autonomously and identify abnormal behavior on its own. In some embodiments, the agents can identify abnormal behavior without having to send data to the endpoint modeling and grouping management system and/or other central server, cloud server, network server, or the like. Because the identification of the abnormal behavior can occur on the endpoints via the agent, the response can be quicker before the security attack can take further action without having to send a notice to a central server and wait for a response. Furthermore, performing the assessment and/or the enforcement at the agent, the required communications back and forth with the endpoint modeling and grouping management system (and/or a central server) is reduced. This becomes important in today's enterprise networks where over a million endpoints can be connected to a cloud system with access controls for each endpoint. Thus, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system in the present disclosure can be scalable, whereas a centralized server performing the identification of abnormal behavior may not be scalable. Another benefit is that the enforcement policies can occur in real-time as processes are sent and/or received at the kernel level. Connection attempts from the endpoint to an external device and/or connection attempts from an external device to the endpoint can be detected before the connection is established. Thus, the agents can restrict these connections in real-time before security breaches occur.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0171">Once abnormal behavior is identified, the agents can autonomously take certain action, such as initiating forensics analysis, mitigation and/or remediation techniques, containment mechanisms, rolling back capabilities, file and machine quarantine, external threat feed ingestion, restricting and/or terminating network path access, and the like.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0172">At block <b>830</b>, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can receive the identified abnormal behavior and perform further security risk assessment. At block <b>816</b>, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can update the model based on the identified abnormal behavior, and transmit the updated model to endpoints of the group such as logical group.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0173">In some embodiments, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can identify endpoints that appear to belong to a particular group such as logical group, but can create exceptions for the endpoint. In some embodiments, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can create customizations to groups that are created, such as changing access restrictions. The customizations can be applied to the entire group and/or to individual endpoints. In some embodiments, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can create exceptions for super-users to allow access to certain cloud data centers that other end points in similar groups may not be able to access.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0174">In some embodiments, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can allow for a search on the collected information generated by the agents installed at various endpoints within the elastic network (for example, analyzing for a specific indicator of compromise (IOC)). In some embodiments, the collected endpoint data can be parsed and indexed in a database. In some embodiments, in response to a receiving a request to search the endpoint data, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can perform a search on the indexed database and transmit matches to keywords, threshold levels, and/or indicators of compromise in the search inquiry. In some embodiments, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system provides an indicator of comprise (IOC) search on all endpoints within the elastic network and/or on network activities occurring within the elastic network. The collected information generated by the agents installed at various endpoints can provide a rich database for threat hunting and data mining for identifying network activity that could be indicative of malware or other harmful software operating on an endpoint within the elastic network. In an embodiment, the system comprises filters and/or other mechanisms for identifying network behavior suggestive of a malware attack, and in some embodiments, the system can be configured to respond to such malware attacks by taking containment actions and/or restricting network access for particular affected endpoints in order to protect the rest of the elastic network.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0175">The endpoint modeling and grouping management system can adjust the granularity threshold for identifying groups. If the granularity threshold is set high, there may be too many endpoints in a group. In some embodiments, having too many endpoints in a group may make it challenging to assign network access path privileges. In some embodiments, the granularity of the threshold can be adjusted for logical grouping and/or modeling. In some embodiments, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can determine groups such as logical groups based on the updated threshold and deploy updated model data to the agents. In some embodiments, the endpoints can identify baseline behavior for the associated groups such as logical groups based on the updated model data. For example, in response to changing the granularity threshold for the groups such as logical groups, some endpoints can remain in group 1 but some endpoints can be regrouped into group 3, and some endpoints can remain in group 2. The endpoint modeling and grouping management system can update the models for the new logical groupings that can be used to determine new baseline behaviors for each of the new logical groupings. These models can be deployed to the agents, such that the agents can identify abnormal behavior for the updated baseline behavior associated with the new logical groupings. In some embodiments, the agents can set access policies to regulate inbound and outbound data to and from the endpoints. These access policies can be determined based on the models updated for each new group such as logical group.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0176">In some embodiments, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can assess violations of a group. In some embodiments, a violation can comprise when an endpoint attempts to access a network path that is restricted based on the privileges assigned to endpoint, and/or the group that the endpoint is a part of, by the endpoint modeling and grouping management system. The endpoint modeling and grouping management system can assess violations to dynamically and/or automatically change the granularity threshold for the groupings, in other words, change the group in which the endpoint is a part of. In some embodiments, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can assess violations to dynamically and/or automatically change the network access path privileges assigned to the endpoint and/or the group in which the endpoint is a part of. In some embodiments, violations can be the identification of an incorrect access restriction. Users can indicate an incorrect access restriction to the endpoint modeling and grouping management system. In some embodiments, based on a number and/or percentage of violations, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can increase and/or decrease the granularity threshold. In some embodiments, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system can adjust the granularity threshold based on a number of groups.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0177">In some embodiments, the endpoint modeling and grouping management system comprises an antivirus system that is configured to search for known viruses and can be combined with a system configured to restrict network access control for endpoints.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0178"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a graphical user interface of a group view according to some embodiments.
