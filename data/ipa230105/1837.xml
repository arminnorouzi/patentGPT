Description of Related Art Including Information Disclosed Under 37 CFR 1.97 and 37 CFR 1.98</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The invention relates to the field of vehicles for transporting objects, more particularly the field of the manufacture of systems which are designed to prevent the objects transported by such a vehicle for transporting objects from being stolen.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In this regard, it will be observed that such a vehicle for transporting objects is configured to transport objects which may have value, and which may consist of goods, equipment or tools, especially portable power tools.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">These vehicles for transporting objects usually comprise rolling means, a chassis which is mounted on these rolling means, and a cabin which is mounted on this chassis and which accommodates people, in particular a driver, or even passengers. Such a vehicle for transporting objects further comprises at least one body which is mounted on the chassis, is intended to contain said objects, and comprises at least one opening. Such a vehicle for transporting objects also comprises at least one door, each of which closes such an opening of the body, and which, depending on the circumstances, prohibits or permits access to the objects contained in the body.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Such a vehicle for transporting objects also comprises a system for preventing an unauthorized third party from opening such a door and entering inside the body to steal such objects. Such a system usually comprises locking means (in particular in the form of a strike plate and bolt assembly) which are configured to lock such a door with respect to another door or with respect to the body, in the position in which an opening of the body is closed by such a door. This system also comprises control means which are configured to control these locking means, with a view to making them adopt a locking position (in which the door is held in a closed position and thus prohibits access to the body and to the objects contained therein) or an unlocking position (allowing the door to be opened and permitting access to the body and to the objects contained therein). These control means can take the form of a lock and a key.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">It will be observed that these vehicles for transporting objects attract the greed of ill-intentioned individuals who are tempted to seize the objects contained in the body of such a vehicle. To do this, these individuals usually tamper with the control means, more particularly with the lock of these control means.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In this regard, it will be observed that these control means have a relatively limited tamper resistance such that they do not resist a tamper attempt for long, before giving way and giving free access to the objects contained in the body.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention is intended to remedy the disadvantages of vehicles for transporting objects and, in particular, the means for controlling the locking means which are provided in such vehicles.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">To this end, the invention relates to a vehicle for transporting objects, this vehicle comprising a body which is intended to contain these objects and comprises at least one opening, and comprising at least one door, each of which closes such an opening, and which, depending on the circumstances, prohibits or permits entry inside the body. This vehicle for transporting objects is characterized in that it comprises a winch which is located inside the body and comprises a hook, a cable having a free end that is provided with this hook, a drum for winding the cable, and a motor for driving this drum, said vehicle also comprising securing means for fixedly securing the winch to the body, at least one attaching means which said at least one door comprises, while the hook of the winch engages directly or indirectly with said at least one attaching means, and remote control means for the motor of the winch.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Another feature relates to the fact that the vehicle comprises at least one door, in particular a rear door, which comprises said at least one attaching means while the hook of the winch engages directly with said at least one attaching means by hooking thereon.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Yet another feature relates to the fact that the vehicle comprises two doors, in particular a rear door and a side door, which each comprise at least one attaching means, and at least one connecting means for connecting the hook of the winch at least to said at least one attaching means.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Thus, the vehicle for transporting objects according to the invention comprises a winch which is fixedly secured to the body, means for attaching the hook of this winch (directly or indirectly) on a door of this vehicle, and remote control means for the motor of this winch.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">These features make it possible for the hook of this winch to engage (directly or indirectly) with the attaching means that the door of such a vehicle comprises, in order to close this door, to actuate the remote control means for the motor of the winch until the cable of this winch is under tension, and to keep this cable under tension. This advantageously makes it possible, after the door of such a vehicle has been closed and despite deterioration of the means for controlling the locking means of the door, to keep and hold this door in its closed position, and thus to prevent this door from being opened and, therefore, to prohibit access inside the body of the vehicle and, consequently, to prevent the objects contained in this body from being stolen.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description which relates to embodiments which are given only by way of indicative and non-limiting examples.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The understanding of this description will be facilitated by referring to the appended drawings.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The FIGURE is a schematic, side and cutaway view of a transport vehicle according to the invention.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0011" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The present invention relates to the field of the manufacture of vehicles for transporting objects, more particularly the field of the manufacture of systems which are designed to prevent the objects transported by such a transport vehicle from being stolen.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Such a vehicle <b>1</b> for transporting objects comprises rolling means <b>2</b>, a chassis <b>3</b> which is mounted on these rolling means <b>2</b>, and a cabin <b>4</b> which is mounted on this chassis <b>3</b> and which accommodates people, in particular a driver, or even passengers.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Such a vehicle <b>1</b> for transporting objects further comprises at least one body <b>5</b> which is mounted on the chassis <b>3</b>, is positioned at the rear of the cabin <b>4</b>, and is intended to contain said objects.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Such a body <b>5</b> comprises at least one opening <b>50</b> which allows entry inside this body <b>5</b>, for depositing or retrieving objects therein.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Such a vehicle <b>1</b> for transporting objects also comprises at least one door <b>6</b>, each of which closes such an opening <b>50</b> of the body <b>5</b>, and which, depending on the circumstances, prohibits or permits access to the objects contained in this body <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Such a door <b>6</b> usually comprises a system <b>60</b> for preventing an unauthorized third party from opening such a door <b>6</b> and entering inside the body <b>5</b> to steal such objects.
