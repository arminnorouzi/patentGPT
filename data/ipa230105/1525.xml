The tools can be picked up out of the magazine by means of the tool spindle and can be used for machining. The workpieces are provided with a respective interface or adapter, such that the workpiece can be held in the tool spindle that is in fact provided for holding the tool. In doing so, the workpiece can be rotationally driven by means of the tool spindle, for example, and can be machined by means of an immovable tool.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A similar principle is also described in EP 0 215 209 A2. There, the adapter by means of which a workpiece can be picked up from the magazine by means of the tool spindle can be removed during clamping of the workpiece in a workpiece clamping device and can be disposed again. Then the workpiece can be machined.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">WO 2021/013899 A1 discloses a method for handling of workpieces that can be stored together with tools in a cocoon in a magazine. The cocoon consists of a support and a bottom. The workpiece is arranged on the bottom. The support can be held by means of the tool spindle and the cocoon can be arranged in the machine tool. By means of a relative movement between the support and the bottom of the cocoon, a releasable connection between the support and the bottom can be released and the cocoon can be opened thereby. The tool spindle can subsequently dispose the support, take out the tool and machine the workpiece arranged on the bottom.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Starting from the known prior art it is an object of the present invention to provide a clamping device and a method in order to simplify handling of a workpiece and particularly clamping and releasing the workpiece in the machine tool.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">This object is solved by a clamping device for clamping a workpiece holder on a machine tool, including: a basis having a support surface for arranging of the workpiece holder, an operating device arranged on the basis that comprises an operating element that can be moved between a first position and a second position along a path around a height axis, wherein the clamping device is in a release condition releasing the workpiece holder, if the operating element is in the first position, wherein the clamping device is in a clamping condition clamping the workpiece holder, if the operating element is in the second position.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">This object is also solved a method for handling a workpiece in a machine tool, wherein the machine tool includes storing locations for workpieces and tools and further includes a tool spindle that is movable in multiple degrees of freedom, wherein the method includes the following steps: attaching a clamping device for clamping a workpiece holder on the machine tool, providing at least one tool and at least one workpiece unit including a workpiece holder with a workpiece and a spindle adapter connected with the workpiece holder, picking up the workpiece holder by means of the spindle adapter by the tool spindle, transporting the workpiece holder to the clamping device and placing the workpiece holder on the clamping device, operating an operating element of the clamping device by means of a movement of the tool spindle in order to bring the clamping device into a clamping condition, releasing a connection between the spindle adapter and the tool spindle, picking up a tool and carrying out actions on the workpiece by means of the tool arranged in the tool spindle.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The clamping device according to the invention is configured for clamping a workpiece holder on a machine tool. The clamping device has a basis having a support surface. The support surface is configured such that the workpiece holder can be arranged thereon and can be held there. In doing so, it is particularly pulled with a tensile force against the support surface. Preferably the support surface is planar.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The basis can have multiple holes for receiving a holding bolt arranged on the workpiece holder. The holding bolts engage a hole on the basis in each case during arrangement of the workpiece holder on the clamping device.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The clamping device has an operating device with an operating element. The operating element is movable, e.g. rotatable or pivotable, along a path around a height axis. The path comprises a first position and a second position and can, for example, extend between these positions. For example, the path can be a circular path or a circular arc path around the height axis. The height axis preferably intersects the support surface and can be a center axis of the basis. The height axis can intersect the geometric center of the support surface.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The clamping device is in a release condition releasing the workpiece holder, if the operating element is in the first position. If the operating element is, however, in the second position, the clamping device is in a clamping condition holding the workpiece holder on the support surface.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Particularly the operating device can comprise clamping bodies that are movably coupled with the operating element, wherein one clamping body is assigned to each hole. In the release condition the clamping bodies are in a position in which the insertion and removal of a holding bolt into a hole or out of a hole on the basis is possible. In the clamping condition of the clamping device each holding bolt is engaged by an assigned clamping body and is retained inside the hole or is pulled into the hole, such that a workpiece holder is held on the basis or on the support surface.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In that the operating element can be moved along a path around the height axis between the first position and the second position, the operating element can be operated simply by means of a movement of a tool spindle of the machine tool. For example, the tool spindle can initiate a rotation movement around the spindle axis in order to move the operating element from the first position into the second position or vice versa from the second position into the first position. Preferably an appropriate device is held by the tool spindle for this purpose, e.g. a spindle adapter or another operating tool, by means of which a movement along the path around the height axis can be carried out. For operation of the operating element it is advantageous, if the height axis of the basis or the clamping device and the spindle axis of the tool spindle coincide during the movement of the operating element along the path.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Such a clamping device can be particularly used for automatic clamping or releasing of workpieces in a machine tool. The clamping device can be arranged in an anyhow present machine clamping device of the machine tool for this purpose and can be held there. The machine clamping device does not have to be able to be clamped and released in an automatic or controlled manner for this purpose. The clamping and releasing of the workpiece holder is carried out by means of the clamping device according to the invention, in that the operating element is moved by means of an operating movement of the tool spindle in the first position or the second position. During the machining of workpieces and during workpiece exchange the clamping device can be continuously clamped in the machine clamping device of the machine tool.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a preferred embodiment the operating device comprises at least one slider that abuts directly or indirectly against the operating element. The at least one slider is movably supported along a first extension direction. It can be moved into different positions by means of a movement of the operating element. The at least one slider is movably coupled with multiple or all of the clamping bodies. Each clamping body is at least movably coupled with one of the sliders.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">For transmission of the movement of the operating element along the path in a linear movement of the slider, at least one cam follower arrangement with respectively one cam surface can be used, wherein the cam surface comprises a non-concentric, but eccentric extension relative to the height axis of the clamping device. For example, the at least one cam surface can extend around the height axis along at least a section of a spiral winding or along a complete spiral winding. The cam surface extends particularly at most along one complete spiral winding. With view around the height axis different sites on the at least one cam surface have different distances to the height axis. The progress of the cam surface is curved, wherein the curvature varies. The cam surface can face the height axis or can face away from the height axis.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In an embodiment the at least one cam surface is provided on the operating element. The at least one slider can abut against the respectively assigned cam surface. Thereby the cam surface is facing the slider and the height axis. In another embodiment the at least one cam surface can face away from the height axis and can be provided on the at least one slider, wherein the operating element abuts against the at least one cam surface. In this embodiment the number of cam surfaces corresponds to the number of provided sliders.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In order to minimize the torque necessary for rotation of the operating element around the height axis or the force necessary for the movement of the operating element along the path, the friction during movement of the operating element or the at least one slider along the cam surface can be reduced. In an embodiment a roller bearing contact between the operating element or the at least one slider and the respectively assigned cam surface can be realized for this purpose. For example, at least one roller body can abut in a rollable manner against each provided cam surface. The roller body can be supported rotatably on the operating element or on the slider depending on the embodiment.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The at least one slider is particularly movably coupled with the clamping bodies of the operating device. For this purpose an arbitrary form of a mechanical transmission can be used. In an embodiment the movement coupling is achieved by means of a wedge surface arrangement or a wedge surface transmission. For a movement coupling also other transmission means or elements can be used, such as toothed wheels, toothed racks, etc.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The operating device can comprise at least one balancing unit. The at least one balancing unit can be arranged anywhere in the force transmission path between the operating element and each of the clamping bodies. If multiple separate force transmission paths are provided, each force transmission path comprises at least one balancing unit. The at least one balancing unit is configured to limit the clamping force that can be transmitted from the clamping bodies to the holding bolts. In doing so, a uniform clamping can be achieved and possible asymmetric force transmissions on the clamping bodies, due to tolerances during manufacturing of components and the assembly can be compensated at least in part.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In an embodiment each balancing unit comprises at least one elastically deformable body, e.g. a helical spring and/or a cup spring and/or a plastic body, etc. For example, each provided slider of the operating device can comprise a balancing unit or at least one elastically deformable body. In an embodiment the slider is separated in two parts and the balancing unit is arranged between the two slider parts that are supported in a manner to be movable relative to one another. The at least one balancing unit or the at least one elastically deformable body is configured to deform elastically, if the force in the respective force transmission path increases or increases considerably. For example, two separate slider parts can move relative to one another due to the elastic deformation of the balancing unit or the at least one elastical body, such that a further clamping force increase transmitted via the clamping bodies is at least reduced.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In a preferred embodiment the operating element is formed by an operating ring that can be arranged coaxially to the height axis. The operating ring can surround the support surface. Alternatively to the operating ring, the operating element could also be a ring segment or another arc-shaped element that extends around the height axis in an angular range less than 360&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">A spindle adapter can be used for transport of the workpiece holder with the workpiece. The spindle adapter is configured to be held in the tool spindle of the machine tool and can comprise a spindle interface for this purpose, e.g. a taper such as a Morse taper, steep taper or hollow shank taper. Particularly, the spindle adapter is configured to be releasably connected with the workpiece holder. A workpiece unit comprises the spindle adapter, the workpiece holder and the workpiece arranged thereon and therefore can be transported by means of the tool spindle, particularly from a storing location to the clamping device or vice versa. Thus, not only the clamping of the workpiece holder, but also its transport is simply possible by movement control of the tool spindle.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">It is advantageous, if the operating element comprises a coupling device that is configured to be releasably connected with a counter coupling device of the spindle adapter. The releasable connection is particularly form-fit and preferably torque-proof in movement direction of the operating element, such that a rotation movement of the spindle adapter results in a movement of the operating element along the path between the first position and the second position.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Preferably the connection between the coupling device and the counter coupling device is established or disconnected by means of a movement parallel to the height axis.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As an example, the coupling device can comprise at least one projection extending in direction of the height axis that engages into a recess of the counter coupling device, if the connection is established. In a direction around the spindle axis the recess of the counter coupling device or spindle adapter can have a dimension that corresponds to the dimension of the projection or can be larger in order to allow a rotation movement of the spindle adapter around the spindle axis during which a movement of the operating element is not yet carried out. In addition or as an alternative, the counter coupling device can also have a projection that engages into a recess on the coupling device, if the connection is established. This releasable connection can be simply established or disconnected by means of a movement of the tool spindle or the spindle adapter parallel to the height axis.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">It is advantageous, if the spindle axis of the tool spindle coincides with the height axis of the clamping device, if the connection between the coupling device and the counter coupling device is established.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The invention also refers to a method for handling of a workpiece. The method is particularly suitable for machine tools that do not have complex grippers or manipulators for automatic tool change and/or automatic workpiece change. The inventive method allows the tool handling and the workpiece handling by means of the tool spindle of the machine tool.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The tool spindle is movable in multiple degrees of freedom relative to the clamping device, e.g. in two or three linear degrees of freedom. Additionally or alternatively, the tool spindle can also be movable in one or more rotational degrees of freedom relative to the clamping device. The tool spindle can in addition comprise a spindle holder that can be rotated around the spindle axis.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The machine tool has storing locations for workpieces and tools, e.g. a magazine unit for workpieces and tools. The magazine unit can consist of one single common magazine or multiple separate magazines. The storing locations of the magazine unit can be movable relative to a machine basis of the machine tool. In addition or as an alternative to this, at least one storing location for a tool or a workpiece can be immovably relative to the machine basis of the machine tool. The magazine unit can comprise one or more chain magazines and/or turret magazines and/or other magazines. The magazine unit can have multiple movable magazine locations and can particularly be configured to bring one or more of the provided magazine locations in an exchange position in that the respective magazine location or magazine locations can be reached by the tool spindle of the machine tool. For example, a tool or workpiece that is stored there can be directly picked up from the magazine unit by the tool spindle without interposition of grippers and/or manipulators.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In at least one of the storing locations a workpiece to be machined can be stored. Each workpiece to be machined is held on a workpiece holder. The workpiece holder comprises a spindle adapter. The spindle adapter can be releasably or non-releasably connected with the workpiece holder. The spindle adapter has an interface by means of which the spindle adapter can be directly picked up by the tool spindle of the machine tool. It is the same interface that is also provided on the tools in order to hold the tools in the tool spindle. For example, the interface can be a taper, e.g. a Morse taper, steep taper or hollow shank taper.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In at least one of the storing locations a tool is provided in addition that comprises the interface for being held in the tool spindle.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the machine tool and particularly on a machine clamping device of the machine tool, a clamping device is arranged. The clamping device is configured to clamp the workpiece holder with a workpiece in the machine tool. The clamping device has an operating element in order to bring the clamping device in a clamping condition. Particularly, the clamping device can be brought again into a release condition by means of the operating element. In an embodiment the operating element can be rotatable around a rotation axis. Preferably the operating element is pivoted by a rotation of pivot angle that is less than 360&#xb0; and further preferably at most 180&#xb0; or at most 90&#xb0; in order to bring the clamping device from the release condition in the clamping condition or vice versa.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The clamping device that is used in the method can correspond to one or more embodiments described above. For example, the rotation axis can be the height axis of the clamping device according to the invention. In the method according to the invention, however, also other modified embodiments of the clamping device can be used.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The tool spindle picks up a workpiece holder with a workpiece to be machined by means of the spindle adapter from one of the storing locations and transports the workpiece holder to the clamping device. The clamping device is placed on the support surface. Subsequently, during or after releasing the connection between the spindle adapter and the workpiece holder, the operating element is moved from the first position into the second position such that the clamping device is switched from the release condition into the clamping condition. The workpiece holder is now clamped or held on the clamping device. The actuation of the operating element is thereby carried out particularly by means of the spindle adapter held in the tool spindle and preferably by means of a rotation movement of the spindle adapter around the spindle axis.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Subsequently, the connection between the spindle adapter and the tool spindle can be released. For example, the spindle adapter can be put down in an empty storing location, preferably in a magazine unit. Subsequently, the tool spindle can pick up a tool and actions can be carried out on the workpiece that is held in the clamping device by means of the workpiece holder, e.g. a chip removing processing by means of a processing tool or at least one dimension of the workpiece can be measured by means of a measurement tool.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In embodiments of a clamping device in which an actuation of the operating element is not possible as long as the tool spindle holds the spindle adapter, first the connection between the spindle adapter and the tool spindle can be released after arrangement of the workpiece holder on the clamping device. Subsequently, an appropriate operating movement of the tool spindle can move the operating element from the first position into the second position and thus switch the clamping device into the clamping condition. For example, the spindle adapter can be put down in an empty storing location and there the connection to the tool spindle can be released prior to switching the clamping device in the clamping condition. Subsequently, the tool spindle can move the operating element.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In case a processing tool is used, the workpiece can be machined, e.g. in a chip-removing manner. The processing tool can be rotatably driven around the spindle axis, for example. Thus, the workpiece can be machined by drilling and/or milling and/or grinding or in any other manner by means of the tool. Additionally or alternatively, also a measurement tool can be arranged in one of the storing locations by means of which the processed workpiece can be measured in one or multiple dimensions. For example, the measurement tool can be a tactile or contactless operating probe.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In general arbitrarily configured tools can be picked up and used for carrying out actions on the workpiece. Thereby also a tool change can be carried out and multiple tools can be subsequently used for carrying out actions on the workpiece.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Therefore, all operations can be carried out by means of the tool spindle. Additional devices for transport of tools or workpieces between the tool spindle and the storing locations (e.g. in the magazine unit) or for operating the clamping device are not necessary. The clamping and releasing of the workpiece holder can be carried out by means of operation of the clamping device by means of the tool spindle according to the invention. The machine tool does not require controllable machine clamping devices for this purpose, but can be switched between the clamping condition by means of an electric motor or pneumatically or hydraulically. According to the invention, automatic machining processes with automatic tool change and automatic workpiece change can be exclusively carried out by means of the tool spindle of the machine tool according to the invention. For example, the method is suitable for the automatic processing of similar workpieces in the context of a small batch.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">It is advantageous, if the connection between the spindle adapter and the workpiece holder is releasable, e.g. a releasable latch connection. In doing so, the possibility exists to release the connection between the spindle adapter and the workpiece holder and to put down the spindle adapter in the magazine unit. The accessibility to the workpiece can be improved by removing the spindle adapter. The release of the connection between the spindle adapter and the workpiece holder can be carried out by means of a relative movement between the spindle adapter and the workpiece holder, particularly by means of a rotational movement around the spindle axis.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">It is advantageous, if the movement of the operating element from a first position into a second position is carried out during or after the release of the connection between the spindle adapter and the workpiece holder by means of a relative movement that is preferably continued without interruption, in order to switch the clamping device from the release condition into the clamping condition. This movement can particularly be a continued rotational movement around the spindle axis. Thereby the spindle adapter preferably engages the operating element.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">It is preferred, if the tool is put down in one of the storing locations after having carried out the processes on the workpiece and subsequently the operating element of the clamping device is operated by means of the tool spindle in order to bring the clamping device into the release condition. Thereby particularly a rotation movement around the rotation axis of the operating element can be carried out. The operating direction, e.g. the sense of rotation, for switching the clamping device from the clamping condition into the release condition is opposite to the movement direction of the operating element in which the clamping device can be switched from the release condition into the clamping condition.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Particularly, the switching of the clamping device into the release condition by movement of the operating element from the second position into the first position can be carried out by means of a respective movement of the tool spindle, particularly by means of a rotation movement around the spindle axis. It is advantageous, if the spindle adapter is held in the tool spindle for this purpose and engages the operating element. In doing so, it is possible to establish the connection between the spindle adapter and the workpiece holder prior to or during the switching of the clamping device into the release condition, such that the workpiece holder with the processed workpiece can be removed from the clamping device and can be put down, for example, in one of the empty storing locations.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">For processed workpieces, also workpieces on which any action has been carried out in the machine tool, other storing locations can be provided then for tools or workpieces that have to be processed yet, for example. A magazine unit can have different magazine portions for this purpose, for example.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In an embodiment in which the operation of the operating element is not carried out by means of the spindle adapter, the tool spindle can pick up an operating tool prior to operating the operating element. For example, the operating tool can comprise a pin, particularly a cylindrical pin. By means of the operating tool the operating element can be operated or moved in a particularly simple manner, e.g. if the operating element is an operating lever.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In an embodiment the operating element can be an operating lever. The operating lever is preferably pivotably supported around a rotation axis. It is advantageous, if an eccentric body is movably coupled and particularly torque-proof connected with the operating lever. The eccentric body and the operating lever can form a common part and can be connected monolithically with each other. The eccentric body can have a cam surface against which a movably supported slider of the operating device can abut, analog to an embodiment of the clamping device according to the invention described above. During a pivot movement of the operating lever around the rotation axis the eccentric body carries out an eccentric movement that in turn effects a displacement of the slider.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In this embodiment multiple clamping bodies can be movably coupled with the slider that can be moved thereby between a clamping condition and a release condition. The movement coupling between the clamping bodies and the slider can be realized, for example, by means of a transmission, particularly by means of a wedged surface arrangement.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The clamping device can have a basis with a top side and a bottom side. The basis has a support surface on the top side into which preferably holes open out for locating of one holding bolt therein respectively. The holding bolts are arranged on a workpiece holder and project, for example, parallel to one another from a bottom side of the workpiece holder. During placing the workpiece holder on the clamping device the holding bolts engage into one assigned hole on the basis respectively. In doing so, a form-fit connection between the basis of the clamping device and the workpiece holder in circumferential direction around the spindle axis as well as orthogonal to the spindle axis is established that can be subject to play in the release condition of the clamping device. This allows a movement of the spindle adapter orthogonal to the spindle axis or in circumferential direction around the spindle axis in order to establish or release a releasable connection between the spindle adapter and the workpiece holder. The workpiece holder is thereby supported in the holes of the basis by means of the holding bolts.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The releasable connection between the spindle adapter and the workpiece holder can be a latch connection, for example.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">On its bottom side the basis can have multiple holding bolts, the shape and dimension of which correspond particularly to the holding bolts that can be provided on the workpiece holder. The machine clamping device can comprise holes that can be engaged by the holding bolts of the basis and in which the holding bolts can be held by clamping in a form-fit and/or force-fit manner.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Therefore, the same clamping principle or clamping system can be used between the clamping device and the machine clamping device on one hand and between the clamping device and the workpiece holder on the other hand.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">It is advantageous, if the clamping connection between the machine clamping device and the clamping device is maintained during the processing of one or more workpieces continuously.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the configuration of the clamping device according to the invention, the movement of the operating element is particularly carried out by means of a rotation movement of the spindle adapter by means of the tool spindle. In another embodiment of the clamping device that can be used in the method according to the invention, the tool spindle can be moved along at least one arbitrary path curve for operating the operating element. For example, the at least one path curve can extend in a plane that is orientated orthogonal to the height axis of the clamping device or to the rotation axis of the operating element. In an embodiment the tool spindle can be moved along a first path curve in order to bring the clamping device into the clamping condition and/or along a second path curve in order to bring the clamping device into the release condition. The first path curve and the second path curve can be different from one another.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The first path curve and/or the second path curve can have a curved progress at least in one section and/or a straight progress in at least one section. In an embodiment the first path curve and/or the second path curve can be a traverse from multiple straight sections. Such movements of the tool spindle along straight sections of a traverse can be realized very simply. In another embodiment the first path curve and/or the second path curve can be continuously curved, e.g. a circular arc.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In an embodiment the spindle adapter can comprise a hollow cylindrical outer wall that surrounds the workpiece holder or the workpiece held on the workpiece holder. However, also other arbitrary embodiments of the spindle adapter can be used, particularly in the context of the method according to the invention. In an embodiment the spindle adapter can be configured and constructed to engage the operating element. In other embodiments of the method according to the invention in which the operation of the operating element is not carried out by means of the spindle adapter, spindle adapters can be used that do not have to be configured for operation of the operating element.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In an embodiment the spindle adapter has two arms. A latch device is provided on each arm. Each latch device is engaged with a counter latch device of the workpiece holder, if the connection with the workpiece holder is established. The counter latch devices of the workpiece holder are arranged on the outside of the workpiece holder, e.g. in corner regions of the workpiece holder arranged diagonally opposite one another. If the latch connection is established, the counter latch devices or latch devices are preferably arranged opposite one another respectively relative to the spindle axis.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Advantageous embodiments of the invention are derived from the dependent claims, the description and the drawing.

The workpiece holder <b>12</b> is particularly a vice or spindle vice with two jaws <b>13</b> that can be moved toward or away from each other. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>5</b></figref> an embodiment of clamping device <b>10</b> according to the invention is shown in different illustrations.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In the embodiment clamping device <b>10</b> has a basis <b>14</b>. On the top side of basis <b>14</b> a support surface <b>15</b> for the workpiece holder <b>12</b> is provided. The support surface <b>15</b> has a circular contour in the embodiment.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Multiple holes <b>16</b> open out in support surface <b>15</b> and are thus open toward the top. The holes <b>16</b> are arranged with distance to one another in a predefined grid. Only by way of example, four holes <b>16</b> are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>5</b></figref>. The number of holes can also be higher than four.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Each hole <b>16</b> is configured for locating a holding bolt <b>17</b> of the workpiece holder <b>12</b> therein. As apparent from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the holding bolts <b>17</b> project from a bottom side of the workpiece holder <b>12</b> that is on the opposite side of jaws <b>13</b>. The holding bolts <b>17</b> extend parallel to one another. They are arranged with distance to one another that matches with the grid of holes <b>16</b>. In the embodiment the workpiece holder comprises four holding bolts <b>17</b>. When arranging the workpiece holder <b>12</b> on the support surface <b>15</b> each holding bolt <b>17</b> engages one of the holes <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">For example, the holding bolts are apparent from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>4</b>-<b>20</b></figref> and shown in basic illustrations in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>22</b> and <b>23</b></figref>. Each holding bolt <b>17</b> has two adjacent sections in the area of which the cross-section of the holding bolt <b>17</b> narrows, according to the example conically. In the embodiment the holding bolt <b>17</b> has two conical surfaces <b>18</b> for this purpose. The two conical surfaces <b>18</b> can adjoin directly to each other or can be connected via a section, particularly a cylindrical section, with one another alternatively, as apparent from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>22</b> and <b>23</b></figref>. In the area of the conical surfaces <b>18</b> the holding bolt <b>17</b> forms a ring groove <b>19</b> that has a triangular cross-section or&#x2014;as in the embodiment&#x2014;a trapezoidal-shaped cross-section. All of the holding bolts <b>17</b> are configured identically.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">On or in the basis <b>14</b> of clamping device <b>10</b> an operating device <b>23</b> is arranged that is shown in the cross-sectional illustrations of the clamping device <b>10</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>). The clamping device <b>10</b> can be switched between a release condition L (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>4</b> and <b>27</b>-<b>29</b></figref>) and a clamping condition S (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>, <b>5</b> and <b>30</b>-<b>32</b></figref>) by means of the operating device <b>23</b>. For operation the operating device <b>23</b> comprises an operating element <b>24</b> arranged on the basis <b>14</b> and accessible from outside. The operating element <b>24</b> is movable between a first position P<b>1</b> and a second position P<b>2</b> along a path around a height axis H of clamping device <b>10</b>. In the embodiments illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>5</b> and <b>27</b>-<b>32</b></figref> the path is a circular path or a circular arc-shaped path around the height axis H. Therefore, the path is arranged coaxially to height axis H. As apparent in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>5</b> and <b>27</b>-<b>33</b></figref>, the operating element <b>24</b> is realized as operating ring <b>25</b> in these embodiments that is arranged coaxially to the height axis H.

In the clamping condition S a clamping end <b>31</b><i>a </i>of the respective clamping body <b>31</b> projects into the hole <b>16</b> such that a holding bolt <b>17</b> arranged therein is applied with a clamping force. In the release condition L the clamping body <b>31</b> is retracted from the assigned hole <b>16</b>, such that its clamping end <b>31</b><i>a </i>allows the insertion and the removal of a holding bolt <b>17</b> into or out of hole <b>16</b> in an unimpeded manner.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The operating device <b>23</b> has in addition a coupling device <b>33</b> that is configured to establish a movement coupling between the operating element <b>24</b> and the clamping bodies <b>31</b>. The coupling device <b>33</b> can be realized in different ways. In the embodiments according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>5</b></figref> as well as <b>27</b>-<b>32</b>, the coupling device <b>33</b> comprises a cam follower arrangement having a cam surface <b>26</b> and according to the example, in addition at least one wedge surface pair <b>29</b> in order to establish the movement coupling between the operating element <b>24</b> and the clamping bodies <b>31</b>. Alternatively to this also other transmission arrangements for movement coupling could be used.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In the embodiments illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>5</b> and <b>27</b>-<b>32</b></figref> the coupling device <b>33</b> comprises at least one slider <b>28</b> that is slidably supported in the basis <b>14</b>. The at least one slider <b>28</b> is slidably supported orthogonal and particularly radially relative to the height axis H in the embodiment. Each slider <b>28</b> can be brought into direct or indirect contact with the operating element <b>24</b> at an abutment site <b>27</b>. The movement coupling between the operating element <b>24</b> and the at least one slider <b>28</b> is realized by means of a cam follower arrangement having a cam surface <b>26</b> that can be arranged either on the operating element <b>24</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>5</b></figref>) or alternatively on the at least one slider <b>28</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>27</b>-<b>32</b></figref>). The cam surface <b>26</b> arranged on the operating element <b>24</b> according to the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>5</b></figref> is arranged on the inner side facing toward the height axis H, wherein the cam surface <b>26</b> forms the ring inner surface of the operating ring <b>25</b> according to the example. In the embodiment according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>27</b>-<b>32</b></figref>, each slider <b>28</b> comprises a cam surface <b>26</b> that faces away from height axis H and faces the operating element <b>24</b> or the operating ring <b>25</b>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Cam surface <b>26</b> has an eccentric progress around height axis H such that it deviates from a circular shape or circular arc shape around the height axis H. Depending on where the abutment site <b>27</b> is located along the respective cam surface <b>26</b>, the slider <b>28</b> takes different positions relative to the height axis H, such that a movement of the operating element <b>24</b> can be transferred into a linear displacement of the at least one slider <b>28</b> in order to switch clamping device <b>10</b> between the release condition L and the clamping condition S.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>5</b></figref> at least the embodiment is explained in which the at least one cam surface <b>26</b> is arranged on the operating element <b>24</b> or the inner side of operating ring <b>25</b>. The cam surface <b>26</b> can extend along 360&#xb0; around height axis H. However, it is sufficient, if the cam surface <b>26</b> extends in an angular range a around height axis H that is less than 360&#xb0; and can be, for example, approximately 90&#xb0;. This angular range a is at least as large as the angle about which the operating element <b>24</b> can be rotated between the first position P<b>1</b> and the second position P<b>2</b> around height axis H.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In the embodiment the distance of cam surface <b>26</b> from height axis H varies along the extension of cam surface <b>26</b>.

The wedge surfaces of the wedge surface pair <b>29</b> extend obliquely to the movement direction of slider <b>28</b> respectively and obliquely to the movement direction of the wedge bodies <b>30</b>. In the embodiment the wedge bodies <b>30</b> are movably supported in a direction that is orthogonal to the movement direction of slider <b>28</b>. Wedge bodies <b>30</b> can move away from each other or toward each other. The end of slider <b>28</b> opposite the abutment site <b>27</b> projects into the interstice between the two wedge bodies <b>30</b> and can move them away from each other, if slide <b>28</b> is further moved into this interstice, wherein slider <b>28</b> allows movement of the two wedge bodies <b>30</b> toward each other during retraction out of the interstice.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Each wedge body <b>30</b> has an end opposite the slider <b>28</b> that in turn abuts against at least one&#x2014;according to the example two&#x2014;clamping bodies <b>31</b> of operating device <b>23</b>.

An important difference between these embodiments is that the operating device <b>23</b> according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>27</b>-<b>32</b></figref> comprises two separate sliders <b>28</b> that are arranged diametrically opposite to one another relative to height axis H and are movably supported toward each other and away from each other. Each slider <b>28</b> is movably coupled with at least one and according to the example, two clamping bodies <b>31</b>. At its back side facing the operating element <b>24</b> and according to the example, the operating ring <b>25</b>, each slider <b>28</b> comprises a cam surface <b>26</b> that extends eccentrically around height axis H. As apparent from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>28</b> and <b>29</b></figref>, a contact can be established between operating element <b>24</b> and sliders <b>28</b> in the release condition L, however, preferably a distance is present and a contact is only established, if the operating element <b>24</b> is moved out of its first position P<b>1</b> into direction of second position P<b>2</b>.

During movement of the operating element <b>24</b> each roller body <b>35</b> can roll on the assigned cam surface <b>26</b>. Due to a roller body support in this manner between operating element <b>24</b> and the at least one slider <b>28</b>, the torque or the force can be reduced that is necessary in order to move the operating element <b>24</b> between the first position P<b>1</b> and the second position P<b>2</b>. Such a roller body bearing can also be used in other embodiments of clamping device <b>10</b>, e.g. in the embodiment according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>5</b></figref>.

Rather the clamping bodies <b>31</b> are directly in contact with the end of the assigned slider <b>28</b> that is arranged opposite to the operating element <b>24</b>, wherein the direct contact between the clamping bodies <b>31</b> and the slider <b>28</b> is realized by means of a respective wedge surface pair <b>29</b>. Each slider <b>28</b> is in abutment with two clamping bodies <b>31</b> via a respective wedge surface pair <b>29</b> in a movable manner. The slider <b>28</b> can move the two clamping bodies <b>31</b> against the preloading force of preloading device <b>32</b> away from each other in order to bring the clamping device <b>10</b> in the clamping condition S. During a retraction movement of slider <b>28</b> out of the interstice between the two clamping bodies <b>31</b> they are moved toward each other due to the preloading force of preloading device <b>32</b>, whereby clamping device <b>10</b> can be brought into the release condition L.

If the clamping bodies <b>31</b> are in abutment with an assigned holding bolt <b>17</b> by means of their clamping ends <b>31</b><i>a</i>, the increase of the clamping force between the clamping bodies <b>31</b> and the holding bolts <b>17</b> can be limited based on the spring characteristic curve or the elasticity characteristic curve of the balancing unit <b>36</b>. In doing so, possible tolerances during manufacturing of the individual components or during assembly are at least partly compensated and the uniformity of clamping of holding bolts <b>17</b> is improved.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">It is in addition apparent from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref> that operating element <b>24</b> comprises a coupling device <b>37</b>.

In so far, reference can be made to the description above.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">In the embodiment of clamping device <b>10</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b> and <b>21</b></figref>, operating lever <b>57</b> is moved or pivoted around rotation axis D between first position P<b>1</b> and second position P<b>2</b> by means of a movement of tool spindle <b>45</b> along a path curve K<b>1</b>, K<b>2</b>. Thereby tool spindle <b>45</b> can directly engage operating lever <b>57</b> or can use an operating tool <b>59</b> having an operating pin <b>60</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b> and <b>18</b></figref> by way of example. Thereby operating pin <b>60</b> or tool spindle <b>45</b> is moved along a first path curve K<b>1</b> for switching the clamping device <b>10</b> from release condition L into the clamping condition S that is illustrated in dashed lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>. Thereby operating lever <b>57</b> is moved from the first position P<b>1</b> into the second position P<b>2</b>. In turn for moving operating lever <b>57</b> from the second position P<b>2</b> into the first position P<b>1</b> and thus for switching the clamping device <b>10</b> from clamping condition S into release condition L, operating pin <b>60</b> or tool spindle <b>45</b> is moved along a second path curve K<b>2</b> that is illustrated in dashed lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">The path curves K<b>1</b> and K<b>2</b> are different from each other. According to the example, they comprise a traverse in each case having adjoining straight sections. The locations at which straight sections adjoin one another and require a direction change of the movement direction so-to-speak are schematically marked by a point.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref> illustrates another embodiment of a spindle adapter <b>39</b>. Spindle adapter <b>39</b> has two arms <b>65</b> that are arranged on diametrically opposite sides relative to the longitudinal center axis M of spindle interface <b>51</b>. The arms <b>65</b> can extend parallel to each other and parallel to the longitudinal center axis M. The arms <b>65</b> have the same distance from the longitudinal center axis M and move during a rotation of the spindle adapter <b>39</b>, preferably on a common circular path around the longitudinal center axis M.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">The arms <b>65</b> are connected with spindle interface <b>51</b> of spindle adapter <b>39</b>, for example by means of a connection leg <b>66</b>. On each arm <b>65</b> and according to the example, on the free end of each arm <b>65</b>, spindle adapter <b>39</b> comprises a latch device <b>67</b> that is configured to establish a latch connection with a counter latch device <b>68</b> of workpiece holder <b>12</b>. The latch device <b>67</b> and the counter latch device <b>68</b> are schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>. A latch projection <b>69</b> projecting obliquely or orthogonal from arms <b>65</b> is part of latch device <b>67</b>. The latch projection <b>69</b> extends approximately tangentially or in circumferential direction around the longitudinal center axis M. On the latch projection <b>69</b> a latch body <b>70</b> is arranged. The latch body <b>70</b> can be preloaded into an initial position and can be moved against the preloading force into the latch projection <b>69</b>. The latch body <b>70</b> can be, e.g. a ball or a ball segment.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">The counter latch device <b>68</b> comprises depressions <b>71</b> on the workpiece holder <b>12</b> that are laterally open on the outward side. The depressions <b>71</b> are arranged diagonally opposite each other in corner areas of the approximately cuboid-shaped workpiece holder <b>12</b>. Within each depression <b>71</b> a latch recess <b>72</b> is arranged that is assigned to the latch body <b>70</b> and into which the latch body <b>70</b> can engage, if the latch projection <b>69</b> is moved into the depression <b>71</b> in order to establish the latch connection. During movement of latch projection <b>69</b> into the recess <b>71</b>, latch body <b>70</b> can be moved against the preloading force into the latch projection <b>69</b>. As soon as latch body <b>70</b> reaches the latch recess <b>72</b> it is urged into the latch recess <b>72</b> by means of the preloading force. In this condition the latch connection between the latch device <b>67</b> and the counter latch device <b>68</b> is established.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">The latch connection can be established and released by means of a relative rotation of spindle adapter <b>39</b> relative to the workpiece holder <b>12</b>, depending on the rotational sense of the relative rotation around the longitudinal center axis M. This relative rotational movement can be carried out by means of tool spindle <b>45</b>, if tool spindle <b>45</b> holds spindle adapter <b>39</b> in spindle holder <b>52</b>. If the latch connection is established, workpiece holder <b>12</b> can be transported together with workpiece <b>11</b> by means of the tool spindle <b>45</b> analog to the embodiment described above.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">It is also apparent from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref> that depression <b>71</b> can have a stop <b>73</b>, at least on one side with view in a direction tangential to the longitudinal center axis M or spindle axis A. If the latch connection is established, latch projection <b>69</b> abuts against stop <b>73</b>.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">By way of example, modifications for the configuration of the latch device <b>67</b> and the counter latch device <b>68</b> are highly schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>25</b> and <b>26</b></figref>. The latch body <b>70</b> is in this embodiment immovably arranged on latch projection <b>69</b>, e.g. on an end of latch projection <b>69</b> opposite the arms <b>65</b>. Analog to the embodiment according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>, latch body <b>70</b> can project upwardly.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">On the bottom side opposite latch body <b>70</b>, the latch projection <b>69</b> comprises a locking arrangement <b>77</b>. The locking arrangement <b>77</b> comprises a support body <b>78</b> that is supported by means of a spring arrangement <b>79</b> in a recess <b>80</b> on the latch projection <b>69</b>. The recess <b>80</b> is open downwardly. The support body <b>78</b> can be moved against the spring force of spring arrangement <b>79</b> into the recess <b>80</b> and is urged by means of the spring force of spring arrangement <b>79</b> out of recess <b>80</b>. The spring force of spring arrangement <b>79</b> acts in direction away from latch body <b>70</b>.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">During insertion of latch projection <b>69</b> into depression <b>71</b> of workpiece holder <b>12</b>, support body <b>78</b> is moved into recess <b>80</b> against the spring force of spring arrangement <b>79</b>. As soon as latch body <b>70</b> reaches latch recess <b>72</b>, latch projection <b>69</b> can be moved into the latch recess <b>72</b>. This movement can be carried out by means of tool spindle <b>45</b>. Due to the spring force of spring arrangement <b>79</b>, support body <b>78</b> is partly or entirely urged out of recess <b>80</b> and takes the locking position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref>. In this locking position the spring force of spring arrangement <b>79</b> supports support body <b>78</b> against workpiece holder <b>12</b> and urges latch body <b>70</b> into latch recess <b>72</b>.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">By means of this configuration it is guaranteed that the latch connection is maintained by means of the spring force of spring arrangement <b>79</b> as long as no outer force acts on spindle adapter <b>39</b> parallel to the longitudinal center axis M. Rotational movements or rotational accelerations of spindle adapter <b>39</b> cannot result in an unintentional disconnection of the latch connection.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">In circumferential direction around the longitudinal center axis M or tangentially thereto, latch body <b>70</b> is preferably abutting against the walls of latch recess <b>72</b>. In order to avoid unintentional releasing the latch connection, it is advantageous if latch body <b>70</b> and latch recess <b>72</b> have side surfaces assigned to each other that are substantially parallel to the longitudinal center axis M.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">The self-locking function described above for avoiding an unintentional disconnection of the latch connection can alternatively also be achieved by other configurations, e.g. if the support body <b>78</b> is not arranged on the latch projection <b>69</b>, but on the depression <b>71</b>.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">In another modification the spring arrangement <b>79</b> and/or the support body <b>78</b> can also be replaced by an elastically deformable support body, e.g. by a leaf spring arranged in the recess <b>80</b>.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">The clamping device <b>10</b> according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> and spindle adapter <b>39</b> according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref> can be used for carrying out the method according to the invention, which is explained in the following based on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b>-<b>19</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">In the initial position according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, the clamping device <b>10</b> is in the release condition L and the operating lever <b>57</b> is in the first position P<b>1</b>. As in the first embodiment of the method, the tool spindle <b>45</b> can pick up the spindle adapter <b>39</b> with the workpiece holder <b>12</b> and the workpiece <b>11</b> arranged thereon from a storing location <b>49</b> and can arrange it on the clamping device <b>10</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>). Now a releasable connection between spindle adapter <b>39</b> and workpiece holder <b>12</b> is disconnected by means of a relative rotation that is carried out by means of the tool spindle <b>45</b>. According to the example, thereby the described latch connection is disconnected and the spindle adapter <b>39</b> can be put down at a storing location (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">After putting down the spindle adapter <b>39</b>, the tool spindle <b>45</b> picks up the operating tool <b>59</b> and brings operating pin <b>60</b> of operating tool <b>59</b> in contact with operating lever <b>57</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>). Due to a movement along the first path curve K<b>1</b>, operating lever <b>57</b> is pivoted out of the first position P<b>1</b> into the second position P<b>2</b> and thus clamping device <b>10</b> is switched into clamping condition S.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">As described in the context of the first embodiment of the method, subsequently a tool <b>50</b> can be picked up and the workpiece <b>11</b> can be machined. After termination of the machining the operating tool <b>59</b> can be picked up again and can be brought into contact with the operating lever <b>57</b>. By means of a subsequent movement of operating tool <b>59</b> along the second path curve K<b>2</b>, operating lever <b>57</b> is moved out of the second position P<b>2</b> again into the first position P<b>1</b> and the clamping device <b>10</b> is thereby brought into the release condition L (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">Subsequently, tool spindle <b>45</b> can put down operating tool <b>59</b> and can pick up spindle adapter <b>39</b>. The machine workpiece <b>11</b> can be picked up by establishment of the releasable connection between spindle adapter <b>39</b> and workpiece holder <b>12</b> and can be put down on an empty storing location <b>49</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>). This method can be repeated for an arbitrary number of workpieces.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">The invention refers to a clamping device <b>10</b> and a method for handling a workpiece <b>11</b> or a unit comprising a workpiece <b>11</b> and a workpiece holder <b>12</b>.
