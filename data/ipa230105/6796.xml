A DCI format (format) 1_0 and a DCI format 1_1 may be used to schedule data, for example, indicate a frequency domain resource of a data channel by using DCI. A data channel is, for example, a physical downlink shared channel (physical downlink shared channel, PDSCH).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Currently, a length of a frequency domain resource assignment field in the DCI format 1_0 can be associated only with a control-resource set (control-resource set, CORESET) 0 or an initial bandwidth part (bandwidth part, BWP). Therefore, a frequency domain resource that can be indicated is limited. Therefore, currently, flexibility of indicating a frequency domain resource for multicast transmission needs to be improved.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">This application provides a communication method and apparatus, to improve flexibility of indicating a frequency domain resource for multicast transmission.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to a first aspect, this application provides a communication method. The method may be performed by a terminal device or a chip in the terminal device.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to the method, the terminal device obtains a first frequency domain resource and a second frequency domain resource. The terminal device receives first information, where the first information is scrambled by using a group-radio network temporary identifier (group-radio network temporary identifier, G-RNTI). The first information indicates a frequency domain resource of a data channel within a range of the first frequency domain resource, the first frequency domain resource and the second frequency domain resource are independently configured, and the second frequency domain resource includes a control-resource set (control-resource set, CORESET) 0 and an initial bandwidth part (bandwidth part, BWP).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to the foregoing method, a multicast or broadcast data channel may be scheduled by using the first information. The first frequency domain resource that is associated with the first information is no longer associated with the CORESET 0 and/or the initial BWP that are/is configured by a network device. In other words, a size of the first frequency domain resource is not limited to the CORESET 0 or the initial BWP, and the first frequency domain resource may be flexibly configured. Herein, that a size of the first frequency domain resource is not limited to the CORESET 0 or the initial BWP may alternatively mean that the first frequency domain resource may be configured without reference to the CORESET 0 and/or the initial BWP. Therefore, flexibility of indicating a frequency domain resource for multicast transmission is improved.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a possible example, the first information does not include an information field of at least one piece of information of a new data indicator, a redundancy version, a hybrid automatic repeat request (hybrid automatic repeat request, HARQ) process number, a downlink assignment index, a physical uplink control channel (physical uplink control channel, PUCCH) transmission power control command, a PUCCH resource indicator, or a PDSCH-to-HARQ feedback timing indicator. In addition, the first information may not include DCI format identifier information, in other words, the first information does not include an identifier for DCI formats information field, where the DCI format identifier information indicates an uplink DCI format or a downlink DCI format. The information field of the new data indicator may also be referred to as a new data indicator information field in this application, and information fields of other information are similar. Therefore, in the first information, a bitwidth in the foregoing information field may be used as a bitwidth in another information field, for example, indicates a frequency domain resource of a downlink data channel or indicates other information, to further improve scheduling flexibility.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">For example, the terminal device may further receive second information, where the second information is in a DCI format 1_0, and the second information is scrambled by using a cell-radio network temporary identifier (cell-radio network temporary identifier, C-RNTI). For example, the second information may include an identifier for DCI formats, frequency domain resource assignment, time domain resource assignment, a virtual resource block (virtual resource block, VRB)-to-physical resource block (physical resource block, PRB) mapping (VRB-to-PRB mapping), a modulation and coding scheme, the new data indicator, the redundancy version, the HARQ process number, the downlink assignment index, the PUCCH transmission power control command, the PUCCH resource indicator, and the PDSCH-to-HARQ feedback timing indicator.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">For example, a payload of the first information is the same as a payload of the second information; and/or a DCI format of the first information is the same as a DCI format of the second information.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In addition, a bitwidth that is in the first information and that corresponds to a first information field indicates the frequency domain resource of the downlink data channel in the first information, where the first information field is an information field in the second information. In this way, scheduling flexibility is further improved. For example, if the first information field occupies an n<sub>th </sub>bitwidth in the second information, an n<sub>th </sub>bitwidth indicates the frequency domain resource in the first information field, and n is a positive integer.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">For example, the first information field may be an information field of at least one piece of information of the identifier for DCI formats, the new data indicator, the redundancy version, the HARQ process number, the downlink assignment index, the PUCCH transmission power control command, the PUCCH resource indicator, or the PDSCH-to-HARQ feedback timing indicator.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">If the first information field is an information field of at least one piece of information of the new data indicator, the redundancy version, the HARQ process number, the downlink assignment index, the PUCCH transmission power control command, the PUCCH resource indicator, or the PDSCH-to-HARQ feedback timing indicator, the terminal device further receives third information from the network device. The third information indicates that the terminal device does not support an uplink HARQ feedback.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">A size of a frequency domain resource information field in the first information may be associated with the first frequency domain resource. In other words, the size of the frequency domain resource information field in the first information is determined based on the first frequency domain resource.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to a second aspect, this application provides a communication method.

The first information includes frequency domain resource assignment information, where the frequency domain resource assignment information indicates a frequency domain resource of the downlink data channel within a range of the first frequency domain resource. The first information is scrambled by using a G-RNTI.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In a possible example, the first information does not include an information field of at least one piece of information of a new data indicator, a redundancy version, a HARQ process number, a downlink assignment index, a PUCCH transmission power control command, a PUCCH resource indicator, or a PDSCH-to-HARQ feedback timing indicator.

The second information is in a DCI format 1_0, and the second information is scrambled by using a C-RNTI.

A quantity of core network devices, a quantity of radio access network devices, and a quantity of terminal devices included in the mobile communication system are not limited in this embodiment of this application.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">It should be understood that the foregoing wireless communication system <b>100</b> is usable in both a low-frequency scenario (sub 6 GHz) and a high-frequency scenario (above 6 GHz). An application scenario of the wireless communication system <b>100</b> includes but is not limited to a long term evolution (long term evolution, LTE) system, a new radio (new radio, NR) system in a 5th generation (5th generation, 5G) mobile communication system, a future mobile communication system, and the like.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the network device <b>101</b> may be an access network device (or referred to as an access network site).

The terminal device may be specifically a mobile phone (mobile phone), a tablet computer (pad), a computer that has a wireless transceiver function, a virtual reality (virtual reality, VR) terminal, an augmented reality (augmented reality, AR) terminal, a wireless terminal in industrial control (industrial control), a wireless terminal in self driving (self driving), a wireless terminal in telemedicine (remote medical), a wireless terminal in a smart grid (smart grid), a wireless terminal in transportation safety (transportation safety), a wireless terminal in a smart city (smart city), a wireless terminal in a smart home (smart home), or the like.

The terminal device may perform the following operations in a serving cell (serving cell) by using a higher layer parameter: BWP-downlink (BWP-Downlink) or higher-layer parameter: An initial downlink BWP (initial downlink BWP) is configured with a maximum of four downlink BWPs. Usually, for one terminal device, only one BWP can be in an active state at a same moment, the activated BWP is referred to as an active BWP (active BWP), and the terminal device can send and receive information only in the active BWP.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Specifically, downlink BWP types include an initial BWP (initial BWP), a dedicated BWP (dedicated BWP), and a default BWP (default BWP). The initial BWP is a BWP configured by the terminal device in an initial access phase, and the initial BWP is configured by using system information. Therefore, for terminal devices in a same cell, initial BWPs are the same. The initial downlink BWP is used to transmit PDSCHs of remaining minimum system information (remaining minimum system information, RMSI), an msg2, an msg4, and other signaling. The dedicated BWP is a BWP configured when UE is in a radio resource control (radio resource control, RRC) connected mode, and can be used only by the terminal device to send and receive information.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">It should be understood that sending and receiving information in this application includes but is not limited to sending and receiving signaling and data.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In addition, each downlink BWP includes at least one control-resource set (control-resource set, CORESET) having a dedicated search space.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Each CORESET may include a plurality of physical resource blocks in frequency domain, and the CORESET includes one to three OFDM symbols in time domain. These OFDM symbols may be located at any location in a slot. Time-frequency resources occupied by the CORESET are semi-statically configured by using higher-layer parameters. In frequency domain, the CORESET configuration supports continuous and discrete frequency domain resource configurations, and the configured CORESET does not exceed a frequency domain range of an active BWP. A quantity of resource blocks (resource blocks, RBs) in a CORESET 0 is indicated by the system information. Therefore, for terminal devices in a same cell, CORESETs 0 are the same.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">When there are a plurality of terminal devices shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the network device <b>101</b> may perform transmission to the plurality of terminal devices through multicast transmission. It should be understood that multicast transmission includes but is not limited to groupcast transmission and/or broadcast transmission. During multicast transmission, the network device <b>101</b> sends one piece of downlink control information to a plurality of terminal devices in a cell (which may be all or some terminal devices in the cell), to indicate these terminal devices to receive PDSCHs on a same frequency domain resource. Correspondingly, the terminal devices may send and receive information on the frequency domain resource corresponding to an active BWP. A dedicated BWP of each terminal device is independently configured. Therefore, multicast transmission needs to be performed on a frequency domain resource common to all target terminals.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In an implementation, the terminal device can detect only one DCI format, namely, a DCI format 1_0, in a common search space. In this application, the DCI format 1_0 may indicate DCI in the DCI format 1_0. It should be understood that the DCI format 1_0 may be scrambled by using a plurality of radio network temporary identifiers (radio network temporary identity, RNTI) to indicate different information. In an embodiment, quantities of bits carried in DCI formats 1_0 scrambled by using different RNTIs are usually the same.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, when a cyclic redundancy check (cyclic redundancy check, CRC) of the DCI format 1_0 is scrambled by using a cell-radio network temporary identifier (cell-radio network temporary identifier, C-RNTI), an example of distribution of information fields in the DCI format 1_0 is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. It should be understood that the information fields shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> are arranged in a linear manner rather than in an array manner. It should be understood that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is merely a schematic diagram. In a specific DCI transmission process, a receiver receives/obtains information about each field in DCI based on a predetermined location or an arrangement.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">It can be learned that the DCI format 1_0 may include the following information fields:</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">An identifier for DCI formats (identifier for DCI formats) information field indicates a DCI format. For example, the identifier for DCI formats information field includes one bitwidth. If the bitwidth is set to 1, the bit identifies a downlink DCI format. If the bitwidth is set to 0, the bit identifies an uplink DCI format.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">A frequency domain resource assignment (frequency domain resource assignment, FDRA) information field indicates a frequency domain resource occupied for data channel transmission, for example, indicate a start position (for example, a start RB) and a width (for example, a quantity of RBs of the frequency domain resource) of the frequency domain resource.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">A time domain resource assignment (time domain resource assignment, TDRA) information field indicates a time domain resource occupied for the data channel transmission.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">A virtual resource block (virtual resource block, VRB)-to-physical resource block (physical resource block, PRB) mapping (VRB-to-PRB mapping) information field indicates whether the VRB-to-PRB mapping is interleaved or non-interleaved.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">A modulation and coding scheme (modulation and coding scheme, MCS) information field indicates a modulation order and a bit rate that are used on a data channel.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">A new data indicator (new data indicator, NDI) information field is used to identify initial transmission (or referred to as initial transmission). A bit in this information field is not reversed during retransmission and is reversed during the initial transmission. For example, a bitwidth of an initially transmitted NDI information field of a data packet is set to 1, and bitwidths of an NDI information field that is in DCI that is retransmitted for three times are all 1. If data transmitted next time is an initially transmitted data packet, a bitwidth of an NDI information field in the DCI is reversed to 0.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">A redundancy version (redundancy version, RV) information field indicates an RV of a scheduled data channel. For example, redundant bits generated by an encoder are divided into several groups, each RV defines a transmission start point, and different RVs are separately used for the first transmission and each HARQ retransmission, to implement gradual accumulation of the redundant bits and complete an incremental redundant HARQ operation.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">A HARQ process number (HARQ process number, HPN) information field indicates a HARQ process number of data.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">A downlink assignment index (downlink assignment index) information field indicates a serial number of a data channel fed back in a codebook during dynamic codebook construction.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">A transmission power control (transmission power control, TPC) command for PUCCH (TPC command for scheduled PUCCH) information field is used to adjust, when HARQ feedback information needs to be sent on a data channel scheduled by using DCI, power of a PUCCH that carries the HARQ feedback information.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">A PUCCH resource indicator (PUCCH resource indicator) information field indicates, when HARQ feedback information needs to be sent on a data channel scheduled by using DCI, a resource of a PUCCH that carries the feedback information HARQ.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">A PDSCH-to-HARQ feedback timing indicator (PDSCH-to-HARQ feedback timing indicator) information field (which may be referred to as a K<b>1</b> information field), when feedback information HARQ needs to be sent on a data channel scheduled by using DCI, indicates an offset, from a slot in which the data channel scheduled by using the DCI is located to a slot in which a channel carrying a HARQ corresponding to a PDSCH is located (which may be referred to as PDSCH-to-HARQ feedback timing below).</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">It should be understood that, in this application, an information field may be a bitwidth included in the information field, or the information field may be information corresponding to the information field, for example, a value of the bitwidth included in the information field and/or information represented by the value of the bitwidth. For example, the identifier for DCI formats information field may be a bitwidth corresponding to the identifier for DCI formats information field, or the identifier for DCI formats information field may be a value of the bitwidth and/or information represented by the value of the bitwidth.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is merely an example for description, and it should not be understood that the DCI shown in this application is limited to the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. For example, when the CRC of the DCI format 1_0 is scrambled by using a system information-radio network temporary identifier (system information-radio network temporary identifier, SI-RNTI), the DCI format 1_0 may include a frequency domain resource assignment information field, a time domain resource assignment information field, a VRB-to-PRB mapping information field, a modulation and coding scheme information field, a system information indicator (system information indicator) information field, and a reserved (reserved) bit (or referred to as a reserved bitwidth). Herein, the scrambling may alternatively be performed by using another identifier. In addition, sizes of the information fields shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> do not represent actual lengths of the information fields in the DCI (namely, quantities of bitwidths included in the information fields).</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">A size of the frequency domain resource assignment information field (namely, a quantity of bitwidths included in the frequency domain resource assignment information field) in the DCI format 1_0 is determined based on a frequency domain width corresponding to a CORESET 0 or an initial BWP. This means that a frequency domain resource for multicast transmission according to a conventional technology can only be the CORESET 0 or the initial BWP. Therefore, flexibility of scheduling a frequency domain resource during multicast transmission is affected.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Based on the architecture shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the communication method provided in embodiments of this application may be performed by the network device <b>101</b> and at least one terminal device, to improve the flexibility of scheduling a frequency domain resource during multicast transmission. The terminal devices may include the terminal device <b>103</b>, the terminal <b>104</b>, and/or another terminal device that is not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The method may include the following steps shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">S<b>101</b>: The terminal device obtains a first frequency domain resource.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Specifically, the terminal device may obtain a start RB and a frequency domain width of the first frequency domain resource by using system information or a higher layer parameter.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In a specific example, the terminal device may obtain the first frequency domain resource by using the system information or RRC signaling. Optionally, the frequency domain resource is a first BWP. In addition, the first frequency domain resource may alternatively be dynamically indicated by using DCI. Specifically, the system information, the RRC signaling, or the DCI may indicate at least one of an index (for example, a BWP identifier) of the first BWP, a start position of the first frequency domain resource, the frequency domain width of the first frequency domain resource, or a numerology (numerology) of the first frequency domain resource. The numerology of the first frequency domain resource includes a subcarrier spacing (subcarrier spacing, SCS) and a cyclic prefix (cyclic prefix, CP).</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">In another example, the first frequency domain resource is a subset or a proper subset of a third frequency domain resource. The third frequency domain resource is an active BWP. The terminal device may obtain the third frequency domain resource by using system information or RRC signaling.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">In an embodiment, the terminal device further obtains a second frequency domain resource. The first frequency domain resource and the second frequency domain resource are independently configured. In other words, the first frequency domain resource does not depend on a configuration of the second frequency domain resource.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">In a possible example, that the first frequency domain resource and the second frequency domain resource are independently configured may mean that the first frequency domain resource and the second frequency domain resource are configured by using different signaling, or may mean that the first frequency domain resource and the second frequency domain resource are configured by using different fields in same signaling. In a further optional embodiment, configurations of the different signaling are not mutually referenced, or configurations of the different fields are not mutually referenced.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">For example, the second frequency domain resource may be configured by the network device <b>101</b> by using system information, and the first frequency domain resource may be configured by the network device <b>101</b> by using higher layer signaling. For another example, the first frequency domain resource is configured by using first RRC signaling, and the second frequency domain resource is configured by using second RRC signaling. A frequency domain width of the second frequency domain resource is a quantity of PRBs corresponding to a CORESET 0, and the CORESET 0 is configured by using system information. Alternatively, the frequency domain width of the second frequency domain resource is an initial BWP, and the initial BWP is configured by using system information or a higher layer parameter. Alternatively, the frequency domain width of the second frequency domain resource is a predefined BWP or a predefined frequency domain width.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">In another possible example, that the first frequency domain resource and the second frequency domain resource are independently configured may mean that the first frequency domain resource is configured without reference to the second frequency domain resource. For example, the frequency domain width of the first frequency domain resource is unrelated to the frequency domain width of the second frequency domain resource, and/or the start position of the first frequency domain resource is unrelated to a start position of the second frequency domain resource. During implementation, a first parameter used to configure the first frequency domain resource may be determined without reference to a second parameter, and the second parameter is used to configure the second frequency domain resource. The first parameter may be a direct parameter used to determine the first frequency domain resource. For example, the first parameter includes the first frequency domain resource. Alternatively, the first parameter may be an indirect parameter used to determine the first frequency domain resource. For example, the first parameter includes a resource indication value (resource indication value, RIV) and/or another parameter used to configure the frequency domain resource. Similarly, the second parameter may be a direct parameter or an indirect parameter used to determine the second frequency domain resource.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">A specific example is used for description herein. If the second frequency domain resource includes the CORESET 0, and the CORESET 0 is determined based on a parameter A, first information may include a parameter B, and the parameter B is determined without reference to the parameter A. If the second frequency domain resource includes the initial BWP, and the initial BWP is determined based on a parameter C, the first information may include the parameter B, and the parameter B is determined without reference to the parameter C. If the second frequency domain resource includes the CORESET 0 and the initial BWP, where the CORESET 0 is determined based on the parameter A, and the initial BWP is determined based on the parameter C, the first information may include the parameter B, the parameter B is determined without reference to the parameter A, and the parameter B is determined without reference to the parameter C.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">The following describes possible configuration manners of the first frequency domain resource and the second frequency domain resource by using examples.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">In a possible configuration manner, the start position of the first frequency domain resource and the start position of the second frequency domain resource are independent of each other and are not mutually referenced. In addition, the frequency domain width of the first frequency domain resource and the frequency domain width of the second frequency domain resource are independent of each other and are not mutually referenced.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">For example, as shown in numbers (a) and (b) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a frequency-domain start position of the first frequency domain resource is f<b>1</b>, a start position of the second frequency domain resource is f<b>2</b>, f<b>1</b> is not equal to f<b>2</b>, and f<b>1</b> is determined without reference to f<b>2</b>. A frequency domain width of the first frequency domain resource is F<b>1</b>, a frequency domain width of the second frequency domain resource is F<b>2</b>, F<b>1</b> is not equal to F<b>2</b>, and F<b>1</b> is determined without reference to F<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">In another possible configuration manner, the start position of the first frequency domain resource and the start position of the second frequency domain resource are independent of each other and are not mutually referenced.
