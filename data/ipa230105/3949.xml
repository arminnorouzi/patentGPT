id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an optical connecting component and an optical connecting structure that are oriented to downsizing and use magnets for holding and pressing optical waveguide components with each other.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In recent years, with increase in traffic due to video services, internet of things (IoT), cloud services, or the like, significant expansion of communication capacity in data centers or between data centers is required. In order to realize the expansion of communication capacity, instead of conventional short-distance communication methods using electric signals, introduction of optical interconnection technology using optical transmission techniques used in optical communications or the like is progressing. In this optical interconnection technology, an optical transceiver form called as a pluggable transceiver is often used. Further, with the recent need for increasing communication capacity, the number of channels of optical transceivers configuring the optical interconnection is increasing. There is a need to mount numerous optical fibers on a board. In order to connect the numerous optical fibers on or at an edge of the board so as to realize a space saving, downsizing of a multicore optical connector is required.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the pluggable transceiver, various optical components represented by an optical transmitter/receiver, electric circuit components for controlling them, a printed circuit board and the like are accommodated in a metal housing thereof. Further, the housing is provided with a guide structure that allows an optical connector to be inserted from or pulled out to the outside. Inserting an optical connector matching with this guide structure enables the optical connector to be optically coupled with the optical transmitter/receiver in the housing.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">As mentioned above, with the need for the increase in communication capacity, the size of the pluggable transceiver is getting smaller year by year, and the housing is downsized to the same extent as the guide structure for the optical connector. Therefore, in order to further downsize the housing in the future, it is required to downsize a guide mechanism, that is, further downsize the size of an optical connector matching with the guide mechanism. Further, there is also an application of connecting optical fibers to each other in the small housing, and the optical connector is required to be made as small as possible even for this application.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Further, it is considered that the introduction of the optical interconnection on a board while eliminating the housing will progress in the future. Even in such a case, in order to reduce the area occupied by optical connecting components on the board, the demand for compact optical connectors is increasing.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Generally, as an optical connector for connecting optical fibers such as an optical connector for a pluggable transceiver, in the case of a single-core connector, the one using a cylindrical ferrule, which is represented by an SC connector or an LC connector, is known. Further, in the case of a multi-core connector, an MT connector and an MPO connector based on the MT connector are known (Non-Patent Literature 2).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The multi-core connector is similar to the single-core connector in that it is used as an interface of a pluggable transceiver, and is widely used particularly for multi-channel parallel transmission applications. As illustrated in Non-Patent Literature 1, in the single-core connector, positioning is performed by accommodating and aligning fibers in cylindrical ferrule components and connecting them in a confronting relationship with a split sleeve interposed therebetween. That is, independent components are used for the optical fiber alignment components (single-core ferrules) and the high-accuracy positioning component (split sleeve) between the ferrules.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">On the other hand, in the multi-core connector, resin-molded ferrules having a plurality of holes for accommodating fibers and two guide holes for accommodating/inserting guide pins are used. The fiber connection is performed by bonding and fixing a plurality of fibers in the ferrules and fitting the guide pins provided in one ferrule into the other ferrule. At this time, since the fiber accommodation holes and the guide pin holes are excellent in both hole diameter accuracy and hole position accuracy, high accuracy positioning between the fibers can be realized.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Further, in each optical connector, connecting end faces of the fibers and the ferrules are polished. For example, in the MT connector of the multi-core connector, the end faces are right-angled. In the MPO connector, the end faces are inclined.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Further, in the multi-core connector, the end face of the fiber is often polished so as to slightly protrude from the end face of the ferrule. In order to prevent Fresnel reflection between the fiber and an air layer on the connecting end face, for example, in the MT connector, the ferrules are pressed against each other by a clip, and the connecting end face is filled with a resin that matches in refractive index. Further, for example, in the MPO connector, the connecting end faces are obliquely formed, and coiled springs are provided behind respective ferrules to realize a physical contact (PC) connection, which is a close contact connection between cores, so that the ferrules in a confronting relationship can be pressed with a sufficient force.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Further, in realizing the optical interconnection, it is necessary to connect optical elements configuring the optical transceiver to numerous optical fibers or optical waveguide devices containing a polymer, silica glass, or the like, as a core material. Conventionally, they are positioned with high accuracy using an active alignment and then permanently fixed and integrated with an adhesive or the like. Further, a structure for easily connecting the connectors is also under study, in which the previously described optical connector technique is diverted for the connection between optical elements and a plurality of optical fibers or optical waveguides on a board, without performing the active alignment.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">For example, by integrating the optical fibers or optical waveguides as optical connecting components using an MT ferrule or the like and arranging a positioning structure that fits with guide pins of the MT ferrule on the optical element side, a multicore connector connection with the optical elements can be realized. Even in such a connector connection with optical elements, since the optical elements themselves are becoming smaller and denser year by year, the connection components are required to be further reduced in size.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Non-Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Non-Patent Literature 1: Ryo Nagase, Kazuo Hokari, &#x201c;optical connector&#x201d;, NTT technique journal, December 2007, pp.74-78.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">&#x201c;Non-Patent Literature 2: History of Fiber Optic Physical Contact Connector for Low Insertion and High Return Losses,&#x201d; Ryo Nagase, Yoshiteru Abe, Mitsuru Kihara, Proc.

In particular, as illustrated in Non-Patent Literatures 1 and 2, the MPO connector using coiled springs requires the usage of a plurality of components and housing components to realize manual push-pull connection while resisting a reaction force of the coiled spring. The size of these components is an obstacle factor in further downsizing the connectors. Further, when a spring component is used for connector connection with optical elements, it is required to use a clip or a spring component for fastening them, and the size of these components is an obstacle factor in downsizing the connector connection portions.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Embodiments of the present invention have been made to solve the above-mentioned problems, and intends to provide an optical connecting component and an optical connecting structure that are compact in size and capable of realizing a stable optical connecting by adding a pressing force between connecting end faces without using any mechanical fastening component, any spring component, or the like.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Means for Solving the Problem</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018">To solve the above-mentioned problem, an optical connecting component according to embodiments of the present invention is an optical connecting component to be connected to another optical connecting

alignment component, wherein a positioning structure is provided on a connecting end face of the alignment component, in which the positioning structure determines a relative position between the connecting end face and a connecting end face of an alignment component provided in the other optical connecting component.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Effects of embodiments of the

Other examples of the optical waveguide component include optical waveguides, optical elements, and the like.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">Further, a plurality of optical fibers <b>101</b> is attached to an optical fiber tape <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">The optical fibers <b>101</b> and the optical fiber alignment component <b>102</b> are surface-polished, at their connecting end face <b>105</b>, so as to be substantially the same plane. Further, a joining component <b>103</b> capable of accommodating the optical fiber alignment component <b>102</b> is arranged in such a way as to surround the circumference of the optical fiber alignment component <b>102</b> in the outer peripheral direction. Here, the outer peripheral direction of the optical fiber alignment component is a direction along the outer periphery of the optical fiber alignment component in a plane perpendicular to the optical fiber longitudinal direction.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">The joining component <b>103</b> in the present embodiment has an opening part capable of accommodating the optical fiber alignment component <b>102</b> (e.g., in the case of an MT ferrule-based structure, the width is approximately 2 to 10 mm, the height is approximately 1 to 5 mm, and the length is approximately 2 to 10 mm), and the size of the joining component <b>103</b> is approximately 3 to 15 mm in width, approximately 2 to 10 mm in height, and approximately 3 to 10 mm in length.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">Further, the optical fiber alignment component <b>102</b> has the fitting structure, according to which two metal guide pins <b>1041</b> used in a known multicore ferrule are inserted into guide pin holes <b>1042</b> provided in the optical fiber alignment component (ferrule) <b>102</b> so that the pins are fitted and positioned. Although in the drawing the guide pins and the pin holes are provided only partly in the longitudinal direction, they may be arranged so as to penetrate in the longitudinal direction of the ferrule. Further, while the fitting by these guide pins is kept, the attractive force acts in such a way as to attract the connecting end faces each other because the joining components <b>103</b> are made of magnets.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">In embodiments of the present invention, the type and material of the optical fiber and the type and material of the optical fiber alignment component <b>102</b> can be any known type and material. For example, the optical fiber may be a silica-based fiber or a plastic fiber.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">Further, although the MT ferrule is used for the optical fiber alignment component <b>102</b>, a known multicore ferrule may be used. In this case, any of general-purpose plastics, engineering plastics, super engineering plastics, and the like, which are often used for the multicore ferrule, may be used. Further, a glass material, a semiconductor material such as silicon, or ceramic may be used for a structure similar to the multicore ferrule. In addition, similar effects can be exerted by any other material as long as the optical fibers can be positioned and arranged with high accuracy. For example, like a known fiber array, a structure in which the fibers are accommodated in a glass V groove and closed by a lid component placed thereon and fixed with an adhesive may be used.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">Further, although the circumference of the optical fiber <b>101</b> is coated, two or more layered coating may be realized by additionally providing a known tube, a nylon coating, or the like thereon. Further, in the case of a multicore fiber, a known taped and bundled fiber tape may be used.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">Further, the guide pins <b>1041</b> and the guide pin holes <b>1042</b> are used in the positioning structure (fitting structure) in the present embodiment. The fitting structure is not limited to the above-described example. For example, like the fitting using notches <b>1111</b> and grooves <b>1112</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, protrusions or the like may be formed, or attached, on one ferrule end face, and guide grooves that match these protrusions may be provided on the other ferrule end face.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">Further, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, an external fitting guide structure <b>107</b> or the like may be used. Any other fitting structure is applicable as long as similar accuracy can be ensured. In the external fitting guide structure <b>107</b> of the fourteenth aspect, one ferrule has an insertion hole and the other ferrule has an external shape that matches the shape of the insertion hole.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">Here, the joining components <b>103</b> are made of permanent magnets. Any known magnets may be used, as the material of the permanent magnets, depending on a magnetic force to be generated. For example, they can be neodymium magnets. In addition, ferrite magnets, alnico magnets, samarium cobalt magnets, KS steels, MK steels, neodymium iron boron magnets, and the like can be used. In this case, the joining components <b>103</b> made of permanent magnets are magnetized to N-poles and S-poles along the optical fiber longitudinal direction. Hereinafter, the &#x201c;joining components&#x201d; are also referred to as a &#x201c;magnetic structure&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">Even if both are not permanent magnets, when one joining component <b>103</b> is a magnet made of a hard magnetic material, the other joining component <b>103</b> may be made of a soft magnetic material such as metal. For example, SUS430, iron, nickel, cobalt, or a material having magnetism of stainless (SUS), which is an iron-based alloy, can be used as a material unexpensive and excellent in machining.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">The optical fiber alignment component <b>102</b> and the joining component <b>103</b> are integrated in advance by any method such as bonding, mechanical fitting, or any one of various joining techniques. Further, in the first embodiment, the external shapes of the optical fiber alignment component <b>102</b> and the joining component <b>103</b> are exemplarily illustrated as being quadrangle/rectangle as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, but their external shapes can be any arbitrary shapes, of course. For example, the external shapes may be circular, elliptical, polygonal, or the like. The above is similarly applied to other embodiments described below.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">Here, the optical fiber <b>101</b> is polished so as to protrude slightly from the optical fiber alignment component <b>102</b> with respect to the optical fiber longitudinal direction of the connecting end face. Further, the connecting end face of the joining component <b>103</b> and the connecting end face of the optical fiber alignment component <b>102</b> are positioned and integrated so as to be substantially the same plane.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">With such a structure, the following effects are exerted. That is, according to the conventional multicore optical connector, in order to hold opposing optical fibers <b>101</b> so as to eliminate a gap therebetween, a coiled spring, a clip, or the like adds a pressing force. Further, the MPO connector or the like has a housing structure that realizes a mechanical fastening structure to constantly add the pressing force of a coiled spring to the connecting end face.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">Adopting the present structure makes it possible to add a pressing force for connecting the optical fibers <b>101</b> each other with the attractive force by the magnet, without adding any spring element. In addition, since the attractive force by the magnet additionally expresses the effect of holding the members, a stable optical connection can be maintained without requiring a mechanical fastening component that counteracts the reaction force of the spring as in the conventional art. That is, the number of members can be reduced, and as a result, a more compact multicore optical connector can be realized.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">Here, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, by appropriately setting the protrusion of the end face of the optical fiber <b>101</b> from the end face of the optical fiber alignment component <b>102</b>, and adding the pressing force by magnets, a physical contact (PC) connection <b>108</b> can be realized in all optical fibers <b>101</b>. In addition, a refractive index matching agent may be provided between them as described below in another embodiment.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">Further, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, a microlens <b>109</b> or the like may be provided on the end face of the optical fiber <b>101</b>, so that the connection is feasible in a state where an air gap <b>110</b> is intentionally provided between the optical fibers <b>101</b>. Further, the air gap no may be intentionally provided without providing the microlens <b>109</b>. Further, if necessary, antireflection coating or the like may be applied on the connecting end face of the optical fiber <b>101</b>. Further, as described below in a second embodiment, the end face of the optical fiber alignment component <b>102</b> and the end face of the optical fiber <b>101</b> may be polished while providing a constant angle with respect to a direction orthogonal to the optical fiber longitudinal direction.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">Here, the opposing faces of the joining components <b>103</b> are desired to be parallel to each other in order to stabilize the vector of the attractive force by the magnet in the optical fiber longitudinal direction. However, even if the above-described parallelism is not perfect, the reduction in optical coupling loss is ignorable unless the abutting angle of the ferrules in the longitudinal direction is greatly deviated. That is, good optical characteristics can be achieved even with parallelism that can be ensured with practical machining accuracy.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">Further, the present embodiment exemplarily illustrates the joining component <b>103</b> arranged so as to cover the outer periphery of the optical fiber alignment component <b>102</b>. However, the covering is not required to be perfect, of course. The joining component <b>103</b> may be arranged so as to be present on only one peripheral face or two peripheral faces.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">Specifically, in the present embodiment, the joining component <b>103</b> is arranged so as to surround the circumference of a part of four sidewalls of the optical fiber alignment component <b>102</b> in the outer peripheral direction, but is not limited to this, and may be arranged so as to surround the entire outer periphery of the sidewalls of the optical fiber alignment component <b>102</b>. Further, it may be arranged so as to surround the circumference of only a part of one face of the optical fiber alignment component <b>102</b>, instead of all four sidewalls, and it suffices that it is arranged around at least a part of one side face of the optical fiber alignment component <b>102</b> in the outer peripheral direction.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">In the case of not surrounding the four sidewalls of the optical fiber alignment component <b>102</b> in the outer peripheral direction, it may be concerned that the attractive force decreases with reducing magnet contact area. However, it is desired to largely set the size of the contact area, if necessary.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">It is also possible that, from the nature of magnets, the present optical connectors are arranged in multiple rows.

Here, any of the magnetic structures <b>903</b> is made of a hard magnetic material (so-called magnet), and any known magnets may be used, as the material of the magnets, depending on a magnetic force to be generated.

Even if both of the paired opposing magnetic structures <b>903</b> are not made of the hard magnetic material (magnet), when only one is made of a magnet and the other magnetic structure <b>903</b> is made of a soft magnetic material, similar application is feasible because a magnetic force acts between the magnetic structures <b>903</b>.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0202">As the soft magnetic material, so-called metals attracted to magnets, and the like are known. For example, iron, nickel, cobalt, or a material having magnetism of stainless (SUS) that is an iron-based alloy (e.g., SUS430) can be used. It is needless to say that, when both of the opposing magnetic structures <b>903</b> are magnets, the magnetic force to be generated is larger and the attractive force is larger.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0203">On the other hand, although the attractive force is inferior to the above, the other may be made of a soft magnetic material from the viewpoint of workability, prevention of adhesion to other components, prevention of adverse effects of the magnetic force, or the like. These can be appropriately selected depending on the required attractive force, the size of the magnetic structure <b>903</b>, required conditions, and the like.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0204">Further, the alignment component <b>902</b> and the magnetic structure <b>903</b> are integrated, and any joining method such as adhesion, mechanical fitting, or metal joining (soldering or the like) may be used.

Further, the connecting end face <b>9031</b> of the magnetic structure <b>903</b> and the connecting end face <b>9021</b> of the alignment component <b>902</b> are configured to be on the same plane, or the connecting end face <b>9031</b> of the magnetic structure <b>903</b> is positioned so as to retract from the connecting end face <b>9021</b> of the alignment component <b>902</b> in the optical fiber longitudinal direction. There is a clearance between the connecting end faces <b>9031</b> of the opposing magnetic structures <b>903</b>.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0206">In general, the smaller the gap, the larger the magnetic force acting between magnets. Therefore, it is ideal that the face between the magnetic structures and the face between the alignment components are on the same plane so that a larger magnetic force can be generated.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0207">On the other hand, if the magnetic structure protrudes even slightly toward the connection face with respect to the optical fiber longitudinal direction, there will be a risk that the end faces of the alignment components or the end faces of the optical fibers cannot be brought into contact with each other. However, the above-mentioned positional relationship can reduce the gap between the magnets being the magnetic structures as small as possible without hindering the contact of the end faces of the alignment components <b>902</b> and the end faces of the optical fibers, and accordingly the magnetic force can be sufficiently generated.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0208">With such a structure, the following effects are exerted.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0209">That is, in the conventional multicore optical connector, it is required to apply a pressing force to the connecting end face so as to reduce the gap between the opposing optical fibers (or to make the gap zero), and a coiled spring, a clip, or the like is used as a member applying the pressing force.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0210">Further, for example, in the MPO connector or the like, it is necessary to provide spring holding components and a plurality of housing components for integrating them. In addition, in order to maintain the connection state where the pressing force is applied, it is necessary to generate the pressing force by providing the mechanical fastening structure for the housing components and maintaining the mechanically fastened structure with interposing adapter components or the like to be fitted with the housing components.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0211">With the structure of embodiments of the present invention, without using the previously described mechanical spring component, the pressing force can be added between the connecting end faces of the optical fibers by the magnetic attractive force.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0212">Further, since the effect of holding the connection state is exerted by the magnetic attractive force, a stable optical connection can be maintained without requiring housing components and adapter components equipped with the mechanical fastening structure as in the past to counteract the reaction force of the spring component.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0213">That is, even when the same pressing force is generated by using the structure of embodiments of the present invention, the number of members can be greatly reduced, and a multicore optical connector connection structure that is greatly downsized compared with the conventional one can be realized.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0214">For example, a known MT ferrule generally has a width of 6.4 mm, a length of 8 mm, and a thickness of 2.5 mm, but the external shape of the MPO connector requires a width of 12 mm, a thickness of 7.5 mm, and a length of 25 mm when a surrounding housing and a fiber protection portion are taken into consideration. In addition, it is necessary to provide the adapter components for coupling.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0215">The elastic force of the coiled spring generated at this time is, for example, 10N. On the other hand, by adopting a structure using a general neodymium magnet around both MT ferrules, for example, if it is arranged with a thickness of 1 mm and a length of 20 mm, the external dimension including the magnetic structure <b>903</b> can be greatly downsized to a width of 8.4 mm, a length of 8 mm, and a thickness of 4.5 mm. As a result, a magnetic force equal to or greater than 10N can be generated, and the adapter components can be eliminated, leading to great downsizing.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0216">The above-described calculation is an example. It is possible to further increase the magnetic force or realize downsizing with the same magnetic force, by adding any method such as forming the magnets by stronger materials, forming the magnets by a one-dimensional or two-dimensional multi-pole magnet array as described in the embodiment described below, or adding other magnetic structure <b>903</b> such as a metal plate, which functions as a so-called yoke and generates a larger magnetic force. Further, in recent years, thin MT ferrules (e.g., 1.25 mm in thickness and 4 mm in length) have been developed, and further downsizing is feasible by combining with the same thin MT ferrule.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0217">Further, in the structures illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>A and <b>17</b>B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b>A and <b>18</b>B</figref>, although the magnetic structure <b>903</b> is arranged so as to surround the circumference of the alignment component <b>902</b>, any other structure capable of generating a magnetic force is employable.</p><p id="p-0219" num="0218"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b>A to <b>20</b>K</figref> illustrate arrangement variations of the positional relationship between the magnetic structure <b>903</b> and alignment component <b>902</b> when viewed from the connecting end face side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>A and <b>17</b>B</figref>.

Further, a boot function for protecting the optical fibers <b>901</b> or the like can be simultaneously functioned. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b>F</figref>, a structure in which the connecting end face <b>9031</b> of the magnetic structure <b>903</b> protrudes from the connecting end face <b>9021</b> of the alignment component <b>902</b> may be adopted.</p><p id="p-0225" num="0224">In any of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b>A to <b>21</b>F</figref>, when a plurality of magnetic structures <b>903</b> are combined, they may be mechanically joined, or may be integrated by magnetic force. Any joining means such as adhesion or soldering may be used. Further, as described above, any combination obtainable from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b>A to <b>20</b>K</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b>A to <b>21</b>F</figref> is usable as a combination of the magnetic structures <b>903</b>, and any combination for the opposing pair may be used as connection structures.</p><p id="p-0226" num="0225">Further, as mentioned above, when one magnetic structure <b>903</b> includes a magnet, the other may be composed of only a soft magnetic material. When one of them is composed of only a soft magnetic material, the magnetic force slightly reduces compared to the case where both are configured by magnets. However, it is unnecessary to worry about the N-S combination and arrangement for generating the magnetic attractive force, and therefore it may be practically preferable and may be appropriately selected.</p><p id="p-0227" num="0226">Using the above-mentioned variations can exert additional effects such as increase in magnetic force for further downsizing, space saving in the case of including a connection structure mounting substrate, and improved workability in manufacturing. For example, it is relatively difficult to drill holes in magnets, but cutting is easy. Therefore, as partly illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b>A to <b>20</b>K</figref>, using another magnet in assembling, or adopting a structure with intervention of a soft magnetic material or the like, can improve easiness in fabrication.</p><p id="p-0228" num="0227">Further, in addition to the above, it is possible to exert mounting benefits such as sharing with other mounting components. For example, the soft magnetic material portions of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b>A to <b>20</b>K</figref> may be shared with the substrate on which the connection structure is mounted, or screw holes or the like may be arranged in the soft magnetic material portions so as to be shared with the mechanical fastening structure for the connection structure mounting substrate.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0228">Next, other constituent elements of embodiments of the present invention will be described. In embodiments of the present invention, any known type and material of the optical fiber and any known type and material of the alignment component can be applied.</p><p id="p-0230" num="0229">For example, the optical fiber <b>901</b> may be a silica-based optical fiber or a plastic fiber, which are well known. Further, any of single-mode fibers, multi-mode fibers, polarization holding fibers, photonic crystal fibers, multi-core fibers, and the like can be applied as the optical fibers <b>901</b>.</p><p id="p-0231" num="0230">In addition, although the circumference of the optical fibers <b>901</b> is coated, a known resin (e.g., acrylic, epoxy, silicone, or polyimide) coating is applied around a portion other than the inside of the microholes of the alignment component <b>902</b>, and further two or more layered coating may be provided by adding a silicone tube, a nylon coating, or the like, thereon. Of course, in the case of a multi-core fiber, the optical fiber can be handled more easily by using a known taped and bundled fiber tape <b>904</b>.</p><p id="p-0232" num="0231">A multicore ferrule such as a known MT ferrule can be used as the alignment component <b>902</b>. Any of general-purpose plastic, engineering plastic, super engineering plastic, and the like, which are often used for the MT ferrule, may be used as the material of the multi-core ferrule.</p><p id="p-0233" num="0232">Further, for a structure similar to the multi-core ferrule, a glass material may be used, or a processed product based on any material such as a semiconductor material such as silicon or a ceramic material may be used. For example, like a known optical fiber array, a structure in which the optical fibers are accommodated in a glass V groove and closed by a lid component placed thereon and fixed with an adhesive is applicable. In this case, as mentioned above, in the circumference thereof, two guide pins or the like may be positioned and bonded at predetermined positions on both ends, so as to obtain an alignment component structure made of a glass material and having a positioning structure.</p><p id="p-0234" num="0233">Further, the external shapes of the alignment component <b>902</b> and the magnetic structure <b>903</b> are exemplarily illustrated as being quadrangle/rectangle in the drawings, but their external shapes can be any arbitrary shapes, of course. For example, the external shapes may be circular, elliptical, polygonal, or the like. The corners and the like may be chamfered or filleted if necessary. The above is similarly applied to other embodiments.</p><p id="p-0235" num="0234">As the positioning structure, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>A and <b>17</b>B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b>A and <b>18</b>B</figref> illustrate the positioning structures by the guide pins used in the MT ferrule or the like, but the positioning structure according to embodiments of the present invention is not limited to the above, of course. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b>A</figref>, like fitting by notches and grooves, protrusions <b>9061</b> or the like may be formed or attached on one ferrule end face and guide grooves <b>9062</b> or the like matching with the protrusions may be provided on the other.</p><p id="p-0236" num="0235">Further, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b>B</figref>, fitting by external form guides <b>907</b> or the like may be used. Any other fitting structure or the like can be applied to positioning as long as similar accuracy can be ensured.</p><p id="p-0237" num="0236">Next, the connecting end face of the optical fiber <b>901</b> will also be described. The same applies even if the optical fiber <b>901</b> is replaced by an optical waveguide or an optical element, as the optical waveguide component. For example, similar to the present embodiment, appropriately setting the protrusion of the end face of the optical fiber <b>901</b> from the end face of the alignment component <b>902</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b>A</figref> and adding the pressing force by the magnet can realize the physical contact (PC) connection for all fibers.</p><p id="p-0238" num="0237">As a result, Fresnel reflection with an air layer can be suppressed. As described below in another embodiment, even if there is a gap between the optical fibers <b>901</b> to be connected, the Fresnel reflection can be suppressed by filling the gap with a resin having an appropriate refractive index for matching in refractive index.</p><p id="p-0239" num="0238">Further, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b>B</figref>, obliquely polishing the end face of the optical fiber <b>901</b> can suppress return light due to the Fresnel reflection. In this case, the alignment component <b>902</b> may be polished together, or an inclined end face may be formed only on the end face of the optical fiber <b>901</b>. The angle at this time may be set in the vertical direction of the paper surface as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b>B</figref>, or may be set in the depth direction of the paper surface, of course.</p><p id="p-0240" num="0239">Further, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b>C</figref>, it is also possible to provide a gap (cavity) and provide microlenses <b>909</b> or the like at the end faces of the optical fibers <b>901</b>, so that the optical fibers <b>901</b> are connected in a state where a designated gap is provided therebetween.</p><p id="p-0241" num="0240">Further, the air gap may be intentionally provided without providing the microlens. In this case, if necessary, antireflection coating or the like may be applied to the fiber connecting end face so that the Fresnel reflection can be suppressed. Further, in the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b>C</figref>, an inclined end face may be formed without applying the antireflection coating. In this case, it suffices that the positions of the opposing optical fibers <b>901</b> may be appropriately set in advance so that the light coupling is realized even in a state where there is an angle.</p><p id="p-0242" num="0241">In the case of a space coupling system, when realizing the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b>C</figref>, it suffices that the connecting end face <b>9031</b> of the magnetic structure <b>903</b> is arranged so as to protrude from the connecting end face <b>9021</b> of the alignment component <b>902</b>.</p><p id="p-0243" num="0242">Next, the tolerance of the magnetic structure <b>903</b> will be described. In order to stabilize the vector of the magnetic attractive force in the fiber longitudinal direction, it is desired that the opposing faces of the magnetic structures <b>903</b> are parallel. However, even if the above-mentioned parallelism is not perfect, the reduction in optical coupling loss is ignorable unless the abutting angle in the longitudinal direction between the alignment components <b>902</b> deviates greatly. That is, good optical characteristics can be achieved even with parallelism that can be ensured with practical machining accuracy.</p><p id="p-0244" num="0243">In addition, due to the nature of magnets, the optical connecting structure <b>900</b> can be arranged in multiple rows. That is, by arranging the multicore optical connecting structures <b>900</b> side by side, a multiple-string multicore optical connection with no clearance can be provided.</p><p id="p-0245" num="0244">As will be described below, in the present optical connecting components and the optical connecting structure, regarding the optical waveguide components, the optical waveguide components accommodated in the alignment components are not limited to a plurality of optical fibers, of course. Similar effects can be exerted even when the optical fibers are replaced by optical waveguides having a plurality of waveguide cores. The connection between the optical waveguides or the connection between the optical waveguides and the plurality of optical fibers are feasible.</p><heading id="h-0024" level="1">Tenth Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0246" num="0245"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>24</b>A and <b>24</b>B</figref> illustrate perspective views of an optical connecting structure moo, before and after connection, according to a tenth embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0247" num="0246">The fundamental structure is the same as that of the ninth embodiment.

On the other hand, a soft magnetic material <b>10</b>_<b>03</b>_<b>03</b> is used as one of the magnetic structures.</p><p id="p-0249" num="0248">On the other hand, unlike the plurality of optical fibers <b>10</b>_<b>01</b> of the first embodiment, an optical waveguide <b>10</b>_<b>21</b> having a plurality of cores and a clad around them is accommodated in each alignment component <b>10</b>_<b>02</b>.</p><p id="p-0250" num="0249">The cores and the clad configuring the optical waveguide <b>10</b>_<b>21</b> are made of a polymer resin, and each is made of a fluorinated epoxy resin whose refractive index is optimally adjusted. The core diameter is approximately 8 &#x3bc;m, and it functions as a single mode waveguide.</p><p id="p-0251" num="0250">The external shape of the polymer waveguide is a quadrangle. A quadrangular groove for accommodating the polymer waveguide is formed in the MT ferrule. After the polymer waveguide is accommodated, the ferrule and the polymer waveguide are integrated by covering the ferrule with a lid from the upper surface of the waveguide and fixing the lid with an adhesive. This is substantially the same structure as that of a well-known PMT connector (Polymer Waveguide Connected with the MT connector). This structure makes it possible to realize connector connection of the waveguides in the same manner as the MT connector.</p><p id="p-0252" num="0251">Of course, the waveguide to be configured is not limited to the above example, and any optical waveguide that functions as an optical waveguide can be applied. For example, a polymer may be used as the material, or a silica-based PLC (Planar Lightwave Circuit) using, as a main base material, a silica glass formed on a well-known substrate may be used.</p><p id="p-0253" num="0252">Further, similarly, any material such as a Si waveguide formed on an SOI substrate, an InP waveguide made of a compound semiconductor, or an LN waveguide made of a dielectric material may be used.</p><p id="p-0254" num="0253">Further, as the material of the polymer waveguide, any known waveguide material may be used in addition to the fluorinated epoxy resin. For example, epoxy resin, acrylic resin, silicone resin, polyimide resin, polynorbornene resin, polyoxetane resin, organic-inorganic hybrid resin, or the like may be the material. A halogen substituent obtained by fluorinating, chlorinating, or brominating the resin may be used. Further, any derivative with a partially modified chemical structure based on the resin may be used.</p><p id="p-0255" num="0254">The size of the waveguide core can be arbitrarily designed, and either single-mode or multi-mode may be used. Further, of course, the interval of the waveguide cores and the number of channels can also be arbitrarily applied.</p><p id="p-0256" num="0255">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>24</b>A and <b>24</b>B</figref>, the arrangement of the neodymium magnets, which are magnetic structures made of the hard magnetic material, is different from that of the ninth embodiment.</p><p id="p-0257" num="0256">Specifically, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>24</b>A and <b>24</b>B</figref>, in the optical connecting component <b>1000</b><i>a, </i>in the magnetic structure <b>10</b>_<b>03</b>, two magnets <b>10</b>_<b>03</b>_<b>01</b> and <b>10</b>_<b>03</b>_<b>02</b> having N- and S-poles in the longitudinal direction are joined along the longitudinal direction. The pair of N-pole and S-pole is disposed in the same magnetic structure <b>10</b>_<b>03</b>. Here, the pair of N-pole and S-pole is arranged in such a manner that an attractive force acts appropriately between the opposing faces of two magnets <b>10</b>_<b>03</b>_<b>01</b> and <b>10</b>_<b>03</b>_<b>02</b>. On the other hand, in the optical connecting component <b>1000</b><i>b, </i>the soft magnetic structure <b>10</b>_<b>03</b>_<b>03</b> is arranged and is connected to the magnet <b>10</b>_<b>03</b>_<b>01</b> by the magnetic force.</p><p id="p-0258" num="0257">With such a structure, similar to the effects described in the first embodiment, a necessary pressing force can be added between the connecting end faces of the optical waveguides <b>10</b>_<b>21</b> by the magnetic attractive force, without using the previously described mechanical spring component.</p><p id="p-0259" num="0258">Further, since the effect of holding the connection state is exerted by the magnetic attractive force, a stable optical connection can be maintained without requiring any housing component equipped with the conventional mechanical fastening component that counteracts the reaction force of the spring component, or any adapter component. That is, even when the same pressing force is generated, using the structure of embodiments of the present invention can greatly reduce the number of members. It is unnecessary to be incorporated into the MPO connector or the like. A connector connection structure for optical waveguides, which is greatly reduced in size compared with the conventional one, can be realized.</p><p id="p-0260" num="0259">Further, by arranging the magnets separately in the same component as in the present embodiment, the magnetic attractive force can be greatly generated even when the size is the same. That is, even if the size of the magnetic structure <b>10</b>_<b>03</b> is made smaller, a sufficient pressing force can be generated. The size for generating the same pressing force can be further reduced. As a result, it becomes possible to provide an optical connecting component and an optical connecting structure that are further reduced in size.</p><p id="p-0261" num="0260">Although the connection between optical waveguides has been described as an example. Of course, similar to the first embodiment, it is applicable to the connection between a plurality of optical fibers or between a plurality of optical fibers and an optical waveguide.</p><p id="p-0262" num="0261">Further, similar to the first embodiment, it can also be applied to the structure and material of the alignment components, different positioning structures, and any connecting end faces illustrated in the examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>23</b>A-<b>23</b>C</figref>.</p><p id="p-0263" num="0262">Further, any combination obtainable from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b>A to <b>22</b>B</figref> may be applied as long as a structure in which the magnet is divided along the longitudinal direction of the waveguide core is adopted. For example, a structure in which SUS430 being a soft magnetic material structure interposes as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>A</figref>, or surrounding as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>B</figref>, may be adopted.</p><p id="p-0264" num="0263">In the present embodiment, although the 2-division example (one N-S pair in one magnetic structure) is illustrated, any N-S holding structure more than 2-division (a plurality of N-S pairs in one magnetic structure) may also be adopted.

The illustrated objects to be connected are an optical fiber and an optical waveguide, instead of connecting optical fibers with each other or connecting optical waveguides with each other. Of course, the same is true for any combination of these optical waveguide components.</p><p id="p-0268" num="0267">In the present embodiment, one of the magnetic structures <b>11</b>_<b>03</b> uses a neodymium magnet that is a single hard magnetic material, and the other uses a neodymium magnet that is also a hard magnetic material.</p><p id="p-0269" num="0268">Except for the objects to be connected, this embodiment is different from the ninth and tenth embodiments in that the N-pole and the S-pole are not magnetized along the optical fiber longitudinal direction but magnetized in the outer peripheral direction. In the optical connecting components <b>1100</b><i>a </i>and <b>1100</b><i>b, </i>N-S is appropriately arranged so as to face each other so that a magnetic attractive force acts between respective magnetic structures <b>11</b>_<b>03</b>.</p><p id="p-0270" num="0269">With such a structure, a compact optical connecting structure can be realized without using mechanical pressing components or housing components provided with a fastening structure or the like, similar to effects described in the ninth embodiment.</p><p id="p-0271" num="0270">Further, by changing the direction of magnetization, depending on dimensions and arrangement of the magnets, the magnetic attractive force can be greatly generated even when the size is the same. That is, even if the size of the magnetic structure <b>11</b>_<b>03</b> is made smaller, a sufficient pressing force can be generated. The size for generating the same pressing force can be further reduced.</p><p id="p-0272" num="0271">Even if there are restrictions on the width, length, thickness, or the like in the implementation of the optical connecting structure, a sufficient pressing force can be generated, and it is possible to provide an optical connecting component and an optical connecting structure that are further reduced in size.</p><p id="p-0273" num="0272">Further, as additional effects, the present configuration exerts two additional effects of an alignment effect in connection faces and a connection holding effect.</p><p id="p-0274" num="0273">Regarding the former, since the opposing connection faces are an N-S pair, for example, if one of the connection components is erroneously inverted when connected, the connection will fail because of confrontment of N-N and S-S as well as repellence acting therebetween. As a result, this brings an additional effect of preventing erroneous connections.</p><p id="p-0275" num="0274">In addition, regarding the former, although detailed positioning is actually performed by the positioning structure, the relative position of the two connection faces that maximizes the attractive force in N-S is uniquely determined by the magnetic force. Therefore, rough positioning can by realized by the magnetic force. In this case, if it is possible to form the external shape and magnetize the component itself very precisely, highly accurate positioning of optical fiber can be performed even when the positioning structure is not present.</p><p id="p-0276" num="0275">Further, regarding the latter, since the position on the plane where the attractive force is maximized is defined in relation to the above, even if an external force is applied after connection in a direction orthogonal to the optical fiber longitudinal direction or in the outer peripheral direction, a reaction force of the magnet acts, and a force for holding a relative positional relationship between the connection faces is larger than that of the ninth embodiment.</p><p id="p-0277" num="0276">Actually, the slip of the connection faces is very small due to the fitting of the guide pins <b>11</b>_<b>41</b>, but when the clearance between the guide pins <b>11</b>_<b>41</b> and the guide holes <b>11</b>_<b>42</b> is, for example, 1 &#x3bc;m, an optical axis deviation between cores after connection corresponding to 1 &#x3bc;m may occur depending on the external force. Therefore, if there is vibration, the connection loss may fluctuate periodically. However, with the present configuration, even when an external force is applied in a direction orthogonal to the optical fiber longitudinal direction or in the outer peripheral direction, a holding/restoring force acts due to the magnetic attractive force, and therefore, it is possible to enhance the stability of the connection.</p><p id="p-0278" num="0277">Similar to the tenth embodiment, an example of 2-division (one N-S pair in one magnetic structure) in the outer peripheral direction may be adopted. Further, any N-S holding structure more than 2-division (a plurality of N-S pairs in one magnetic structure) may also be adopted. For example, 2-division illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b>A</figref> may be adopted.</p><p id="p-0279" num="0278">Further, any combination obtainable from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b>A to <b>22</b>B</figref> may be applied as long as the magnet is divided along the outer peripheral direction of the waveguide core.
