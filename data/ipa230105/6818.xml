Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Homomorphic encryption is a complex technology with compelling benefits, including security and privacy. Homomorphic encryption is a form of encryption that allows users to perform operations on encrypted data without having to decrypt the data. The result of the operations are left in an encrypted form, and when decrypted, the decrypted results provide output that is identical to what would be produced had the operations been performed on the unencrypted data. Implementing systems that leverage homomorphic encryption allow an organization to expand the amount and/or types of information that it will share with and receive from others without compromising privacy or risking a data breach.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Systems and methods for homomorphic encryption-based triggering are disclosed.

In embodiment, a customer may wish to stage future transactions that will execute based on some trigger criteria without letting the financial institution that will execute the transaction know of the details of the transaction until the transaction is triggered to be executed. For example, the customer may not wish to disclose the target (e.g., a stock), a target price, or a trade amount.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Using a web browser or program, the customer may generate and encrypt one or more trigger conditions using the financial institution's public key and may send the encrypted request to a system that has no access to the private key for storage and processing.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The financial institution may use the same public key to encrypt a stream of data, such as stock tickers, and may send the encrypted data to the encrypted trigger processing service. While the trigger and the stream of data remain encrypted, the encrypted trigger processing service may compare the encrypted trigger to the incoming encrypted stream of data until a trigger is met. Then, the encrypted trigger may be provided to a separate system for processing. for example, the encrypted trigger may be decrypted using the corresponding private key and the transaction may then be executed.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Alternatively, the encrypted trigger may be provided to the customer, who may decrypt the encrypted trigger and provide it to the financial institution for execution of the transaction.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a system for homomorphic encryption-based triggering is disclosed according to an embodiment. System <b>100</b> may include customer electronic device <b>110</b>, which may execute computer program <b>115</b>. Customer electronic device <b>110</b> may be any suitable electronic device, including computers (e.g., workstations, desktops, laptops, notebooks, tablets, terminals, etc.), smart devices, automated teller machines, kiosks, Internet of Things devices, etc. Program <b>115</b> may be a web browser, an application, etc. Using program <b>115</b>, a customer may set up a trigger that that is encrypted in the browser using the financial institution's public key before submission to the encrypted processing service.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Program <b>115</b> may interface with backend computer program <b>122</b> executed by backend electronic device <b>120</b>. Backend electronic device <b>120</b> may be any suitable electronic device, including servers (e.g., physical and/or cloud-based), computers, etc.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Backend computer program <b>122</b> may provide a public key for an organization, such as a financial institution, to program <b>115</b>, and may receive encrypted trigger data from program <b>115</b>. It may store the encrypted trigger data in trigger store <b>124</b>, which may be any suitable storage.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Backend computer program <b>122</b> may also receive streaming data from streaming data source <b>130</b>.

An example of streaming data source <b>130</b> is market data.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a method for homomorphic encryption-based triggering is disclosed according to an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In step <b>205</b>, using a computer program on a customer electronic device, a customer or client may select one or more trigger conditions for an event. The trigger condition may be any suitable condition that may be used to cause execution of an action. For example, the one or more trigger conditions may be based on a price (e.g., a price of a security), a change (e.g., a change in value), etc.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In one embodiment, the trigger condition may identify the action to execute when the trigger condition is met.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In another embodiment, the action may be separate from the trigger condition, but may be associated therewith.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In step <b>210</b>, if needed, the computer program on customer electronic device may requests a public key for an organization, such as a financial institution, a FinTech, a broker, etc. from a backend electronic device for the organization.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In step <b>215</b>, the computer program on the customer electronic device may receive the public key from backend computer program. For example, a backend computer program executed by the backend electronic device may return or otherwise make the public key available to the computer program.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In step <b>220</b>, the computer program on the customer electronic device may encrypt the one or more trigger conditions using the public key and may post the encrypted trigger condition(s) to the backend computer program. For example, the computer program on the customer electronic device may send the encrypted trigger condition(s) to the backend computer program, may write them to a distributed ledger, etc.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In one embodiment, the action may also be encrypted with the public key for the organization. In another embodiment, the action may remain unencrypted.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In one embodiment, the backend computer program may store the encrypted trigger conditions(s) and the action (encrypted or unencrypted) in a database. If the action is separate from the encrypted trigger condition, the action may be linked or associated with the encrypted trigger condition.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In step <b>225</b>, the backend computer program may receive streaming data from a streaming data source and may encrypt the streaming data with the public key.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In step <b>230</b>, the backend computer program may compare the encrypted streaming data to the encrypted trigger condition(s). The backend computer program may perform the comparison continuously, periodically, or as desired. Because both the streaming data and the trigger condition(s) are encrypted with the same public key, the backend computer program does not need to decrypt the trigger condition(s) to perform this comparison.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In step <b>235</b>, if the trigger condition is not met, the backend computer program may continue monitoring the encrypted streaming data and comparing the encrypted streaming data to the encrypted trigger condition.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">If the trigger condition is met, in step <b>240</b>, the backend computer program execute the action associated with the trigger condition. If necessary, the backend computer program may decrypt the encrypted trigger condition to identify the action to be executed. In another embodiment, the backend computer program may retrieve the action associated with the encrypted trigger condition and may decrypt the action as necessary. If needed, the backend computer program may also decrypt the encrypted streaming data.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In one embodiment, multi-key homomorphic encryption may be used, and each party (e.g., customer, financial institution, etc.) may encrypt the data using its own public key or the other entity's public key. For example, the customer may encrypt its public key and send it to the organization in its encrypted state, and may also encrypt the trigger condition with its public key and/or with the organization's public key. The organization may encrypt the stream of data with the organization public key.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">An example of multi-key homomorphic encryption using on-the-fly multipart fully homomorphic encryption that introduces an evaluation key with the private and public key is described in eprint.iacr.org/2013/094.pdf, the disclosure of which is incorporated, by reference, in its entirety.
