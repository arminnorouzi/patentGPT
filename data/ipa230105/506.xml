More specifically, the disclosed system and method relate to surgical guides for orthopedic procedures involving an ankle.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Total joint replacement prostheses typically include a specially designed jig or fixture to enable a surgeon to make accurate and precise bone resections in and around the joint being prepared to accept the prosthesis. The ultimate goal with any total joint prosthesis is to approximate the function and structure of the natural, healthy structures that the prosthesis is replacing. Should the prosthesis not be properly attached to the joint, i.e., an ankle or knee, the misalignment could result in discomfort to the patient, gait problems, or degradation of the prosthesis.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Many surgical procedures employ the use of intra-operative fluoroscopy to check the alignment of the intramedullary cavities that are prepared to receive the joint replacement prosthesis. However, the use of intra-operative fluoroscopy in the operating room has several drawbacks. One such drawback is that the use of fluoroscopy to check the alignment of intramedullary cavities formed during surgery increases the overall length of the surgical procedure as time is taken to acquire and evaluate the fluoroscopic images. Long surgery times lead to increased tourniquet time forth patient and therefore may increase recovery time.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Another drawback of fluoroscopy is exposing the patient and others in the operating room to the ionized radiation. For example, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (&#x201c;FDA&#x201d;) has issued several articles and public health advisories concerning the use of the fluoroscopy during surgical procedures. Consequently, even though steps are taken to protect the patient and other from the ionized radiation, it is virtually impossible to eliminate all risk associated with the ionized radiation.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some embodiments, a system includes a cartridge having an elongate body extending from a first end to a second end and having a top side and a bottom side. The cartridge defines a first hole adjacent to the first end that extends through the cartridge from the bottom side to the top side. The top side of the cartridge defines a pair of parallel slots that extend perpendicular with respect to a longitudinal axis of the cartridge. Each slot of the pair of parallel slots is equidistant from a central axis defined by the first hole.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some embodiments, a system includes a first component, a second component, and a third component. The first component has a body defining a first opening. The second component has a body defining a hollow interior and a first side that defines a second opening. The second component is sized and configured to engage the first component such that the second opening aligns with the first opening. The third component has an elongate body extending from a first end to a second end and having a top side and a bottom side. The third component defines a first hole adjacent to the first end that extends through the cartridge from the bottom side to the top side. The third component is sized and configured to be received within the first opening defined by the first component, the second opening defined by the second component, and the hollow interior of the second component when the first and second components are engaged.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, a method includes inserting a second component into a resected joint space located between a first bone and a second bone; coupling a first component to the second component such that a first opening defined by the first component aligns with a second opening defined by the second component; and inserting a third component into the first opening defined by the first component, the second opening defined by the second component, and a hollow interior of the second

description of preferred embodiments is intended to be read in connection with the accompanying drawings, which are to be considered part of the entire written description. The drawing figures are not necessarily to scale and certain features may be shown exaggerated in scale or in somewhat schematic form in the interest of clarity and conciseness. In the description, relative terms such as &#x201c;horizontal,&#x201d; &#x201c;vertical,&#x201d; &#x201c;up,&#x201d; &#x201c;down,&#x201d; &#x201c;top&#x201d; and &#x201c;bottom&#x201d; as well as derivatives thereof (e.g., &#x201c;horizontally,&#x201d; &#x201c;downwardly,&#x201d; &#x201c;upwardly,&#x201d; etc.) should be construed to refer to the orientation as then described or as shown in the drawing figure under discussion. These relative terms are for convenience of description and normally are not intended to require a particular orientation. Terms including &#x201c;inwardly&#x201d; versus &#x201c;outwardly,&#x201d; &#x201c;longitudinal&#x201d; versus &#x201c;lateral&#x201d; and the like are to be interpreted relative to one another or relative to an axis of elongation, or an axis or center of rotation, as appropriate. Terms concerning attachments, coupling and the like, such as &#x201c;connected&#x201d; and &#x201c;interconnected,&#x201d; refer to a relationship wherein structures are secured or attached to one another either directly or indirectly through intervening structures, as well as both movable or rigid attachments or relationships, unless expressly described otherwise. When only a single machine is illustrated, the term &#x201c;machine&#x201d; shall also be taken to include any collection of machines that individually or jointly execute a set (or multiple sets) of instructions to perform any one or more of the methodologies discussed herein. The term &#x201c;operatively connected&#x201d; is such an attachment, coupling or connection that allows the pertinent structures to operate as intended by virtue of that relationship. In the claims, means-plus-function clauses, if used, are intended to cover the structures described, suggested, or rendered obvious by the written description or drawings for performing the recited function, including not only structural equivalents but also equivalent structures.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">The disclosed systems and methods advantageously utilize custom manufactured surgical instruments, guides, and/or fixtures that are based upon a patient's anatomy to reduce the use of fluoroscopy during a surgical procedure. In some instances, the use of fluoroscopy during a surgical procedure may be eliminated altogether. The custom instruments, guides, and/or fixtures are created by imaging a patient's anatomy with a computer tomography scanner (&#x201c;CT&#x201d;), a magnetic resonance imaging machine (&#x201c;MRI&#x201d;), or like medical imaging technology prior to surgery and utilizing these images to create patient-specific instruments, guides, and/or fixtures.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Although the following description of the custom patient-specific instruments are described with respect to a foot <b>10</b> and ankle <b>12</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), one skilled in the art will understand that the systems and methods may be utilized in connection with other joints including, but not limited to, knees, hips, shoulders, and the like. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a typical human foot <b>10</b> includes an ankle joint <b>12</b> formed between a talus <b>14</b>, which is disposed on a calcaneus <b>20</b>, and a tibia <b>16</b> and fibula <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">A CT or MRI scanned image or series of images may be taken of a patient's ankle <b>12</b> (or other joint) and then converted from, e.g., a DICOM image format, to a solid computer model of the ankle including the calcaneus, talus, tibia, navicular, and fibula to determine implant alignment, type, and sizing using specialized modeling methods that are often embodied in computer software. Computer generated solid models that are derived from the data of the CT or MRI scan image will often include precise and accurate information regarding the surface contours surrounding the structures that have been imaged, e.g., the surface topography of the bones or contour of fascia that have been imaged. It will be understood that by surface topography it is meant the location, shape, size and distribution of surface features such as concavities and prominences or the like.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">The methods disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,768,134, issued to Swaelens et al., which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, have been found to yield adequate conversions of data of CT or MRI scan images to solid computer models. In some embodiments, images are made of a foot <b>10</b>, i.e., the calcaneus <b>20</b>, talus <b>14</b>, tibia <b>16</b>, and fibula <b>18</b> of a patient using a CT or MRI machine, or other digital image capturing and processing unit as is understood by one skilled in the art. The image data is processed in a processing unit, after which a model <b>50</b> is generated using the processed digitized image data as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">Interactive processing and preparation of the digitized image data is performed, which includes the manipulation and introduction of additional extrinsic digital information, such as, predefined reference locations <b>52</b> for component positioning and alignment so that adjustments to the surgical site <b>54</b>, that will require resection during surgery, may be planned and mapped onto computer model <b>50</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>). After the interactive processing of the digitized image data, it is possible to go back to original CAD data to obtain a higher resolution digital representation of the patient specific surgical instruments, prostheses, guides, or fixtures so as to add that digital representation to the patient's image data model.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a pair of custom cutting guides for an ankle replacement surgery including a tibial resection guide mount <b>100</b> and a talar resection guide mount <b>102</b>, which are formed and mounted to the patient's lower tibia <b>16</b><i>a </i>and upper talus <b>14</b><i>a</i>. A custom tibial drill guide mount <b>200</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b>-<b>20</b></figref>) is also formed and configured to be received within ankle space created by using the custom tibial and talar resection guide mounts <b>100</b>, <b>102</b>. Although custom cutting guides are described for preparing a patient's talus, tibia, and femur, one skilled in the art will understand that other cutting guides may be implemented and that custom guides may be created for other joints including, but not limited to, the knee, hip, shoulder, or other joint.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">Tibial resection guide mount <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is formed from a resilient polymer material of the type that is suitable for use in connection with stereo lithography, selective laser sintering, or like manufacturing equipment. Resection guide mount <b>100</b> includes a unitary body including a cruciform tibial yolk <b>104</b> projecting upwardly from a base <b>106</b> that further defines a guide receptacle recess <b>108</b> as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. Cruciform yolk <b>104</b> includes a pair of spaced apart arms <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> that project outwardly from a central post <b>114</b>. Arms <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> and central post <b>114</b> each have a conformal bone engaging surface <b>116</b> that is complementary to the contours of a corresponding portion of the patient's lower tibia <b>16</b><i>a </i>as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. Through the previously discussed imaging operations, conformal bone engaging surfaces <b>116</b> of arms <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> and central post <b>114</b> are configured for complementary matching with anatomical surface features of a selected region of the patient's natural bone. For tibial resection guide mount <b>100</b>, the selected bone region comprises the lower surfaces of the patient's tibia <b>16</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>5</b></figref>, a pilot block <b>118</b> projects outwardly from central post <b>114</b>, adjacent to the intersection of arms <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>. A support block <b>120</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) is located on base <b>106</b> in spaced relation to pilot block <b>118</b>. Guide receptacle recess <b>108</b> is defined by a pair of wings <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> that extend outwardly from either side of central post <b>114</b> in opposite directions on base <b>106</b>, with support block <b>120</b> located between them. Each wing <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> includes a respective pylon <b>126</b> projecting outwardly from base <b>106</b> so as to provide lateral support for tibial resection guide <b>132</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>). An elongate slot <b>128</b> is defined transversely in a central portion of base <b>106</b> below pilot block <b>118</b>, but above support block <b>120</b>. Each wing <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> also defines a respective slot <b>130</b> that is oriented at an angle relative to central post <b>114</b>. In some embodiments, slots <b>130</b> are disposed at a non-perpendicular angle relative to central post <b>114</b>, although one skilled in the art will understand that slots <b>130</b> may be disposed at perpendicular angles with respect to the direction in which central post <b>114</b> extends. Slots <b>128</b> and <b>130</b> are sized and shaped to allow a typical surgical saw <b>60</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>) of the type often used for bone resection, to pass through from a correspondingly positioned and sized slot in resection guide <b>132</b> without contact, or with only incidental contact with resection guide mount <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, tibial resection guide <b>132</b> includes a pair of arms <b>134</b> that project downwardly and outwardly in diverging angular relation from the ends of a bridge beam <b>136</b>. The shape of tibial resection guide <b>132</b> is complementary to the shape of guide receptacle recess <b>108</b> as defined by the inwardly facing surfaces of pilot block <b>118</b>, support block <b>120</b>, and pylons <b>126</b>. Bridge beam <b>136</b> defines an elongate slot <b>138</b> that aligns with slot <b>128</b> when tibial resection guide is coupled to and supported by resection guide mount <b>100</b>. Arms <b>134</b> each define a respective slot <b>140</b> that align with a respective slot <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">The inwardly facing surfaces <b>142</b> of pilot block <b>118</b>, support block <b>120</b>, and pylons <b>126</b>, that together define guide receptacle recess <b>108</b>, have a shape that is complementary to the outer profile of tibial resection guide <b>132</b>. Guide receptacle recess <b>108</b> is sized so as to accept tibial resection guide <b>132</b> with a &#x201c;press-fit&#x201d;. By press-fit it should be understood that the inwardly facing surfaces <b>142</b> of pilot block <b>118</b>, support block <b>120</b>, and pylons <b>126</b> are sufficiently resilient to deflect or compress elastically so as to store elastic energy when tibial resection guide <b>132</b> is pushed into guide receptacle recess <b>108</b>.

The trocar can then be removed, and the k-wire lightly tapped further into the calcaneus <b>20</b>. In a representative embodiment, the bushing <b>324</b> measures 6 mm in diameter, and the cannulated trocar can be 6 mm loaded with a 2.4 mm k-wire. The physician can now operate a cannulated first reamer (e.g., 6 mm) (not shown) over the k-wire up into the calcaneus <b>20</b> and talus <b>14</b>.

A convex dome is coupled to the stem and provides an articulating joint surface. A tibial stem may be monolithic or include a plurality of segments that may be coupled together in situ. A tibial platform couples to the tibial stem and either includes or is coupled to a convex joint surface for articulating with the articulating joint surface coupled to the talar/talo-calcaneal stem.
