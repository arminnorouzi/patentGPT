American Football, snowboarding, boxing, skateboarding rugby, etc. Other helmets may be worn for protection in potentially-hazardous situations, for example, construction sites, accident and natural disaster sites, combat, fire-fighting, police actions, riots (riot helmets), etc. In other cases, helmets may be worn to help properly-shape the head of an infant (a cranial orthosis) as he/she grows, such as in the case where a baby is born with a flat spot or other head shape deformity (i.e., positional plagiocephaly), and/or in the case where the cranial plates improperly fuse causing craniosynostosis.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Processes for making helmets, are well known and typically involve the use of a hollow mould into which an expandable material, such as a foam and/or a foam precursor is added. The mould is typically heated up prior to or during the process, and often a vacuum is applied to help expand the foam and/or foam precursor. Various processes are known to make foam items, foam helmets, etc. such as in-moulding, also known as injection-moulding and co-injection moulding steam chest moulding, steam press moulding, etc. For example, in-moulding is well-known in the art of helmet making for combining a hard outer shell with an inner polystyrene shape. Processes are known for adding an outer shell; or a lacquered outer shell, to a styrofoam, polystyrene foam, or other foam helmet. Some processes apply different materials into the mould at the same time (see, for example, US 2015/01137709 A1 to Cheng, published on Apr. 30, 2015, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety) in an in-moulding process, while other traditional processes first form the pieces separately and then affix them together afterwards.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Furthermore, there are various helmet standards worldwide for bicycle helmets, motorcycle helmets, etc. For example, European Uniform Protective Helmet Standard ECE 22.05 (a.k.a., &#x201c;Regulation No. 22&#x201d;) may be found here: http://www.unece.org/trans/main/wp29/wp29regs21-40.html, European CSN Engineering Standard EN 1077 for Helmets for Alpine Skiers and Snowboarders (see: https://www.en-standard.eu/csn-en-1077-helmets-for-alpine-skiers-and-snowboarders/), European CSN Engineering Standard EN 1078 for Helmets for Pedal Cyclists, Skateboarders. and Roller Skates (see: https://www.en-standard.eu/csn-en-1078-al-helmets-for-pedal-cyclists-and-for-users-of-skateboards-and-roller-skates/), European CNS European Engineering Standard EN 1384 for Helmets for Equestrian Activities (see: https://www.en-standard.eu/csn-en-1384-helmets-for-equestrian-activities/), etc. In addition, the US Department of Transportation (DOT) has separate standards such as, for example, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 218 (a.k.a., &#x201c;49 CFR 571.218&#x201d;, &#x201c;FMVSS 218&#x201d;, etc.) related to Motorcycle Helmets (see: https://www.nhtsa.gov/document/tp-218-07pdf). Japanese standards include, for example, JSA JIS 8133-2007 for Protective Helmets for Drivers and Passengers (see: http://www.freestd.us/soft/136571.htm). In addition, additional national standards are known in the art, such as the Australian and Chinese helmet standards. Finally, the Snell Memorial Foundation also issues its own standards, for example, M2010 for motorcycle helmets.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In such tests, a helmet to be tested is typically dropped at a given speed onto a variety of anvils that are used to simulate the impact of the helmet onto different surfaces. For example, a flat anvil mimics the helmet hitting the flat pavement, while a hemispherical anvil or an angled anvil mimics the helmet hitting a curb on the side of the road. They type of anvil, the impact speed/force, duration, etc. are all described in the specific tests described above.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Equipment suitable for testing helmets according to the ECE, EN, and/or JIS tests include, for example, the 1002 MAU 1006/CF/ALU&#x2014;Monorail shock absorption test equipment available from AD Engineering s.r.l., of Bergamo Italy. See, for example: http://www.adengin.it/en/products/2_1002_MAU_1006_CF_ALU__Monorail shock ab.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, it has been increasingly found that the types of impacts in the flat and hemispherical anvils described above are insufficient to adequately account for real-word conditions. Accordingly, there has been an increasing amount of attention being paid to protecting people from oblique impacts. The rationale is that the current testing methods and requirements for flat and hemispherical anvils only represent impacts which occur when the helmet hits the pavement at a 90&#xb0; angle, and when the helmet hits the curb. However, it is increasingly recognized that a majority of impacts occur when the helmet hits the pavement at an oblique angle. Furthermore, it is increasingly recognized that significant injury to soft tissue and spinal vertebrae may be cause by the torque transmitted in such oblique impacts and therefore oblique impacts are a greater threat than previously appreciated.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, a variety of new helmet technologies have being developed to address the dangers of oblique impacts (see, for example, https://www.singletracks.com/blog/mtb-gear/most-of-the-new-helmet-technologies-are-more-alike-than-different/). A recent MIPS (Multi-directional Impact Protection System, see https://mipsprotection.com) helmet includes a low-friction, slightly movable frame/layer between the inner helmet surface and the user's (i.e., the wearer's) head. By allowing a slight slippage of the helmet relative to the user's head at the moment of impact, the MIPS system allegedly provides improved protection against oblique impacts as a reduced force is transmitted to the user. While MIPS is currently the gold standard for oblique impact protection, it is solely-designed for oblique impact protection and does not in-and-of-itself significantly protect against direct vertical impacts.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Bontrager's WaveCel (https://wavecel.trekbikes.com/us/en_US/) is a technology formed of a collapsible open cell structure which allegedly performs better than MIPS, supposedly due to its collapsability. However, these claims are currently disputed by MIPs and other industry players.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Koroyd employs dual-core straw-like material to form crumple-zones in the helmet which protect against various impacts. This technology may be used in combination with MIPS, for example.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Other technologies to achieve a similar effect include the SPIN (Shearing Pad INside) rotational protection system, which attaches silicone gel pads between the inner helmet surface and the user's head. These gel pads allegedly allow the helmet to shear in any direction during an oblique impact, again reducing the impact force transmitted to the user's head. In contrast, the Fluid system by Fox attempts to mimic the properties of cerebral spinal fluid with Fluid pods in the helmet so as to reduce the damage due to oblique impacts.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Kali and Leatt use the Armourgel material, a shock-absorbing smart material which absorbs impact force and also flexes to allow lower transmission of oblique impact force. Kali employs Amourgel to form their LDL (Low Density Layer), which is shaped as strips containing small cups which harden during impact. The 360&#xb0; Turbine technology by Leatt employs small formed blue Amourgel foam discs located at strategic head locations to allegedly allow both cushioning for direct impacts and slippage to reduce the force transmitted to the user in oblique impacts.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">6D Helmet's ODS (Omni-Directional Suspension, see, for example: https://www.6dhelmets.com/innovation/) essentially forms 2 concentric helmets having a suspension layer therebetween. The ODS system allegedly provides the user with both linear as well as oblique impact protection. However, such a system entails significant manufacturing complexity as well as essentially making 2 separate helmets with close tolerances. Accordingly, such a helmet may be expensive, difficult to manufacture, thicker and bulky.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Shred employs strategically-placed discs which allegedly reduce the rotational impact force transmitted to the user in oblique impacts.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">However, the current systems suffer from various disadvantages such as, for example, increased cost, increased raw materials, increased manufacturing complexity, increased weight, complexity, reduced ventilation, reduced flexibility, and/or discomfort. Accordingly, there remains a need for improved helmets and improved helmet-forming processes which address the problems with oblique impacts.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">An embodiment of the present invention relates to an oblique-impact protection technology containing a layer of closed cell foam containing a first surface, a second surface, and a plurality of wells on the first surface. The first surface contains a plurality of first surface apertures and the first surface apertures have a square shape. The second surface is opposite the first surface and optionally contains a plurality of second surface apertures. Each well corresponds to a first surface aperture and the second surface is substantially parallel; or parallel, to the second surface.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">An embodiment of the present invention relates to a helmet containing a oblique-impact protection technology. An embodiment of the present invention relates to a piece of sports equipment comprising the oblique-impact protection technology.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">An embodiment of the present invention relates to a process for manufacturing a helmet by providing a female mould portion, providing a male mould portion, providing an oblique-impact protection technology member containing the oblique-impact protection technology herein, and providing an impact-dissipating material. The male mould portion is complementary to the female mould portion and therefore the female mould portion and the male mould portion are able to be fit together so that they form a hollow mould therebetween. Either before the male mould portion and the female mould portions are fitted together, or after the male mould portion and the female mould portions are fitted together the oblique-impact protection technology member is applied to the male portion. In the manufacturing process, the impact-dissipating material is applied to the hollow mould in the form of a liquid or a plurality of beads; or as a plurality of beads. The oblique-impact protection technology member and the impact-dissipating material are subject to an in-moulding process within the hollow mould. In the process herein the impact dissipating material forms an impact-dissipating member having an impact-dissipating member inner side and an impact-dissipating member outer side opposite from the impact dissipating member inner side. The in-moulding process permanently binds the oblique-impact protection technology member, typically the outer side of the oblique-impact protection technology member, to the impact-dissipating member inner side.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Without intending to be limited by theory, it is believed that the invention herein may reduce potential trauma to the head, spine, skeleton and/or soft tissues by reducing the amount of force and/or torque transmitted to the user's body; or head, during an oblique impact event. Specifically, it is believed that the texture of the first surface containing the plurality of wells allow the layer of closed cell foam to both provide a comfortable fit, as well as allowing side and lateral flexing of the layer. This in turn allows the layer to reduce the rotation and/or torque of the helmet before it transmits the resulting force and/or torque to the user's head. It is also believed that the present invention may provide significant protection from both oblique impacts as well as traditional (i.e., 90&#xb0;) impacts. In addition, it is believed that the invention provides significant; or improved, protection, while simultaneously reducing raw materials, reducing manufacturing complexity, reducing cost, reducing waste, reducing manufacturing time per helmet, improving breathability and/or ventilation for the user, etc. In addition, it is believed that the present oblique-impact protection technology may be extremely flexible in that one skilled in the art may be able to widely-apply it to a variety of helmets, pieces of sports equipment, etc. with little or no additional modifications needed thereto.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a cut-away side view of an embodiment of a helmet, <b>10</b>, according to the present invention;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a partial, top perspective close-up view of an embodiment of the oblique-impact protection technology member,</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a partial, bottom perspective close-up view of an embodiment of the oblique-impact protection technology member;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a partial, top view of the embodiment of the oblique-impact protection technology member of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a partial, side view of the embodiment of the oblique-impact protection technology member of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a partial, side view of the embodiment of the oblique-impact protection technology member; and</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a 450 anvil and related helmet testing.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The figures herein are for illustrative purposes only and are not necessarily drawn to scale.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Unless otherwise specifically provided, all tests herein are conducted at standard conditions which include a room and testing temperature of 25&#xb0; C. sea level (I atm.) pressure, and pH 7, if relevant, and all measurements are made in metric units. Furthermore, all percentages, ratios, etc. herein are by weight, unless specifically indicated otherwise. It is understood that unless otherwise specifically noted, the materials, ingredients, compounds, chemicals, etc. described herein are typically commodity items and/or industry-standard items available from a variety of suppliers worldwide.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Unless otherwise explicitly indicated, as used herein with respect to a helmet, the terms &#x201c;inner&#x201d; and &#x201c;inside&#x201d; indicate a relative position towards the helmet portion which is or would be closer to the wearer's head. Unless otherwise explicitly indicated, as used herein the term &#x201c;outer&#x201d; and &#x201c;external&#x201d; indicate a relative position towards the helmet portion which is or would be closer to the outside of a helmet which is or would be away from the wearer's head.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">An embodiment of the present invention relates to an oblique-impact protection technology containing a layer of closed cell foam containing a first surface, a second surface, and a plurality of wells on the first surface. The first surface contains a plurality of first surface apertures and the first surface apertures have a square shape. The second surface is opposite the first surface and optionally contains a plurality of second surface apertures. Each well corresponds to a first surface aperture and the second surface is substantially parallel; or parallel, to the second surface.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Without intending to be limited by theory, it is believed that the invention herein may reduce potential trauma to the head, spine, skeleton and/or soft tissues by reducing the amount of force and/or torque transmitted to the user's body; or head, during an oblique impact event as well as during a traditional (i.e., 90&#xb0;) impact. Specifically, it is believed that the texture of the first surface containing the plurality of wells allow the layer of closed cell foam to both provide a comfortable fit, as well as allowing side and lateral flexing of the layer. This in turn allows the layer to reduce the rotation and/or torque of the helmet before it transmits the resulting force and/or torque to the user's head.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Furthermore, it is understood that the first surface often is in contact with the user's body; or head, during use. It has been discovered that if the first surface possesses to large of a surface area, then the layer may not significantly reduce the force and/or torque transmitted to the user's body; or head. Accordingly, it is believed that the design of the present invention is optimized such that the first surface gently grips the user's head while the well walls may compress and/or flex so as to absorb some part of the total force from an oblique impact. This is turn is believed to reduce the total amount of force and/or torque transmitted to the user's body; or head during an accident.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The closed cell foam useful herein typically is a blown foam which contains a plurality of closed cells. The closed cell foam typically contains a close cell foam material selected from the group of a foam rubber, a polyurethane foam, a polyethylene foam, an ethylene vinyl acetate foam, a latex foam, a polyvinyl chloride foam, a vinyl nitrile foam, and a combination thereof; or an acrylic polyethylene foam, a polyurethane foam, an ethylene vinyl acetate foam; a polyvinyl chloride foam, a vinyl nitrile foam, and a combination thereof; or a polyurethane foam, a latex foam, a rubber foam, a polyvinyl chloride foam, a vinyl nitrile foam, and a combination thereof; or a vinyl nitrile foam.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The closed cell foam material typically has a melting point from about 60&#xb0; C. to about 250&#xb0; C.; or from about 80&#xb0; C. to about 180&#xb0; C.; or from about 90&#xb0; C. to about 160&#xb0; C. In an embodiment herein, the density of the closed foam material is from about 0.1 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>to about 0.5 g/cm<sup>3</sup>; or from about 0.15 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>to about 0.4 g/cm<sup>3</sup>; or from about 0.175 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>to about 0.35 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. In an embodiment herein, the hardness of the layer is from about 20 to about 85; or from about 25 to about 75; or from about 30 to about 70.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Without intending to be limited by theory, it is believed that such a closed cell foam material temperature range balances desirable properties such as toughness, ability to permanently bond with the other helmet components, comfort, etc. Such materials are well-known in the art of helmet making, insulation, etc. and are available from multiple suppliers worldwide in varying grades and qualities.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In an embodiment herein, the surface area of the first surface aperture is greater than or equal to 25% of the corresponding first surface's surface area or from about 25% to about 95% of the corresponding first surface's surface area; or from about from about 35% to about 90% of the corresponding first surface's surface area; or from about 45% to about 85% of the corresponding first surface's surface area; or from about 50% to about 80% of the corresponding first surface's surface area. As used herein, the surface area of the corresponding first surface and/or the corresponding second surface is calculated as the total surface area, including the surface area of the apertures.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In an embodiment herein, the first surface is substantially parallel; or parallel, to the second surface. Typically the layer thickness is from about 0.5 mm to about 2 cm; or from about 1 mm to about 1.5 cm, or from about 2 mm to about 1.2 cm; or from about 0.3 to about 1 cm, as measured from the first surface to the second surface.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The first surface herein refers to the surface of the layer; or the plane formed by the top-most surface of the layer. In an embodiment herein, the first layer is intended to touch the user's body; or head, and/or to be the surface of the oblique-impact protection technology which is closest to the user's body; or head.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The first surface apertures herein have a square shape, as it is believed that such a shape provides improved benefits as compared to other shapes. Various shapes such as hexagonal, round, etc. were tested and overall it is believed that square shapes proved to be the most acceptable when various factors such as performance, force/torque absorption, comfort, etc. are considered. Without intending to be limited by theory, it is believed that during an oblique impact, the layer flexes and rotates around the user's body; or head, to reduce the force/torque transmitted thereto. In general, it is believed that shapes with corners allow the force to accumulate/concentrate at these locations during an oblique impact. In contrast, while a round first surface aperture shape would in theory avoid concentrating impact force, it was found that using round shapes provided too much surface area in-between the first surface apertures which made the layer uncomfortable and less effective. Furthermore, it is believed that polygons such as hexagonal-shaped apertures contained too many corners (where the force/torque would be concentrated. Accordingly, it is believed that when the first aperture contains a square shape, this provides the optimal balance between, for example, force/torque reduction, comfort, breathability, etc. It is also believed that sharp corners may also unnecessarily concentrate force and therefore in an embodiment herein, the square shape contains a rounded corner; or four rounded corners.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The second surface is typically parallel to the first surface, and may contain a second surface aperture; or a plurality of second surface apertures. In an embodiment herein, the second surface aperture has a shape; or a shape selected from the group of a square, a circle, an oval, and a combination thereof; or a circle or an oval; or a circle.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The layer also contains a plurality of wells in the first surface, and each well corresponds to a first surface aperture. In essence, each first surface aperture forms the mouth of a well. It is believed that the well is very important as a greater proportion of well volume in the layer in turn results in thinner walls which are therefore able to flex and deform more so as to result in less force/torque transmitted to the user's body; or head. Thus, one skilled in the art must balance a greater well volume which results in reduced force/torque transmission, with factors such as comfort, the helmet (or other equipment) feeling secure and not slipping too much during regular use, etc.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In an embodiment herein, the oblique-impact protection technology reduces oblique-impact force/torque transmission by at least 10%; or from about 10% to about 50%; or from about 12% to about 45%; or from about 13% to about 40%, as compared to a similar helmet without the oblique-impact protection technology, as measured by a modified Regulation No. 22 test employing a 45&#xb0; anvil instead of the normal flat and hemispherical anvils.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In an embodiment herein, in addition to reducing the oblique-impact force/torque transmission, the oblique-impact protection technology also reduces impact force transmission by at least 2%; or from about 2% to about 50%; or from about 3% to about 45%; or from about 4% to about 40%, as compared to a similar helmet without the oblique-impact protection technology, as measured by a Regulation No. 22 test employing a flat anvil (i.e., a traditional 90&#xb0; impact), and/or a hemispherical anvil.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The well herein may go partially through the layer, in which case it is characterized as a closed well, or may go all the way through the layer in which case it is characterized as an open well. A closed well will typically possess a well depth of greater than or equal to 25% of the layer thickness; or from about 25% to about 99% of the layer thickness; or from about 35% to about 95% of the layer thickness; or from about 45% to about 90% of the layer thickness. The well depth is measured from the first surface; or the first surface plane, to the well floor, if a well floor is present (i.e., a closed well). Typically the well floor is the point of the well farthest from the first surface; or the first surface plane, as measured perpendicularly from the first surface; or the first surface plane, respectively. In cases where there is no well flor, because the well goes completely through the layer (e.g., the well is an open well), then the well depth is defined as 100%, and is equivalent to the layer thickness.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Therefore, in an embodiment herein, a well in the plurality of wells is a closed well; or at least 25% of the plurality of wells are closed wells; or at least 50% of the plurality of wells are closed wells; or wherein substantially all of the plurality of wells are closed wells; or all of the plurality of wells are closed wells.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the case of an open well, one skilled in the art would understand that the well depth is 100% of the layer thickness as the well forms a passage that goes entirely through the layer. Therefore, in an embodiment containing an open well, the first surface aperture corresponds to a well, and the first surface aperture and/or a well also corresponds to a second surface aperture; in other words, an open well forms a passage that connects a first surface aperture to a corresponding second surface aperture. In an embodiment herein, a well in the plurality of wells is an open well and the well corresponds to a second surface aperture; or at least 25% of the plurality of wells correspond to a second surface aperture; or at least 50% of the plurality of wells correspond to a second surface aperture; or substantially all of the plurality of wells correspond to a second surface aperture; or all of the plurality of wells correspond to a second surface aperture.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In an embodiment herein, a well in the plurality of wells is an open well and the well corresponds to a second surface aperture and thereby forms a passage from the first surface to the second surface; or at least 25% of the plurality of wells corresponds to a second surface aperture and thereby form a plurality of passages from the first surface to the second surface; or wherein at least 50% of the plurality of wells corresponds to a second surface aperture and thereby form a plurality of passages from the first surface to the second surface; or wherein substantially all of the plurality of wells correspond to a second surface aperture and thereby form a plurality of passages from the first surface to the second surface; or wherein all of the plurality of wells correspond to a second surface aperture and thereby form a plurality of passages from the first surface to the second surface from the first surface to the second surface.
