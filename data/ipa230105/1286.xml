system is disclosed for providing array-based games reflecting the performance of participants in sporting events. The array-based games include skill-based games and event bingo games. The skill based games depend on selecting prospective winners that match actual winners based on real events. The event bingo games provide bingo cards with randomized numbers associated with each position on the card. Winning cards are the first cards that match the randomized numbers with another set of randomized numbers to form a game ending patterns of matches. The system includes at least one server having a processor configured to execute machine-readable code. The processor is configured to cause the server to create and provide a set of array-based games to the plurality of presentation devices of the users, which each present the set of games on a respective display, each game of the set having an assigned fixed odds payout. The server receives, over the wide area network, data from the presentation devices of the users. The server updates the event data pertinent to participants in the actual events associated with the array-based games. The server uses the updated data to calculate and assign payoffs to the users based on the fixed payoff odds.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img

Aspects of the invention relate to computer-implemented gaming systems that meet the requirements for class II gaming under 25 C.F.R. &#xa7; 547.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Sports wagering is popular because it increases fan interest and excitement in sporting events. Sports wagering both land-based and internet-based have been established to offer such services and depend on jurisdictional laws.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Sports wagering, however, is not legal in many locations. As a result, other types of activities have been created to increase fan interest and excitement associated with sporting events. As one example, fantasy sports have been created. These activities correlate the performance of players or sets of players involved in actual sports events to a non-wagering entertainment activity.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Skill-based games that allow a player to participate with real money purchases with resulting prizes based on the fan's skill have become popular. Such games allow a fan to engage in a skill where they compete and play against other users. Examples of such skill-based games include games such as, poker and fantasy sports leagues (e.g. baseball, football etc.).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Traditional fantasy sports typically require a significant time commitment and may be difficult for a fan to play casually or quickly. Similarly, legacy sports betting is a standardized model based on money-line spreads, with betting lines on single events or multiple events in combinations and at various prices for various risk level.

The platform <b>152</b> provides an interface between the activity server system <b>150</b> and any platform-specific game application <b>153</b> that is downloaded to the presentation device <b>151</b>. The platform <b>152</b> may perform some or all of the authentication processing and determines if the user meets with a set of compliance criteria to use the platform <b>152</b>. The user downloads a platform specific game application <b>153</b> to the presentation device <b>151</b> from the activity server system <b>150</b>. The platform specific game application <b>153</b> includes hooks, such as API function calls to the platform. Thus, the game application <b>153</b> only operates if authorized by the platform <b>152</b>.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">The compliance criteria may be based upon local or national laws and determining whether the user complies with such laws. For example, the platform <b>152</b> may have access to GPS information, or IP-based location information and may use this information to select the compliance criteria based upon location. Additionally, the age of the user may be pertinent as jurisdictions may have various age requirements. Thus, the platform <b>152</b> interfaces with the presentation device <b>151</b> and extracts information from one or more sources (e.g. GPS data, IP information) or may require the user to enter a password or answer a series of questions to validate the user's identity. Once the platform <b>152</b> determines that the user is an authorized user and one that meets the compliance criteria, the platform <b>152</b> grants access to the application game and allow the application game to either communicate <b>154</b> directly with the activity server system <b>150</b> or communicate <b>155</b> with the activity server system <b>150</b> through the platform <b>152</b>.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">The activity server system <b>150</b> may include one or more servers (e.g., management server <b>24</b>) and may operate in a distributed computing environment. Thus, the functionality performed by the computer-based modules of the activity server system <b>151</b> may be distributed across processors or devices. The presentation device <b>151</b> (e.g., presentation device <b>22</b>) of the user interfaces with one or more computer-based modules of the activity server <b>150</b> through a communications network. The activity server system <b>150</b> receives a request to play a game from the presentation device at an authentication engine <b>156</b> and receives a key that indicates that the platform <b>152</b> has confirmed compliance. The authentication engine <b>156</b> accesses a user's account information module <b>157</b> and obtains the account information for the specified user. The authentication engine <b>156</b> may perform additional authentication based upon data passed from the platform and the user's account information.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">Once the authentication engine <b>156</b> is satisfied, the authentication engine <b>156</b> accesses the gaming engine <b>158</b>. The gaming engine <b>158</b> provides game information (e.g., matchup data, over-under data, graphical images, statistics, etc.) to the game application <b>153</b> on the presentation device <b>151</b>. The gaming engine <b>158</b> is in communication with a suggestion engine <b>159</b>, an image database <b>160</b>, a participant statistics and historical information database <b>161</b>. The gaming engine <b>158</b> gathers this information and formats the information in accordance with a protocol that is recognized and understood by the game application <b>153</b>. The game application <b>153</b> receives the data and incorporates the data into one or more templates for presentation to the user. Additionally, the application program <b>153</b> provides an interface for the transmission of selection data and other game related data to the game engine <b>158</b>.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">The suggestion engine <b>159</b> provides a series of risk units (e.g. matchups, over-unders, toggles) to the game engine <b>158</b> based upon a plurality of factors including: the specific user and his likes and dislikes (e.g., as to teams, particular participants, etc.), a risk assessment engine <b>162</b> determination, and a set of predetermined risk units. The predetermined risk units are determined by an operator, who is knowledgeable about the specific activity or activity of the game, or automatically determined by the suggestion engine <b>159</b> based on various criteria, including statistics and historical data associated with the activity or activity participant and accessed from database <b>161</b>.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">A game tool <b>163</b> is provided to the operator for assisting the operator in his risk unit selections. The tool <b>163</b> may include a graphical interface and accesses participant statistics and historical data in a database <b>161</b>. The operator <b>164</b> determines risk units and stores them in a database <b>165</b>.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">The suggestion engine <b>159</b> communicates with a risk assessment engine <b>162</b>. The risk assessment engine <b>162</b> receives all of the predetermined risk units from the database <b>165</b> and determines whether certain ones should be eliminated based upon a criteria set. As expressed above, the risk assessment engine <b>162</b> may eliminate matchups, over-unders and toggles based upon player injures, or if a determination is made that a matchup is no longer an even match or the predicted score of the over-under is no longer a likely score. The risk assessment engine <b>162</b> may receive data from one or more locations about matchup, toggle and over-under selection by users. If the matchup/toggle selections reach a predetermined percentage in favor of one of the participants, the risk assessment engine <b>162</b> may remove the matchup from the list of possible matchups. If the over-under selections reach a predetermined percentage in favor of going over or under the presented score, the risk assessment engine <b>162</b> may remove the over-under from the list of possible over-unders. The risk assessment engine will operate on single events (projected teams or athletes or other events) or more complex or conditional outcomes. It should be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that other analytical tools may be used for assessing risk and making determinations about which risk units to eliminate from presentation. For example, one may not wish to include two match-ups having players in the same game. Additionally, it should be recognized that the risk assessment engine <b>162</b> continues to operate during the playing of the sports games or other events and can cause the risk units displayed between end-users to change. The risk assessment engine may allow for an operator to respond to the identification of a risk and to take action based on that risk by instructing the activity server <b>150</b> to change the predetermined risk units as stored in data source <b>165</b>. Risk can be identified based upon information, such as a report about an athlete, an injury report, information posted on a news or blog website. The risk assessment engine may include a web-monitoring tool for each player that is part of a risk unit, such that information about the player is collected and represented to an operator. Additionally, the risk assessment engine may be regularly updated based upon award entries. For example, the risk assessment engine may provide a listing of the 10 highest matchups with the greatest risk. The risk could be based simply on an imbalance in sales or on a more complex formula. Additionally, the risk assessment engine <b>162</b> may monitor all of the selections by users and identify if there are imbalances based upon groups of matchups, toggles, and over-unders that show an imbalance in the selected risk units. The risk assessment engine includes a graphical user interface that displays the risk units with the greatest risk and reports on developing news about players where imbalances in selections are occurring. For example, the 30 highest matchups that have the greatest risk may be presented and a news ticker of information about the players in the matchups may be included from either a general web search or by monitoring specific websites (sports-related websites, e.g. ESPN, NBA, MLB etc. or fantasy sports-related websites) for the names of the players in the matchups. Thus, the risk assessment engine allows for monitoring of risk in real-time.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">In embodiments of the invention, the risk assessment engine can be automated based upon threshold values to remove matchups, toggles, or over-unders. For example, there may be a monetary threshold for a matchup that causes the matchup to be removed, such as, a statistical differential in award entries or wagers on one player or team or if more than 80% of the wagers are on one potential event outcome.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">The risk assessment engine <b>162</b> passes the risk units to the selection engine <b>159</b>. The selection engine <b>159</b> may then further eliminate some of the risk units. For example, matchups or over-unders that include a participant from a favored team of the user may be preferred. Similarly, matchups or over-unders that include participants from a team that the user does not like may be given a lower priority. Other factors may be used by the selection engine <b>159</b> in determining the risk units to present as discussed above. The process of determining which risk units should be presented at a higher or lower rate may develop a pruned list of risk units.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">The game engine <b>158</b> then sends the pruned or unpruned list of risk units from the selection engine <b>159</b> along with images of the risk unit participants, statistics of the participants and other data needed by the application game <b>153</b> for providing the intended visual and game experience to the user on the presentation device <b>151</b> through a secure network connection <b>154</b>. For an array game, in some embodiments, the application game <b>153</b> may present an array of position units (e.g. &#x201c;squares&#x201d;) for the application game <b>153</b> for the user to associate each square with one of the pruned matchups or over-unders. In other embodiments, the game engine <b>158</b> uses a random or algorithmic method for selection of the advanced choice games for the entries of the array. In some embodiments, the platform also uses a random or algorithmic method for determining the placement of the selected risk units into the entries of the array. In some embodiments, the platform also uses a random or algorithmic method for determining the placement of the selected risk units into the entries of a ranking array. In some embodiments the platform uses a random number generator to assign numbers to potential winners, and to provide winning numbers to match in event bingo games. The activity server system <b>150</b> may also have an engine which provides chances of a reward winning pattern occurring depending on the set of reward winning patterns. Dependent on the chances of each reward winning pattern occurring, a set of fixed odds payouts for each reward winning pattern may be determined. In some embodiments the fixed odds payout may depend on the potential winners selected. The fixed odds payouts may be determined such that the chance of a non-negative return are unlikely. Promotional payouts may also be determined such that the chance of a non-negative return are more likely than in other embodiments. The engine calculating the chances of a reward winning pattern occurring may take into account the chance of a user or computer selecting a winning selection in each risk unit. While this may typically be 50% where there are 2 potential winners, the activity server may be able determine fixed odds for non-negative return when the risk units do not present 50/50 chances.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">In one embodiment the platform <b>152</b> and the application <b>153</b> are client programs that run locally on the presentation device of the user. The various components of the activity server system can communicate with one another through an Application Programming Interface (API) <b>170</b>. The API <b>170</b> allows for the communication of the game information between the application <b>153</b> and the gaming engine <b>158</b>. Additionally, the API <b>170</b> can be used for supplying both tools such as the matchup &#x26; over-under tool and the risk assessment engine to a presentation device of the operator <b>164</b> in the form a client programs <b>172</b>, so that the operator may remotely monitor and make changes to the game without the need to be directly connected to the activity server system <b>150</b>. The application game <b>153</b> receives this data and incorporates the data into one or more templates for presentation on the display associated with the presentation device <b>151</b>. Communication continues between the game engine <b>158</b> and the application game <b>153</b> until the end of the session.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">The user's selection is saved and stored in a database <b>157</b> associated with the user's account. The game engine <b>158</b> includes a settlement engine <b>171</b> that also determines whether the user has selected one or more winning participants, whether the winning participants are in a row of the tic-tac-toe board, whether winning participants are in a row of a ranking array (and correctly ranked), and whether random number assigned to a user's selection matches an independently chosen random number in event bingo. The game engine <b>158</b> informs the application game <b>153</b> whether the user has won the game based upon the game rules.

The risk assessment engine <b>162</b> may include a set of predefined thresholds or the operator may set a threshold value for each number of picks of potential payout maximums and roster count maximums. In one embodiment of the invention, the risk assessment engine is configured to highlight and present selection groups above a threshold in the graphical user interface with some indicia, such as highlighting the selection group in red. The risk assessment engine may also generate alerts, which can be auditory or may generate an e-mail notification to one or more operators. Depending upon the configuration by the operator, the risk assessment engine may automatically close individual matchups when a threshold level has been met without requiring authorization from an operator. The thresholds may be determined at the discretion of the operator, but will be based at least in part on an expected number of users submitting rosters along with historical information concerning payouts.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the roster selections by user playing the fantasy game or team based game (user roster data) are sent from the presentation device of the user through the network connection <b>154</b> between the application <b>153</b> and the gaming engine <b>158</b>. The data received by the gaming engine will include the ID number for the user, a description of the selected roster including the number of picks, whether the picks include a hedge, and an array of selections for each risk unit within the roster. Thus, the array will include a pointer to the selected athlete in each matchup selected by the user. Additionally, other parameters may be communicated when the roster selections are transmitted by the application <b>152</b> running on the presentation device of the user <b>151</b>, including the location of the presentation device. On a periodic basis or at the request of an operator, the risk assessment engine queries the data store management server <b>167</b> using a database query API to query the data store of user roster selections. The database of the data store <b>168</b> contains all of the currently active user roster selections for all of the users playing the fantasy game. The API query will produce a report to the risk assessment engine. For example, the database query may produce a report that indicates the N-riskiest selections in terms of overall possible payout disparity for matchups or over-unders. Other database searches may be used to provide information concerning risk to the risk assessment engine. The risk assessment engine will receive the results of the database query in the form of a report, such as a data file in a predefined format in conformity with the database API. The risk assessment engine parses the report and compares the entries within the report to a threshold value that has either been preset or set by an operator. For example, the threshold could be based on a percentages of disparity, such as 40% of the users betting on one athlete or team, or the threshold could be in the disparity of the total amount bet, such that a payout that included a matchup may exceed $500,000. Again, other thresholds can be established based upon the risk without deviating from the intended scope of the invention. It should be recognized by one or ordinary skill in the art that the data-base and data management server may operate as part of the activity server system or may be outside of the activity server system. Additionally, the data store management server may periodically push the results of a pre-set number of database queries to the risk assessment engine within the risk assessment engine needing to query the data store management server <b>167</b>.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">In one embodiment of the invention, risk units may be presented on a customized basis to fans. Customization of risk units occurs in the suggestion engine <b>159</b> that takes into account the user's account information and profile data stored in a datastore <b>157</b>. For example, while a plurality of users may be presented with the same card or set of matchups, set of over-unders, or mixed set of matchups and over-unders, the order of how such is presented may be customized. As one example, the first presented matchup may be selected based upon the location of the user or based upon a fan's profile. If the matchups include a matchup involving Drew Brees, fans who are located in Louisiana or identify themselves as New Orleans Saints fans may be presented with a set of matchups where the first matchup is the matchup involving Drew Brees. Thus, the order or configuration of the matchups, over-unders, or mix may vary based upon geographic region, time of year, rankings of players or teams, user's input or profile data or other criteria. In addition, the graphical presentation of the matchups and over-unders may be changed based upon such criteria.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>31</b>A-C</figref> are block diagrams showing the determination of risk used to assign fixed odds payout to matchups and over-unders, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">The challenge for crafting game products from joint and several events is embedded in the idea of a game itself. One category of game that is generally understood is Oskar Morgenstern and John von Neumann's explication of the Prisoner's Dilemma, wherein the games of cooperation, incomplete information, and optimization are characterized by the set of possible outcomes.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">In the prisoner's dilemma the game is assumed to have positive and negative potential outcomes, with the simple version concerning two participants each participant having a potential outcome that may be positive or negative. Each participant experiences an outcome which is based, at least in part, on the performance of the other participant. If both participants exhibit behavior in which each participant cooperates with the other participant they may experience a positive outcome. Similarly, if both participants exhibit behavior in which neither cooperates with the other, one may receive a positive outcome while the other may receive a negative outcome. More generally, in this context the individual participants always have an incentive to choose in a way which creates less than optimal outcome for the participants as a group. The game is assumed to be one cooperation to evade a negative outcome&#x2014;if both participants behave optimally both are successful, if neither cooperates both realize negative outcomes, and two possibilities for partial results of partial cooperation.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">A uniformity of outcomes to either both mutually negative or both mutually positive represent the participants' weighting of their information and the result of the mutual actions. One can treat these as equivalent to market instructions, with a mutual negative decision around a sell game as resulting in a sell decision, and a mutual decision around a buy game resulting in a buy decision.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">In the event of machine learning there exist two categories, supervised and unsupervised learning. Supervised learning uses decision trees, na&#xef;ve Bayesian classification, ordinary least squares regression, logistic regress, support vector machines, and ensemble methods amongst others. Unsupervised learning uses clustering algorithms (such as Eigen vectors), principle component analysis, singular value decomposition, and other tools and methodologies. Both are producing signals that produce expected values where the ratio of &#x201c;true&#x201d; to &#x201c;false&#x201d; is better than random, i.e. has a ratio that is better than the coin toss of 50% probability. While adjusted probability is typically the result of what is called a Bayesian Nash equilibrium, which is not the only form of game production. The expected value can be also represented as a state of the data that may also form the expectation of probabilistic outcome.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152">In such a circumstance the above Prisoners Dilemma becomes a set of high confidence intervals of 0.5 (50%) probabilities and can be represented as an array set for each characteristic or information signal that produces the expected result. As such the reading or a game theory around an event has advanced to a set of statements around the data itself rather than the expected value of cooperation. In such a set, the instructions for the probability are around the &#x201c;memory&#x201d; of the game, i.e. its data being available to calculate, and the calculation instructions themselves.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0153">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>31</b>A and <b>31</b>B</figref>, partial payouts on both buy and sell games are calculated by the platform. Three states of informational results exist in a machine learning game: a buy decision, a sell decision, both starting from a base decision. As such any game therefore be set as being the result of an array set of 0.5 probability sets (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b>B</figref>) as the game in digital format depends on the player deciding whether they agree with the base case.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0154">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b>C</figref>, a game can now be created from any array which the game is executed whereby the probability of outcome is a machine learning based expectation of an equivalent result whereby the game contestant identifies an expectation where they believe the game maker is incorrect in producing a game of (A<sub>NX</sub>), for any array set. Thus the general game is for any and all variation on a game wherein A and X may be of any value of 1 or more, and where A may or may not be equal to X. The commercial value of the game is the ability to predict the required number of contestants for any array at a payout that may be both for single or multiple outcomes and which also produces a risk statement of how stable much the prediction of 0.5 be to maintain the stability of the expected reward.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0155">This relationship can be described as being the organization of &#x201c;tuples&#x201d; various arrangements of X, N in an array such that a central limit theorem relating the expected payout to the contestant can be calculated based on the number of contestants to produce a fixed payout knowable for a statistical level of risk and ordered by a central limit theorem. Such a set involves the conditional performance of the contestant in correctly ascertaining the performance of a real word athlete or athletes or other efforts resulting in a final performance at a measurement of the least means squared adjusted or some other measurement of risk adjusted expected performance. Such a measurement may be in the single incident of an athlete, team, or a real world event. Such an event may be on a continuous polling basis, or in the form of a final polling outcome, i.e. a vote.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0156">Moreover, the form of the X, N can also be conditional in series, such that the array can be arrangements of X, N in series as reflected by [ ]. Such a three dimensional game also offers the same underlying games, where by a computer recursively and heuristically solves for a set of arrays which may also be considered as a machine learning based game for enthusiasts seeking to have a 2&#xd7;2&#xd7;2 game or a 3&#xd7;3&#xd7;3 game, or a 1&#xd7;2&#xd7;3 game. Indeed a the computer process is such that a 1&#xd7;10 game is defined as being a N<sub>1</sub>&#xd7;X<sub>10</sub>&#xd7;{0}game&#x2014;the instance of a the second array is defined as being a null set {0} or &#xd8; game rather than not existing at all.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0157">In all circumstance, the fixed reward for correctly defining the array outcome of N, X can be defined by the necessary levels of customer participation for the reward payout be at an expected level. Rather than the game maker making money from the differential between two reward outcomes based upon the buyer vs. the seller of the reward, the reward payout can be defined as fixed for a previously defined level of customer activity. The revenue model exists in the discount to the reward payout at a discount to the theoretical value of the reward given the predicted required levels of customer activity. Moreover the rewards can themselves be fixed on a progressive basis. Thus while one embodiment may require a 6 out of 6 selection to obtain a reward, fixed odds payouts can be defined for the given levels of player activity for 4 out of 6, 5 out of 6, and 6 out of 6 correct selections.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0158">Various Embodiments of the present invention are implemented at a matchup game having a fixed odds payout. However, not all embodiments of the present invention are limited to such a matchup game. An over-under of an athlete offers similar array presentations for fixed odds payout based on actual performance. An over-under on a set of athletes or teams in a row across (1) and &#xd7; (1 or more) down a column. In this embodiment, the computational system offers fixed odds payout with a single calculable value of all risks and expected outcomes for customer activity on the platform. Other games in embodiments of the present invention (e.g., parlay matchups, tic-tac-toe, ranking array, etc.) can be calculated based on a game algorithm, which is defined as a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations. The rules can be particularly followed by a computational system that defines risk, reward and a further algorithm based on probabilities of liquidity expressed at each transaction for either cash or other reward format (possibly for token, loyalty program, merchandise, or liquidity rebate) that prove to have statistical value on the calculation of reward, risk and liquidity, i.e. customer activity.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0159">The game algorithm exists as a separate mathematical formulation that has been deployed throughout the entire gaming platform. As a result new games are in continuous development based on the premise of the value of fixed odds payout in either matchup or over-under presentment but with single or instances or other formats. For example, when building ranking games, in some embodiments the platform develops ranking games build on top of event choice games, and in other embodiments the platform builds ranking games separately from event choice games.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0160">In embodiments, rewards are available in two forms and can be continuously produced: (1) fixed odds payout with a single reward outcome; and (2) fixed odds payout with multiple reward outcomes.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0161">The platform is data driven, which allows rewards to continuously deploy additional fixed odds payout at the player level for either athletes or teams in each of the games produced above. Moreover, the prizing or rewards can occur in the time interval both prior to the game and during the game itself.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162">The centralizing computational theory of the platform additionally allows multiple application programming interfaces to automatically generate similar games but across multiple events. Any sporting or athletic contest (defined as professional or amateur league or association) can be turned into game inventory. This further included racing formats such as auto or horse racing wherein the jockey and or the trainer are offered as athletes. Last, it includes awards or other reality shows, such as the Oscar, the Tony, the Grammy, the Emmy, the Country Music Awards, or game shows, all of which can be rendered to this game presentment of continuous fixed odds payout.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0163">In sports gaming, three methods may be used to achieve a monetary benefit. First, a margin-based method takes a fee and manages a spread (margin) between buyer's price and seller's price. This method is based on game theory, and sometimes called a double-blind auction. The market-maker, through the platform, manages the prices of a seller's auction that is higher in price than in a buyer's auction. This premise of auction behavior is an essential part of game theory, and includes use cases such as Bayesian Nash price equilibrium. One risk is that to produce liquidity and attract larger wagers, the market-maker may need to act as principal in order to serially locate an offsetting buy or sell order.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0164">Second, a volume-based method takes a percentage of the total volume bet, with losers paying the winners on a pro rata basis from the pool of price entries. This method is called a pari-mutuel or rake system&#x2014;no risk to the manager, but a high number of games at various price points for wagering means the business is highly dependent on marketing spend. Further, the data used by the method cannot be centralized, virtually assuring a direct-to-consumer model and low scalability. This model has been the backbone of horse-racing, poker, and daily fantasy sports.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0165">Third, a margin-and-volume based method offers a fixed odds payout, with a fixed reward that is at the midpoint of predicted sellers and buyers price, but at a discount from the theoretical value expected for the payout on that midpoint for an expected number of players. Such a method is improved and used by the platform in embodiments of the present invention to determine the fixed odds payouts for the advanced choice games. This method uses machine-learning tailored to game theory. Rather than relying on the typical game theory treatment of probability, in this method, embodiments of the present invention reformulate the game theory to states of data as digital signals around the data with reward, risk, and liquidity all having a common centralized limit. Accordingly, for every level of reward and risk, this method calculates the value of that trade-off based on the value of the number of players of the games on a random basis producing a more efficient price. As every player gets the same odds, there is no need to add fractionated pools of liquidity to assure effective marketing. As the games are predictive to the midpoint, there is no need for the market-maker to accept principal risk to assure price. As primary risks of marketing and balance sheet exposure can be controlled, there is no marginal friction between margin and volume in working capital turns, i.e. no marginal OpEx or CapEx necessary to grow the business. In embodiments, the platform relies on the discount to the fair value of the model to determine the fixed odds payout.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0166">Further, when teams are matched to payouts based on handicapped spreads, e.g., Team A at plus X points, the actual bet is on a portfolio of athletes. Fixed odds payouts of embodiments of the present invention are the foundational math for producing a sports book based on teams or other events&#x2014;but using a more efficient pricing model.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0167">In some embodiments of the invention, the platform starts a game by creating a 3D advanced choice game as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref>. In on embodiment the 3D advanced choice game has 27 risk units <b>2805</b> in a cube <b>2801</b>. In this embodiment each risk unit is a 3D block, and not the 2D surface of such block. However, in some embodiments each risk unit is the surface of a block. The cube <b>2801</b> has possible outcomes marked as 0, 0.5, and 1. The platform then determines, for a given game probability of 50%/50%, a reward for a winning pattern and a level of volume necessary for the theoretical value reward to be equal to the input as shown in cube <b>2810</b>. In some embodiments the platform determines whether each risk unit in a game has a unique 50/50 chance. If one risk unit is the over-under on a player of team A and another risk unit is the over-under of the entire team A, the two may be linked such that the chance of success of picking over on both is higher than the 25% chance of picking two true 50/50s. In such a case, the two risk units would not each have a unique 50/50 chance. The platform would then adjust the risk units in a game to ensure the risk units are all true 50/50s. Alternatively, the platform may adjust the prizes to account for the adjusted chances of success due to non-unique risk units.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0168">In some embodiments of the invention, a game can have more than two outcomes while still providing what we call here a 50% game probability. Consider, for example, a game having four potential outcomes. Ideally, the probability of each outcome would be 25%, but the ideal situation does not always prevail. With a game having four potential outcomes, the platform determines a margin of error associated with such platform's estimation of a 25% probability for any given outcome. For such game to have a 50/50 game probability, the margin for error, of the platform's estimation of each outcome's success, must straddle 25% equally in each direction. In some embodiments the game probability is not 50/50, and thus the platform calculates the rewards based on the percentage chance each potential winner will be an actual winner. In one embodiment the platform would base the fixed odds payout after the potential winner is selected. In another embodiment the platform would base the fixed odds payout on the outcome having highest chance of being the winning outcome. For any game and number of potential winners, the platform can calculate the probability of any number of given outcomes to determine the likelihood of a winning pattern being selected. From these likelihoods the platform further calculates the accompanying fixed odds rewards. By adjusting the fixed odds rewards and chances of winning (e.g. by changing the winning pattern) the platform can determine a projected payout percentage. In different embodiments the projected payout percentage is associated with a level of volume of sales of the game, sometimes referred to as liquidity.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0169">To aid in the game operator's generating a profit from sales of the game, it is advantageous to find a balance which allows the game to payout a specific amount of rewards that both delivers profit and keeps user interest. For example, a game that paid out 70% of entrance fees would, in theory, be bought less by users than a game which paid out 98% of the entrance fees. However, the game offering 98% would need to sell 15 times more tickets to average a greater profit. The platform can derive a fixed odds payout that maximizes profits by varying the percentage payout of fees expected to be paid as fixed odds rewards.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0170">Further, the operator may wish to limit the chances of a non-negative return. For any game based on chance, there is a chance that the odds will fall out of the operator's favor and more money will be paid out than taken in. There are two significant factors in reducing the chances of a non-negative return. First, the percentage payout, and second, the volume of sales. Since a higher volume of sales decreases the chance of a non-negative return, it allows the operator to offer higher percentage payouts, which increases user participation.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0171">The platform does not have full control over the volume of sales, and thus uses volume of sales data to appropriately adjust the percentage payout to maximize profit for the game. In some embodiments, the platform collects user data and increases payouts to specific users based on their likelihood of winning, past participation, or other data features. The platform may also adjust the payouts universally.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0172"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b></figref> shows how the platform may derivate the 3&#xd7;3&#xd7;3 cube game <b>2901</b> into a 2&#xd7;2&#xd7;2 cube game <b>2910</b> or a 3&#xd7;3 array <b>2920</b>. The platform simplifies the original game <b>2901</b> into the derivative forms <b>2910</b>, <b>2920</b> which may be less complicated to pay and understand how to win. These games may be further characterized based on the winning patterns selected by the platform. For example, 3&#xd7;3 array <b>2920</b> may be broken down into Tic-Tac-Toe, Squares, and X's and O's. The games <b>2901</b>, <b>2910</b>, and <b>2920</b> may be further characterized as games of skill, class II games, or games of chance. A game of skill allows the customer to select a projected winner from the risk units. The class II games provide a bingo element to the games. In these games of chance the computer to generates the projected winner selections. The selections may be of a matchup (2 or 3), Over-Under, and toggle.

For any selected entry that is a toggle, the user selects which of the second activity participants to pair against the first activity participant in the toggle matchup. For any selected entry that is an over-under, the user selects whether the actual score will be over or under the presented score. The user then ranks each square in the row from 1 . . . N, indicating how the user expects the matchup or over-under associated with that square to perform with respect to the matchups or over-unders associated with each other square in the row, multiple rows, or the entire array. In some embodiments, the platform uses a random or algorithmic method for selection of the advanced choice games for the entries of ranking array. In some embodiments, the platform also uses a random or algorithmic method for determining the placement of the selected advanced choice games into the entries of the ranking array.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0186">In some embodiments, risk units are selected prior to the activity participants participating in the corresponding event (e.g., playing in a professional sporting event or other events). The set of risk units and the corresponding participants is referred to as &#x201c;user roster data&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0187">In some embodiments, these skilled-based games may be created based on single team performance projections associated with their game components, such as matchups, over-unders, toggles of a selected advanced choice game, such that these games are created for individual teams by mathematically calculating the portfolio of participants based on single participant prediction and statistical optimization. In some embodiments, these games may also be created based on single participant performance projections by prediction and statistical optimization of the scores of such participant.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0188">The outcomes of the matchups may be determined with reference to the first and second participants' actual performance in one or more actual sports events or other events according to a predetermined scoring criterion. In one embodiment, the first or second participant(s) with better statistics in predetermined, weighted, statistical categories (e.g., a better fantasy sports score) in the one or more actual sporting event(s) may be determined as the &#x201c;winner&#x201d; of each matchup. In various embodiments the fantasy score is related to an event choice, an event ranking, and an event choice and ranking. These fantasy score matchups may be developed as array-based games. In some embodiments, the winners of the matchups may be compared to the user's picks.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0189">The outcome of the over-unders may be determined with reference to the participants' actual score in one or more actual sports events or other events. In one embodiment, the predetermined, weighted, statistical categories (e.g., a fantasy sports score) may be determined as the participants' actual score compared to the user's pick of over or under the score presented to the user.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0190">In a straight matchup, toggle, over-under, or mixed game, if the user has made a sufficient number of winning picks, then the user may be declared to be a winner of the activity. In the tic-tac-toe game, if the user made winning picks that form a sufficient number of rows, columns, or diagonals, then the user may be declared a winner of the activity. In the ranked array game, if the user made a sufficient number of winning picks and/or rankings of the winning picks, then the user may be declared to be a winner of the activity.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0191">Accordingly, embodiments require a fixed odds payout table and each user has an opportunity to win against the system. The fixed odd payout table indicates varying fixed odds payouts based on the number of matchups/over-unders selected, etc. This is in contrast to other games, such as pari-mutuel games, where users play against other users and payouts are based upon the amount of money that users associate with their selections. The payout may be based on a fantasy-based scoring which is &#x201c;performance based scoring&#x201d; and in the context of teams the scoring may include points scored as presented within these unique games and on the system that scores both participants and teams through a single risk management system.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0192">When the user is a winner of a game, the user may be awarded a reward according to a fixed odds payout table, which may be predetermined fixed odds, dynamic fixed odds, fixed odds progressive, and dynamic fixed odds progressive. For dynamic fixed odds and dynamic fixed odds progressive payouts, the system may dynamically price the payouts using techniques selected from the group consisting of AI, machine learning and, other algorithmic data analysis of reward, risk, volume, and total risk, and combinations thereof. Each of these payout types is also captured and monitored by the risk assessment system.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0193">In some embodiments, the user may win a fixed odds payout as a cash award or other fixed reward for correctly picking actual winners, or for correctly picking a predetermined number of actual winners (e.g., for getting close). The awards may vary depending on the number of actual winners selected. In another example, the user may win such a fixed odds payout for correctly picking actual winners that form a row, column, or diagonal in a tic-tac-toe board. The fixed odds payout may vary depending on the number of rows, columns, and diagonals formed by the actual winners selected. In a further example, the user may win such a fixed odds payout for correctly picking and ranking actual winners in a row of an array. The award may be progressive, such that winning all matchups in row wins a reward, and progressively higher rewards are given based on the number of those matchups are correctly ranked within the row.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0194">The use of fixed odds payout games is a pronounced innovation over prior art because it reduces the complexity of multiple sports (or other events) and multiple teams and multiple athletes to single application of the game as a user interface across multiple clients. Accordingly, in these embodiments, events can be virtualized, i.e., turned into a game. In these embodiments, the consumer, perhaps the audience, a spectator, or a fan is presented with an objective expectation of rewards with a single set of rules for each game no matter what the athlete, team or sport. In the case that the fantasy sports examples used herein are used as aspects of the user interface, in these embodiments, the performance scoring of the particular event may be based on the reduction of the performance data to an application programming interface and then used to score the new games described herein. The fixed odds payout simplifies the performance expectations to concrete expectation of reward based on the calculations of the event result. Further, in some embodiments, the platform's production of a new class of games (further described herein) take all events and reduce them to a single expected prizing format and is able to evaluate the variable and fixed risks based on projected event scoring, discount to the theoretical value based on total entries and the basis risk of those entries. Such prizing format is completely unlike &#x201c;Totes&#x201d; or pari-mutuel where the odds of success depend on the actual vs advertised rewards. Creating a finality of the expectation at the time of reward entry radically, in these embodiments, changes the idea of the value of the event as a prizing tool for fan or audience engagement.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0195"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b></figref> shows a ranking array screen layout in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The user is presented with a set of three risk units, 1, 2, and 3, with potential &#x201c;winners&#x201d; 1A and 1B, 2A and 2B, and 3A and 3B, respectively. The user first makes a selection of &#x201c;winners&#x201d; and then ranks the choices based on the difference in the performance between the winning and losing choices. For example, if 1, 2, and 3 are matchups and the &#x201c;winner&#x201d; is based on winning score, then the winning ranking would rank the matchups from highest difference in fantasy point to lowest difference in fantasy points between the winning and losing scores. For the ranking game shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b></figref>, the user-selected winners are compared to the actual winners, and the actual ranking of winners based on the actual differences in the performance between winning and losing choices, as determined by actual events.

A winning pattern for this array occurs when winners are correctly selected corresponding to position in the N&#xd7;M matrix that form an YxZ square, where Y&#x3c;N and Z&#x3c;M. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> provides a 2D embodiment of &#x201c;squares,&#x201d; formed from a square array of 3&#xd7;3 positions, for which the winning pattern occurs when any of four possible 2&#xd7;2 squares are correctly associated with winners. In other embodiments, as discussed below, squares may be a 3D game. A first such square <b>610</b> is shown in light gray with a dotted line border, and a second such square <b>620</b> is shown in dark gray with a dashed line border. The remaining potential winning 2&#xd7;2 squares, at the upper right and lower left of the 3&#xd7;3 square are not specifically illustrated. Because the central 1&#xd7;1 square is required in order to form a 2&#xd7;2 pattern, a consolation prize may be given for users that correctly select four or more positions that do not form a square.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0196">Array games similar to &#x201c;squares&#x201d; can be formed with other geometric objects. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> shows a &#x201c;triangles&#x201d; game formed with 2&#xd7;2&#xd7;2 equilateral triangles within a 3&#xd7;3&#xd7;3 equilateral triangle.

In this embodiment, each game has a reward specified as fixed odds, progressive fixed odds, variable fixed odds, and variable progressive fixed odds. In game I of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b></figref> a ranking game of four players is shown in a 1&#xd7;4 array. Game II depicts a sample selection of over-unders. Each over-under combines two of the 4 participants A, B, C, and D. A user may then select over or under for the set lines of each pair of participants. In this embodiment of four participants, there are six over-unders to choose from. In some embodiments the payouts are based on fixed odds for a certain number of correct selections. In one embodiment the user selects how many correct selections they will make, and get a fixed odds payout based on that number, granting higher payouts for more successful picks.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0203"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b></figref> game III shows a matchup of two participants versus another two participants. For 4 participants there are three matchups. In some embodiments each participant may be weighted differently in different matchups. In another embodiment each participant has a different criteria for achieving a certain fantasy score from matchup to matchup. Game IV is a ranking game based off of game III allowing each of the groups of participants to be ranked by how much they beat the other group by. In some embodiments the platform calculates the chances of each selection relating to each other (for example, if participant A has a very high fantasy score, it is likely that the groups having participant A will all win) and calculates the fixed odds payouts based on these relations.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0204">In embodiments of games shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b></figref>, the fantasy scores of participants A, B, C, and D are based off of a qualification and a time. For example, a participant requires a certain amount of time of riding a bull to qualify for a score, and then the score is based off the time ridden above said qualifying time.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0205">In an embodiment the game a number of contestants are entered and after a qualification event, a further over-under is selected. A reward winning pattern may be found for users who correctly select qualifying participants and make winning selections in the following over-under. In one embodiment of a rodeo based game the wager selects three rider/bull pairs and an over-under on each pair. The over-under may be based on the rider's score or the combined rider and bull score. A user wins if they correctly select at least 2 riders who make their eight.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0206">The user would receive higher payouts for selecting three riders who make their 8. The user may then get a higher payout for each over-under they correctly select. In one embodiment a user who pays one unit will receive 5 units if two of their 3 riders make the 8. If said user selected three riders who made their 8 that user would receive 15 units if they selected 0 over-unders correct; 40 units for selecting one over-under correct, 85 units for selecting two over-unders correct, and 350 units for selection all three over-unders correct. In this embodiment the platform has calculated the odds based upon an approximate &#x2159; probability that any rider will make their 8, an approximate &#xbd; probability of selecting a correct over-under, and a probabilistic return of 9.97%. The platform can adjust the fixed odds payout schedule based on changes in any of these numbers.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0207">In some embodiments, such as the fixed odds payout schedule above, the payouts are of relatively large orders of magnitude, e.g. 350:1. Therefore, it is advantageous in these embodiments to have a large number of wagers, e.g. 1,000 to obtain reasonable downside protection.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0208">In other embodiments, the game may not require over-under selections. Instead, the user selects N riders, and receives a fixed odds payout based on the number of selected riders who make the eight.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0209">In other embodiments, the game may require the user to select two riders to make the eight and respective over-unders. This embodiment may require at least one of the riders to make the eight to receive a prize, but offer less payouts than selection two out of three.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">Event Bingo Games</heading><p id="p-0211" num="0210">Class II games under 25 C.F.R. &#xa7; 547 provide popular Native American gaming activities. Predominant in this category are games based on bingo cards, i.e. a random number output in an array format. Event bingo games integrate a component based on fantasy sports scoring with various random number generation and random event generation schemes. Event bingo games provide added excitement for sport's fan and gaming enthusiasts while maintaining compatibility with the technical requirements of class II games.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0211">Any array choice game can be configured as an event bingo game by computer processes involving random number generation (RNG) and random event generation (REG). As for the skill based games previously discussed, each array, or &#x201c;bingo card&#x201d; is associated with a set of geometrically confined positions, each position further being associated with a risk unit, and each risk unit being associated with a set of potential winners. A key difference between the pure skill based games and the event bingo games is that each potential winner is further associated with a set of random numbers, determined by RNG. In some embodiments, events can also be randomly generated by a process of REG.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0212">As summarized in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, for preferred embodiments, the activity server system prepares an event selection schedule <b>300</b>. Based on that schedule, a risk inventory <b>310</b> is provided for the user, based on the user's profile, or on random selection processes, or on a combination of the two. Risk units are selected from the risk inventory for placement in an array <b>320</b> by the user or by the activity server system, depending on the type of game. Each selected risk unit is then assigned to exactly one position in the array, with exactly one risk unit per position, by the user or by the activity server system, depending on the type of game. Each potential winner of each selected risk unit is assigned a random number. The pool of random numbers available to each potential winner does not overlap with any other potential winner. A projected winner is then determined for each risk unit. In some embodiments the projected winner for each risk unit is selected by the user. In some embodiments the projected winner is randomly selected by the computer. Winning selections are determined by matching the projected winners to actual winners as determined by real events. When it is determined that the projected winner is an actual winner, that position of the array is marked, i.e. covered by the electronically generated RNG. Rewards may be awarded to the users to have a preset pattern or amount of marks. In some embodiments, additional prizes may be awarded based on matching of winners with patterns, such as a reward winning pattern, or on matching some number of winners and random numbers.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0213">In some such embodiments, as summarized in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the computer generates a risk inventory based on customer profiles, which include predicted customer preferences (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>13</b></figref>). Such preferences may be determined by algorithmic or machine learning processes based on user history, geographical information or on user-provided preferences for athletes, teams, horses, trainers, and the like.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0214">Based on these preferences, in some embodiments the computer builds an array and selects projected winners within the array (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>).

In step <b>700</b> primary random numbers are associated with array positions. There are a set of groups of numbers which are assigned to a potential winner of a risk unit. The numbers may be in three or more groups for a toggle event or other three or more way event. In step <b>710</b> a user or the activity server may select a projected winner for each risk unit. The user may select the projected winner based on a skill or knowledge that the user has. The activity server may select the projected winner randomly. When the projected winner is selected in step <b>715</b> a number from a group of numbers associated with said projected winner is assigned to the same array position as the projected winner. In step <b>720</b> a prized set (often referred to as interim prize) are determined by the correct selections of a real event. In some embodiments the event is a sports game, awards show, political race, random number generator, or other event. In step <b>725</b>, the array positions where the projected winner is the actual winner are marked. A mark may be a virtual or physical marking. In step <b>735</b>, a Bingo game is played such that secondary random numbers are generated as winning numbers. These secondary random numbers are matched against the random numbers associated with the events in the card set. If the secondary random numbers match those associated with the events in the card set, the position is daubed. The secondary random numbers may only be matched against numbers associated actual winners. In step <b>740</b>, the bingo card that is makes a game ending pattern of daubs is considered the winning bingo card. In some embodiments, the secondary random numbers may be redrawn a plurality of times to provide at least one winner. In other embodiments the secondary random numbers may be redrawn until each bingo card having a reward winning pattern of marks also has a game ending pattern of daubs. In some embodiments, once a winning bingo card is determined the game is over. Further rewards, sometimes called continuation or bonus prizes or awards, may be assigned for entries associated with correctly selected patterns based on the game type regardless of achieving the game ending pattern associated with the bingo RNG. In step <b>745</b>, rewards are awarded to the bingo card having the game ending pattern. These rewards may be money, tokens, discounts, nominal, and any other prize. Once rewards for the winning bingo cards are doled out, bingo cards that have a reward winning pattern from step <b>730</b> are paid out in step <b>750</b>. In some embodiments this may be redundant, as each card with a reward winning pattern will have a game ending pattern, thus the reward may be the same for both. The reward for the reward winning pattern is a fixed odds payout which the activity server determines. The activity server may calculate all the possible winning patterns and associate different or identical fixed odds for each pattern such that the odds of a payout are at a specified value.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0217">A specific embodiment of a general process for building and matching an event bingo card is described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b>-<b>23</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref> exemplifies how a 3&#xd7;3 bingo card is built and matched. Initially, the bingo card <b>545</b> is built where each position on the card is associated with a specific risk unit, selected randomly, or based on specific customer preferences. Each risk unit has a pool of random number selections associated therewith. The bingo card <b>550</b> has a random number from each group of random number selections selected. The bingo card <b>555</b> then has a risk unit associated with each array position and thus each potential winner has a unique random number associated therewith.</p><p id="p-0219" num="0218">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref> the bingo card <b>560</b> is played by the user or activity server by selecting a projected winner for each risk unit on the bingo card. Therefore, each array position now has a single random number associated therewith as shown on card <b>565</b>.</p><p id="p-0220" num="0219">As the events take place, the actual winners are determined and the played bingo card is compared with the actual winners and the bingo card is marked where the projected winner is the actual winner. A first pattern may be a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line being three units long. In this case, the bingo card has achieved a first pattern having a diagonal line from the top left to the bottom right of the card. In some embodiments this first pattern may have a specific fixed odds payout associated with it, which would pay out based on how much the user paid for the bingo card. In some embodiments only the cards containing the first pattern may move onto a second game. In other embodiments both cards having a first pattern and those without a first pattern may move onto a second game. In other embodiments cards not having a first pattern will move onto a second game. In some embodiments there may be different requirements to move onto the second game e.g. having a specified number of marks.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0220">The second game is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>. The second game may run in parallel with the first game or at a different time, such as right after the last actual event takes place. In card <b>570</b>, each array position has a secondary number assigned to it. In some embodiments where the numbers may be assigned not in order, the secondary numbers may be drawn without an assigned array position. In some embodiments, when a user or the activity server makes a selection of a projected winner, a random number from the pool of number associated with that projected winner is assigned to that space. In other embodiments, for each bingo card a random number from each pool of numbers associated with a potential winner is assigned to the array section before the projected winner is chosen. The secondary numbers shown in card <b>570</b> are then compared to the primary number <b>575</b>. In some embodiments only primary numbers associated with winning selections are compared. The primary and secondary numbers are then compared as shown on card <b>575</b> to determine if a Bingo card has a game ending pattern and is thus, a winning Bingo card. The winning bingo card may be the first bingo card to obtain a game ending pattern. If there is no game ending pattern such as shown in card a new set of secondary numbers may be chosen, or a new game ending pattern may be chosen. The game ending pattern in the second game may be different than the reward winning pattern in the first game. Once a bingo card is known to have a game ending pattern the game is ended and prizes are awarded. Prizes may or may not be given out for having the game ending pattern for the second game. In some embodiments prizes are given out for reward winning patterns.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0221"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref> provides a flow chart outlining an exemplary embodiment of a process for determining a winning bingo card. The process is designed to ensure that, for each game with more than one player, there is a winning bingo card. If the number of entries is less than one, then the entry is canceled and the user has her money refunded. If the number of entries is greater than one, then the activity server detects how many entries have the first pattern. If the number of entries with the first pattern on their bingo cards is also greater than one, then secondary random numbers are generated. The first bingo card to match the game ending pattern with their daubed array sections is declared the winning bingo card. If no bingo card provides the game ending pattern of daubed array sections, then secondary random numbers are again generated until a game ending pattern of daubed array sections is obtained. In some embodiments the secondary random numbers are again generated until each entrant having a reward winning pattern has a game ending pattern. In further embodiments, the secondary random numbers are generated until each random number associated with each risk unit has been selected, thereby all permutations of correctly selected reward winning patterns have a game ending pattern. In an even further embodiment the reward winning pattern is the same as the game ending pattern.</p><p id="p-0223" num="0222">If on the other hand no card has a pattern of daubs that matches the game-ending pattern, then a new game ending pattern is generated and checked for a game ending pattern of winning matches. This process continues until a game ending pattern of winning matches is found. For example, the original game ending pattern may be a line of three, but if no card has a pattern that matches a line of three, the system would instead look for a line of two. Once the game ending pattern of matches is found, then secondary random numbers are generated as described above until a winning bingo card is obtained.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0223">Once the game has ended, the prizes are awarded. In some embodiments prizes are awarded for achieving the first pattern, the game ending pattern, the reward winning pattern, and other patterns. Small consolation prizes may also be awarded, e.g. for obtaining a given pattern of matches or a given number of winning selections.</p><p id="p-0225" num="0224">In various embodiments prizes are awarded by applying a random number generator to correctly selected risk units, until each correctly selected risk unit associated with the event is matched with a correct random number generator of the prize ending pattern. This can be run in sequence or also run randomly. Such prizes are interim, continuation, consolation and bonus prizes. In some embodiments, the potential winners do not have a common prize set, such as the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b></figref>. In these embodiments the fixed odds payout would be given to the user based on the selections made.</p><p id="p-0226" num="0225"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref> shows a game ending pattern of having two neighboring daubs. There are 16 different ways to arrive at this simple game ending pattern. In another embodiment the game ending pattern is 2 daubs that do not need to be adjacent.</p><p id="p-0227" num="0226">Numerous variations and modifications based on the determination of daubs and marks will be apparent to those skilled in the art. All such variations and modifications are intended to be within the scope of the present invention as defined in any appended claims.</p><p id="p-0228" num="0227">Among such variations, are slot-machine type games, which involve purely random choices made by the computer, where the user interacts with the slot machine to initiate the random choices (e.g. by pulling a lever), which institutes random processes of array generation and random selection as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref>. Similarly to matching the potential winners to a pool of numbers in the array, the slot machine may have a set of reel possibilities related to each potential winner. The reel possibilities may overlap with each potential winner. When the actual winner is determined the slot machine may generate a random reel possibility for the actual winner. In some embodiments the reel may look like a 3&#xd7;3 array such as the one showed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref>. Each row may be classified as A, B, or C. Each array section may display <b>1</b> reel possibilities and payout based on having a set of a particular reel possibility appear in the row. Each array section may determine an actual winner from a different event or some array sections may determine the actual winner from the same game. The activity server may decide payouts based on the possibilities of a winning set of reel possibilities appearing.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
