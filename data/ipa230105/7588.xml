Larger bandwidth, shorter latency and/or operation of antenna array (e.g., beam) are some aspects of 5G leading to high power consumption. Therefore, mechanisms to save power are under development in 3GPP.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">A power saving signal can be used to configure and/or adapt power consumption of a UE. A power saving signal may be associated with one or more power saving techniques. For example, a power saving signal can be used to turn-on or turn-off one or more power saving techniques associated with the power saving signal. If a power saving technique can be adjusted with a plurality of power consumption levels (e.g., turn-on and turn-off can be considered as a special case of two levels), a power saving signal associated with the power saving technique can indicate which operation (or technique) with which level is to be applied, performed and/or conducted by the UE. In an example, a power saving technique may be wake up operation and a power saving signal may be used to wake up a UE (and/or to indicate to and/or instruct the UE to go to sleep). Another example of power saving technique is cross-slot scheduling. Cross-slot scheduling with different minimum values of scheduling delay may result in different levels of UE power saving and/or different levels of UE power consumption. In an example, a scheduling delay with minimum value 0 slot could consume the most power, a scheduling delay with minimum value 1 slot could consume medium power and a scheduling delay with minimum value 2 slot could consume the least power. A power saving signal may indicate to the UE a minimum value the UE should apply and/or assume. Power consumption characteristics associated with power saving techniques may be applied based on one or more indications in the power saving signal. Accordingly, power consumption of a UE may be adjusted and/or regulated using a power saving signal. There are several discussions regarding how a power saving signal could be indicated from a base station to a UE. For example, a Downlink Control Information (DCI) (e.g., one DCI) may indicate a power saving signal for a UE and/or a group of UEs. A DCI (e.g., one DCI) may be divided into several portions and/or fields wherein a UE could read and apply a corresponding portion and/or field of the DCI (associated with the UE). The power saving signal may be carried on a scheduling DCI, with addition of one or more new fields and/or modifications of interpretation of one or more existing fields. The power saving signal could be carried on a DCI for power saving purpose. A UE may read power saving related information from a DCI for power saving purpose. A UE may not read other information from a DCI for power saving purpose. More details regarding power saving signal and its corresponding design could be found in R1#96bis RANI Chairman's note and R1#97 RANI Chairman's note.

Under the framework of DRX, Active Time may be defined and/or counted by a UE. A UE may be required and/or configured to monitor PDCCH during Active Time. Outside Active Time, such as during in-active time and/or non-active time, a UE may not monitor PDCCH so that power could be saved. Several timers and/or procedures are developed, which allow UE to determine and/or realize when Active Time is, (e.g., for various purposes such as at least one of initial traffic, bursty traffic, retransmission, random access, receiving an uplink grant, etc. More details of DRX may be found in the following quotation from 3GPP TS 38.321 V15.6.0:</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">5.7 Discontinuous Reception (DRX)</heading><p id="p-0079" num="0165">The MAC entity may be configured by RRC with a DRX functionality that controls the UE's PDCCH monitoring activity for the MAC entity's C-RNTI, CS-RNTI, INT-RNTI, SFI-RNTI, SP-CSI-RNTI, TPC-PUCCH-RNTI, TPC-PUSCH-RNTI, and TPC-SRS-RNTI.

A UE may send a scheduling request (SR) to a base station. The scheduling request may be sent via a physical uplink control channel (PUCCH) and/or via a random access procedure. Responsive to the scheduling request, the base station may send an uplink grant to the UE. The UE may send a buffer status report (BSR) to the base station with the uplink grant. The buffer status report may inform the base station of an amount of uplink data to be transmitted. For example, the UE may send a buffer status report if there is still uplink data left which could not be accommodated in the uplink grant. The base station may determine and/or realize how to schedule uplink data with the assistance of a buffer status report.

Some of them, e.g., handover and/or PDCCH, may be initiated by a base station. Some of them, e.g., beam failure, uplink data arrival, system information (SI) request, connection (re-)establishment, etc. may be initiated by a UE. The random access procedure may be categorized into two types: contention based and non-contention based. A contention based random access procedure involves four steps (Msg<b>1</b>&#x2dc;Msg<b>4</b>). Msg<b>1</b> of contention based random access procedure is selected from a group of preambles shared by a plurality of UEs, so Msg<b>3</b> with UE identity information is required to identify the UE and a contention resolution (Msg<b>4</b>) is used to complete the random access procedure. A non-contention based random access procedure involves two steps (Msg<b>1</b>&#x2dc;Msg<b>2</b>) (e.g., there could be another step Msg <b>0</b> to initiate the procedure). Msgl of non-contention based random access procedure is dedicated to a UE in one or more allocated Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH) resources. Thus, Msg<b>1</b> in a non-contention based random access procedure may be sufficient to identify a UE and a Msg<b>2</b> may be used to complete the non-contention based random access procedure.

Physical control information may comprise several types (e.g., scheduling information, a command from a base station, slot format related information, etc. A UE may not be able to predict whether there is a PDCCH (e.g., a PDCCH for scheduling data) from a base station to the UE. Therefore, the UE may have to monitor PDCCH in some occasions (e.g., monitoring occasions) indicated by the base station. For example, a UE may try to decode a plurality of PDCCH candidates. PDCCH in a slot may or may not comprise a PDCCH for the UE. This is known as PDCCH blind decoding. UE blindly decodes and/or checks a plurality of resources with a plurality of DCI formats. Once PDCCH for the UE is detected, the UE may take corresponding action accordingly (e.g., perform data-related processing if the detected PDCCH carrying scheduling information). To perform such blind decoding or searching, the number of candidates and/or the type of candidates that could be decoded by a UE within a duration may be subject to some constraints (e.g., a UE capability of the UE). For example, a number of PDCCH candidates that may be decoded by a UE in a slot is limited. The limitation could depend on a numerology and/or a subcarrier spacing. Slot length itself may depend on numerology and/or subcarrier spacing. A number of non-overlapping Control Channel Elements (CCE) may also be limited since the number of non-overlapping CCEs corresponds to a number of channel estimations to be performed by a UE. The number of channel estimations to be performed in one slot could be proportional to a UE's complexity. Another example of limitation is a number of DCI sizes to be decoded in one slot. If the number of DCI sizes to be decoded in one slot exceeds a certain threshold, the UE may align sizes of different DCI formats to fit within such limitation. A number of control resource set (CORESET) and/or a number of search space in a given bandwidth part (BWP) are limited, e.g. 3 CORESETs per BWP and 10 search spaces or 10 search space sets per BWP.

In some embodiments, the power saving signal is for a group of UEs (e.g., multiple UEs comprising the UE). The power saving signal may be carried on a group common PDCCH. In some embodiments, the PDCCH (e.g., the group common PDCCH) is not a scheduling Downlink Control Information (DCI).

Alternatively and/or additionally, if the Active Time is due to a scheduling request or contention based random access (e.g., if the Active Time is initiated due to the scheduling request and/or the contention based random access), a base station may not be aware of the Active Time (e.g., the base station may not be aware of the Active Time of the UE during at least some of the Active Time, such as in the beginning of the Active time during which the base station does not receive a scheduling request). Accordingly, the base station may not determine and/or realize the conflict of the UE (e.g., the conflict between monitoring PDCCH for the power saving signal and monitoring PDCCH for other types of signals and/or information other than the power saving signal). The base station may not be able to resolve the conflict (such as due to the base station not determining and/or realizing the conflict). In some embodiments, the conflict may arise as a result of monitoring PDCCH for the power saving signal and monitoring PDCCH for other types of signals and/or information exceeding a UE capability of the UE (e.g., a UE capability for PDCCH monitoring). For example, the UE may not be able to perform both monitoring PDCCH for the power saving signal and monitoring PDCCH for the other types of signals and/or information. For example, a total quantity of PDCCH candidates in a slot for both the power saving signal and one or more other types of PDCCH (e.g., a scheduling DCI and/or one or more other types of PDCCH) may exceed a quantity of PDCCH candidates that can be monitored by the UE (e.g., the UE capability of the UE may correspond to the quantity of PDCCH candidates that can be monitored by the UE). Alternatively and/or additionally, a total quantity of non-overlapped Control Channel Elements (CCE) in a slot for both the power saving signal and the one or more other types of PDCCH may exceed a maximum value of non-overlapped CCEs (such as corresponding to the UE capability of the UE). Alternatively and/or additionally, a total quantity of DCI format sizes in a slot for both the power saving signal and the one or more other types of PDCCH may exceed a maximum value of DCI format sizes (such as corresponding to the UE capability of the UE). Alternatively and/or additionally, Transmission Configuration Indication (TCI) states or beams for both the power saving signal and the one or more other types of PDCCH may not be monitored simultaneously and/or concurrently (e.g., the UE may not be capable of monitoring (and/or configured to monitor) TCI states or beams for both the power saving signal and the one or more other types of PDCCH simultaneously and/or concurrently). Alternatively and/or additionally, a total quantity of CORESETs to be monitored for both the power saving signal and the one or more other types of PDCCH may exceed a maximum value of CORESETs (such as corresponding to the UE capability of the UE). Alternatively and/or additionally, a total quantity of search spaces to be monitored for both the power saving signal and the one or more other types of PDCCH may exceed a maximum value of search spaces (such as corresponding to the UE capability of the UE). Alternatively and/or additionally, overlapping and/or conflict between Active Time and at least some of the one or more monitoring occasions for the power saving signal corresponds to continuous data traffic. In some embodiments where there is continuous data traffic from a last DRX ON duration (e.g., a previous and/or most recent DRX ON duration), one or more DRX timers (e.g., at least one of DRX inactivity timer, DRX retransmission timer, etc.) may be running such that there is Active Time for the UE after the last DRX ON duration. The Active Time may cover and/or span across at least some of the one or more monitoring occasions of the power saving signal (e.g., the power saving signal indicating the offset to a DRX ON duration, such as a next DRX ON duration). In some embodiments, a difference between continuous data traffic (and/or contiguous data traffic) and uplink data arrival is that the base station may realize and/or determine that there is continuous data traffic (and/or contiguous data traffic) (e.g., whereas the base station may not be able to realize and/or determine that there is uplink data arrival and/or Active Time of the UE due to uplink data arrival). Accordingly, a base station may resolve a conflict associated with one or more monitoring occasions for the power saving signal and/or Active Time that is due to continuous data traffic (and/or contiguous data traffic).</p><p id="p-0122" num="0310">A first general concept of the present disclosure is that a UE may not monitor a PDCCH for a power saving signal in one or more monitoring occasions if the one or more monitoring occasions are within Active Time.

In an example where the one or more specific values, the one or more default values and/or the one or more default assumptions indicate that the UE should wake up, the UE may wake up if the UE skips monitoring a power saving signal that indicates to (and/or instructs) the UE to wake up or not to wake up. One or more criteria may be used to determine the one or more specific values, the one or more default values and/or the one or more default assumptions (and/or to select the one or more specific values, the one or more default values and/or the one or more default assumptions).</p><p id="p-0124" num="0312">A third general concept of the present disclosure is that a base station may instruct (and/or indicate to) a UE not to monitor one or more monitoring occasions for one or more power saving signals.
