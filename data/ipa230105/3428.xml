A sensor is positioned and configured to measure a value associated with the refrigerant in the condenser or the evaporator, and a controller is communicatively coupled to the compressor and the sensor. The controller determines, based on an operational history the compressor, that pre-requisite criteria are satisfied for entering a sensor validation mode. The prerequisite criteria include a requirement that the compressor has been inactive for at least a minimum time. In response to determining the pre-requisite criteria are satisfied, an initial sensor measurement value is determined. Following determining the initial sensor measurement value, the compressor is operated according to a sensor-validation mode. Operating according to the sensor-validation mode involves operating the compressor at a maximum recommended capacity. Following operating the compressor according to the sensor-validation mode for at least a minimum time, a current sensor measurement value is determined. The controller determines whether validation criteria are satisfied for the current sensor value, based on a comparison of the current sensor measurement value to the initial sensor measurement value. In response to determining that the validation criteria are satisfied, the controller determines that the sensor is validated.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">HVAC systems may include sensors for monitoring system performance and detecting system faults. For example, sensors may be positioned to measure a saturated suction temperature (or a corresponding saturated suction pressure) and a suction temperature of a refrigerant associated with an evaporator. This information may be used to determine a superheat value, the temperature difference between the temperature of the superheated vapor refrigerant and the saturation temperature of the refrigerant flowing through an evaporator of an HVAC system. As another example, sensors may be positioned to measure a saturated liquid temperature (or a corresponding saturated liquid pressure) and a liquid temperature of refrigerant associated with a compressor. This information may be used to determine a subcool value, or the temperature difference between the saturation temperature of the refrigerant and the temperature of the subcooled liquid refrigerant flowing through a condenser coil of an HVAC system. The superheat and/or subcool values may be used to detect a loss of charge in an HVAC system and/or diagnose other system faults. Sensors, such as those described above, may be relied upon to detect system faults and take appropriate corrective actions. However, there is generally a lack of tools for detecting problems associated with these sensors and reliably validating their operation and the reliability of their measurements.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The unconventional HVAC system and sensor validation approach described in this disclosure solves problems of previous technology by facilitating more efficient and reliable sensor validation than was possible using previous technology. The systems and sensor validation approach may be particularly effective for HVAC systems with complex configurations (e.g., with intertwined condenser coil configurations). This disclosure further encompasses the recognition that it may be difficult or impossible to validate sensor measurements in systems with multiple compressor circuits and/or in systems employing intertwined coils (e.g., in the condenser and/or evaporator). In some embodiments, multi-level validation checks are performed to further confirm sensor validation such that both false positive and false negative sensor failures are decreased. Certain embodiments may include none, some, or all of the above technical advantages. One or more other technical advantages may be readily apparent to one skilled in the art from the figures, descriptions, and claims included herein.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">For a more complete understanding of the present disclosure, reference is now made to the following description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram of an example HVAC system configured for sensor validation;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is a diagram of an example condenser of the HVAC system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> is a diagram of an example evaporator of the HVAC system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref></p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-C</figref> are diagrams of different coil configurations of the evaporator and/or condenser of the HVAC system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating an example method of validating one or more sensors of the HVAC system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>; and</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a diagram of the controller of the example HVAC system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Embodiments of the present disclosure and its advantages are best understood by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> through <b>5</b></figref> of the drawings, like numerals being used for like and corresponding parts of the various drawings.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">As used in the present disclosure, a &#x201c;saturated liquid&#x201d; refers to a fluid in the liquid state that is in thermodynamic equilibrium with the vapor state of the fluid for a given pressure. A &#x201c;saturated liquid&#x201d; is said to be at the saturation temperature for a given pressure. If the temperature of a saturated liquid is increased above the saturation temperature, the saturated liquid generally begins to vaporize. A &#x201c;superheated vapor&#x201d; refers to a fluid in the vapor state that is heated to a temperature that is greater than the saturation temperature of the fluid at a given pressure. A &#x201c;subcooled liquid&#x201d; refers to a fluid in the liquid state that is cooled below the saturation temperature of the fluid at a given pressure.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">One metric of an HVAC system's operating conditions is the ratio of the cubic feet per meter (CFM) of conditioned air being supplied to a space to the tonnage of cooling performed by the system (i.e., or the &#x201c;CFM/ton&#x201d; measure of the system). The flow rate of air provided by a blower is generally measured in units of cubic feet per minute (CFM). The tonnage of the HVAC system corresponds to the cooling capacity of the system, where one &#x201c;ton&#x201d; of cooling corresponds to 12000 Btu/hr. The tonnage of the HVAC system is largely determined by the speed of the compressor(s) of the system, such that a decreased compressor speed corresponds to a decreased tonnage. The relationship between compressor speed and system tonnage may be approximately linear. Accordingly, the CFM/ton value of an HVAC system may be controlled by adjusting the flow rate of air provided by the blower and/or the speed of the compressor(s). For example, at a constant air flow rate from the blower, the speed of a variable-speed compressor may be decreased, to increase the CFM/ton value of the HVAC system.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">As described above, prior to the present disclosure, there was a lack of tools for effectively and reliably validating sensors of an HVAC system. As such sensor errors may have gone unreported, resulting in poor efficiency and possible damage to the HVAC system or components thereof. This disclosure particularly encompasses the recognition that one or more particular criteria (i.e., pre-validation criteria) should be met before sensor validation is performed. For example, sensor validation may only be performed after the HVAC system has been de-energized for at least a minimum time. The use of these, and other such, pre-validation criteria ensures that the results of any test(s) used to validate one or more sensors are repeatable and reliable. In some cases, the pre-validation criteria may instead require that the compression circuit for which one or more sensors are being validated was inactive for at least a minimum time. Certain alternative or additional pre-validation criteria (e.g., a criteria that there is a cooling demand) improve system efficiency but limiting the number of validation tests, which generally involve cooling actions of the HVAC system, to times when cooling is actually needed. As demonstrated in various embodiments described herein, this disclosure further encompasses the unique recognition that a multi-tiered validation process may be especially effective at identifying actual sensor errors, thereby limiting false positive identification of errors and the resulting cost and down-time associated with subsequent maintenance or other intervention.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">HVAC System</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of an embodiment of an HVAC system <b>100</b> configured to facilitate effective sensor validation.

Method <b>400</b> may begin at step <b>402</b> where the controller <b>160</b> determines whether one or more of the pre-requisite criteria <b>162</b> are met for entering a sensor validation mode. The sensor validation criteria are generally related to the operational history of the HVAC system <b>100</b> and may include a requirement that the compressor <b>106</b><i>a,b </i>has been inactive for at least a minimum time. The minimum time may correspond to a minimum idle time of at least about 5 minutes to 30 minutes. In an embodiment, the minimum time is at least 15 min. For an HVAC system <b>100</b> that includes an evaporator <b>124</b><i>a,b </i>that is an intertwined evaporator coil (e.g., as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>), all compressors <b>106</b><i>a,b </i>must be inactive for the minimum time in order for the criteria to be met at step <b>402</b>. This prevents any inconsistencies in sensor measurements caused by cooling between the coils in the intertwined evaporator configuration. Generally, for other evaporator coil types (e.g., for face-split configuration <b>302</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>) the pre-requisite criteria <b>162</b> may be that at least the compressor(s) <b>106</b><i>a,b </i>corresponding to the circuit of the sensor(s) <b>114</b><i>a,b, </i><b>118</b><i>a,b, </i><b>132</b><i>a,b, </i><b>136</b><i>a,b </i>being validated is not active for the minimum time.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some embodiments, additional or secondary pre-requisite criteria <b>162</b> are included to further improve the efficiency and/or reliability of the validation of method <b>400</b>. For instance, a secondary pre-requisite criteria <b>162</b> may indicate that there is a cooling demand in the space being conditioned by the HVAC system <b>100</b>. This may prevent a waste of energy when the system <b>100</b> is operated according to the sensor-validation mode (i.e., when one or more of the compressors <b>106</b><i>a,b </i>are operated at high capacity). In this way, in cooling achieved during the validation is not wasted. This results in improved overall operating efficiency of the HVAC system <b>100</b>. Another example of a secondary pre-requisite criteria <b>162</b> is a requirement that the current time is an off-peak time (e.g., a time when people are not expected to be in the space being conditioned by the HVAC system <b>100</b>) such that comfort is not sacrificed during sensor validation. For example, sensor validation may only be conducted between midnight and 4 am. Yet further examples of secondary pre-requisite criteria <b>162</b> are requirements that the outdoor air temp (e.g., measured with sensor <b>152</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) is greater than 55&#xb0; F. and/or that both an outdoor air temperature sensor <b>152</b> and a return air temperature sensor <b>150</b> are operating properly (e.g., providing measurements within expected temperature ranges).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some cases, the pre-requisite criteria <b>162</b> may take into account whether previous validations have already been attempted and failed for a given sensor <b>114</b><i>a,b, </i><b>118</b><i>a,b, </i><b>132</b><i>a,b, </i><b>136</b><i>a,b </i>or corresponding compressor circuit. For instance, a criteria <b>162</b> may indicate that a sensor-validation mode can only be entered as long as there are less than a threshold number of previous failed validation attempts (e.g., less than two failed validations) since the previous passed validation for the sensor(s) <b>114</b><i>a,b, </i><b>118</b><i>a,b, </i><b>132</b><i>a,b, </i><b>136</b><i>a,b. </i>In some cases, a further criteria <b>162</b> may include a requirement that the HVAC system <b>100</b> has no dehumidification demand before entering a sensor-validation mode. If the criteria <b>162</b> are not met at step <b>402</b>, the controller <b>160</b> generally waits some time interval before repeating step <b>402</b> to check whether conditions have changed and the criteria <b>162</b> are satisfied at step <b>402</b>.
