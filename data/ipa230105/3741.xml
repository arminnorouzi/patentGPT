Particularly, the invention in embodiments thereof relates to the use of urinary biomarkers for non-invasive evaluation of the level of inflammation.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The biological response of body tissues to injury, infection or irritation is typically characterized by inflammation, an innate immune reaction in which a cascade of cellular and microvascular events serves to eradicate the infection, remove damaged tissue and generate new tissue. During this process, elevated permeability in microvessels allows neutrophils and mononuclear cells to leave the intravascular compartment, and perform various anti-microbial activities to eradicate the injury. Inflammation can be characterized as local or systemic, and as acute or chronic, depending on its specific etiology and course.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Sepsis is a clinical syndrome that complicates severe infection, which is characterized by a dysregulated, systemic inflammation, and may progress to increasingly severe tissue injury, organ failure and death. Septic shock is a severe form of sepsis, with significantly increased mortality due to increased abnormalities of circulation and/or cellular metabolism. Early recognition and treatment of sepsis is key to improved survival, as the source of infection, which is most often bacterial, should be controlled as early as possible.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The concept of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), defined by certain abnormalities of vital signs and laboratory results, has been introduced in 1992, to define a clinical response to a non-specific insult, wherein SIRS accompanied by a documented or presumed infection has been defined as sepsis. However, SIRS criteria have been found to lack sensitivity and specificity for increased mortality risk, which is the main consideration for using such a conceptual model. Blood levels of certain cytokines and acute phase proteins (APPs), and in particular C-reactive protein (CRP), are also used to evaluate the level of systemic inflammation.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">APPs are plasma proteins, the synthesis and the circulating concentrations of which are adaptively regulated in response to most forms of inflammation, infection and tissue injury. The acute-phase response is considered part of the innate immune system, and APPs play a role in mediating such systemic effects as fever, leukocytosis, increased cortisol, decreased thyroxine, decreased serum iron, and many others. APPs can be categorized as positive (increasing serum concentration, e.g. CRP, complement factors, serum amyloid A and ferritin) or negative (decreasing serum concentration, e.g. albumin, transferrin, and transthyretin).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The development of methods for assessing inflammatory load in a subject, comprising immunoassays that examine protein marker levels in blood samples, is an ongoing effort, and various diagnostic assays are under development.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">WO 2019/027910 suggests an adjusted multi-biomarker disease activity score for inflammatory disease assessment, in particular in rheumatoid arthritis. Specifically, provided are methods for assessing response to inflammatory disease therapy. The methods include performing immunoassays to generate scores based on quantitative data for expression of inflammatory biomarkers to assess disease activity in an inflammatory disease such as rheumatoid arthritis.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">U.S. Pat. No. 9,200,324 is directed to biomarkers useful for diagnosing and assessing inflammatory disease, in particular rheumatoid arthritis, along with kits for measuring their expression. Also provided are predictive models based on the biomarkers, as well as computer systems, and software embodiments of the models for scoring and optionally classifying samples.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">EP 1836493 relates to a method for assigning a therapy regimen and/or assigning a prognosis to a subject diagnosed with or suspected of suffering from SIRS, sepsis, severe sepsis, septic shock, or MODS, comprising: performing an assay method on a sample from said subject that provides one or more detectable signals related to the presence or amount of one or more subject-derived markers, and correlating the signal(s) obtained from said assay method to ruling in or out a therapy regimen for said subject and/or assigning a prognosis to said subject. In particular, the publication discloses the evaluation of various panels of blood markers.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Ashkenazi-Hoffnung et al. 2018 (Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis. Jul;37(7):1361-1371) discloses a host-protein signature for differentiating between bacterial and viral disease in patients with respiratory infection and fever without source, based on a combining of three blood proteins: tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), interferon gamma induced protein-10 (IP-10), and C-reactive protein (CRP). US 2017/0269081 relates to a method of determining an infection type in a subject comprising measuring the concentration of a first determinant selected from a first group of determinants and a second determinant selected from a second group of determinants in a sample derived from the subject, wherein said concentration is indicative of the infection type. In particular, the publication discloses the identification of expression profiles of multiple determinants measured in blood serum samples, including TRAIL, IP-10 and CRP.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Urinary biomarkers have also been investigated for diagnostic applications, especially to detect or evaluate renal injury or disease. For example, US 2015/0038595 relates to methods and compositions for diagnosis and prognosis of renal injury and renal failure, and Rodriguez-Ortiz et al., (2018, Sci Rep 8(1): 15940) relates to urinary biomarkers for chronic kidney disease. Certain urinary proteins were also evaluated as markers in the context of infective diseases, for example in EP 2711710, Jortani et al. (2004, J Clin Lab Anal.;18(6):289-95), Denz et al. (1990, Klin Wochenschr. Feb 15;68(4):218-22), and Whetton et al. (2020, J Proteome Res acs.jproteome.0c00326). Evaluation of urinary proteins as potential biomarkers in neonates has been reported, for example, by Reisinger et al. (PLoS One 9.3 (2014)), suggesting urinary SAA as a marker in differentiating severe necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) from moderate NEC in neonates, particularly if combined with serum platelet count. The significance of these findings outside of the context of neonate NEC and the functionally immature neonate kidney is unclear.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">However, despite the need for developing simple and non-invasive diagnostic assays, there is currently no test for assessment of inflammation based on the identification of urinary proteins in adult subjects in clinical practice. In particular, the levels of blood proteins, including those proposed as biomarkers for inflammatory conditions, do not correlate closely with their levels in urine. This may be attributed to processes such as glomerular filtration and tubular absorption in the mature kidney, responsible for restricting the release of most plasma proteins into the blood.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">There remains an unmet need for a noninvasive and rapid methods, for ascertaining the level of systemic inflammation in a subject. The ability to determine treatment urgency and immediately treat patients with the urgent need for therapy, as well as to determine the therapeutic efficiency during treatment, by simple assays suitable for self-use, would be highly advantageous.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The invention provides assays and methods for detecting and monitoring systemic inflammation. Particularly, the invention in embodiments thereof relates to the use of urinary biomarkers for early and non-invasive determination of the grade or intensity of inflammation, and for evaluation of risks associated therewith.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The invention is based, in part, on the surprising discovery of unique proteomic signatures based on measurements of protein biomarkers in the urine, determined to be unexpectedly effective for evaluating systemic inflammation. Surprisingly, as demonstrated herein, diagnostic markers and classifiers were developed, capable of identifying severe systemic inflammation. Further, as demonstrated herein, highly predictive models were constructed, capable of assessing the level of systemic inflammation not only in high-grade severe cases, but also in patients exhibiting signs of mild and moderate inflammation. In contradistinction, it was found that other proteins hitherto used or suggested as blood markers, including tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and CXCL10 (IP-10), are not appropriate for use as urinary markers.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The invention is further based, in part, on the discovery that certain gene products are present in urine samples in the form of endogenous peptides, rather than as full-length polypeptides that may be found in other samples such as blood.

The subject according to the methods of the invention is typically a human subject. According to some embodiments, the subject is at least two years of age, or in other embodiments an adult human subject.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0106">According to embodiments of the invention, the methods and assays as disclosed herein may be used for detecting, quantifying or monitoring systemic inflammation in subjects diagnosed or afflicted with various conditions that may be associated with inflammation. In one embodiment, the subject is afflicted with an infection. In other embodiments, the subject may be afflicted with a non-infective inflammatory condition. For example, the subject may be afflicted with (or suspected of having) an autoimmune disease, a rheumatic disease, or a chronic inflammatory disease. In another embodiment the subject is afflicted with cancer.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0107">In various embodiments, the infection may be a bacterial, viral or parasitic, wherein each possibility represents a separate embodiment of the invention. For example, without limitation, the subject may be afflicted with a bacterial or viral infection selected from the group consisting of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, measles, parainfluenza bronchitis, upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), lower respiratory tract infection, rash, varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection, sternitis, peritonitis, pneumonia, <i>rickettsia </i>infection, cellulitis, folliculitis, diverticulitis, colitis, dental infection, bacterial endocarditis, myositis, bacteremia, ascending cholangitis, abscess (e.g. abdominal, liver, lung or perianal abscess), bacterial pharyngitis, cholecystitis, (e.g. gangrenous cholecystitis), empyema, osteomyelitis, parotitis, viral infections associated with asthma exacerbation, bronchitis, dengue infection, herpes zoster infection, infectious mononucleosis, influenza, meningitis, and combinations thereof. In other exemplary embodiments, the subject may be afflicted with a bacterial or viral infection selected from the group consisting of EBV infection, CMV infection, measles, parainfluenza bronchitis, URTI, lower respiratory tract infection, rash, VZV infection, sternitis, peritonitis, pneumonia, <i>rickettsia </i>infection, cellulitis, folliculitis, diverticulitis, colitis, dental infection, bacterial endocarditis, myositis, bacteremia, ascending cholangitis, abscess, bacterial pharyngitis, cholecystitis, empyema, osteomyelitis, parotitis, bronchitis, dengue infection, herpes zoster infection, infectious mononucleosis, influenza, meningitis, and combinations thereof.

In yet other embodiments, the subject is not afflicted with an infection as disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0108">In another embodiment the condition is an autoimmune disease, in which the subject's immune system attacks the subject's own tissue. Exemplary autoimmune diseases include but are not limited to multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), myasthenia gravis, and inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's and ulcerative colitis). These conditions are typically mediated by an auto-immune inflammatory response characterized by the presence of host-specific antibodies and/or T cells, which correlates with the disease severity.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0109">In another embodiment the conditions include rheumatic diseases, which are inflammatory joint diseases. Inflammatory joint diseases refer to damage or partial or complete destruction to any part of one or more joints, including the connective tissue and cartilage, where damage includes structural and/or functional damage of any cause and is characterized by inflammation in the joint, and may or may not cause joint pain (arthalgia). In one example, the inflammatory joint damage is caused by arthritis, such as, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, or psoriatic arthritis.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0110">In another embodiment, said disorder is a chronic inflammatory disease. A chronic inflammatory disease is characterized by a persistent inflammatory response with pathologic sequelae. This state is typically accompanied by infiltration of mononuclear cells, proliferation of fibroblasts and small blood vessels, increased connective tissue, and tissue destruction. Non-limitative examples include idiopathic or non-infective chronic conditions, e.g. pericarditis or periodontitis.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0111">In other embodiments the condition is a neoplastic disorder (cancer). In various embodiments, the cancer is selected from glioma, leukemia, uterine cancer, lymphoma, neuroblastomas, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, clear cell renal carcinoma, colorectal, lung, and breast tumors, and melanoma. In such conditions, the subject may be prone to developing infections due to chemotherapy, irradiation or other immune-suppressive treatments or to manifest inflammatory symptoms due to other immune-modulating treatments. For example, immunotherapy (e.g. by CAR T cells) or immunostimulatory treatments may be associated with the development of cytokine release syndrome (CRS).</p><p id="p-0083" num="0112">In some embodiments, the subject is not afflicted with renal injury or disease, e.g. chronic kidney disease. In some embodiments the subject is not afflicted with (or has not been diagnosed as having) urinary tract infection. In other embodiments, the subject is not presented with leukocyturia.

In other particular embodiments, the subject is not diagnosed with, or suspected of having, tuberculosis or necrotizing enterocolitis. In another particular embodiment, the subject is not diagnosed with, or suspected of having, COVID-19. In yet another embodiment, said subject is afflicted with, or suspected of having, COVID-19. Each possibility represents a separate embodiment of the invention.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0113">The urine sample to be used in embodiments of the invention is obtained or collected from the subject as is known in the art. Typically, the urine sample is obtained non-invasively, as disclosed herein. In one embodiment, the urine sample is a voided urine sample. In a particular embodiment the sample is collected from the subject without a preceding step of bladder scraping or washing. In another embodiment, the method further comprises the step of freezing the urine sample obtained and thawing the sample prior to the step of determining the levels of gene products. Conveniently, urine samples may be kept at &#x2212;20&#xb0; C. or &#x2212;80&#xb0; C. until the analysis is performed. Yet in other embodiments the invention relates to rapid diagnostic and prognostic methods, in which the sample is assayed within hours (e.g. 1-4 hours or less than 24 hours) or minutes (e.g. up to 15, 30 or 45 minutes) of collection. In one embodiment, the sample is a non-sedimented urine sample. In another embodiment, the urine sample is substantially free of residual cells. Each possibility represents a separate embodiment of the invention.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0114">In various embodiments, the methods of the present invention further comprise diluting the urine sample before determining the level of the marker(s). In one embodiment, the sample is diluted in the range of 1:2 to 1:20 for instance, using PBS. In another embodiment, the sample is diluted 1:4, 1:6, 1:8, 1:10, 1:15 or 1:20, e.g. prior to subjecting the sample to an immunoassay. In another embodiment, the urine sample undergoes concentration or filtration. In a preferable embodiment, the sample undergoes ultra-filtration using, for instance, a MILLIPORE Amicon Ultra. As is known in the art, ultra-filtration relates to a variety of membrane filtration in which hydrostatic pressure forces a liquid against a semipermeable membrane. The cut-off of the membrane may be selected from 3KD, 10KD, 30KD or more. In another embodiment, the sample is reconstituted (e.g. with PBS).

The specific reaction referred to above is meant to indicate that the antigen will react, in a highly selective manner, with its corresponding antibody and not with the multitude of other antibodies which may be evoked by other antigens.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0127">In some embodiments, determining the levels of gene products of the invention in the sample is performed by a process comprising contacting the sample, under conditions such that a specific antigen-antibody complex may be formed, with antibodies directed to the gene products of interest, and quantifying the amount of antigen-antibody complex formed for each gene product, to thereby determine (or obtain) the urinary proteomic signature of the subject with respect to said gene products.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0128">In various embodiments, the immunoassay is selected from the group consisting of dipstick, ELISA (including various multiplexed ELISA technologies), an antibody array, an antibody chip, a lateral flow test, and multiplex bead immunoassay.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0129">In accordance with the principles of the invention, any suitable immunoassay can be used. Such techniques are well known to the ordinarily skilled artisan and have been described in many standard immunology manuals and texts. In certain embodiments, determining the capacity of the antibodies to specifically bind the gene products is performed using an antibody array-based method, including, but not limited to an antibody array or an antibody chip. In some embodiments, the array is incubated with an optionally diluted urine sample of the subject so as to allow specific binding between the gene products contained in the sample and the immobilized antibodies, washing out unbound components from the array, incubating the washed array with detectable label-conjugated antibodies of the desired isotype, washing out unbound label from the array, and measuring levels of the label bound to each gene product.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0130">Additional exemplary assays may be based on dipstick technology, as demonstrated, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,632,901, 4,313,734 and 4,786,589 5,656,448 and EP 0125118. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,632,901, discloses a flow-through type immunoassay device comprising antibody (specific to a target antigen analyte) bound to a porous membrane or filter to which is added a liquid sample. As the liquid flows through the membrane, target analyte binds to the antibody. The addition of sample is followed by addition of labeled antibody. The visual detection of labeled antibody provides an indication of the presence of target antigen analyte in the sample. EP 0125118 discloses a sandwich type dipstick immunoassay in which immunochemical components such as antibodies are bound to a solid phase. The assay device is &#x201c;dipped&#x201d; for incubation into a sample suspected of containing unknown antigen analyte. Enzyme-labeled antibody is then added, either simultaneously or after an incubation period. The device next is washed and then inserted into a second solution containing a substrate for the enzyme. The enzyme-label, if present, interacts with the substrate, causing the formation of colored products which either deposit as a precipitate onto the solid phase or produce a visible color change in the substrate solution.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0131">In certain embodiments, the detection of the biomarkers (gene products) may be performed using other immunoassays such as an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) testing kit. In such assays, for example, samples are typically incubated in the presence of an immobilized first specific binding agent (e.g. an antibody) capable of specifically binding the biomarker. Binding of the biomarker to said first specific binding agent may be measured using any one of a variety of known methods, such as using a labeled second specific binding agent capable of specifically binding the biomarker (at a different epitope) or the first specific binding agent. Exemplary specific binding agents include e.g. monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, and antibody fragments such as recombinant antibody fragments, single-chain antibodies (scFv) and the like. In some embodiments, various conventional tags or labels may be used, such as a radioisotope, an enzyme, a chromophore or a fluorophore. A typical radioisotope is iodine<sup>&#x2212;125 </sup>or sulfur<sup>&#x2212;35</sup>. Typical enzymes for this purpose include horseradish peroxidase, horseradish galactosidase and alkaline phosphatase.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0132">Alternately, other immunoassays may be used; such techniques are well known to the ordinarily skilled artisan and have been described in many standard immunology manuals and texts. In some embodiments, the methods of the invention are suitable for automated or semi-automated analysis, and may enable clinical, medium or high-throughput screening of multiple samples. For example, automated ELISA systems such as Biotest's Quickstep&#xae; ELISA Processor, Maxmat Automated microwell ELISA analyzer (Maxmat S. A., France), or DSX&#x2122; Four-Plate System (Dynex Technologies) may conveniently be used, and employed in various methods including, but not limited to multiplexed ELISA methods. Other suitable assays include for example flow cytometry assays (such as singleplex and multiplex bead-based Luminex&#xae; assays (Invitrogen), or other multiplex bead immunoassays available in the art.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0133">Lateral flow tests operate on the same principles as ELISA assays as described above. In essence, these tests run the sample along the surface of a pad with reactive molecules that show a visual positive or negative result. The pads are based on a series of capillary beds, such as pieces of porous paper, microstructured polymer, or sintered polymer. Each of these pads has the capacity to transport fluid (e.g., urine) spontaneously. The sample pad acts as a sponge and holds an excess of sample fluid. Once soaked, the fluid flows to the second conjugate pad in which freeze dried bio-active particles called conjugates are stored in a salt-sugar matrix. The conjugate pad contains all the reagents required for an optimized chemical reaction between the target molecule (e.g., a gene product as disclosed herein) and its chemical partner (e.g., antibody) that has been immobilized on the particle's surface. This marks target particles as they pass through the pad and continue across to the test and control lines. The test line shows a signal, often a color. The control line contains affinity ligands which show whether the sample has flowed through and the bio-molecules in the conjugate pad are active. After passing these reaction zones, the fluid enters the final porous material, the wick, that acts as a waste container.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0134">In another embodiment determining the levels of said gene products is performed by mass spectrometry or using a micro-spectrometer. For example, mass spectrometry-based, targeted proteomics may be employed, e.g. using heavy labeled synthetic internal standards for the proteolytic peptides of said gene products. The native peptides and the standards may be measured using a mass spectrometer and the signal from the internal standard is referenced to the native peptides, which represent the original gene products in the urine sample. In a non-limitative example, suitable equipment such as the SCIO Near Infrared mini Spectrometer may be used.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0135">Additional embodiments of the invention are directed to articles of manufacture comprising means for specifically detecting and/or determining the levels of gene products as disclosed herein in urine samples.

In some embodiments, the control urine sample corresponds to a healthy control subject. In other embodiments, the control urine sample corresponds to a sample obtained from said subject at a time point preceding the time of obtaining the urine sample from said subject (and may be used for example for monitoring changes in the inflammatory state of said subject). In other embodiments (for example in methods for determining the level of systemic inflammation), the control urine sample corresponds to a subject with a predetermined level of inflammation. Such control samples are also referred to herein collectively as reference control samples.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0145">In one embodiment, the methods of the invention are used for the assessment of systemic inflammation in a subject in need thereof, including detecting (diagnosing), determining the level of (grading or quantifying), and monitoring changes in the inflammatory state (comparing the level of systemic inflammation in a patient to its level at a previous time point).</p><p id="p-0112" num="0146">In one embodiment, the methods of the invention are used for (or comprise) detecting systemic inflammation in a subject in need thereof. As used herein, the term &#x201c;systemic inflammation&#x201d; refers to an immune-mediated inflammatory state affecting multiple portions or organs of the body. In contradistinction, local inflammation is confined to a particular location or organ. A systemic inflammation may be an infective inflammation (e.g. when the subject is afflicted with an infection as disclosed herein) or a sterile inflammation (sterile systemic inflammation, e.g. when the subject is afflicted with a non-infective inflammatory condition such as an autoimmune disease, a rheumatic disease, or other types of chronic inflammatory diseases).</p><p id="p-0113" num="0147">Non-limiting examples of symptoms of systemic inflammation include: altered body temperature (e.g., less than 36&#xb0; C. or greater than 38&#xb0; C.), increased heart rate (e.g., greater than 90 beats per minute), tachypnea (e.g., greater than 20 breaths per minute), decreased arterial pressure of CO<sub>2 </sub>(e.g., less than 4.3 kPa), altered white blood count (e.g., less than 4,000 cells/mm<sup>3 </sup>or greater than 12,000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>), increased histamine levels (e.g., greater than 60 ng/mL in blood), increased leukotriene B4 levels (e.g., greater than 30 pg/mL or greater than 35 pg/mL in blood), increased prostaglandin levels (e.g., greater than 3.0 ng/mL in blood), increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., greater than 20 ng/mL TNF-&#x3b1; and/or greater than 10 pg/mL IL-6).</p><p id="p-0114" num="0148">In another embodiment the method is used for (or comprises) determining the level of systemic inflammation in a subject in need thereof. In various embodiments the inflammation is selected from the group consisting of mild (low-grade or chronic), moderate and severe. Acute systemic inflammation is typically either moderate (intermediate grade) or severe (high grade, typically spread to more organs and systems). One type of high-grade systemic inflammation is systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Manifestations of SIRS include abnormally high or low body temperature, elevated heart rate, high respiratory rate, and abnormal white blood cell counts. Generally, SIRS is defined as a condition in which at least two of the following criteria (hereinafter &#x201c;SIRS criteria&#x201d;) are met: fever&#x3e;38&#xb0; C. or &#x3c;36&#xb0; C.; heart rate&#x3e;90 beats per minute; respiratory rate&#x3e;20 breaths per minute or PaCO<sub>2</sub>&#x3c;32 mm Hg; and abnormal white blood cell count (&#x3e;12,000/mm<sup>3 </sup>or &#x3c;4,000/mm<sup>3 </sup>or &#x3e;10% bands).</p><p id="p-0115" num="0149">Systemic inflammation is traditionally evaluated by measuring blood markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and CRP, wherein elevated CRP levels indicate a more severe grade of inflammation. For example, the level of systemic inflammation may be determined as being mild, moderate or severe, characterized by blood CRP levels of 10-39, 40-100, or over 100 mg/L, respectively. In contradistinction, healthy subjects (or subjects in which inflammation is inhibited by suitable treatment), are characterized by blood CRP levels of up to 10 mg/L, although some individual subjects may manifest blood CRP levels of up to 30 mg/L without significant clinical manifestation. In a particular embodiment the method is used for (or comprises) detecting severe systemic inflammation (e.g. characterized by blood CRP levels over 100 mg/L or 120 mg/L).</p><p id="p-0116" num="0150">In some embodiments, the control urine sample corresponds to a subject with a predetermined level of inflammation (e.g. mild, moderate or severe as disclosed herein), and determining the level of systemic inflammation comprises comparing the level of each gene product to the respective value corresponding to its level in one or more such reference samples, or to predetermined cutoffs differentiating between the urinary level of said gene product in a healthy control subject and a subject with systemic inflammation, and/or between the predetermined levels of systemic inflammation.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0151">In another embodiment the method is used for (or comprises) monitoring changes in the inflammatory state of a subject in need thereof (e.g. when the reference control sample has been obtained from said subject at a time point preceding the time of obtaining the urine sample from said subject). Thus, aggravation (enhancement) or amelioration (reduction) of systemic inflammation (e.g. correlated with significantly enhanced or significantly reduced blood CRP levels, respectively), may be determined. In some embodiments, aggravation or amelioration in the inflammatory state of a subject will typically result in aggravation or amelioration, respectively, of one or more symptoms of systemic inflammation as disclosed herein.

CRS is a form of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) that can be triggered by a variety of factors such as infections and certain drugs. CRS occurs when large numbers of white blood cells are activated and release inflammatory cytokines, which in turn activate yet more white blood cells. When occurring as a result of a therapy (e.g. certain monoclonal antibody medications, adoptive T-cell therapies or other immunostimulatory treatments), CRS symptoms may be delayed until days or weeks after treatment. Immediate-onset CRS and severe cases of CRS may also be referred to as a cytokine storm (CSS).

The positive and negative controls referred to herein typically and conveniently represent control sets, such as a panel of control samples from a set of healthy or similarly-diagnosed individuals, or a stored set of data obtained from healthy or similarly-diagnosed individuals.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0167">Thus, in some embodiments of the methods of the invention, the comparing step is performed using a learning and pattern recognition algorithm as disclosed herein. In a particular embodiment, the algorithm is selected from the group consisting of gradient boosted trees, random forest, regularized regression, and combinations thereof, wherein each possibility represents a separate embodiment of the invention.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0168">In another embodiment of the methods of the invention, the comparing step comprises comparing the level of each gene product to a predetermined cutoff differentiating between the urinary level of said gene product in a healthy control subject and a subject with systemic inflammation (or between predetermined levels of systemic inflammation).</p><p id="p-0135" num="0169">In some embodiments, the determining and comparing steps comprise determining the presence or absence of each marker in the sample, wherein the urinary proteomic signature reflects said presence or absence of each marker in said sample. According to additional embodiments, comparing the urinary protein signatures further includes comparing the level of each gene product (including the presence or absence of said gene product) to its control urinary level in a specific order or hierarchy, to thereby compare the urinary proteomic signature of said subject to the control urinary proteomic signature. For instance, Example 3 herein demonstrates comparison of urinary proteomic signature using decision tree algorithms, in which the presence or absence of the markers (SRGN, IGLV3-12, and ASGR1) is considered in a specific hierarchy.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0170">In various embodiments, the invention relates to methods useful in evaluation of inflammation in cases in which existing assays are lacking, lengthy or otherwise inappropriate or inadvisable. The invention in embodiments thereof overcomes these and other challenges as disclosed herein by assaying a urine sample of said subject in a prompt and non-invasive manner. In some embodiments, the methods of the invention for early treatment for infectious disease, as correct diagnosis and treatment assignment (in particular of antibiotic treatment) can be made within hours (e.g. 1-4 hours or less than 24 hours) from symptoms onset. In some embodiments of the methods of the invention, the determining and comparing steps are performed within 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 60 minutes, 1-4 hours, 3-6 hours or up to 24 hours, collectively, wherein each possibility represents a separate embodiment of the invention.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0171">Treatment Assessment and Assignment</p><p id="p-0138" num="0172">In some embodiments, the methods of the invention provide for treatment assignment methods and therapeutic methods, comprising e.g. adjusting, determining and/or providing treatment, wherein each possibility represents a separate embodiment of the invention. In various embodiments of the treatment assignment methods, the subject may be afflicted with an infective or non-infective inflammatory condition as disclosed herein. Accordingly, the treatment to be adjusted, determined and/or provided to the subject is a treatment for the corresponding condition (including for the associated inflammatory response).</p><p id="p-0139" num="0173">In one embodiment, the methods of the invention comprise adjusting treatment provided to the subject (e.g. a drug or agent as disclosed herein). In another embodiment, aggravation of systemic inflammation in the subject indicates that the treatment should be adjusted. Adjusting the treatment may include in some embodiments replacing the treatment, providing an additional treatment, and/or altering (typically enhancing) the administered dose or duration of said treatment, such that the adjusted treatment corresponds to a more severe form or grade of the disease.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0174">In another embodiment the methods of the invention comprise determining (selecting) treatment for a subject based on the level of systemic inflammation determined in the subject. For example, without limitation, determining treatment may comprise determining a suitable dose, wherein e.g. higher doses are used in severe inflammation compared to moderate inflammation, and the dosage may further be reduced for cases of or mild inflammation. In another non-limitative example, more potent immunosuppressive drugs are used in severe cases compared to less severe cases. Exemplary doses and drugs with various potencies are provided hereinbelow.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0175">In another embodiment the methods of the invention further comprise providing said subject with the treatment. Accordingly, in some embodiments there is provided a method of treating a subject in need thereof, comprising:<ul id="ul0029" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0029-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0030" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0030-0001" num="0176">a. obtaining a urine sample from the subject,</li>        <li id="ul0030-0002" num="0177">b. determining the levels of at least three gene products selected from the group consisting of the gene products listed in any one of Tables 6 and 10-14 in the sample, to thereby determine the urinary proteomic signature of the subject with respect to the at least three gene products, and</li>        <li id="ul0030-0003" num="0178">c. comparing the level of each gene product to the respective value corresponding to its level in a reference control urine sample, to thereby compare the urinary proteomic signature of said subject to the urinary proteomic signature of the reference control sample,</li>        <li id="ul0030-0004" num="0179">d. determining the level of systemic inflammation in said subject (e.g. as mild, moderate or severe),</li>        <li id="ul0030-0005" num="0180">e. determining treatment for said subject based on the level of systemic inflammation determined, and</li>        <li id="ul0030-0006" num="0181">f. providing said subject with the treatment.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0142" num="0182">In various embodiments, the treatment to be adjusted, determined and/or provided in the methods of the invention (e.g. in the case of non-infective inflammatory conditions) may be anti-inflammatory drugs, immunosuppressants, or corticosteroids. For example, anti-inflammatory drugs include, without limitation, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs NSAID) and anti-cytokine agents such as anti-IL6 mAb (e.g. Actemra), anti-IL-1 mAb (e.g. Anakinra) and anti-TNF mAb (e.g. Remicade).; immunosuppressants or immunosuppressive agents have negative immunoregulatory activities and include e.g. cyclosporine and methotrexate. Corticosteroids have both anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory activity and include e.g. prednisone, dexamethasone, and hydrocortisone.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0183">Thus, in an exemplary embodiment (e.g. in the treatment of IBD or similar conditions), corticosteroids or other potent treatments may be provided to a subject determined to have severe systemic inflammation, less potent immunosuppressants may be provided to a subject with moderate systemic inflammation, and mild anti-inflammatory drugs such as NSAID may be provided to subjects with mild inflammation, or in combination with other treatments in moderate and severe cases.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0184">In another embodiment the treatment may be an antibiotic drug (e.g. when the presence or level of inflammation in infective conditions is determined). For example, the antibiotic treatment may include e.g. broad-spectrum gram-positive antibiotics, broad-spectrum gram-negative antibiotics, and combinations thereof. For example, broad-spectrum gram-positive antibiotics may include, without limitation, vancomycin or linezolid. Broad-spectrum gram-negative antibiotics may include, without limitation, broad-spectrum penicillins such as piperacillin and tazobactam, 3<sup>rd</sup>&#x2014;or 4<sup>th</sup>&#x2014;generation cephalosporins, imipenems, and aminoglycoside. In yet another embodiment, the treatment excludes an antibiotic drug.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0185">Doses and treatment regimens for disease-specific treatments e.g. as listed above are known in the art and may be determined and adjusted by the skilled artisan (e.g. treating physician) according to the patient's characteristics and disease manifestations.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0186">For example, NSAIDs inhibit the generation of prostaglandins by blocking cyclooxygenase enzymes, COX-1 and COX-2. The major effect of these agents is to reduce acute inflammation thereby decreasing pain and improving function. All of these drugs also have mild to moderate analgesic properties independent of their anti-inflammatory effect. There are a large number of NSAIDs, some over the counter including ibuprofen and naproxen and many others are available by prescription including meloxicam, etodolac, nabumetone, sulindac, tolementin, choline magnesium salicylate, diclofenac, diflusinal, indomethacin), ketoprofen, meloxicam, oxaprozin, and piroxicam. Longer acting NSAIDs that allow daily or twice daily dosing may improve compliance. The NSAID class also includes drugs known as COX-2 inhibitors that are also effective in controlling inflammation, e.g. celecoxib, etoricoxib, and lumiracoxib. NSAID doses for the treatment of various autoimmune and inflammatory conditions are known in the art. For example, for the treatment of SLE, ibuprofen may be used as needed or in doses up to 3000 mg a day, and naproxen is typically used as 500 mg twice a day.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0187">Corticosteroids (including, but not limited to prednisone; methylprednisolone) have both anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory activity. They can be given orally, intravenously, intramuscularly or can be injected directly into the joint. In mild SLE, for example, prednisolone is given in doses starting at 0.1-0.3 mg/kg/day followed by a gradual tapering dose regimen according to clinical response. The dose rises to 0.4-0.6 mg/kg/day in moderate disease and as high as 0.7-1.5 mg/kg/day in very severe disease. At such high doses, pulse therapy with intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone (MP; 500-1000 mg on one to three occasions) is deemed by many physicians to be safer with fewer associated side effects. IV therapy is considered in patients that have not responded to oral therapy and/or have serious manifestations of SLE such as lupus nephritis, neuropsychiatric disease, severe refractory thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, severe vasculitis and cardiopulmonary disease.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0188">Azathioprine is an immunosuppressive agent commonly used for the induction of remission and as a steroid-sparing agent in mild-to-moderate autoimmune diseases. It works by affecting cell-mediated and humoral immune responses via the inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation, reduction in antibody production and suppression of natural killer cell activity. In severe disease, it is used as maintenance therapy and data from lupus nephritis trials show significant improvement in disease activity following induction therapy with cyclophosphamide or mycophenolate mofetil.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0189">Other biological agents and immunosuppressive agents include for example monoclonal antibodies targeting several surface molecules on B cells, to reduce the formation of auto-antibodies. Such exemplary drugs include rituximab (anti-CD20), ocrelizumab (humanized anti-CD20), belimumab (anti-BAFF/BLyS), atacicept (anti-BLys/APRIL) and epratuzumab (humanized anti-CD22). In addition, other key cell-surface markers have been developed to interfere with costimulatory molecules such as cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (abatacept). In addition, Leflunomide (original brand name Arava) is an immunosuppressive pyrimidine synthesis inhibitor that works by inhibiting dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. Leflunomide is an immunomodulatory drug that inhibits the reproduction of rapidly dividing cells, especially lymphocytes. In addition, TNF-&#x3b1; inhibitors, e.g. Etanercept or Infliximab, may be used in some cases.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0190">In other embodiments, the methods of the invention may be used for evaluating the subject's response to various treatments, e.g. immunostimulatory treatment or immunosuppressive treatment.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0191">In some embodiments, the methods are used for evaluating adverse effects associated with immunostimulatory treatment. Such treatments include various cancer immunotherapies including, but not limited to, CAR T cells and adoptive transfer cell therapy, and checkpoint inhibitors (e.g. PD-1 and PDL-1 inhibitors). In an exemplary embodiment, the subject has received an immunostimulatory treatment, and the method is used for assessing the presence of, or the risk for developing, cytokine release syndrome (CRS).</p><p id="p-0152" num="0192">In other embodiments, the methods of the invention are used for evaluating the therapeutic effects of immunosuppressive treatments e.g. one or more drugs or agents as disclosed herein exhibiting negative immune regulatory effects. In some embodiments the subject has received an immunosuppressive treatment, and the method is used for determining treatment efficacy (e.g. inhibition of inflammation or autoimmunity manifested as reduction in the inflammatory state as disclosed herein).</p><p id="p-0153" num="0193">SAA Gene Products</p><p id="p-0154" num="0194">Serum amyloid A (SAA) proteins are a family of apolipoproteins associated with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in plasma, comprising different constitutively expressed and inducible isoforms. These proteins are produced predominantly by the liver. SAA1 and SAA2, listed in Tables 1 and 4-6 herein, are highly homologous. As disclosed herein, SAA1 and SAA2 are particularly useful prognostic markers, which may be used in various embodiment of the invention as described in further detail herein.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0195">As is further disclosed herein, the gene products of the invention may be found in human urine samples in the form of fragments or peptides, rather than as intact polypeptides. Accordingly, urine-borne gene products as disclosed herein may differ structurally from the corresponding gene products that may be found in blood or bodily tissues, as lacking portions of the corresponding native polypeptides. It is to be understood, that the term &#x201c;gene product&#x201d; as referred to herein explicitly includes these partial fragments and peptides e.g. C-terminally truncated and/or N-terminally truncated fragments. As further disclosed herein, these peptides may include in particular N-terminally truncated fragments of SAA gene products. In other embodiments, the gene products referred to herein are intact (or substantially intact) polypeptides.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0196">For example, it was unexpectedly found that both SAA1 and SAA2 are present in the urine samples during inflammation as endogenous peptides, as described in Example 5 herein. In particular, the SAA2-derived peptide, GNYDAAKRGPGGAW (SEQ ID NO: 1), exhibited remarkable correlation (0.78) with blood CRP levels, and found particularly useful as a marker for inflammation.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0197">Accordingly, another aspect of the invention relates to an isolated peptide having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0198">The peptides of the invention may be isolated or synthesized using any recombinant or synthetic method known in the art, including, but not limited to, solid phase (e.g. Boc or f-Moc chemistry) and solution phase synthesis methods. For example, the peptides can be synthesized by a solid phase peptide synthesis method of Merrifield (1963 J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 85:2149-2156). Alternatively, a peptide of the present invention can be synthesized using standard solution methods well known in the art (see, for example, Bodanszky, 1984 The Principles of Peptide Synthesis, Springer-Verlag, New York) or by any other method known in the art for peptide synthesis.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0199">In alternate embodiments, the peptides may be produced by recombinant technology. Recombinant methods for designing, expressing and purifying proteins and peptides are known in the art (see, e.g. Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Springs Harbor Laboratory, New York, 2001). Nucleic acid molecules according to the invention may include DNA, RNA, or derivatives of either DNA or RNA. An isolated nucleic acid sequence encoding a peptide can be obtained from its natural source, either as an entire (i.e., complete) gene or a portion thereof. A nucleic acid molecule can also be produced using recombinant DNA technology (e.g., polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, cloning) or chemical synthesis. Nucleic acid sequences include natural nucleic acid sequences and homologs thereof, including, but not limited to, natural allelic variants and modified nucleic acid sequences in which nucleotides have been inserted, deleted, substituted, and/or inverted in such a manner that such modifications do not substantially interfere with the nucleic acid molecule's ability to encode a functional peptide of the present invention. A polynucleotide or oligonucleotide sequence can be deduced from the genetic code of a protein, however, the degeneracy of the code must be taken into account, as well as the allowance of exceptions to classical base pairing in the third position of the codon, as given by the so-called &#x201c;Wobble rules&#x201d;. Moreover, polynucleotides that include more or less nucleotides can result in the same or equivalent proteins. Thus, according to other embodiments, the invention provides nucleic acids encoding the peptides of the invention, as well as recombinant constructs, expression vectors and pharmaceutical compositions thereof as known in the art (see, e.g. Sambrook et al., 2001).</p><p id="p-0160" num="0200">In the methods of the invention, the term &#x201c;peptide&#x201d; relates to a sequence of 7-40 preferably 10-20 contiguous amino acids, linked by peptide bonds. The peptide may include both &#x201c;L&#x201d; and &#x201c;D&#x201d; amino acids as well as non-natural and chemically derivatized amino acids known in the art. Preferably, the peptides of the invention are 12-18 amino acids (aa) in length, more preferably about 14 aa in length.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0201">As used herein, the term &#x201c;isolated peptide&#x201d; refers to either a synthetic peptide or a peptide which has been &#x201c;altered by the hand of man&#x201d; and separated from the co-existing materials of its natural state. An isolated peptide has been synthetically produced or changed or removed from its original environment and typically both.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0202">Whenever peptides are mentioned in the invention, also salts and functional derivatives thereof are contemplated, as long as they retain the corresponding immune reactivity. Thus, the present invention encompasses peptides containing non-natural amino acid derivatives or non-protein side chains. The peptides of the invention may be used having a terminal carboxy acid, as a carboxy amide, as a reduced terminal alcohol or as any pharmaceutically acceptable salt, e.g., as metal salt, including sodium, potassium, lithium or calcium salt, or as a salt with an organic base, or as a salt with a mineral acid, including sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid or phosphoric acid, or with an organic acid e.g., acetic acid or maleic acid.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0203">The amino acid residues described herein are preferred to be in the &#x201c;L&#x201d; isomeric form. However, residues in the &#x201c;D&#x201d; isomeric form can be substituted for L-amino acid residues, as long as the peptide substantially retains the desired functional property (e.g. immune reactivity). The N&#x2032; and C&#x2032; of the peptides may optionally be derivatized by stabilizing chemical groups as known in the art, which do not substantially affect the structure or conformation of the peptide, such as by amidation, acetylation, conjugation of fatty acids and the like.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0204">Further encompassed by embodiments of the invention are analog peptides obtained by replacement, deletion or addition of amino acid residues to the sequence, optionally including the use of a chemically derivatized residue in place of a non-derivatized residue. These analogs may be considered equivalent to the peptide corresponding to SEQ ID NO: 1 as long as they retain high sequence homology (at least 70% and typically 80%, 90% or more) and retain the corresponding immune reactivity (i.e. are cross-reactive with an antibody directed to SEQ ID NO: 1 under physiological conditions).</p><p id="p-0165" num="0205">In some embodiments, the kits and assays of the invention advantageously incorporate the use of an antibody directed to an SAA2 fragment as disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0206">In other embodiments there is provided a method of producing an antibody directed to the SAA fragments of the invention, comprising immunizing a subject (e.g. a non-human animal) with the peptide. The peptide may be used for immunization in the form of an immunogenic conjugate in which the isolated peptide is linked (e.g. by direct covalent bond or via a linker) to a heterologous sequence such as a carrier protein.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0207">In other embodiments the invention relates to a conjugate of the isolated peptide with a heterologous moiety, e.g. a carrier or a label. In some embodiments, the conjugate may also be provided in the form of a multimeric conjugate comprising multiple copies of the peptide linked directly or via a linker. The antibody may then be isolated e.g. obtained directly from the sera of the immunized animals or further isolated by methods known in the art.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0208">In another aspect the invention relates to an antibody, or an antigen-binding portion thereof, specific to the peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1. In various embodiments, the antibody is a monoclonal antibody, a polyclonal antibody, or a fragment thereof, as described herein. In another embodiment the antibody has been produced by a method comprising immunization with the peptide and isolation of the resulting antibody.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0209">Methods of generating monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies are well known in the art. Antibodies may be generated via any one of several known methods, which may employ induction of in vivo production of antibody molecules, screening of immunoglobulin libraries, or generation of monoclonal antibody molecules by continuous cell lines in culture. These include, but are not limited to, the hybridoma technique, the human B-cell hybridoma technique, and the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)&#x2014;hybridoma technique.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0210">In cases where target antigens are too small to elicit an adequate immunogenic response when generating antibodies in vivo, such antigens (referred to as &#x201c;haptens&#x201d;) can be coupled to antigenically neutral carriers such as keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) or serum albumin (e.g., bovine serum albumin (BSA)) carriers (see, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,189,178 and 5,239,078). The antisera obtained can be used directly (e.g. as diluted sera or as purified polyclonal antibodies), or monoclonal antibodies may be obtained, as described herein.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0211">A monoclonal antibody (mAb) is a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies to a specific antigen. The term &#x201c;monoclonal antibody&#x201d; as used herein refers to an antibody (typically intact) obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigen. Furthermore, in contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations that typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. The modifier &#x201c;monoclonal&#x201d; is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. mAbs may be obtained by methods known to those skilled in the art. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by hybridoma methods, or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567). The &#x201c;monoclonal antibodies&#x201d; may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries. See, for example U.S. Pat. No. 4,376,110; Ausubel et al (&#x201c;Current Protocols in Molecular Biology,&#x201d; Volumes I-III, John Wiley &#x26; Sons, Baltimore, Md., 1994).</p><p id="p-0172" num="0212">Antibody fragments may be obtained using methods well known in the art. (See, for example, Harlow, E. and Lane, D. (1988). Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York). For example, antibody fragments according to the present invention can be prepared by proteolytic hydrolysis of the antibody or by expression in <i>E. coli </i>or mammalian cells (e.g., Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell culture or other protein expression systems) of DNA encoding the fragment.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0213">Besides the conventional method of raising antibodies in vivo, antibodies can be generated in vitro using phage display technology. Protocols for bacteriophage library construction and selection of recombinant antibodies are provided in the well-known reference text Current Protocols in Immunology, Colligan et al (Eds.), John Wiley &#x26; Sons, Inc.

In a particular embodiment said gene product has the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1. In another embodiment, the method further comprises determining the level of at least one additional gene product in said sample, e.g. one or more gene products as set forth in Table 1, 4, 5 or 6 (e.g. SAA1 and GUCA2B) and comparing their levels to the respective level in said control sample.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0215">In another aspect there is provided a method for detecting systemic inflammation in a subject in need thereof, comprising:<ul id="ul0031" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0031-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0032" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0032-0001" num="0216">a. obtaining a urine sample from the subject,</li>        <li id="ul0032-0002" num="0217">b. determining the level of an SAA2 gene product in the sample, and</li>        <li id="ul0032-0003" num="0218">c. comparing said level to the respective value corresponding to its urinary level in a healthy control subject,</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0176" num="0219">wherein a significantly enhanced level of the one or more gene products compared to their levels in a healthy control subject indicates that said subject has severe systemic inflammation.

For example, the methods can comprise determining the levels of at least three gene products as disclosed herein in a urine sample, and comparing the resulting urinary proteomic signature to the urinary proteomic signature of a healthy control using such algorithms and/or analyzers.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0222">In certain embodiments, one or more algorithms or computer programs may be used for comparing the amount of each gene product quantified in the urine sample against a predetermined cutoff (or against a number of predetermined cutoffs). Alternatively, one or more instructions for manually performing the necessary steps by a human can be provided.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0223">Algorithms for determining and comparing urinary proteomic signatures include, but are not limited to, supervised classification algorithms including, but not limited to, gradient boosted trees, random forest, regularized regression, multiple linear regression (MLR), principal component regression (PCR), partial least squares (PLS), discriminant function analysis (DFA) including linear discriminant analysis (LDA), nearest neighbor, artificial neural networks, multi-layer perceptrons (MLP), generalized regression neural network (GRNN), and combinations thereof, or non-supervised clustering algorithms, including, but not limited to, K-means, spectral clustering, hierarchical clustering, gaussian mixture models, and combinations thereof. In a particular embodiment, the algorithm is selected from the group consisting of gradient boosted trees, random forest, regularized regression, and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0224">Many of the algorithms are neural network-based algorithms. A neural network has an input layer, processing layers and an output layer. The information in a neural network is distributed throughout the processing layers. The processing layers are made up of nodes that simulate the neurons by the interconnection to their nodes. Similar to statistical analysis revealing underlying patterns in a collection of data, neural networks locate consistent patterns in a collection of data, based on predetermined criteria.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0225">In other embodiments, principal component analysis is used. Principal component analysis (PCA) involves a mathematical technique that transforms a number of correlated variables into a smaller number of uncorrelated variables. The smaller number of uncorrelated variables is known as principal components. The first principal component or eigenvector accounts for as much of the variability in the data as possible, and each succeeding component accounts for as much of the remaining variability as possible. The main objective of PCA is to reduce the dimensionality of the data set and to identify new underlying variables.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0226">In another embodiment, the algorithm is a classifier. One type of classifier is created by &#x201c;training&#x201d; the algorithm with data from the training set and whose performance is evaluated with the test set data. Examples of classifiers used in conjunction with the invention are discriminant analysis, decision tree analysis, receiver operator curves or split and score analysis.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0227">The term &#x201c;decision tree&#x201d; refers to a classifier with a flow-chart-like tree structure employed for classification. Decision trees consist of repeated splits of a data set into subsets. Each split consists of a simple rule applied to one variable, e.g., &#x201c;if value of &#x201c;variable 1&#x201d; larger than &#x201c;threshold 1&#x201d;; then go left, else go right&#x201c;.

After best matchings of the groups were made based on age, gender and estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR), subjects in the viral and control groups were 10-16 years younger as compared to those in the bacterial group.

Newly-Identified SAA Fragments as Urinary Markers for Inflammation</heading><p id="p-0232" num="0262">A series of experiments to characterize the amino acid sequence of the SAA1 and SAA2 gene products identified in the urine samples. To this end, peptidomic analyses were performed on urine samples from patients described in Example 3. The samples were filtered with 10 kDa molecular weight cutoff membranes, and the low molecular weight fraction was collected. It was then desalted using C18 cartridges and analyzed by mass spectrometry.</p><p id="p-0233" num="0263">Unexpectedly, it was found that both SAA1 and SAA2 are present in the samples as endogenous peptides, and not whole proteins. The SAA1 and SAA2 fragments were characterized by N&#x2032; truncations ranging beyond the signal peptide.</p><p id="p-0234" num="0264">Remarkably, one of the peptides, namely the SAA2-derived peptide GNYDAAKRGPGGAW (SEQ ID NO: 1), exhibited high correlation (0.78) with blood CRP levels.

The targeted proteomic experiment was performed on a total of 91 samples: 32 healthy controls, and 59 samples from patients with inflammatory conditions (30 with viral infections, and 29 with bacterial infections).</p><p id="p-0236" num="0266">Gene products corresponding to CRP were detected in the urine samples as follows: 14 out of the 32 control samples (43.8%), 26 out of the 30 viral samples (86.7%) and 28 out of the 29 bacterial samples (96.6%) contained a CRP gene product. The increased abundance of urinary CRP in patients with inflammatory conditions compared to healthy subjects reached statistical significance (Chi square&#x3c;0.001); no statistical significance was reached when comparing subjects with viral infections to those with bacterial infections (Chi square p=0.173). When comparing the levels of urinary CRP in the three groups, a significant difference was identified between patients with inflammatory conditions and healthy controls (median IQR in controls: 0 [0-1,771,063], in viral infections: 6,191,530 [1,742,375-14,390,560] and in bacterial infections 15,081,115 [2,886,969-47,985,575], p&#x3c;0.001, Kruskal-Wallis H test).
