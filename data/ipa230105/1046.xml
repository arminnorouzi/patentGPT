More specifically, the present invention relates to compositions suitable for the delivery of agents to biological targets such as tissues and cells and/or capable of providing protection to said biological targets, and methods for the production thereof.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">When damage occurs to biological tissue, for example, as a result of accidental mechanical injury, surgery or disease, a major priority is to effectively seal the site of injury. Tissue sealants have a wide variety of applications including, but not limited to, the prevention of further injury, prevention of infection and minimisation of blood loss. Increasingly, tissue sealants are also being used to deliver agents to damaged tissue which may aid healing and/or help to prevent infection. Adverse effects such as allergic reactions are less likely when sealants are produced from naturally occurring materials.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Sealants vary widely in their mechanism of action and ease of application. An effective sealant flows freely during administration, but has the capacity to maintain shape/structure following application. The latter property is of particular importance when the shape of the biological tissue under repair is crucial to its function, for example, corneal tissue.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The cornea is the clear component of the protective covering of the eye. It allows light to pass through the pupil and is the primary refractive element of the eye's optical system. The cornea consists of five layers: the outer epithelium, Bowman's layer, the stroma, Descemet's membrane, and the inner endothelium. The corneal stroma accounts for approximately 90% of the overall thickness of the cornea and is mostly made up of collagen.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Corneal blindness is a major cause of blindness worldwide, second only to cataracts in terms of numbers. Causes of corneal blindness are diverse, and include diseases such as trachoma, onchocerciasis, leprosy, ophthalmia neonatorum, and xerophthalmia, and other processes such as ocular trauma, corneal ulceration, and complications arising from the use of traditional eye medicines.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Corneal injuries represent the most common ophthalmic emergency presentation in Australia and approximately 75% of all cases are due to the presence of foreign bodies or abrasions in the cornea. These injuries alone are estimated to cost the Australian population more than $155 million per year and, if not treated effectively, can lead to infection and scarring, resulting in permanently impaired vision.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In mild cases, a damaged cornea is able to regenerate via normal healing pathways. In other cases, however, the cornea's normal healing mechanism is insufficient, leading to the formation of non-healing defects which can result in corneal melting, corneal neovascularisation, loss of transparency, infection, scarring and diminished vision to the point of blindness.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Current medical treatments for corneal injuries include antibiotics, eye pads, sutures and surgical glues, which may help with minor issues. However, they do not adequately address issues arising in more advanced situations including pain relief, infection and/or the development of scar tissue. Infection represents a significant complication and often requires hospitalisation. Scarring, which is common in severe corneal injuries, can lead to permanent vision loss. In such cases, corneal transplantation is the only option for visual rehabilitation, but a shortage of donor corneas exists worldwide.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Many of the aforementioned issues are not restricted to corneal injuries, and also prevail in the case of damage to other body tissues.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">A need exists for improved compositions and methods for sealing biological tissue, and/or for the effective delivery of agents to biological targets such as tissues and cells.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention alleviates at least one of the problems associated with current compositions and/or methods for sealing biological tissue and the delivery of agents to biological targets. In the context of the cornea, one of the main approaches currently is to reconstruct corneal defects with natural or synthetic materials. Collagen is the main natural material used, being the major protein in the cornea. Collagen contributes 60-80% of the dry weight of the cornea, and type I collagen is the predominant type in corneal stroma. However, the strength and elasticity of current naturally generated collagen products are limited. Chemical modification or cross-linking is normally required to improve the robustness of type I collagen and other types of collagen generated for therapeutic use. Biomechanical properties of current collagen-based products remain insufficient for ongoing use, as an irregular corneal shape is normally observed over time.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In addition to collagen implants, collagen sealant and bioinks have also been proposed and developed. However, the application of such bioinks has been limited by complicated printing methods and lack of transparency of the resulting products.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Instead of using collagen implants as stromal equivalents, the present inventors have developed printable collagen bioinks using unmodified type I collagen for printing directly onto the cornea. The bioinks of the present invention may also be printed directly onto a range of other biological targets (e.g. tissue, membranes, cells). The printed collagen bioinks can be solidified to form a temporary structure that will be degraded safely, and which allows the migration of surrounding corneal cells and restructuring of the stroma. The collagen bioinks of the present invention may be printed using two-dimensional or three-dimensional (extrusion) bioprinting techniques. Further, the bioinks of the present invention are able to be photo-crosslinked. The bioinks described herein may be transparent and adhesive and can support cell migration and proliferation. Bioactive molecules (e.g. growth factors) may be delivered using the biodegradable bioinks.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Without limitation, the compositions and methods described herein are generally useful for the delivery of agents (e.g. drugs and/or or other substances) to biological targets (e.g. tissue, membranes, cells) and may find application, for example, in the sealing of tissue, including corneal tis sue.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present invention relates at least in part to the following embodiments:</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Embodiment 1.

In particular, the compositions of the present invention may be used to apply collagen gels to tissue (e.g. eye) using two- or three-dimensional (extrusion) bioprinting techniques. The compositions provide a means of delivering agents to biological targets (e.g. organs, tissues, cells). While suitable for application to the cornea, the compositions described herein provide a platform for numerous applications in the areas of sealing tissue and the delivery of agents by virtue of providing, for example, structural support, viable cells, and other factors.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0155">There is a need in the art for effective collagen-derived sealants and adhesives for surfaces such as ocular surfaces and the corneal stroma. The compositions described herein are based on natural type I collagen which, in the context of the cornea, can reconstitute the major protein in this tissue. The compositions of the present invention are also ideal agents for the delivery of a diverse range of growth factors and other agents. The compositions described herein may utilise biomaterial that mimics in vivo tissue and acts as a scaffold for cells to populate, and/or, through the manipulation of conditions, encourages the cells themselves to regenerate their surrounding matrix. In the context of their suitability for application to eye tissue the present inventors have, for example, addressed the difficulties of creating a matrix that can embody the structural integrity of the tissue under treatment (e.g. cornea) whilst maintaining transparency and still being porous and biocompatible enough to allow for the infiltration, migration and/or proliferation of corneal cells and growth factors.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0156">The balance between providing the nutritional needs of damaged tissue while meeting the structural, mechanical and physical requirements of damaged tissue (e.g. eye tissue such as cornea) was a problem existing at the time that the present invention arose. The present invention provides improved compositions and methods for delivering agents to a broad variety of biological targets. Without limitation to any particular application, the compositions may be used for sealing tissue and the delivery of agents to biological targets.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Compositions for Delivery of Biological Agents</heading><p id="p-0129" num="0157">The present invention provides compositions suitable for the delivery of agents to biological targets such as tissues and cells. The compositions may also be used as sealants and/or adhesives for said biological targets.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0158">The compositions utilise a base scaffold material to provide structural support upon application to a biological target (e.g. tissues, membranes, cells, organs), to facilitate the delivery of agents to the biological target.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0159">No particular limitation exists regarding the specific material/s used to generate the scaffolds.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0160">For example, the scaffolds may be collagen scaffolds. These may be generated, for example, via the use of type I collagen in the compositions. The type I collagen used may be unmodified when compared to its naturally occurring counterpart.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0161">The compositions of the present invention may further optionally comprise ions and/or one or more sources of ions. Non-limiting examples of suitable ions include calcium ions and sodium ions. Non-limiting examples of suitable ion sources include compounds comprising calcium (e.g. calcium chloride) and sodium (e.g. sodium chloride). Calcium ions and sodium ions may be present in the compositions of the present invention together or individually.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0162">The present inventors have identified optimal relative concentrations of type I collagen, sodium ions and/or calcium ions for the compositions of the present invention, some of which are described in the Examples and claims of the present application. It will be understood that the relative concentrations of type I collagen, sodium ions and/or calcium ions disclosed are exemplary only.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0163">The composition may comprise 1-20 mg/ml type I collagen, 0.07-0.5 M sodium ions and/or 0.008-0.4 M calcium ions.

In some embodiments, the composition may comprise 4-12 mg/ml type I collagen, 0.135-0.16 M sodium ions and/or 0.015-0.03 M calcium ions. In some embodiments, the composition may comprise 5-10 mg/ml type I collagen, 0.135-0.14 M sodium ions and/or 0.018-0.02 M calcium ions. In some embodiments, the composition may comprise less than 15 mg/ml type I collagen and more than 0.135 M sodium ions and/or more than 0.018 M calcium ions.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0164">The compositions of the present invention may further comprise one or more crosslinking agents. In some embodiments of the invention, the crosslinking agent is riboflavin. The riboflavin could be present at a concentration of 0.01-0.5% (w/v). Light, such as UV light or blue light could be used to activate the riboflavin, crosslinking the composition. The person skilled in the art will be aware of other suitable photo-crosslinking agents and light sources, for example, Rose Bengal dye and green light, both of which have been approved for several applications to the cornea. In some embodiments, Rose Bengal is used as a photo-crosslinking agent and is activated by green light. In some embodiments, Rose Bengal is used as a photo-crosslinking agent and is activated by white light. In some embodiments, 0.01-0.5% (w/v) Rose Bengal is used for photo-crosslinking. In some embodiments, compositions provided by crosslinking the collagen bioink with Rose Bengal and a suitable light source will be coloured. In some embodiments, the colour will be pink. These coloured compositions may be used for monitoring collagen metabolism in tissue, or for other uses requiring tracking of collagen activity.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0165">In some embodiments of the present invention, the crosslinking agents are fibrinogen and/or thrombin. Concentrations used may be 1.6-6 mg/ml fibrinogen and 1-5 U/mL thrombin. Concentrations used may be 0.1-20 mg/ml fibrinogen and 2-20 U/mL thrombin. The present inventors have identified optimal relative concentrations of fibrinogen and thrombin for the compositions of the present invention which are described in the claims of the present application. It will be understood that the relative concentrations of fibrinogen and thrombin disclosed are exemplary only.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0166">The compositions of the present invention may include platelet lysate. The platelet lysate may, for example, be mammalian platelet lysate (e.g. generated using human, canine, feline, bovine, porcine, equine, caprine, hircine, murine, leporine, cricetine, or musteline platelets, or any combination thereof). The source of platelets utilised to generate the platelet lysate will generally depend on the specific purpose for which the composition is to be used. As known to those of ordinary skill in the art, platelet lysate is generated by isolating platelets, lysing them and removing cellular debris. The constituents of platelet lysate and its applications have been well analysed (see, for example, Burnouf et al. Biomaterials. 2016 January; 76:371-87).</p><p id="p-0139" num="0167">In some embodiments, the compositions do not comprise anticoagulants or are substantially free of anticoagulants which may be present at only trace amounts. Non-limiting examples of such anticoagulants include heparin, Vitamin K Antagonists (e.g. Warfarin, Coumarins), Rivaroxaban, Edoxaban, Apixaban, Dabigatran, and the like. In some embodiments, the platelet lysate comprises less than: 10% (v/v), 9% (v/v), 8% (v/v), 7% (v/v), 6% (v/v), 5% (v/v), 4% (v/v), 3% (v/v), 2% (v/v), 1% (v/v), 0.5% (v/v), anticoagulants.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0168">Compositions according to the present invention may include cells. The cells may, for example, be mammalian cells (e.g. human cells, canine cells, feline cells, bovine cells, porcine cells, equine cells, caprine cells, hircine cells, murine cells, leporine cells, cricetine cells, musteline cells, or any combination thereof). The type of cells utilised will generally depend on the specific purpose for which the composition is to be used. For example, the cells may be of the same type as a tissue to which the composition is to be administered (e.g. eye surface cells including those of the central and/or peripheral corneal epithelium, bulbar and/or tarsal conjunctival epithelia, tarsal conjunctival stroma, and/or lid margin; skin cells including but not limited to keratinocytes, melanocytes, Merkel cells, and Langerhans cells; and neural tissue cells including but not limited to neurons and glial cells). Other examples include epithelial cells, keratocytes, neuronal cells, and endothelial cells. In some embodiments, the cells may be hematopoietic stem cells, bone marrow stem cells, neural stem cells, epithelial stem cells, skin stem cells, muscle stem cells, adipose stem cells, pluripotent stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, embryonic stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells, or any combination thereof. In some embodiments, the cells may be neuronal cells.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0169">The platelet lysates and/or cells of the compositions may be autologous (i.e. self-derived from a given subject intended to receive the composition, or allogeneic (i.e. donor-derived).</p><p id="p-0142" num="0170">The compositions of the present invention may comprise essential and/or non-essential amino acids.

Lyophilised bovine collagen type I may be used in the preparation of the compositions. Additionally or alternatively, human collagen may be used. The type I collagen may be neutralised prior to the addition of ions and other components of the compositions. In some embodiments of the invention, the one or more crosslinking agents are combined with a base to form part A the type I collagen is combined with the ions, for example, sodium ions and/or calcium ions to form part B; and parts A and B are mixed to form a solution prior to applying the solution to a surface. In some embodiments, parts A and B are mixed in a ratio of between 1 and 20: between 200 and 300. In further embodiments, the ratio is 9:250. A person skilled in the art would recognise that various protocols could be used to prepare the compositions of the invention and that various buffer solutions could be used to keep the collagen at physiological pH and to maintain solubility.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0186">In some embodiments of the present invention, the crosslinking agents are fibrinogen and thrombin. In some embodiments, a type I collagen preparation comprising thrombin may be maintained separately from a type I collagen preparation comprising fibrinogen, and the two preparations may be combined prior to or during application of the composition.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0187">In some embodiments, the type I collagen plus fibrinogen and type I collagen plus thrombin preparations can be provided by establishing individual flow streams of the two separated components. These streams can be maintained in a state of continual flow for a suitable time period and be oriented to mix with each other at a given point to thereby provide a further stream of mixed components that is deposited on the biological target. Alternatively, the streams may be oriented to mix with each other at or on a surface of the biological target to which the composition is applied. Compositions of the present invention using fibrinogen and thrombin as crosslinking agents may not be transparent without the addition of platelet lysate. Such non-transparent collagen bioinks may be used for wider application than in ophthalmology.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0188">Compositions of the present invention may comprise platelet lysate (e.g. mammalian platelet lysate, human platelet lysate).

The compositions of the present invention may be used in applications where there is a need for delivery of agents (e.g. natural growth factors, drugs, nanoparticles, and/or cells,) and/or for the fixation of individual biological surfaces, and/or in tissue culture methods.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0201">In some embodiments the compositions can act as tissue sealants and/or as a fixative for biological structures. They may provide structural and/or nutritional support to tissue. Additionally or alternatively, the compositions may facilitate the growth of target cell type/s, including those which may be provided as a component of the compositions and/or cells present in the target tissue.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0202">In some embodiments, compositions provided by crosslinking the collagen bioink with Rose Bengal and a suitable light source will be coloured. In some embodiments, the collagen compositions may be pink. These coloured compositions may be used for monitoring collagen metabolism in tissue, or for other uses requiring tracking of collagen activity.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0203">While no limitation exists as to the type of tissue to which the compositions may be applied, the present inventors have demonstrated that the compositions are effective in the sealing of eye tis sue.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0204">For example, the compositions are demonstrated herein to be effective in sealing corneal tissue. In these embodiments, the compositions may be used to promote the proliferation and/or migration of corneal epithelial cells. The compositions may, for example, support multidirectional growth and/or stratification of corneal epithelial cells, which may partially or completely biodegrade the composition once a cell monolayer is formed.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0205">The present invention thus provides methods for sealing tissue and for the delivery of a variety of agents to biological targets. The targets may, for example, be located in or around eye tissue including tissue of the central and/or peripheral corneal epithelium, bulbar and/or tarsal conjunctival epithelia, tarsal conjunctival stroma, and/or lid margin.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0206">It will be appreciated by persons of ordinary skill in the art that numerous variations and/or modifications can be made to the present invention as disclosed in the specific embodiments without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention as broadly described.
