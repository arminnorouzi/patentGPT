Each example is provided by way of explanation of the embodiments, not limitation of the present disclosure. In fact, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made to the embodiments without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. For instance, features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment can be used with another embodiment to yield a still further embodiment. Thus, it is intended that aspects of the present disclosure cover such modifications and variations.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Example aspects of the present disclosure are directed to automated delivery systems for vehicles. In particular, the systems and methods of the present disclosure can allow for integrating an automated delivery system into a vehicle, such as an autonomous vehicle, that is also configured to provide passenger services. The systems and methods of the present disclosure can facilitate maximizing utilization of a vehicle fleet as demand shifts among different service products throughout a day. For example, the systems and methods of the present disclosure can provide for vehicles that allow for a mix of passenger services and delivery services, thereby allowing for maximizing trip efficiency and increasing the amount of time a vehicle is in service, such as buffering certain delivery trips to be completed during non-peak passenger travel times, buffering delivery trips along routes to coincide with expected passenger travel, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">More particularly, an entity (e.g., service provider, owner, manager) can use one or more vehicles (e.g., ground-based vehicles) to provide a vehicle service such as a transportation service (e.g., rideshare service), a courier service, a delivery service, etc. The vehicles can comprise a drive system at least including an engine/transmission/axle assembly for transferring torque to the wheels for driving the vehicle. The vehicle(s) can be an autonomous vehicle(s) that includes various systems and devices configured to control the operation of the vehicle(s). For example, an autonomous vehicle can include an onboard vehicle computing system for operating the vehicle (e.g., located on or within the autonomous vehicle). The vehicle computing system can receive sensor data from sensor(s) onboard the vehicle (e.g., cameras, LIDAR, RADAR), attempt to comprehend the vehicle's surrounding environment by performing various processing techniques on the sensor data, and generate an appropriate motion plan through the vehicle's surrounding environment. The vehicle computing system can control (e.g., via a vehicle controller, etc.) one or more vehicle controls (e.g., actuators or other devices that control acceleration, throttle, steering, braking, etc.) to execute the motion plan. Moreover, the autonomous vehicle can be configured to communicate with one or more computing devices that are remote from the vehicle. For example, the autonomous vehicle can communicate with an operations computing system that can be associated with the entity. The operations computing system can help the entity monitor, communicate with, manage, etc. the fleet of vehicles.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to an aspect of the present disclosure, an automated delivery system can include a delivery service pod that is integrated into the roof space of a vehicle, such as an autonomous vehicle. In some implementations, the delivery service pod can be configured to optimize the space required for the pod such that it has minimal or no impact on the passenger cabin space of the vehicle. In some implementations, the delivery system can be configured such that the delivery service pod is configured as a separate compartment from the passenger cabin of a vehicle, thereby isolating the delivery contents from passengers within the vehicle. By isolating deliveries from the passenger cabin air, passenger irritation from delivery odors and the like can be minimized or eliminated.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to an aspect of the present disclosure, in some implementations, a delivery service pod can comprise a conveyor unit such as a belt driven, carousel-style or looped conveyor (e.g., capable of moving objects in a continuous loop, etc.) that can provide for optimizing access and handling for a plurality of delivery crates contained within the pod. In some implementations, the conveyor unit can include pre-defined positions (e.g., holding positions) for a plurality of delivery crates, for instance, using a series of sidewalls or divider walls associated with the conveyor that define isolated spaces to securely and separately hold each delivery crate relative to the conveyor. In some implementations, the series of sidewalls or divider walls associated with the conveyor can provide for ensuring that only a designated delivery crate for a recipient (e.g., a delivery crate currently in a retrieval position within the delivery service pod) can be accessed by the recipient (e.g., preventing a recipient from accessing adjacent holding positions when retrieving a designated delivery crate). In some implementations, the delivery service pod can be configured to store up to eight or more delivery crates.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to another aspect of the present disclosure, an automated delivery system can include a system of delivery crates designed to securely hold a set of packages, containers, and/or the like that make up a distinct delivery unit (e.g., a delivery for a single recipient). In some implementations, the delivery crates can be sized to accommodate a range of typical delivery package sizes. For example, a delivery crate can be configured in a size (e.g., 16.5&#x2033;&#xd7;16.5&#x2033;&#xd7;7&#x2033;, etc.) to hold a certain number of beverage containers (e.g., three two-liter bottles, etc.), food containers (e.g., three extra-large pizza boxes, multiple food take out containers, etc.), standard mailing packages (e.g., large flat rate shipping boxes, etc.), and/or the like. In some implementations, the delivery crates can be configured to provide thermal stability to the contents (e.g., help maintain cold/warm temperature of the contents, etc.), such as through the use of insulated construction materials and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some implementations, the delivery crates may be constructed with durable insulating materials that can be cleaned and sanitized to allow for reuse of the delivery crates. For example, in some implementations, the delivery system can be configured such that a recipient can remove a delivery crate containing their assigned delivery from the delivery pod, remove the contents of the delivery crate, and reinsert the empty delivery crate into the same position within the delivery pod. Additionally or alternatively, in some implementations, a recipient can remove a delivery crate containing their assigned delivery from the delivery pod and take the delivery crate with them, returning the delivery crate at a later time (e.g., to another delivery vehicle upon requesting a crate return, at a drop off location, etc.). In some such implementations, a monetary cost may be assessed to a recipient for the delivery crate if the delivery crate is not returned within a specified time period after delivery. In some implementations, the delivery crates may be configured to be disposable and/or recyclable, such that a recipient need not return the delivery crate to the service provider.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to another aspect of the present disclosure, in some implementations, an automated delivery system can provide for notification of a pending delivery to a recipient, for example, through an application running on a user computing device (e.g., smartphone, tablet, computer, etc.). Additionally, the automated delivery system can provide secure access for retrieval of the delivery by the recipient. For example, a recipient (e.g., application user) can receive a notification via an application on their user computing device that a vehicle has arrived or will be arriving soon at the recipient's location with a delivery for the recipient. The recipient can then proceed to the vehicle and request to retrieve the delivery, for example, by scanning or entering an identification code (e.g., via the application, via an interface associated with the vehicle, etc.). Upon confirmation of the identification code, the vehicle (e.g., delivery service pod) can provide the recipient with access to the delivery crate associated with the recipient's delivery (e.g., moving the designated delivery crate to a retrieval position, access unit, etc.).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">For example, in some implementations, before or upon arrival at the recipient's location, the delivery system can cause the delivery crate associated with the recipient to be moved in the delivery pod to a retrieval position of the delivery pod (e.g., by rotating the conveyor within the delivery pod to align the holding position of the identified delivery crate with an access unit comprising an access door, panel, hatch, and/or the like of within the exterior wall of the delivery pod). Upon confirmation that the recipient's identification has been verified, the delivery system can cause the access unit door, panel, hatch, and/or the like within the delivery pod to be released and/or opened to provide recipient access to the delivery crate containing the delivery package(s) for the recipient from the exterior of the vehicle. In some implementations, the delivery pod can include an actuator comprised within and/or associated with an access unit that causes the assigned delivery crate to be moved or shifted out of the delivery pod to provide for convenient access and retrieval by the recipient. For example, in some implementations, an access unit can comprise an actuator to move the delivery crate to be delivered, for example, to a transfer unit of the access unit that provides for moving the delivery crate from the conveyor to a position that allows for a recipient to remove the delivery crate from the exterior of the vehicle. In some implementations, the delivery system can verify that the recipient has removed the delivery crate (e.g., by monitoring the status of the delivery crate holding position, by monitoring the status of the access unit, by monitoring the movement of the recipient, by receiving a confirmation from the recipient, etc.) and then cause the delivery pod access unit to be closed and/or secured.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some implementations, machine learning can be used to understand fleet travel patterns, allowing for vehicle use to be optimized between a mixture of delivery services and passenger services. For example, by gaining an understanding of fleet travel patterns, trips can be utilized with increased efficiency, for instance, by determining deliveries that coincide with passenger travel routes and/or times to optimize distances traveled by vehicles. As another example, in some implementations, deliveries can be buffered throughout the day to optimize in-service time of the vehicles, such as by increasing delivery trips during non-peak passenger travel periods.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">According to another aspect of the present disclosure, in some implementations, a delivery system associated with a vehicle (e.g., a ground-based vehicle), as described herein, can further provide for accepting and/or retrieving one or more delivery packages from a delivery drone. In some implementations, the delivery system can accept and/or retrieve a delivery package while the vehicle is stationary or in motion (e.g., traveling to a destination, etc.). For example, in some implementations, a delivery service pod (as described herein) can comprise a package handling unit which can obtain a delivery package from a delivery drone that is positioned proximate to the delivery service pod (e.g., hovering near the vehicle comprising the delivery service pod, landed on the delivery service pod, etc.). In some implementations, the package handling unit of the delivery service pod can further provide for positioning the obtained delivery package within the delivery service pod (e.g., into a conveyer holding position, etc.) such that the obtained delivery package can be safely stored until the delivery package can be provided to/retrieved by a recipient.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some implementations, a delivery system associated with a vehicle (e.g., a ground-based vehicle) can provide for transferring one or more delivery packages housed within a delivery service pod to a delivery/transfer drone (e.g., an aerial drone, ground-based drone, etc.). In some implementations, the delivery system can transfer a delivery package to a delivery/transfer drone while the vehicle is stationary or in motion (e.g., traveling to a destination, etc.). For example, in some implementations, a delivery service pod can comprise a package handling unit which can provide for obtaining a delivery package from the delivery service pod and transfer the delivery package to a delivery/transfer drone, for example, to transport the delivery package to another location (e.g., a recipient, a final destination, a different delivery carrier, etc.). In some implementations, a package handling unit can provide for obtaining a delivery package from a delivery drone and storing the package within a delivery service pod as well as transferring a delivery package from a delivery service pod to a delivery/transfer drone.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">As one example, in some implementations, a delivery drone (e.g., an aerial drone, etc.) can approach and land on or hover proximate to a vehicle comprising a delivery service pod. A package can be transferred from the delivery drone to the delivery service pod. Upon nearing or arriving at a package destination (e.g., recipient location, etc.), the delivery service pod can transfer the package to a transfer drone (e.g., a ground-based drone, etc.) that can move the package to the physical delivery location (e.g., complete the last leg of the delivery to the recipient, etc.).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In particular, in some implementations, a delivery service pod associated with a vehicle can include a landing panel unit located on the rooftop of the delivery service pod that provides for interaction between a delivery drone and the delivery service pod. For example, a landing panel unit can be located on the top of a delivery service pod toward the front of a vehicle. The landing panel unit can be deployed from the top of the delivery service pod to allow for a delivery drone to hover above and/or land on the delivery service pod to provide for transferring a delivery package between the delivery drone and the delivery service pod. In some implementations, the landing panel unit can at least partially cover the delivery drone, for example, to provide protection to the drone and/or package from environmental elements. The landing panel unit can provide for extracting a delivery package from a drone and transferring the delivery package to the conveyer within the delivery service pod, for example, in conjunction with a package handling unit. In addition, in some implementations, the landing panel unit can provide for extracting a delivery package from the delivery service pod in conjunction with a package handling unit and transferring the delivery package to a delivery drone.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some implementations, for example where the vehicle associated with the delivery service pod is configured for bi-directional travel, a landing panel unit can be located on the top of a delivery service pod toward the center of the vehicle. The landing panel unit can be deployed from the top of the delivery service pod to allow for a delivery drone to hover above and/or land on the delivery service pod. The delivery drone can hover and/or land on either side of the panel of the landing panel unit based on the direction of travel of the vehicle. In some implementations, the landing panel unit can at least partially cover the delivery drone, for example, to provide protection to the drone and/or package from environmental elements.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some implementations, a delivery drone can lower a package from the delivery drone to the landing panel unit without requiring the drone to land on the delivery service pod. In some implementations, a delivery drone can be configured such that a nose cone of the delivery drone can be raised to provide access to a storage space within the fuselage of the delivery drone from which a package can be extracted.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some implementations, a delivery system associated with a vehicle can provide for transferring a delivery package from a delivery drone that is exterior to the vehicle to a recipient located in the interior passenger cabin of the vehicle. For example, a delivery system can obtain a delivery package from a delivery drone that is positioned proximate to the vehicle (e.g., via a landing panel unit and/or package handling unit). The delivery system can provide for moving the obtained package from the exterior of the vehicle to the interior of the vehicle (e.g., the passenger cabin) such that the package can be provided for retrieval by a recipient in the passenger cabin.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As an example, a vehicle rooftop delivery system can obtain a delivery package, such as hot coffee and breakfast, from a drone that has approached the vehicle indicating it has a delivery for an occupant of the vehicle (e.g., a morning commuter). The delivery system can transfer the package containing the coffee and breakfast from the exterior of the vehicle to the interior of the passenger cabin such that the recipient (the morning commuter on the way to work) can retrieve the package and enjoy their coffee and breakfast during the commute to their destination. In some implementations, the transfer of the package from the drone to the vehicle, as well as the transfer to the recipient in the passenger cabin, can occur while the vehicle is in motion (e.g., traveling to a destination).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In particular, in some implementations, a delivery system associated with a delivery service pod can comprise a dispensing unit which can provide for transferring a package from the delivery service pod to the passenger cabin of a vehicle. For example, in some implementations, the delivery system can be configured with a dispensing unit in a central location of the top of the passenger cabin. The dispensing unit can be deployed from the ceiling within the passenger cabin to allow for a recipient to retrieve the package from the dispensing unit. In an example, a delivery drone can transfer a package for a vehicle passenger to the vehicle's delivery service pod (e.g., via a landing panel unit and/or package handling unit). The delivery system can transfer the package to the dispensing unit and the dispensing unit can deploy down from the cabin ceiling such that a passenger (e.g., the package recipient) can retrieve the package from the dispensing unit while traveling in the vehicle. Alternatively, in some implementations, the delivery system can be biased toward one end of the vehicle (e.g., front of the vehicle, rear of the vehicle) and the dispensing unit can comprise a carousel system within the passenger cabin, which can rotate through a set of delivery positions within the vehicle interior to allow for retrieval of a package by a vehicle passenger.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some implementations, a delivery service pod associated with a vehicle can include an exterior shuttle unit that provides for interaction between a delivery drone and the delivery service pod. The exterior shuttle unit can be configured on the front, rear, and/or side of the delivery service pod. The exterior shuttle unit can provide for extracting a package from a delivery drone and moving the package to a pass through area configured in the delivery service pod to transfer the package to the vehicle (e.g., to the conveyor of the delivery service pod, to the dispensing unit of the delivery service pod, and/or the like).</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">According to another aspect of the present disclosure, in some implementations, an automated vehicle cleaning system can be integrated with the delivery system in a vehicle. In some implementations, a vehicle cleaning system can comprise a vacuum unit and a robotic manipulator that can be integrated within a central cavity of the rooftop delivery service pod of the delivery system. The robotic manipulator of the vehicle cleaning system can be deployed from the central cavity of the rooftop delivery service pod such that it can perform routine cleaning of the vehicle interior (e.g., after the completion of a service trip, etc.). For example, the vehicle cleaning system can provide for determining when a vehicle interior deviates from an established standard or when objects have been left behind in the vehicle and allow for collection of objects, cleaning and/or sanitizing of exposed interior areas and/or surfaces, and/or the like, through the use of the robotic manipulator. In some implementations, a vehicle cleaning system can determine and/or receive an indication that a service trip has been completed (e.g., passengers have exited the vehicle at the destination, etc.) and the vehicle cleaning system can then initiate a cleaning routine (e.g., for the interior of the passenger cabin, etc.). The central cavity of the rooftop delivery service pod can be configured such that the cavity is covered and secured when the cleaning system robotic manipulator is stowed, such that the robotic manipulator is isolated from riders within the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some implementations, the robotic manipulator can include a robotic arm comprised of multiple arm segments and joints (e.g., rotary joints, etc.) to allow the robotic manipulator to access all of the exposed surfaces and/or areas within the vehicle interior that may need to be cleaned after a service trip is completed. For example, in some implementations, the robotic manipulator can be configured with a plurality of adjacent arm segments and joints based on the location of the robotic manipulator within the vehicle to provide desired degrees of freedom (e.g., five degrees of freedom, seven degrees of freedom, etc.) to allow the robotic manipulator access to all the areas and/or surfaces to be cleaned. The robotic manipulator can be configured to identify and collect personal items left in the vehicle by a user (e.g., user objects), to collect and remove refuse objects (e.g. trash) left in the vehicle, and to clean areas and/or surfaces of the vehicle interior, including vacuuming debris and/or sanitizing the areas and/or surfaces. In some implementations, the robotic manipulator can be further configured to manipulate components of the vehicle, such as closing compartments, doors, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some implementations, the multiple adjacent arm segments and joints of the arm of the robotic manipulator can have a hollow configuration, such as by defining one or more cavities, channels, etc., to provide for routing a vacuum path through the arm of the robotic manipulator (e.g., in flow communication with a vacuum unit), as well as separate power and/or data cable paths through the robotic manipulator arm. For instance, the arm segments/joints may define a hollow vacuum channel for providing a vacuum path through the arm and one or more additional hollow channels for routing power cables, data cables, and/or the like through the robotic manipulator arm. The robotic manipulator can further comprise a gripper unit disposed at a distal end of the arm that can be configured to collect user objects and/or refuse objects as well as provide a vacuum nozzle for the cleaning system (e.g., in flow communication with the vacuum path through the arm). In some implementations, the gripper unit can further comprise a means for sanitizing and/or sterilizing areas of the vehicle interior, such as through the use of ultraviolet light. In some implementations, the robotic manipulator can include one or more sensors, such as a camera, etc., that can be used to inspect the vehicle interior and identify objects left behind to be collected (e.g., user objects, refuse objects, etc.) and/or identify areas that need to be cleaned.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">According to an aspect of the present disclosure, the automated cleaning system can operate in a largely autonomous mode, for example, by performing one or more defined cleaning routines within fixed areas of the vehicle interior. In some implementations, the automated cleaning system can highlight an area to be cleaned and obtain and execute a motion path to perform the cleaning of that area. For example, in some implementations, one or more sensors can be used to inspect each area of the vehicle interior to identify if any objects were left in the vehicle that should be collected (e.g., user objects, refuse objects, etc.) and/or identify if an area needs to be cleaned (e.g., vacuumed and/or sanitized, etc.), such as after the completion of a vehicle service, for example. The automated cleaning system can then implement one or more appropriate motion paths to allow the robotic manipulator to access the designated area and perform the necessary actions.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">As an example, in some implementations, the one or more sensors (e.g., camera, etc.) can be used to identify personal items (e.g., user objects) that may have been left behind in the vehicle by a user. The robotic manipulator can be used to collect the object(s) (e.g., using the gripper end) and deposit the object(s) into a collection receptacle within the vehicle where it can be stored until it can be returned to the user. For example, one or more collection receptacles can be configured within the vehicle for the storage of user objects and the robotic manipulator can place a collected user object into one of the collection receptacles (e.g., after completion of a service trip, etc.) such that the user object can be securely stored until the user object can be returned to or retrieved by the user. Additionally, in some implementations, the robotic manipulator can be further configured to provide for handling objects within the vehicle (e.g., packages to be delivered to a recipient external to the vehicle, recovered user objects to be returned to a prior passenger, etc.) and extending outside the vehicle to allow a recipient external to the vehicle to retrieve the object.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In another example, the automated cleaning system can identify larger debris (e.g., refuse objects such as containers, papers, etc.) left in the vehicle (e.g., via one or more sensors, etc.) and deploy the robotic manipulator to collect the larger debris and deposit it into a collection receptacle configured for storage of refuse objects within the vehicle to be held until it can be removed, for example, during a vehicle service. Additionally, in some implementations, the automated cleaning system can be configured to allow the robotic manipulator to collect larger debris and deposit the debris at a location external to the vehicle (e.g., a refuse container at the roadside, a collection point at a service location, etc.).</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The systems and methods described herein provide a number of technical effects and benefits. For instance, the systems and methods described herein can provide for an automated delivery system that can allow for improved trip efficiency by allowing for understanding of travel patterns to align deliveries to coincide with passenger travel routes and/or times, thereby optimizing the distance traveled by a vehicle. The systems and methods described herein can also provide technical effects and benefits of allowing for buffering deliveries to coincide with non-peak passenger travel time such that the in-service time of a vehicle can be maximized.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Additionally, the systems and methods described herein provide the technical effect and benefit of providing separation between a delivery unit and a passenger cabin, such that delivery contents can be isolated from passengers, thereby limiting potential irritation of passengers within the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">With reference to the figures, example embodiments of the present disclosure will be discussed in further detail.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts an example of an autonomous vehicle <b>100</b> with an integrated delivery system according to example embodiments of the present disclosure.
