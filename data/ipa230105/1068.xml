id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">A system, method, and apparatus for the collection of surgical/wound fluid from a subject patient with the capability of simultaneous fluid removal from a plurality of such wounds and/or wound through the utilization of a single pump device worn by such a patient. Such a system, method, and apparatus allow for such a single pump device to collect surgical/wound fluid within a single site collection component attached to or associated with such a single pump device. Multiple fluid transfer lines may be incorporated with the single pump device leading to such plurality of wounds and/or wound sites for greater versatility and comfort for the subject patient, as well as cleaner removal capabilities than in the standard apparatus systems and method currently undertaken within the industry.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000"

Once the bulbs are filled, the patient or an aide empties the contents into a measuring cup, measures and reports the amounts of collected fluid to the healthcare provider. The daily collected amount is the determinant of the clinical decision, i.e., the removal of the drains. Patients strongly dislike the drains due to quality of life issues, but yet it is their self-reported values that determine the clinical course. This conflict of interest jeopardizes the optimal care of the patient.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Despite prior attempts to reduce the risk of postoperative seromas due to large flap forming surgeries, no single technique has been shown to eliminate the risk completely. Current solutions are passive, tend to clog, are ineffective in removing fluid, are much disliked by patients and healthcare providers, and lack any diagnostic capability.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">One of the major issues with post-surgical fluid management is the storage of the collected fluids. There are large amounts of fluid that is collected in patients who undergo large void-forming surgeries. This results in large volumes to be collected, measured, and emptied. The patients wear graduated bulbs in which fluid is collected and measured by patients themselves. Multiple issues relate to this: (1) fluid is collected only after all the air is removed from the abdomen; (2) patients have to pour the fluid in a measuring cup, measure, record, and report to their healthcare provider, (3) maintenance of sterility is difficult. In order to effectively remove the fluid in a continuous manner, air must be removed from the collection reservoir. Otherwise, either the reservoir is filled quickly with air/liquid mixture and emptying must take place to remove fluid often, or the reservoir overfills leading to high pressure levels and possibly backflow.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Devices which are designed to remove serous or serosanguinous fluid from the internal percutaneous space of a patient after surgery are cumbersome for patients to manage, and apply severely limited pressure to the internal space resulting in ineffective drainage and the development of blockages in the drainage lines.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, there is a need for a device that that addresses these problems and issues with a comprehensive approach.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Additionally, there is lacking the ability to provide efficient and effective surgical (or wound) fluid removal from more than one site by a single device simultaneously within the prior art. There are instances where a patient undergoes a plurality of surgical procedures, or, alternatively, suffers multiple wounds during an accident, as examples, that require more than one active fluid removal actions at the same time. Whether in terms of a surface injury with a deep tissue wound at the same site or with a surface injury and a separate surface injury at different sites or deep tissue wounds at different sites or surface and deep tissue wounds at different sites, with, of course, the potential for more than two such injuries in whatever combination possible, there is no fluid removal device that provides a single point of fluid intake and thus removal from all such sites simultaneously. The closest type is of the potential for a surface incision having fluid removed therefrom with a deeper intake provided below the exact incision. In such a situation, the system utilized is specific to such a configuration and requires exactness as to the layout with the lower intake component just below the surface, not within a deep tissue position, and certainly not within the ability to provide such fluid removal at any other location other than strictly at the same surgical incision location. As such, again, there is no teaching that provides a single device capability for simultaneous surgical (or wound) fluid removal from multiple sites. To the contrary, then, a further development provides such a beneficial and effective method and system.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In various exemplary embodiments, the present disclosure comprises a system and apparatus for the collection of serous or serosanguinous fluid from the percutaneous site after surgery. There are large amounts of fluid that collect in patients who undergo large void-forming surgeries. This results in large volumes to be collected, measured, and emptied. In order to effectively remove the fluid in a continuous manner, air must be removed from the collection reservoir. Otherwise, either the reservoir is filled quickly with air/liquid mixture and emptying must take place to remove fluid often, or the reservoir overfills leading to high pressure levels and possibly backflow.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In several embodiments, the present invention makes use of a powered source of negative pressure which helps overcome clogging observed in prior art devices, and one or more reservoirs which allow excess air to be removed. The invention comprises disposable reservoirs with one-way valves that are easy to handle while maintaining sterility and a seal to prevent the loss of vacuum. The present invention further provides continuous negative pressure suction which assists in providing constant drainage. Prior art devices do not provide a means of applying continuous negative pressure to the percutaneous wound site.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In addition, the measurements of the output can be performed automatically, relieving the need for the patient to perform measurements directly (and thus resolving the potential conflict of interest in self-measuring so that the best clinical decisions can be made). The measurements of output can be relayed to the caregiver, doctor, or the nurse via wired or wireless communications, and enables patients who do not have companions to manage their drain care. There is a potential diagnostic value in taking various measurements associated with the collected fluid. Measurements can include and are not limited to collected fluid amount, pH, certain known harmful mediators (cytokines, chemokines, reactive oxygen species), protein levels, blood content, etc. For example, amount of fluid collected can be an indicator of possible seroma development in some hernia surgeries. Additionally, pH has also been shown to act as an indicator of possible seroma formation. The present invention thus allows for the detection of infectious materials, and any other chemicals or substances which may indicate infection, or the presence of some medical condition which may naturally arise in response to the surgical procedure, initial pathology, or additional complications (of either the surgical procedure or the initial pathology) in the fluid collected from percutaneous (internal) wounds.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The ability to provide simultaneous removal from different surgical and/or wound sites with the same vacuum device creates significant efficiencies, particularly through the avoidance of &#x201c;grenades&#x201d; at multiple sites. In other words, the standard &#x201c;grenade&#x201d; type surgical fluid removal devices required a plurality at each site to ensure any degree of fluid transfer. The ability to utilize a single vacuum device with multiple reliable suction lines thus allows for a much cleaner, far less cumbersome, and superiorly effective manner of providing safer conditions for subject patients to heal.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">As noted herein, any standard type of vacuum device may be utilized to perform such multiple location fluid removal actions simultaneously; however, it has been found and realized that peristaltic pumps provide certain benefits that allow for greater reliability and, overall, safer results. In particular, the ability for such peristaltic pumps to stop quickly, but further to reverse easily and without any appreciable, let alone potential, harm to the motor(s) therein, provides significant improvements over standard air pumps (and other like types). For instance, regardless of the type of device utilized for such fluid removal, a vacuum is applied, thereby leaving the system susceptible to potential problems due to clogging of the fluid removal line. Alternatively, such a device has no indicator available providing the user (or health care provider, for that matter) if the total amount of fluid present at the surgical/wound site has been truly transferred external of the subject patient. Thus, the system may suffer from a situation wherein the device continues to apply suction and such an action results in a back up due to either of a clog or the lack of any further fluid to be removed. A typical vacuum device (air pump, grenade type, for instance) has no way to determine what problem may be encountered, leaving the user or provider with removing the line from the patient to check for a clog empirically. If no clog is present, it may be surmised that the device has completed the desired fluid removal from the target site. To the contrary, however, is the ability to determine any such problem (clog or finished removal) without having to remove (and thus deal with a cumbersome if not &#x201c;messy&#x201d; situation) the vacuum line from the patient. The inclusion of appropriately situated sensors within the target line combined with the ability to reverse a peristaltic pump without harming the device and/or system, overcomes any such issues. For example, with a sensor located at the line's end within the patient (e.g., adjacent the fluid ingress point within the line itself), if the device exhibits a vacuum lock (due to a clog or completed fluid removal), the user or provider may simply stop the peristaltic pump and reverse for a short period (1-2 seconds, for instance). With the sensor in place, if a clog is present, the sensor will either indicate the movement of the clog back out of the line, or no movement at all of fluid or anything else, essentially denoting the clog is rather strong and thus requires manual removal. If the fluid removal has finished, the reversal will force any fluid within the line back within the patient through the line, particularly without any push back force (due to a clog, for example). Thus, such a peristaltic pump device allows for such a determination. If the fluid removal has completed, the line can then be removed without any excess fluid flowing therefrom as it is being taken from the subject patient. If a clog is present, either the reverse direction of the pump will dislodge it or the user/provider will know it is serious enough to require manual removal, thereby allowing for preparation of such a line removal, as well. In any event, such a peristaltic pump device allows for such simplified manners of system monitoring, combined with the cleaner and less cumbersome practice related thereto, particularly as compared with &#x201c;grenade&#x201d; type fluid removal devices. Again, although standard air (or even hydraulic, etc.) pumps may be utilized for the multiple location removal systems disclosed herein for simultaneously fluid removal from a plurality of surgical/wound sites, the peristaltic pump device(s) further disclosed herein are potentially preferred, particularly in view of the beneficial reversible pressure applications (on the fly, for that matter) for improved operations (e.g., again, determine clog, system finishing, etc.), and thus overall greater reliability and, ostensibly, cleaner operations, as well.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The utilization of a single vacuum device with multiple vacuum assemblies allows, again, for the placement of a single unit for such a purpose, thereby permitting a user (patient) the potential for a more comfortable placement of such a device as worn during fluid removal operations. The multiple vacuum assemblies thus further accord the ability to access a plurality of different surgical wound (or other like) sites on a single patient for simultaneous draining capabilities. As noted throughout, such sites may be deep wounds (such as well below the cutaneous and possibly subcutaneous layers thereof) as well as surface wounds (such as within cutaneous and possibly subcutaneous layers). The utilization of two vacuum assemblies within the same device simultaneously (with attached fluid removal lines leading through the device to collection chambers) thus may allow for access to fluid within a deep wound and a surface wound, two deep wounds, or two surface wounds, again, simultaneously. Additionally, however, due to the vacuum strength involved, the user (patient) may be configured with even more fluid removal lines attached to two vacuum assemblies within the same device (and leading to at least one, potentially more, collection chambers, particularly within or attached the same vacuum device) for access to even more wound sites. For instance, a first fluid removal line leading from a vacuum component (pump) may lead to a splitter device that includes two or more separate fluid removal lines leading therefrom to two or more wound sites. A second fluid removal line leading from the same device, but the other vacuum component (pump) may also lead to a separate splitter device that includes another st of separate fluid removal lines in the same manner. Thus, instead of just two wound sites involved for fluid removal simultaneously, the number may be doubled, even tripled, or even higher, on demand. Such a splitter device may thus be completely open in terms of continuous vacuum pressure application for fluid removal from each accessed wound site, or such may be controlled through, for example, a stopcock, or like device, that may allow for one line to remain open while one or more of the others is closed, permitting selected fluid removal (for instance, if one wound site is of a larger type generating a greater amount of fluid, or, perhaps, as another non-limiting alternative, the user, or health care professional aiding with such an activity, desires to access one or more wound sites for fluid removal for analytical reasons for a certain time period). In any event, such an overall capability allows for selective or, at least, continuous access for fluid removal purposes with a single vacuum device. It should be evident, as well, that even if the vacuum device has two separate vacuum components (pumps) such a plurality wound site access potential may be achieved through the utilization of only one such pump with a single fluid removal line leading to a splitter for multi-fluid removal line access purposes, as alluded to above. Thus, the system(s) and method(s) disclosed herein permit significant versatility with a single worn vacuum device, providing the user (patient) and, for the most part, the health care field, a noticeable improvement in terms of comfort, cleanliness, and overall efficiency as it concerns effective and desirable surgical and/or wound fluid removal.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The plurality of sites for fluid removal with a single device and/or system, as well as the beneficial operations due to safe reversible vacuum application on demand, are discussed in greater detail

Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In various exemplary embodiments, the present invention comprises a system and apparatus for the collection of serous or serosanguinous fluid from the percutaneous site after surgery. There are large amounts of fluid that collect in patients who undergo large void-forming surgeries. This results in large volumes to be collected, measured, and emptied. In order to effectively remove the fluid in a continuous manner, air must be removed from the collection reservoir. Otherwise, either the reservoir is filled quickly with air/liquid mixture and emptying must take place to remove fluid often, or the reservoir overfills leading to high pressure levels and possibly backflow.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In several embodiments, the present invention makes use of a powered source of negative pressure which helps overcome clogging observed in prior art devices, and one or more reservoirs which allow excess air to be removed. The invention comprises disposable reservoirs with one-way valves that are easy to handle while maintaining sterility and a seal to prevent the loss of vacuum. The present invention further provides continuous negative pressure suction which assists in providing constant drainage. Prior art devices do not provide a means of applying continuous negative pressure to the percutaneous wound site.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In addition, the measurements of the output can be performed automatically, relieving the need for the patient to perform measurements directly (and thus resolving the potential conflict of interest in self-measuring so that the best clinical decisions can be made). The measurements of output can be relayed to the caregiver, doctor, or the nurse via wired or wireless communications, and enables patients who do not have companions to manage their drain care. There is a potential diagnostic value in taking various measurements associated with the collected fluid. Measurements can include and are not limited to collected fluid amount, pH, certain known harmful mediators (cytokines, chemokines, reactive oxygen species), protein levels, blood content, etc. For example, amount of fluid collected can be an indicator of possible seroma development in some hernia surgeries. Additionally, pH has also been shown to act as an indicator of possible seroma formation. The present invention thus allows for the detection of infectious materials, and any other chemicals or substances which may indicate infection, or the presence of some medical condition which may naturally arise in response to the surgical procedure, initial pathology, or additional complications (of either the surgical procedure or the initial pathology) in the fluid collected from percutaneous (internal) wounds.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an exemplary embodiment of the present system. Drainage structures <b>3</b> begin in the percutaneous space, extend through the percutaneous tissue at an exit site <b>2</b> and terminate in the multiple-drainage-structure manifold <b>4</b>. A pump <b>6</b> creates a negative pressure in the connection <b>5</b> between the pump <b>6</b> and manifold <b>4</b> and imparts a negative pressure to the single or multiple drainage structures <b>3</b>. The pump <b>6</b>, by employing either a peristaltic mechanism, positive displacement, or some other source conveys positive pressure to the collected fluid after it enters the pump unit, which causes the fluid to be transported to the disposable reservoir <b>8</b>. A series of one way valves which may be placed at either one or all of the following locations ensure the prevention of backflow: at the manifold entrance, pump entrance and exit, and reservoir entrance.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The pump <b>6</b> is controlled by means of an onboard processor which may take as inputs from the user the following: on/off; desired pump pressure; and device communication parameters (i.e., mobile device connectivity and the selection of default mobile device). Additionally, the onboard processor may take as inputs from the device the following: pump pressure differential (between exit <b>2</b> and pump entrance); flow rate at manifold (for each individual drainage structure or for all drainage structures combined); motor current draw; device orientation with respect to force of gravity (from accelerometer); presence of bacterial or pathogenic substances; immune system indicators; battery charge level; or any value relevant to the operation of the device.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">The device may communicate via Bluetooth or some other communication protocol (e.g., BLE, NFC) to a mobile device or to a larger cellular network in order to provide information regarding the performance of the device (e.g., battery charge level, need to change reservoir, device temperature, current magnitude of negative pressure, presence of blockage in tubing, or any other relevant information which may be of benefit to either the patient, their nurse, their doctor, their caregivers, their family, or any interested party) and the characteristics of the collected fluids. These characteristics may include, but are not limited to, the following: total collected amount (either total or per drainage structure); rate of fluid collection (total or per drainage structure) over one or more time scales (e.g., hours, days, or weeks); presence of infectious materials; and the presence of any other chemicals or substances which may indicate infection or the presence of some medical condition which may naturally arise in response to the surgical procedure, initial pathology, or additional complications (of either the surgical procedure or the initial pathology) in the fluid collected from percutaneous (internal) wounds. This information may be relayed to a mobile computing device, personal computer, or any computer or database system which may be accessed by the staff of an inpatient or outpatient medical center, the patient, their nurse, their doctor, their caregivers, their family, or any interested party as allowed by law. This information may be accessed by a purposefully designed mobile application on the mobile computing devices of the patient, their nurse, their doctor, their caregivers, their family, or any interested party as allowed by law.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a perspective view of a pump <b>9</b>, manifold <b>10</b>, and disposable reservoir <b>11</b> placed onto an abdominal binder <b>8</b>. This arrangement comprises a single unit generally placed at the end of the surgical procedure. The device components may connect to the binder by means of a removable fastening system so that it may be removed from the binder to facilitate patient comfort. Additionally, the binder may incorporate some means to secure the drainage structure (drainage tubing) at the surgical exit site, and along its path to the pump unit. Furthermore the binder may fasten to itself (forming a continuous loop) by means of hook-and-loop fabric connection, buckle connector, or button snap connector(s). The location at which the pump unit attaches to the abdominal binder may incorporate some means of heat mitigation, such as, but not limited to, an open-cell foam pad, or gel-filled plastic pouch type pad.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">In an alternative embodiment, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a perspective view of a combined pump, manifold, and disposable reservoir unit <b>14</b> placed on a bra <b>13</b> or mastectomy binder, which is commonly used following a mastectomy procedure. This allows a single unit which is generally to be placed at the end of the surgical procedure. The device <b>14</b> may connect or be attached to the bra <b>13</b> by means of a removable fastener (as described above) so that it may be removed from the binder to facilitate patient comfort. Additionally, the bra may incorporate some means to secure the drainage structure (drainage tubing) at the surgical exit site, and along its path to the pump unit.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-B</figref> shows views of possible internal drainage structures placed inside of the percutaneous space at the time of surgery. A hollow flexible tube <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> may be perforated, or may incorporate some cross section which facilitates the drainage of fluid and prevents tissue ingrowth into the tubing. Scaffolding <b>15</b>, <b>19</b> holds the drainage structure in the conformation which increases surface area. The scaffolding units may be biodegradable or resorbable, and may incorporate different geometry, number, or conformation than shown in the figures. Additionally, these scaffolding units may incorporate antibacterial substances, or any substance which may aid in the tissue apposition of the wound space, healing, infection prevention, blood clot formation, or any other medically useful property. The scaffolding may adhere to the surface of the drainage tubing, or may incorporate such geometry as is necessary to allow the scaffolding to completely encapsulate the drainage tubing at the points of intersection. The drainage structure continues <b>17</b> through the percutaneous tissue through the exit site and terminates at the fluid collection unit or drainage bulb. While the drainage structures shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-B</figref> are embodiments of the unique drainage structure, many other possible configurations are possible which utilize resorbable or biodegradable scaffolds to form the geometry of the drainage suture.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a perspective view of one embodiment of the pump mechanism. The top housing (front <b>28</b> and rear <b>23</b>) provides the main structural support for the device, and may also provide the contact path necessary for the peristaltic action or positive displacement to occur. Furthermore, it may house all necessary electronic components which include, but are not limited to, the microprocessor/microcontroller, the battery charging components, the user interface components (buttons, switches, displays), the communication components and circuitry, and all necessary wiring and small components. The peristaltic action is accomplished by the central rolling mechanism <b>21</b> sequentially compressing the internal tubing <b>22</b> which may consist of silicone rubber or any similar flexible material which may have desirable properties for this application. The driving force needed to rotate the central rolling mechanism is provided by an electric motor <b>20</b> which may be powered by either a rechargeable or a non-rechargeable battery source. In one embodiment, the motor is a 6V DC motor with a 90 degree output shaft in order to reduce the overall device profile. The majority of the electrical components are contained within the rear device housing <b>23</b>. This also provides some storage space for batteries.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Sterile, one-way valves <b>27</b> prevent backflow of the fluid at both the pump entrance, and also at the pump exit (reservoir entrance). Fluid is transferred from the pump to the reservoir <b>25</b> through either direct connection or via additional tubing <b>24</b> to allow the reservoir to be placed at a distance away from the pump. The reservoir may be either soft flexible plastic or a hard, rigid container, or a combination of both in which a flexible plastic pouch is placed within a rigid outer container. As the reservoir <b>24</b> is placed downstream from the pump unit, it must provide for the release of excess air which may otherwise become trapped in the reservoir. Air-permeable, liquid-impermeable membranes may be incorporated into the reservoir in order to allow this air to escape. Furthermore the entire reservoir may be comprised of an air-permeable, liquid-impermeable material.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">The pump unit may have features which allows it to be easily attached to an abdominal binder, mastectomy binder, or other means of securing the device to the patient. Additionally, an insulator (not illustrated) may be attached to the external surface of the rear device housing <b>23</b> to protect the patient/user from any excess heat generated by the device itself during operation. In a further exemplary embodiment, a sound insulator/reduction component or structure to reduce the sound waves generated by the unit may also be attached to the external surface of the rear device housing. The sound insulator/reduction component may reduce both actual sound volume as well as amplitude thereof, in order to provide a more comfortable situation for the patient/user.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a cutaway view of an embodiment of the reservoir. The reservoir is compartmentalized by segmenting structures <b>34</b> (in the case of a rigid reservoir) or by the heat-sealed or pressed structure (in the case of a flexible pouch-like reservoir). These segmenting structures prevent the splashing or excessive or irregular movement of fluid <b>200</b> in the reservoir, and provide a sequential filling order of the reservoir to limit the amount of fluid present in the final segment, in which gas-permeable, liquid-impermeable membranes <b>32</b> allow the escape of air. Fluid <b>200</b> is transferred from the pump unit into the reservoir through a quick-release connection <b>28</b>. A one-way valve <b>29</b> prevents the backflow of fluid when disconnecting the reservoir from the pump unit. A significant distinction between this reservoir and prior art devices is that the reservoir of the present invention is designed to be disposed of and replaced by a new, clean reservoir each time the fluid fills a reservoir. This significantly improves the patient experience in that they no longer must empty the drain reservoir and replace it.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">At the end of the reservoir furthest from the intake connection <b>28</b> is a chamber which may contain some compound <b>33</b>, such as activated carbon, which both hinders the flow of fluid should it gain entry to the chamber, but also removes any odor from the air which is to be released from the reservoir. A mesh (foam or otherwise) filter <b>31</b> prevents excess fluid from backing up against the first gas-permeable, liquid-impermeable membrane <b>32</b>. The end segment is constructed in such a way as to maximize gas release, and minimize the leakage of fluid. In the embodiment shown, three sequential membranes <b>32</b> are utilized in order to prevent the escape of fluid from the reservoir.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Additionally, the reservoir may make use of an onboard system (electronic or otherwise) for measuring certain characteristics of the collected fluid. These characteristics may include, but are not limited to, the following: total collected amount; rate of fluid collection on the time scales of hours, days, or weeks; presence of infectious materials; and any other chemicals or substances which may indicate infection; or the presence of some medical condition which may naturally arise in response to the surgical procedure, initial pathology, or additional complications (of either the surgical procedure or the initial pathology) in the fluid collected from percutaneous (internal) wounds.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">For example, in one embodiment the reservoir may make use of a fluorescent-based assay for detecting the presence of bacteria, by using a photosensitive sensor to detect the light emitted by excitation of the fluorescent compound in the presence of bacteria. The reservoir may also make use of external graduation markings in combination with a transparent material to allow easy monitoring of fluid collection.

This manifold allows the connection of one or many drainage inputs. In this embodiment, four input connections are shown; however the manifold may comprise fewer inputs or greater inputs. Each drainage tubing line <b>49</b> is secured to the manifold by a connector <b>50</b> (which may be a barbed fitting and quick-disconnect combination). This connector <b>50</b> may allow for the input of many different sizes of drainage tubing via adaptor fittings or through inherent design.

These channels <b>52</b> direct the fluid into separate measurement units <b>53</b> which collect information about the characteristics of the collected fluid. These characteristics may include, but are not limited to, the following: total collected amount; rate of fluid collection on the time scales of hours, days, or weeks; presence of infectious materials; and any other chemicals or substances which may indicate infection, or the presence of some medical condition which may naturally arise in response to the surgical procedure, initial pathology, or additional complications (of either the surgical procedure or the initial pathology) in the fluid collected from percutaneous (internal) wounds. This information may then be relayed to an onboard processor <b>58</b> for additional processing before being forwarded on to the processor in the pump device. A collection unit <b>55</b> channels all fluid into single channel. The manifold may include another one-way valve <b>56</b> at the exit <b>57</b> which may make use of a quick-disconnect connector or may transfer the fluid directly the pump unit. In this embodiment, the manifold, itself, does not possess any means of moving the collected fluid but rather relies on the action of the downstream pump device. The manifold may be separable from the pump device or may be a continuous molded unit with the body of the pump device.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> shows an overview of a unique mechanism within the peristaltic pump device which prevents a high pressure in the system downstream from the central rolling unit <b>63</b>. This is useful particularly when the reservoir is removed from its connection to the upstream collected fluid. A one-way valve or valves may be positioned both before and after the reservoir connection, and the upstream valve likely will have some residual pressure against it which may cause an amount of fluid to leak when the reservoir is disconnected. This mechanism allows the central rolling unit to automatically reverse, i.e., turn in a direction opposite the direction it must turn to normally pump the fluid. This is achieved via a spring <b>65</b> at the attachment between the motor output shaft <b>64</b> and the body of the central rolling unit <b>63</b>. When the motor is stopped the spring naturally unwinds or uncoils, causing the central rolling unit to turn with it some amount. This causes the point at which the rollers contact the tubing <b>66</b> to shift, causing the fluid to be pushed backwards opposite its normal flow direction. A section of compliant tubing <b>60</b> allows the influx of excess fluid without causing a higher than optimal pressure to develop in the tubing. A one-way valve <b>59</b> prevents the fluid from back flowing through the pump entrance <b>58</b>. The arrows <b>58</b> and <b>67</b> show the normal direction of fluid transport. The direction of fluid transport caused by this mechanism (when the motor is stopped) is opposite the direction denoted by the arrows. Not shown is the pump housing, which holds all components and allows the peristaltic action of the pump.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is an overview of one embodiment of a mechanism to allow the preservation of a &#x201c;stripping&#x201d; or &#x201c;milking procedure&#x201d;, and also allow for the collection of large materials, which can cause problems in the pump(s). The &#x201c;milking&#x201d; or &#x201c;stripping&#x201d; procedure is currently prescribed as a method to clear blockage in the drainage structure, and calls for the user to apply pressure using their fingers to the tubing above the blockage and, in a peristaltic nature, moving their fingers down the tubing past the blockage, promoting a restored flow. As several exemplary embodiments of the present utilize a peristaltic pump, which occludes flow if stopped, some mechanism is needed to accommodate the &#x201c;stripping&#x201d; or &#x201c;milking&#x201d; procedure. This mechanism consists of one or more one-way valves <b>68</b> (generally one per drainage connection) immediately after the connection to the drainage structure, which prevents backflow of fluid or particles into the tubing. Immediately downstream of the one-way valve is a chamber (or chambers) <b>70</b> to receive fluid and particles, the latter of which may potentially block downstream components in the device and inhibit flow. At the exit of this chamber is a filter or screen <b>69</b>, which prevents larger particles from moving further downstream. This entire chamber may be removable, in which case seals <b>74</b> are incorporated to prevent fluid leakage by occluding the gap necessary to facilitate removal of the chamber. Downstream of this chamber, the tubing bifurcates with one channel facilitating fluid transport to the pump(s) <b>71</b> and a second &#x201c;bypass&#x201d; channel facilitating fluid transport around the pump when the &#x201c;milking&#x201d; or &#x201c;stripping&#x201d; procedure is performed. A one-way valve <b>73</b> is placed in the second channel to prevent backflow of fluid during normal pump operations. The valve remains closed, and the bypass channel thus is shut-off to fluid flow during normal operations. The two tubing channels converge to a single channel downstream from the pump and one-way valve, facilitating fluid transport to the remainder of the device <b>72</b> or to the output reservoir.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is an exploded view of an exemplary embodiment of an assembled device incorporating the elements described above. Fluid inlet connectors <b>86</b> (either barbed or otherwise) allow for the connection of one or multiple drainage structures or tubes (as described above) to the pump unit of the device. In this embodiment, two drainage structures are accommodated; however, additional structures may be provided for by including additional assemblies of the relevant components. For each fluid inlet, immediately downstream of the connector is a one-way valve, as described above, to prevent the backflow of material into the drainage structure. Downstream of the one-way valve is a fluid chamber <b>82</b>, which includes a pressure sensor <b>84</b> to monitor the pressure developed in the device. Tubing allows fluid from this chamber to flow into a peristaltic, or positive displacement, pump <b>83</b>, which applies negative pressure on the upstream side of the pump, and positive pressure on the downstream side. This positive pressure downstream of the pump causes fluid to be transported through the remainder of the pump housing body and connection elements to a reservoir unit <b>77</b>.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">A set of one-way valves <b>79</b>, <b>80</b> may be incorporated at the connection between the pump housing body and the reservoir to prevent fluid leakage during change of reservoirs. The reservoirs may be collapsible in nature which are much more comfortable to the patient, and may be made in a more economic, and environmentally conscious, way as the collapsible reservoir will necessitate a smaller volume of plastic to produce. The reservoir incorporates some means of removably attaching to the pump body, which allows the reservoir to be conveniently detached and replaced by the patient. In this embodiment, a connector <b>78</b> is attached to the reservoir, which mates to a counterpart receptor on the pump housing body.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, the reservoir unit comprises a pair of independent reservoirs as described above. The reservoir thus may contain several channels to allow the fluid from multiple drainage structures to be independently collected. These may be necessary if the healthcare professional desires to independently record the collected fluid amounts. Furthermore, the reservoir may be graduated, either by adhering a label or paint to the reservoir, or by embossing the plastic. These graduations allow the fluid collected fluid amount to be easily assessed.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">The reservoir may also contain a substance intended to sterilize the collected fluid, and may also cause the fluid to congeal. This is necessary for the reservoir to be disposed of as &#x201c;white bag&#x201d; waste, or waste which may be disposed of in landfill without additional treatment. This substance may be contained in a pouch or container within the reservoir or may be freely distributed inside of the reservoir. This pouch or container may be ruptured by the patient in order to disburse the contents, or may simply dissolve within a convenient period of time.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">The reservoir or manifold, or both, may further comprise one or more sensors or measurement devices, internally or externally, or both. These sensors provide diagnostic value in taking various measurements associated with the collected fluid. Measurements can include and are not limited to collected fluid amount, pH, certain known harmful mediators (cytokines, chemokines, reactive oxygen species), protein levels, blood content, etc. For example, amount of fluid collected can be an indicator of possible seroma development in some hernia surgeries. Additionally, pH has also been shown to act as an indicator of possible seroma formation. The present invention thus allows for the detection of infectious materials, and any other chemicals or substances which may indicate infection, or the presence of some medical condition which may naturally arise in response to the surgical procedure, initial pathology, or additional complications (of either the surgical procedure or the initial pathology) in the fluid collected from percutaneous (internal) wounds. Sensors may also be located in the pump unit.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">Detection of a full reservoir may be accomplished by counting the revolutions of the peristaltic pump, or cycles of the positive displacement pump, and then calculating the total displaced fluid. This is made possible because the peristaltic, or positive displacement pump moves a nearly constant amount of fluid or gas with each revolution of its motor. The device may be powered by either consumable or rechargeable batteries <b>85</b> which are held in a battery holder.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">A circuit control board <b>81</b> comprising some or all required electrical components controls the operation of the device. The control board may take as inputs, and make decisions regarding, the following: user inputs via interface buttons; battery charge level; need to change reservoir; device temperature; current magnitude of negative pressure; presence of blockage in tubing; or the characteristics of the collected fluids. These characteristics may include, but are not limited to, the following: total collected amount (either total or per drainage structure); rate of fluid collection (total or per drainage structure) on the time scales of hours, days, or weeks; presence of infectious materials; and any other chemicals or substances which may indicate infection, or the presence of some medical condition which may naturally arise in response to the surgical procedure, initial pathology, or additional complications (of either the surgical procedure or the initial pathology) in the fluid collected from percutaneous (internal) wounds.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">The user interface may comprise a single push-button <b>75</b>, which controls an on/off or pause function, as well as any other functions which are desirable for the operation of the device. One operation may be the selection of desired level of negative pressure. The interface may also consist of a series of lights or a screen which alerts the user to various conditions including, but not limited to, device power state (off/on/paused), selected pressure level, battery charge level, need to change battery, reservoir fill level, need to change reservoir, insufficient vacuum seal at any point in the system, or presence of infections materials, and any other chemicals or substances which may indicate infection, or the presence of some medical condition. The device may apply a negative pressure in the range of 50 mmHg to 700 mmHg below ambient pressure either continuously or intermittently, or operate solely in range from 200 mmHg and 700 mmHg below ambient pressure, either continuously or intermittently. The device may create a constant negative pressure of a desired amount and then allow the motors to momentarily stop, until a time when the onboard pressure sensors detect that the applied pressure has fallen below some desired threshold. Alternatively, the pumps may apply pressure based on a time increment rather than a pressure level.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> shows a perspective view of the assembled pump unit device <b>87</b> and reservoir <b>88</b> as detailed above in the description of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>.

A pair of inlet ports/connectors <b>122</b> with one-way valves and inlet fluid chambers <b>134</b> are located near one end. A push-button interface <b>124</b> is located on the top or front of the pump housing, and a series of lights <b>126</b> are located on the side near the inlet ports (which is generally the top side, when the unit is worn). A battery cover <b>128</b> allows access to the batteries <b>130</b>, which provide power to the circuit control board <b>132</b> and the pump motors <b>138</b>. Pumps <b>136</b> move fluid to the outlet ports/connectors <b>154</b>, which are contained in the reservoir holder <b>150</b>. Pairs of one-way valves <b>142</b> extend from one end of the reservoir unit <b>140</b> (which contains two independent reservoirs in the embodiment shown) and are inserted into the outlet ports/connectors <b>154</b> to attach the reservoir unit to the pump unit. One or more rigid or semi-rigid guides <b>146</b> may be provided to fit into corresponding slots or holes in the reservoir holder <b>150</b>. This establishes connection with a sensor or switch, which enables the control board in the pump unit to determine whether the reservoir unit is attached, as described below. The guides also may help ensure accurate connection and prevent damage to the one-way valves or other connection elements.

Alternatively, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>26</b>A-C</figref>, the fluid inlet ports <b>310</b> may comprise a rotating blade <b>320</b> or rotary apparatus for the same purpose. The blade <b>320</b> may spin within the fixed port by either a powered motor or by the power provided by movement of the fluid. In the latter case, the blade has geometry to transform the fluid flow to rotational force, as well as separate geometry to break-up or divide particles or similar larger material as described above.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">In yet another exemplary embodiment, filters <b>340</b> are provided on a reservoir connection unit <b>330</b> which is attached to one end of the reservoir unit <b>140</b>. When the reservoir connection unit is used to attach the reservoir unit <b>140</b> to the pump unit <b>120</b>, the filter arm <b>342</b> with filters <b>340</b> is inserted into a slot in the end of the pump unit, so the filters <b>340</b> are inserted into the fluid flow lines in the body of the pump unit <b>120</b>. When the reservoir unit is removed (such as by pressing the quick release latch <b>348</b>), the reservoir connection unit and filters are also removed. The reservoir connection unit and filters can be disposed of with the reservoir. In one embodiment, the filters or reservoir connection unit, or both, may be removable from the reservoir unit, and cleaned for re-use.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">In yet another embodiment of the invention, the reservoir unit prevents re-connection to the pump unit after an initial connection to the pump unit (or other suction apparatus). This prevents re-attachment of a presumably full reservoir unit, and the attempted movement of fluid into a full fluid collection reserv01r.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">In a further embodiment of the invention, the pump control unit can detect whether a reservoir unit is connected to the outlet ports/connections, and prevents normal operation (i.e., the pumping of fluid) without a reservoir present to contain the fluid. The detection mechanism may comprise a mechanical switch or latch, the formation or breaking of an optical pathway, or similar mechanism appropriate for determining or confirming proximity.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">The various embodiments of the present invention thus provide substantial improvements and advantages over the prior art. First, the present invention allows multiple drainage tubes to be connected to the same source of negative pressure. Prior art devices lack the functionality to allow the combination of multiple drainage tubes into a common source of negative pressure, thus requiring patients in surgeries necessitating multiple drains to wear multiple instances of the previously described device. Second, the present invention also places the reservoir after the negative pressure source. Prior art systems require the reservoir to be placed between the tubing leading from the internal wound site and the source of the negative pressure, which impairs functioning of the device. For example, gravity's action on the fluid to provide an air space on which the source of negative pressure may act prevents prior art devices from functioning optimally while the patient is in the prone or supine position. Furthermore, the placement of the reservoir in prior art devices increases the working distance between the source of negative pressure and the internal wound, necessitating that it act on a larger volume, reducing the efficiency of the device, and creating a source of oscillating pressure in the case of a temporary blockage which is suddenly freed. Third, prior art devices make use of a perforated internal drain which allows the collection of fluid. The present system comprises a manifold which allows the use of the unique internal drain described herein or the use of one or more of the many conventional internal drainage structures which the surgeon may prefer. Further, the present invention incorporates adaptor fittings which allow any size or sizes (in the case of multiple drain lines) to be utilized.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">Additionally, prior art devices prescribe the application of a pressure regime from 125 mmHg to 200 mmHg below atmospheric. At this range, it is unlikely that the device will impart sufficient force on any impediment to flow which may become lodged in the drainage tubing such as a mass of clotted blood, fibrous material, or small portion of tissue. The present invention may operate at a pressure above 200 mmHg for certain periods of operation, such as the initial drawing together of the separated (surgically or otherwise) tissue and the clearing of a blockage. At other times, the present invention may operate at lower pressures in order to allow a more passive means of suctioning. Further, prior art devices do not incorporate a disposable reservoir, and do not allow neutralizing any odor from the collected fluid. The present invention comprises a fluid reservoir inherently designed to be disposable and is placed downstream from the source of negative pressure, negating the previously described problems with prior art devices.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">Prior art devices do not allow for the accurate measurement of collection fluid, or derivative measurements. The present invention allows for the measurement of the amount of collected fluid in either the input manifold or the reservoir, and further calculates the calculation of the percentage of collected fluid to air which would allow for the prediction of poor suturing and possibly surgical site infection (SSI).

Such a depiction basically shows how certain issues during pump activity within a subject patient are easily understood, thereby permitting facilitated trouble shooting as well as ultimate quick resolution to any such problems (and efficient, cost-effective manners thereof, as well). In this situation, the system is started <b>600</b> with the pump activated and the fluid transfer line placed within a wound, whether internal or at the surface of the subject patient. The motor is then increased in terms of pressure applied <b>601</b> in order to reach the optimal level for such fluid removal. In normal operation, the system will run until the correct vacuum pressure is applied, and will periodically perform a clog detection, and mitigation routine. In such operation, the vacuum pressure is then measured to determine if such pressure has reached or increased above that of the set pressure <b>602</b>. If such a pressure exceeds the set pressure <b>603</b>, then a timer is set in order to reverse pressure application to dislodge a potential clog <b>604</b>. The duration set is then monitored <b>605</b> such that when the full time has expired <b>608</b>, then a mitigation procedure is followed <b>607</b> whereby the peristaltic pump is stopped and run in the opposite direction to determine if a clog is actually present as well as to force such a clog outwards back into the wound where it can be then subjected to higher vacuum pressures as it is brought back into the fluid transfer line (tubing) or otherwise treated through another removal procedure. If the timer has not expired <b>608</b>, then the peristaltic pump motor is paused <b>609</b> as the set pressure is achieved as desired. In any event, such a clog, if present, may be detected in this manner in relation to the facilitated capability of starting, stopping, and running such a peristaltic pump in the opposite direction quickly and effectively. This allows for a clog determination easily in relation to higher vacuum pressures (lower absolute pressure applications) in reaction to such difficulties when in operation. Certainly, if the measured vacuum does not show a higher level than the set pressure from the peristaltic pump itself <b>610</b>, then the user may determine if there is an air leak (or possible exhaustion of fluid to be removed) within the system. Such involves the setting of an air leak timer <b>611</b> to limit the time that the pump will try to establish the set vacuum pressure. Thus, an initial air leak timer is set and may expire <b>613</b> leading to the setting of a further air leak error timer <b>614</b> to further assess the potential for such a leak (or lack of fluid within the wound). If such a timer expires without a change <b>616</b>, then an error is deduced <b>617</b>, allowing for a simple rectification of the issue. If either air leak timer <b>611</b> or <b>614</b> does not expire, the pump is allowed to continue to attempt to reach the set vacuum pressure <b>601</b> and will reassess the situation as needed. In any case, again, such a peristaltic pump allows for quick reversal of pressures and thus effective and quick understanding and resolution of such potential problems within a fluid transfer line.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0155"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b></figref> provides a view of a fluid transfer line <b>502</b> sensors therein <b>504</b>A leading from an internal wound outwardly to an end <b>503</b> (for incorporation eventually within a pump. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>34</b></figref> has a similar set up with a transfer line <b>502</b>A having sensors <b>504</b>B, leading from a surface wound <b>501</b>A to an end <b>503</b>A for introduction/incorporation within a pump device.
