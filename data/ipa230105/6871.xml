For example, in order to limit the control signaling transmitted by a wireless transit/receive unit (WTRU), a DM-RS transmission schedule may be defined such that fewer DM-RSs are transmitted as compared to previous LTE releases. In an example, the location and/or coding of the DM-RS transmissions may be different than that of previous LTE releases in order to reduce signaling overhead. Methods and systems are disclosed for dynamically switching between uplink DM-RS transmission schedule and for performing retransmission with dynamic uplink DM-RS transmission schedule switching.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A WTRU may include a processor. The processor may be configured to determine to use a demodulation reference signal (DM-RS) transmission schedule. For example, the processor may determine to use a DM-RS transmission schedule out of a plurality of DM-RS transmission schedules. The DM-RS transmission schedule may be characterized by a DM-RS transmission being mapped to a single orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) symbol of a subframe of a data stream. As such, the DM-RS transmission may be mapped to a single time slot of the subframe.

The OFDM symbol may be associated with a second time slot of the subframe and the DM-RS transmission schedule may be characterized by PUSCH transmission and/or PUCCH control information being mapped to a corresponding OFDM symbol of a first time slot of the subframe of the data stream. A corresponding OFDM symbol of a time slot may refer to an OFDM symbol of another time slot that has the same relative time or position (e.g., the nth OFDM symbol of the time slots would be corresponding OFDM symbols).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The OFDM symbol may be a last OFDM symbol (e.g., the OFDM symbol in position six or seven depending of the cyclic prefix (CP)) of a first time slot of the subframe.

For example, a layer of small cells may be configured to operate either in a separate frequency band and/or in the same frequency band than the one used by the macro cell layer. The use of such deployments may result in additional capacity being provided via the use of additional spectrum, via cell reuse, and/or due to spectrum efficiency gains that may be achieved due to the channel characteristics of the small cell environment. For example, the distribution of path loss between the small cell and a connected device may be such that large values of signal-to-noise-ratio are achieved more frequently.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The current Long Term Evolution (LTE) specifications are targeted to support a wide range of deployments in terms of cell sizes, environments, and device speeds. As a result, the LTE Release 8 and/or Release 10 physical layer may have been designed and configured in such a way as to meet diverse deployment scenarios. Therefore, the LTE physical layer may not be currently configured in a manner capable of taking full advantage of specific channel characteristics of a small cell environment. For example, uplink coverage may be enhanced via a variety of physical layer techniques that may be designed to operate specifically in the small cell environment.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Examples of small cells may include low-powered radio access nodes (e.g., NBs and/or eNBs) that operate in licensed and unlicensed spectrum, for example, that may have a range of 10 meters to 200 meters (e.g., compared to a mobile macrocell which might have a range of a few kilometers). To support the growth in mobile data traffic, the network may use the small cells to perform data offloading, which may result in a more efficient use of radio spectrum. Such use of small cells for data offloading may facilitate the management of LTE Advanced spectrum more efficiently compared to using just macrocells.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Small cells may include one or more of femtocells, picocells, and/or microcells. Small-cell networks may also be realized using distributed radio technology, for example centralized baseband units and remote radio heads. Beamforming techniques (e.g., focusing a radio signal/energy on a very specific area) may be utilized to further enhance or focus small cell coverage. A common factor in many approaches utilized to deploy small cells may be central management of the small cells by mobile network operators.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Small cells may be deployed on a wide range of air interfaces, for example including GSM, CDMA2000, Time Division Synchronous Code Division Multiple Access (TD-SCDMA), WCDMA, LTE, WiMax, and/or the like. In third generation partnership project (3GPP) terminology, a Home Node B (HNB) may be configured to serve a femtocell and/or some other type of small cell. A Home eNode B (HeNB) may be configured to serve an LTE femtocell and/or or some other type of small cell. A Wi-Fi network may be an example of a small cell that does not operate in licensed spectrum. As a result, it may be more difficult to manage Wi-Fi deployments effectively as compared to small cells that utilize licensed spectrum under the control of a network operator.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">A form of small cells is femtocells. Femtocells were initially designed for residential and small business use, with a short range and a limited number of channels. Femtocells with increased range and capacity spawned a proliferation of terms including metrocells, metro femtocells, public access femtocells, enterprise femtocells, super femtos, Class 3 femto, greater femtos, and microcells. The term &#x201c;small cells&#x201d; may be used as an umbrella term to describe deployments that utilize one of more of these types of lower power and/or limited range cells.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In order to achieve the potential system throughput gains that may be provided via an efficient small cell deployment, the access system may be designed in such a way as to limit the amount of resources that are consumed by overhead. For example, a source of potential overhead may include resources used up by physical signals that do not include user data. An example of physical layer resources that may not carry user information are demodulation reference signals (DM-RSs). Therefore, one or more of the following techniques may be used to modify DM-RS transmission, for example, for small cell deployments to facilitate efficient small cell spectrum use. The methods and systems described herein may be used in any combination.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Although examples to reduce physical layer overhead in order to improve resource utilization may be described with reference to small cell environments, the examples and techniques described herein may be equally applicable to deployment in macro cell environments. Therefore, although certain benefits may be achieved by using the methods and systems described herein in a small cell deployment, embodiments contemplate the utilization of these techniques in macro deployments, and thus this disclosure should not be read to limit the techniques to small cell deployments alone.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">As an example, a WTRU may be able to reduce overhead by altering the transmission schedule for DM-RSs and/or by reducing the overall transmission of DM-RSs within the system. For example, the DM-RS overhead may be reduced by decreasing the number of resource elements (REs) used to transmit DM-RSs. The reduction of DM-RS transmission may be performed in the time domain and/or in the frequency domain. For example, DM-RS transmission may be limited in the time domain by limiting the number of times a given frequency resource may be used for DM-RS transmission per subframe and/or per transmission time interval (TTI). For example, the WTRU may be configured to use a subcarrier such that the subcarrier has a single DM-RS symbol per subframe. In an example, DM-RS overhead reduction may be achieve in the frequency domain, for example by utilizing an OFDM symbol for a combination of PUSCH transmission and DM-RS transmission. Furthermore, hybrid combinations of time and/or frequency DM-RS transmission limitations may be utilized in order to reduce DM-RS transmission overhead.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">A DM-RS transmission may refer to one or more DM-RSs. For example, a DM-RS transmission may be characterized by one or more DM-RSs that may be distributed across one or more REs, one or more PRBs, one or more time slots, one or more OFDM symbols, and/or one or more subframes of a data stream. A WTRU may be configured to select between one or more different DM-RS transmission schedules. A DM-RS transmission schedule may be characterized by one or more of the examples described herein. A DM-RS transmission configuration may refer to one or more DM-RS transmission schedules that may be used in one or more different subframes.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In an example, a DM-RS transmission may be characterized by a DM-RS being transmitted in a single OFDM symbol within a subframe instead of two OFDM symbols per subframe. If a DM-RS is transmitted in a single OFDM symbol per subframe, then the DM-RS would be transmitted in a single time slot of the two time slots of a subframe. As such, the DM-RS may be mapped to a single OFDM symbol of a subframe of a data stream.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">If fewer OFDM symbols are used for DM-RS transmission, then one or more REs that were previously used for DM-RS transmission (e.g., according to Release 8/10) may instead be used for user data transmission and/or control signaling (e.g., via the PUSCH and/or the PUCCH). For example, in Release 8/10, the fourth symbol in the time slot (e.g., third symbol for extended cyclic prefix) may be used to transmit a DM-RS (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>). In an example, the fourth symbol in the time slot (e.g., third symbol for extended cyclic prefix) may be used for transmission of a DM-RS in one of the time slots of a subframe, but not for the other time slot of the subframe. Instead, the symbol that was previously used for DM-RS transmission may be used for PUSCH transmission and/or for some other UL channel.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is a diagram of an example mapping of a DM-RS transmission in a first time slot of a subframe with a normal cyclic prefix.

The DM-RS transmission schedule may be characterized by a DM-RS transmission being mapped to a single OFDM symbol of a subframe of a data stream. As such, the DM-RS transmission may be mapped to a single time slot of the subframe. The OFDM symbol may be associated with a first time slot of the subframe and the DM-RS transmission schedule may be characterized by Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH) transmission and/or Physical Uplink Control Channel (PUCCH) control information being mapped to a corresponding OFDM symbol of a second time slot of the subframe of the data stream (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>). The OFDM symbol may be associated with a second time slot of the subframe and the DM-RS transmission schedule may be characterized by PUSCH transmission and/or PUCCH control information being mapped to a corresponding OFDM symbol of a first time slot of the subframe of the data stream (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>). A corresponding OFDM symbol of a time slot may refer to an OFDM symbol of another time slot that has the same relative time or position (e.g., the nth OFDM symbol of the time slots would be corresponding OFDM symbols).</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The identity of a time slot that includes a DM-RS transmission may be varied across a plurality of subframes, for example, if a single slot per subframe includes an OFDM symbol with the DM-RS transmission. The identity of a time slot may refer to the number or temporal position of the time slot within a subframe (e.g., first time slot or second time slot). For example, there may be a group(s) of subframes where the first time slot includes a DM-RS transmission and another, possibly overlapping, group(s) of subframes where the second time slot includes DM-RS transmission. For example, a data stream may be characterized by an OFDM transmission schedule whereby a DM-RS transmission is incorporated into a single OFDM symbol of a first time slot of one or more subframes (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>) and is incorporated into a single OFDM symbol of a second time slot of one or more subframes (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>). The subframe(s) of the data stream may alternate between subframe(s) that incorporate the DM-RS transmission in the first time slot and subframe(s) that incorporate the DM-RS transmission in the second time slot. The subframe(s) that incorporate the DM-RS transmission in the first time slot may be equal to, greater than, or less than the subframe(s) that incorporate the DM-RS transmission in the second time slot.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In an example, a WTRU may determine the identity of a time slot that includes (and/or does not include) a DM-RS transmission based on the physical resource block(s) (PRB(s)) associated with an allocation. Therefore, the time slot used for DM-RS transmission may vary based on the PRB. For example, there may be a set of PRBs within a subframe where the first time slot includes a DM-RS transmission in an appropriate symbol of the first time slot. There may be a second set of PRBs, possibly overlapping the first set of PRBs, where the second time slot includes a DM-RS transmission in an appropriate symbol of the second time slot.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In an example, the OFDM symbol used for DM-RS transmission may be shifted towards the edge of a time slot.

As a result, a DM-RS from another subframe may be used to estimate the channel for a subframe that does not include a DM-RS transmission.

Thus, a single DM-RS (e.g., the DM-RS included in the fourth OFDM symbol <b>508</b> of the subframe <b>500</b>) may be applicable to multiple subframes (e.g., the subframe <b>510</b>). Although illustrated as being included in the fourth OFDM symbol <b>508</b> of the second time slot <b>504</b> of the subframe <b>500</b>, the DM-RS transmission <b>506</b> may be included in any OFDM symbol of either time slot <b>502</b>, <b>504</b> of the subframe <b>500</b>. Although illustrated as being used for a subsequent subframe, the DM-RS transmission <b>506</b> may be used to estimate the channel for a subframe that precedes the subframe <b>510</b>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In an example, a WTRU may be configured to utilize interlaced frequency division multiplexing (FDM) for DM-RS transmission. For example, a DM-RS transmission may be transmitted over a subset of subcarriers on an appropriate OFDM symbol (e.g., the fourth OFDM symbol for normal cyclic prefix, the third OFDM symbol for extended cyclic prefix, any other OFDM symbol used for enhanced DM-RS, etc.). The subcarriers that are not part of the subset may be used for data user data transmission and/or other control channel transmission (e.g., via the PUSCH and/or the PUCCH).</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">For example, a DM-RS may be interlaced with the PUSCH, PUCCH, and/or any other UL channel. For example, half the subcarriers in a given OFDM symbol may be used for DM-RS transmission, while the other half may be used for PUSCH. As an example, even numbered subcarriers in an OFDM symbol may be used for DM-RS transmission (e.g., DM-RS data is mapped to the REs that correspond to the even numbered subcarriers of the OFDM symbol) while odd numbered subcarriers may be used for PUSCH and/or PUCCH (e.g., PUSCH data is mapped to the REs that correspond to the odd numbered subcarriers with the OFDM symbol), or vice-versa.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In an example, half of the subcarriers typically utilized for DM-RS transmission in a given OFDM symbol (e.g., according to Release 8/10) may be used for DM-RS transmission, while the other half of the REs may be used for other types of data transmission, for example, to reduce DM-RS overhead. In an example, greater or less than half of the subcarriers typically utilized for DM-RS transmission in a given OFDM symbol (e.g., according to Release 8/10) may be used for DM-RS transmission. For example, the total number of subcarriers used for a given DM-RS transmission may be an integer that is less than the total number of subcarriers assigned to the WTRU. In an example, the total number of subcarriers used for DM-RS transmission may remain a multiple of 12, thus enabling the reuse of Zadoff Chu (ZC) sequences designed for legacy DM-RS. Similarly, for the case where some PRBs include DM-RS transmissions and others do not, the number of PRBs that include a DM-RS transmission may be different than the number of PRBs that do not include a DM-RS transmission.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a diagram of an example mapping of DM-RS transmission in a subset of subcarriers of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) symbols of two time slots of a subframe.

If a given PRB does not include DM-RS transmission, then a WTRU may be assigned a plurality of PRBs, where the plurality of PRBs may be a combination of one or more PRBs that include a DM-RS transmission (e.g., in a subset of, or all, subcarriers) and one or more PRBs that do not include a DM-RS transmission. As such, a DM-RS transmission schedule may be characterized by one or more PRBs that do not include a DM-RS transmission and one or more PRBs that include the DM-RS transmission, whereby the PRBs that do include the DM-RS transmission may include the DM-RS transmission in one or more subcarriers of one or more OFDM symbols of the PRB.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">If interlaced FDM is utilized, the peak-to-average-power (PAPR) of the DM-RS portion of an OFDM symbol may be low due to ZC sequence generation. Similarly, the PAPR of the PUSCH portion of the OFDM symbol may be low due to the use of discrete Fourier transform (DFT) precoding. However, if the DM-RS transmission and the PUSCH transmission are multiplexed, it may be that the combination of the two signals (e.g., of which each may be characterized by low PAPR) into a single symbol may result in a transmission that is no longer characterized by a low PAPR. In order to ensure the interlaced symbol retains low PAPR characteristics, a WTRU may be configured to power scale the PUSCH REs accordingly. In an example, a WTRU may use a scaling factor to assist in the demodulation of the scaled PUSCH in the interlaced OFDM symbol. For example, a WTRU may include a scaling value in its transmission to assist in the demodulation of the scaled PUSCH in the interlaced OFDM symbol. In an example, a WTRU may be configured with approved scaling values that it may use in the event of an interlaced symbol losing its low PAPR characteristics.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">In an example, a combination of time and/or frequency multiplexing methods may be used to decrease the number of resources utilized for DM-RS transmission. For example, in some embodiments a single time slot per subframe may be used for DM-RS transmission. The identity of the time slot used for DM-RS transmission may depend on the PRB(s) associated with a given allocation. For example, a WTRU may be configured to utilize DM-RS transmission in the first timeslot of a subframe for a first subset of PRBs (e.g., odd numbered PRBs) and utilize DM-RS transmission in the second timeslot of a subframe for a second subset of PRBs (e.g., even numbered PRBs). In an example, the number of PRBs with that include a DM-RS transmission may be greater, fewer, or equal to in number the number of PRBs that do not utilize DM-RS transmission. In an example, a WTRU may be configured to utilize two (e.g., both) time slots of a subframe for DM-RS transmission for a first subset of PRBs, to utilize a single (e.g., possibly alternating) time slot in a second subset of PRBs, and/or to refrain from transmitting DM-RSs in either timeslot for a third subset of PRBs.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">In an example, a WTRU may use interleaving of PUSCH and/or PUCCH transmissions and DM-RS transmission in both time slots and/or in each PRB. As a result, a given subcarrier may have no DM-RS symbol mapped to it during a slot or subframe, a single DM-RS symbol mapped to it during a slot or subframe, and/or two DM-RS symbols mapped to it during a slot or subframe. For example, for a given PRB, odd numbered subcarriers may include a DM-RS transmission in the appropriate symbol of the first time slot, while even numbered subcarriers may include a DM-RS transmission in the appropriate symbol of the second time slot, or vice versa.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">If interlaced frequency division multiplexing is used to decrease the DM-RS transmission overhead, the sequence (e.g., pilot sequence) used for DM-RS transmission may be modified. For example, the value of the DM-RS sequence mapped to a given resource element in a DM-RS transmission schedule may be the same value that would otherwise be used in the legacy scheme in resource elements for which DM-RS is still transmitted. The same sequence and resource mapping as in the legacy scheme may be used, but with puncturing such that some resource elements may be replaced with PUSCH and/or PUCCH symbols according to a reduction scheme.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">As another example, the DM-RS sequence may be calculated based on the actual number of symbols for resource elements available to the uplink (UL) DM-RS in a given time slot M<sub>sc</sub><sup>RS </sup>which may be smaller than the number of subcarriers in the PUSCH resource allocation M<sub>sc</sub><sup>PUSCH </sup>If the total number of subcarriers used to transmit DM-RS in one time slot is a multiple of 12, a WTRU may reuse the sequence generation method utilized for legacy DM-RS transmission. A WTRU may determine the appropriate sequence length based on the number of PRBs granted and/or the ratio of REs used for DM-RS transmission to total REs. For example, in case of an interlaced frequency division multiplexing scheme in which DM-RS symbols and PUSCH symbols are interspersed within the same time slot, the reference signal sequence may be calculated based on a formula, for example, except that M<sub>sc</sub><sup>RS</sup>=M<sub>sc</sub><sup>PUSCH </sup>(e.g., in case the DM-RS is reduced by a factor of two). The DM-RS to RE mapping may be pre-configured and/or may be performed in an order similar to previous releases, although the WTRU may be configured to skip certain subcarriers if the skipped subcarriers are not to be used for DM-RS transmission. The mapping to resource elements may follow the same rules as a legacy scheme, e.g., by order of subcarrier first and time slot second, within the resource elements designated for DM-RS.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">For cases where the number of subcarriers used to transmit DM-RSs in one symbol is not a multiple of 12, sequences (e.g., new sequences) may be determined that satisfy similar properties as ZC sequences.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">For cases where a single OFDM symbol (e.g., and/or a single time slot) per subcarrier is used for DM-RS transmission, the identity of the symbol (and/or time slot) used for DM-RS transmission may change over time (e.g., as a function of slot number, subframe number, system frame number (SFN), etc.) and/or over frequency (e.g., as a function of subcarrier number, as a function of PRB, etc.). The size of the sequence M<sub>sc</sub><sup>RS </sup>may remain the same as M<sub>sc</sub><sup>PUSCH</sup>. The mapping to resource elements may be modified, for example, such that it may be by order of time slot first and subcarrier second. For the example case where DM-RS transmissions are included in even numbered subcarriers of the appropriate symbol of the first time slot and DM-RS transmissions are included in odd numbered subcarriers in the appropriate symbol of the second time slot, the mapping of a single length 12*N ZC sequence (e.g., where N is the total number of PRBs) may be done sequentially over the subcarriers. Therefore, the first symbol of the ZC sequence may be located in the first subcarrier in the first time slot. The second symbol of the ZC sequence may be located in the second subcarrier in the second time slot. The third symbol of the ZC sequence may be located in the third subcarrier in the first time slot, and the fourth symbol of the ZC sequence may be located in the fourth subcarrier in the second time slot, and so on. Such a mapping approach may be applicable even when groups of adjacent subcarriers have DM-RS transmission(s) in the same time slot. For example, subcarriers 0,1,2 may have DM-RS data in the first time slot, while subcarriers 3,4,5 may have DM-RS data in the second time slot, etc.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">In an example, a WTRU may be configured to and/or triggered by the network to utilize a certain type of DM-RS transmission schedule. For example, the WTRU may be triggered based on detecting and/or moving to a small cell and/or a macro cell. The WTRU may be configured to utilize a certain DM-RS transmission schedule based on explicit signaling received from the network (e.g., radio resource control (RRC) signaling). For example, the network may configure the WTRU to devote greater or fewer resource elements for a DM-RS transmission and/or change the identity of resource elements used for a DM-RS transmission. One or more of the following methods for triggering the WTRU to change its DM-RS transmission schedule may be used in any combination.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">In an example, higher layer signaling (e.g., medium access control (MAC) and/or RRC signaling) may semi-statically indicate the DM-RS transmission schedule to be used by a WTRU. In an example, a message may use a single bit to indicate whether to use a legacy (e.g., Release 8, Release 10, etc.) DM-RS transmission schedule or a DM-RS transmission schedule characterized by reduced overhead (e.g., via a reduction in DM-RS). The DM-RS transmission schedule characterized by reduced overhead may be a schedule that reduces the number of REs used for DM-RS transmission(s). The parameters for the DM-RS transmission schedule characterized by reduced overhead may be tied or linked to the cell physical cell identifier (PCI). For example, small cells may be associated with PCIs linked to DM-RS schedules characterized by reduced overhead and macro cells may be associated with PCIs linked to legacy DM-RS transmission schedules.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">Higher layer signaling may indicate a DM-RS transmission schedule (e.g., whether a reduced DM-transmission schedule is to be used, an indication of the identity of slots and/or subcarriers to use for DM-RS transmission, etc.) In an example, RRC may be utilized to provide a plurality of DM-RS transmission schedules, for example a normal DM-RS transmission schedule and a resource-saving DM-RS transmission schedule. Dynamic signaling (e.g., Layer 1 (L1) signaling such as grants received via the physical downlink control channel (PDCCH), PDCCH orders, and/or MAC control elements (CEs)) may be used to indicate the DM-RS transmission schedule to use, for example, per UL transmission.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">If a DM-RS transmission schedule characterized by reduced overhead is to be indicated dynamically (e.g., by sending an indication of a pre-configured DM-RS parameter set to be used), the configuration may be performed in a variety of ways. For example, downlink control information (DCI) included in a UL grant (e.g., DCI Format 0, DCI Format 4, a new DCI Format, etc.) may include a bit(s) (e.g., a new bit(s)) to indicate the identity of the pre-configured set of parameters to be used. In an example, the configuration of a DM-RS transmission schedule characterized by reduced overhead may be implicitly linked or tied to a PCI and/or virtual cell identifier (VCID), and for example, may be implicitly indicated by a VCID configuration.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">In an example, a DM-RS transmission schedule may be implicitly indicated by based on the properties or parameters associated with an uplink grant. For example, the WTRU may be configured to determine the appropriate DM-RS transmission schedule based on one or more of the allocation size, the Modulation Coding Scheme (MCS) level, the subframe number, the frame number, the transmission mode, whether the grant is associated with semi-persistent scheduling (SPS) or not, and/or the like. In an example, a DCI Format (e.g., a new DCI Format) may be designed to be used with a specific set of DM-RS transmission schedule(s). In an example, the appropriate DM-RS transmission schedule may be linked or tied to whether the UL grant was received in WTRU-specific search space or the common search space within the PDCCH. In an example, a DM-RS transmission schedule(s) may be tied or linked to certain component carriers. Therefore, a WTRU may be implicitly triggered to utilize a DM-RS transmission schedule based on the carrier indicator field (CIF) include in an UL grant.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">A WTRU may be configured to transmit PUSCH and/or PUCCH (e.g., and/or some other UL channel and/or signal) and a DM-RS transmission on the same set of resource elements and/or symbols. For example, DM-RS transmissions and PUSCH transmissions may occupy the same resources in the time domain (e.g., REs within an OFDM symbol may include both DM-RS transmission data and PUSCH transmission data), in the frequency domain (e.g., REs within a subcarrier and/or PRB may include both DM-RS transmission data and PUSCH transmission data), and/or in both the time and frequency domains (e.g., REs may include both DM-RS transmission data and PUSCH transmission data, for example on different transmission layers, separated by different cover codes, etc.). If DM-RS transmissions and PUSCH transmissions are to occupy the same resources, a WTRU may allocate half its transmission power to DM-RS transmission and half to PUSCH transmission (e.g., or to transmission of other UL channel(s) and/or signal(s)).</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">To facilitate demodulation, a WTRU may be configured to utilize orthogonal cover codes (OCCs) to allow for the separation of the DM-RS transmission from the PUSCH transmission, for example if the transmissions are to occupy the same REs. For example, a WTRU may be configured to repeat the same data symbols (e.g., PUSCH transmission) in the two time symbols that are used for DM-RS. Use of appropriate OCC precoding for DM-RS symbols (e.g., [1 1]) and/or PUSCH symbols (e.g., [1 &#x2212;1]) may allow for proper demodulation at the eNB. Such a coding technique may be used in conjunction with examples of DM-RS transmission schedules described herein.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">In an example where PUSCH (e.g., and/or PUCCH) and DM-RS transmission collide (e.g., where a single symbol per subframe is used for DM-RS transmission, etc.), the PUSCH data to be mapped to REs that collide with the DM-RS transmission(s) may be duplicated on other REs colliding with DM-RS, for example in the same symbol. For example, PUSCH data that is to be mapped to REs used for DM-RS transmission may be transmitted on one or more additional REs (e.g., so at least two REs include a copy of the relevant PUSCH data) in order to increase the likelihood of successful reception. For example, if PUSCH data is duplicated across two REs when it is transmitted with a DM-RS transmission, the same DM-RS transmission may also be duplicated in those same RE pairs. If such an approach is utilized, the OCC may be applied over subcarriers rather than over symbols. For example, data of a DM-RS transmission may be mapped to symbol 4 of the first time slot and in subcarriers 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10. In such a case, the PUSCH in subcarriers 0, 2, and 4 may be duplicated in subcarriers 6, 8, and 10. Furthermore, the DM-RS data transmitted on subcarriers 0, 2, and 4 may be duplicated in subcarriers 6, 8, and 10. If an OCC of values [a b] is used for PUSCH transmission and an OCC of values [c d] is used for DM-RS transmission, the values of a, b, c, and/or d may be selected to facilitate the code multiplexing. For example, the PUSCH transmission in subcarriers 0, 2, and 4 may be multiplied by &#x2018;a&#x2019;, while the PUSCH transmission in subcarriers 6, 8, and 10 may be multiplied by &#x2018;b&#x2019;. The DM-RS transmission in subcarriers 0, 2, and 4 may be multiplied by &#x2018;c&#x2019;, and the DM-RS transmission in subcarriers 6, 8, and 10 may be multiplied by &#x2018;d&#x2019;.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">In an example, a WTRU may be configured to interlace PUSCH transmissions (e.g., and/or PUCCH transmissions) with DM-RS transmissions using reserved tones. For example, if PUSCH or other data is interlaced with DM-RS transmissions over different subcarriers within one symbol, the PUSCH data may be produced as an output of a DFT to reduce PAPR, and the DM-RS transmission may be a ZC sequence to also reduce the PAPR. Interlacing the DM-RS transmission and the PUSCH transmission into one time symbol may affect the PAPR properties of the overall symbol. In an example, to decrease the largest peaks of the overall OFDM signal, tone reservation may be used. For example, in one OFDM symbol (e.g., the fourth symbol of the first time slot, for normal cyclic prefix) some subcarriers may be used for DM-RS transmission, other subcarriers may be used for PUSCH transmission, and other subcarriers may be used for reserved tones. The reserved tones may be modulated in such a way that the largest peaks of the overall OFDM signal may be suppressed, which may allow for reduced power-amplifier back-off.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">As an example, a WTRU may be configured with a spacing of three subcarriers between DM-RS transmission REs, PUSCH transmission REs (e.g., and/or PUCCH transmission REs), and reserved tone REs. A different subcarrier shift may be applicable to one or more of the DM-RS transmission, the PUSCH transmission, and the reserved tone transmission, for example to ensure the transmissions do not collide. For example, the DM-RS transmission may be mapped to a first subset of subcarrier (e.g., subcarriers 0, 3, 6, 9) of the appropriate OFDM symbol, the PUSCH transmission may be mapped to a second subset of subcarriers (e.g., subcarriers 1, 4, 7, 10) of the same OFDM symbol, and the remaining subcarriers (e.g., 2, 5, 8, 11) may be reserved for tones configured to decrease the larger peaks of the OFDM signal.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">In an example, one or more of the DM-RS transmission, the PUSCH transmission, and the transmission of the reserved tones may be configured to use some or all subcarriers of respective (e.g., possibly overlapping) sets of PRBs, for example, one or more of the subcarriers within one PRB. In an example, the total number of REs used for DM-RS transmission, the total number of REs used for PUSCH transmission, and/or the total number of REs used for reserved tone transmission may be OFDM symbol specific and/or PRB specific and/or the ratio of REs used for the different purposes may vary over time and/or frequency. For example, a WTRU may be configured with RE subsets to use for DM-RS transmission, PUSCH transmission, and/or reserved tone transmission. The subsets may be configured explicitly using a bitmap and/or a bitstream mapped to a table of possible RE subsets. In an example, a RE subset (e.g., for DM-RS transmission, PUSCH transmission, and/or reserved tone transmission) may be obtained from configuration parameters. Such configuration parameters may include the RE periodicity and/or a subcarrier shift.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">In an example, a WTRU may be configured to precode one or more reference signals (e.g., DM-RSs) with user data (e.g., PUSCH data). SC-FDMA may be used to minimize the PAPR, for example, in UL transmissions for LTE. In an example, interlaced PUSCH and DM-RS symbols may be input to an SC-FDMA signal generator, for example, to decrease the overhead associated with DM-RS transmission while maintaining a relatively low PAPR. The bit stream that forms the input to the SC-FDMA signal generator may include alternating PUSCH and DM-RS modulation symbols. In an example, the bit stream that forms the input to the SC-FDMA signal generator may include the DM-RS modulation symbols to be transmitted (e.g., in an OFDM symbol, slot, subframe, etc.) followed by the PUSCH modulation symbols to be transmitted (e.g., or vice versa). The output of the DFT may be applied to the appropriate OFDM symbol (e.g., the fourth symbol of the first and/or second time slot for normal cyclic prefix). In such a case, the RS may be different that a ZC sequence. For example, a Gold sequence initialized based on the cell PCI and/or the VCID may be used.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">In order to decrease the DM-RS overhead, a WTRU may be configured to perform UL transmission(s) without DM-RS transmission. To compensate for the lack of DM-RSs, a WTRU may be configured to transmit precoded sounding reference signals (SRSs) and/or non-precoded SRSs in the subframe where DM-RS-free PUSCH transmission occurs. Precoding of the SRSs may be omitted, for example, given that in LTE the uplink precoder matrix may be selected by the network and/or may be provided to the WTRU in an uplink scheduling grant.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">To configure a WTRU for DM-RS-free transmission(s), the SRS request field may be used to indicate that the WTRU should perform DM-RS-free transmission. For example, a WTRU may be configured such that one of the SRS parameter sets configured by higher layers for the SRS request corresponds to DM-RS-free PUSCH transmission with SRS. For example, an SRS request field value of &#x2018;11&#x2019; may configure a WTRU to transmit aperiodic SRS with a DM-RS-free PUSCH. In an example, to configure a WTRU with DM-RS-free PUSCH, the network may use one of the reserved bit fields used for UL precoding information in DCI Format 4 and/or other DCI Formats. The bits corresponding to the UL precoding information fields may indicate a specific precoder matrix as well as the use of DM-RS-free PUSCH transmission. As an example, for the case of two antenna ports with one codeword, bit fields 6 and 7 may be used for one layer DM-RS-free transmission with Transmitted Precoding Matrix Indicator (TPMI)=0 and TPMI=1 (e.g., or any other higher layer configured and/or pre-configured TPMI values), respectively. For two antenna ports with two codewords, bit field 1 may be used to indicate two layer DM-RS-free transmission with TPMI=0. For four antenna ports with one codeword, bit fields 40-63 may be reused for one or two layer DM-RS-free transmission with a subset of available TPMI (e.g., either pre-configured or configured by higher layers). For four antenna ports with two codewords, bit fields 29-63 may be reused for two, three, and/or four layer DM-RS-free transmission with any of the available TPMI (e.g., either pre-configured and/or configured by higher layer signaling).</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">In an example, a WTRU may be able to transmit UL data using any of a number of DM-RS transmission schedules, which for example, may include a legacy DM-RS transmission schedule(s) and/or one or more reduced DM-RS transmission schedule(s). In one or more subframes, a WTRU may use a legacy DM-RS transmission schedule, while in another subset of subframes the WTRU may transmit DM-RS in a single time slot of a subframe. The WTRU may be semi-statically configured with subsets of subframes, e.g., via RRC signaling, where for one or more of the subset of subframes, the WTRU may use a different DM-RS transmission schedule. For example, two or more DM-RS transmission schedules may be defined, where in a first DM-RS transmission schedule the DM-RS is transmitted in a first slot and in a second DM-RS transmission schedule the DM-RS is transmitted in a second slot. The WTRU may transmit the first DM-RS transmission schedule in even subframes and the second DM-RS transmission schedule in odd subframes, for example, to enhance the quality of channel estimation when two UL transmissions occur in consecutive subframes. In an example, the WTRU may be configured via higher level signaling with one or more of DM-RS transmission schedules, for example, with an index (e.g., each with an index). The WTRU may be configured (e.g., dynamically) with the appropriate DM-RS transmission schedule for a subframe (e.g., each subframe) by adding a corresponding index in the UL grant DCI. In an example, a WTRU may be configured with a legacy DM-RS transmission schedule(s) as well as a DM-RS transmission schedule(s) characterized by reduced overhead. One or more bits may be included in a UL grant and may be used to trigger a DM-RS transmission schedule(s). The absence of the bit and/or a predetermined value of the bit (e.g., 0 or 1) may cause a WTRU to use a legacy DM-RS transmission schedule.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">There may be rules for switching DM-RS transmission schedules. The WTRU may be configured to switch (e.g., dynamically switch) between different DM-RS transmission schedules. For example, subframes where HARQ-ACK, RI, and/or CQI/PMI are transmitted in the PUSCH may use a first DM-RS transmission schedule. Whereas subframes where data (e.g., only data) is transmitted may use a second DM-RS transmission schedule. The DM-RS transmission schedule may be determined (e.g., implicitly) based on the number of transmission layers. The DM-RS transmission schedule may be determined (e.g., implicitly) based on the OCC used on the DM-RS. The DM-RS transmission schedule may be determined (e.g., implicitly) based on the virtual cell ID used for DM-RS. The DM-RS transmission schedule may be determined (e.g., implicitly) based on the sequence and/or cyclic shift used for DM-RS.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">The DM-RS transmission schedule to be used may be a function of the frame, subframe, and/or time slot number. A WTRU may be configured with sets of subframes for a (e.g., each) DM-RS transmission schedule, for example, for semi-persistent scheduling. The WTRU may determine the DM-RS transmission schedule based on a previously used DM-RS transmission schedule. For example, if a first subframe uses a first DM-RS transmission schedule, the next scheduled subframe may switch to a different DM-RS transmission schedule, for example, in a pre-configured order. The WTRU may be configured to switch DM-RS transmission schedules for each retransmission, for example, in a pre-configured order.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">The DCI may be used to determine the DM-RS transmission schedule to be used in the scheduled grant. The DCI Format used may configure the WTRU for a DM-RS transmission schedule. Values of the precoding information field in the DCI may indicate to the WTRU what DM-RS transmission schedule to use. A WTRU may be configured to use different DM-RS transmission schedule based on the number of layers. Upon decoding an uplink grant for a specific number of layers, the WTRU may determine the appropriate DM-RS transmission schedule.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">In an example, a transport block size may be indicated. In a subframe in which the WTRU uses a DM-RS transmission schedule characterized by reduced overhead, the transport block size determination may be different from a case in which a WTRU uses a legacy DM-RS transmission schedule. The modulation and coding scheme (MCS) indication included in the UL grant may have a different mapping to Transport Block Sizes (TBS). A WTRU may be configured with a MCS to TBS mapping table (e.g., a new MCS to TBS mapping table) for DM-RS subframes. The table may take into account the reduction in DM-RS overhead. A WTRU may use the DM-RS transmission schedule, which may have been obtained semi-statically or dynamically, to determine the appropriate MCS-to-TBS mapping table to use.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">In another example, the MCS index included in the UL grant may implicitly indicate the TBS table that may be used. The WTRU may determine the type of DM-RS transmission schedule that may be used based on the MCS index. A subset of MCS indices may be associated with a DM-RS subframe type. The WTRU may be configured via higher layers, the mapping between values of MCS, and/or the type of DM-RS. For example, a WTRU may be configured with a list of MCS indices. Such MCS indices may map to a DM-RS transmission schedule(s) (e.g., a DM-RS transmission schedule characterized by reduced overhead), and other MCS indices may map to DM-RS transmission schedule(s) (e.g., legacy DM-RS transmission schedule(s)).</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">An MCS-to-TBS table that may be used for DM-RS transmission schedule(s) may be defined explicitly and preconfigured in the WTRU. In an example, the TBS value may be determined as a function of the legacy MCS-to-TBS table. For example, if the DM-RS transmission schedule(s) characterized by reduced overhead are obtained by transmitting DM-RS in one time slot, the overhead reduction may be 12 REs per PRB (e.g., a reduction of 1/14). Upon receiving an MCS index, the WTRU may determine the TBS by examining the table configured for a legacy DM-RS transmission schedule and multiplying the TBS value by a preconfigured value, e.g., 156/144&#x2248;1.0833 and using a floor function, e.g., TBS<sub>enhanced</sub>=[1.0833TBS], where TBS may be obtained from the MCS value. In an example, given that the savings in overhead from DM-RS located in a single time slot are equivalent to a gain of an extra PRB every 14 PRBs, the conversion may be performed taking those savings into account. For example, every 14 PRBs assigned may map to a TBS for 15 PRBs. An adjustment may be added for assignments that are not multiples of 14. The TBS may be determined from the MCS and the number of PRBs allocated such that, for example,</p><p id="p-0124" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mrow>   <msub>    <mi>TBS</mi>    <mi>enhanced</mi>   </msub>   <mo>=</mo>   <mrow>    <mrow>     <mi>f</mi>     <mo>&#x2061;</mo>     <mo>(</mo>     <mrow>      <msub>       <mi>I</mi>       <mi>MCS</mi>      </msub>      <mo>,</mo>      <mrow>       <msub>        <mi>N</mi>        <mi>PRB</mi>       </msub>       <mo>+</mo>       <mrow>        <mo>&#x230a;</mo>        <mfrac>         <msub>          <mi>N</mi>          <mi>PRB</mi>         </msub>         <mrow>          <mn>1</mn>          <mo>&#x2062;</mo>          <mn>4</mn>         </mrow>        </mfrac>        <mo>&#x230b;</mo>       </mrow>      </mrow>     </mrow>     <mo>)</mo>    </mrow>    <mo>+</mo>    <mrow>     <mi>&#x394;mod</mi>     <mtext>&#x205f;</mtext>     <mo>(</mo>     <mrow>      <msub>       <mi>N</mi>       <mi>PRB</mi>      </msub>      <mo>,</mo>      <mn>14</mn>     </mrow>     <mo>)</mo>    </mrow>   </mrow>  </mrow>  <mo>,</mo> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0125" num="0000">where the function &#x192; may be the appropriate location on the preconfigured mapping table and delta is a preconfigured value.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0123">In an example, DM-RS transmission schedule(s) may be configured for retransmission of PUSCH. The WTRU may support the use of multiple DM-RS transmission schedules. The type of DM-RS transmission schedule may change often. This change may occur after a WTRU has made a transmission, but before the WTRU makes a retransmission. Accordingly, the type of DM-RS transmission schedule a WTRU is expected to use in this situation may be ambiguous. In an example, when a WTRU is indicated via a NACK on PHICH that the WTRU should retransmit the transport block, it may be assumed that the WTRU reuses the same DM-RS transmission schedule that was used in the previous transmission, overriding a DM-RS transmission schedule for that subframe.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0124">In another example, a WTRU may be provided an UL grant on a PDCCH that requested a retransmission, e.g., by an appropriate toggle of a data indicator. The WTRU may be indicated via the MCS index the redundancy version that it is expected to transmit. The MCS indices mapping to different redundancy versions may be separated into different groups. One or more of the group(s) (e.g., each group) may map to a different DM-RS transmission schedule. The WTRU may be able to infer or determine the appropriate MCS/TBS to use in the retransmission, for example, from this mapping, as well as the appropriate redundancy version.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0125">In an example, the WTRU may use a combination of the configured DM-RS transmission schedule for the retransmission subframe and the signaled redundancy version to determine the appropriate MCS/TBS to use for the retransmission. One or more of the MCS indices (e.g., each MCS index) that is mapped to redundancy versions may have multiple meanings, depending on the configured DM-RS transmission schedule for the retransmission subframe.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0126">In an example, for an UL grant indicating retransmission, the WTRU may be provided with a MCS index (e.g., a new MCS index) that is not mapped to a redundancy version. The presence of this MCS index may implicitly indicate to the WTRU that a DM-RS transmission schedule (e.g., a DM-RS transmission schedule characterized by reduced overhead) may be used in the retransmission subframe. It may indicate to the WTRU the MCS/TBS to use, for example, using the appropriate TBS mapping rule based on the DM-RS transmission schedule. To allow for different redundancy versions, the WTRU may be preconfigured with an order of redundancy and versions to be used when the DM-RS transmission schedule changes and the MCS is not used for redundancy version indication.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0127">In an example, in an UL grant for retransmission, a bit flag may be included that may indicate the type of DM-RS transmission schedule that may be used. This indication (e.g., in combination with the MCS index, which may trigger a redundancy version) may allow the WTRU to determine the redundancy version as well as the appropriate MCS/TBS.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0128">One or more embodiments contemplate DM-RS sequence generation. Embodiments recognize that the sequence-group number that may be used for DM-RS sequence generation (e.g., the determination of a DM-RS transmission schedule(s)) may no longer be a function of the time slot, perhaps given that there may be a single DM-RS per subframe, among other reasons. In some embodiments, the sequence-group number u may be defined as u=(&#x192;<sub>gh</sub>(n)+&#x192;<sub>ss</sub>) mod 30, where n=i&#x2212;1 for the i<sup>th </sup>DM-RS transmission in the radio frame, for example, for reduced DM-RS transmission schedule(s) among other reasons. For example, a WTRU may be configured with a radio frame where one or more, or each, subframe may have a single DM-RS located in the first time slot, the n could be defined as n=SFN mod 10, where SFN is the subframe number. The value of n may be reused, for example, to replace the slot number in a legacy formulation of sequence hopping and/or cyclic shift hopping, among other reasons.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0129">The sequence-group hopping, sequence hopping, and/or cyclic shift hopping may be performed over subframes and/or the hopping values may remain constant over pairs of time slots, for example, for a DM-RS transmission schedule where a sequence (e.g., a single sequence) may be spread over multiple symbols (e.g., the hybrid method where a single DM-RS is partially in a first time slot and partially in the second time slot), among other scenarios.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0130">The WTRU may be indicated (e.g., explicitly indicated) what value of n may be used in the UL grant. Sequence-group hopping, sequence hopping, and/or cyclic-shift hopping may be re-initiated, for example, upon switching from one DM-RS transmission schedule to another, among other scenarios.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0131">Data and/or control information may be multiplexed. A number of coded modulation symbols per layer for HARQ-ACK, RI, PMI/CQI, and/or UL-SCH data may be used. In some subframes, data may be multiplexed with CQI, PMI, RI and/or ACK. In such scenarios, the mapping of one or more, or each, component of the transport block may be done according to one or more of the rules described herein, for example, in order to properly take account of a reduced DM-RS transmission schedule(s), among other reasons. For example, when the WTRU transmits HARQ-ACK bits, and/or rank indicator bits, and/or CQI/PMI bits, among other scenarios, it may determine the number of coded modulation symbols per layer Q&#x2032; for HARQ-ACK, and/or rank indicator, and/or CQI/PMI as a function of N<sub>symb</sub><sup>PUSCH-initial</sup>, M<sub>sc</sub><sup>PUSCH </sup>and/or M<sub>sc</sub><sup>PUSCH-initial</sup>, where N<sub>symb</sub><sup>PUSCH-initial</sup>=(2(N<sub>symb</sub><sup>UL</sup>&#x2212;1)&#x2212;N<sub>SRS</sub>). N<sub>symb</sub><sup>UL </sup>is the number of SC-FDMA symbols per subframe. N<sub>SRS </sub>is either 0 or 1, perhaps depending on if there is an SRS transmission in the subframe, among other reasons. M<sub>sc</sub><sup>PUSCH </sup>is the scheduled bandwidth for PUSCH transmission in the current subframe. M<sub>sc</sub><sup>PUSCH-initial </sup>is the initial scheduled bandwidth obtained from the initial (E)PDCCH.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0132">In some embodiments, perhaps if the WTRU is scheduled with a reduced DM-RS transmission schedule, and perhaps where there may be a single DM-RS symbol per subframe, among other scenarios, the WTRU may be configured to use N<sub>symb</sub><sup>PUSCH-initial</sup>=(2 (N<sub>symb</sub><sup>UL</sup>&#x2212;1)&#x2212;N<sub>SRS</sub>+1). In some embodiments, perhaps for a legacy DM-RS transmission schedule, among other scenarios, the product of N<sub>symb</sub><sup>PUSCH-initial</sup>&#xb7;M<sub>sc</sub><sup>PUSCH-initial </sup>may be used in a function to determine Q&#x2032; and/or G, the total number of coded bits for UL-SCH data information.

The relationship between the higher layer signaled indices and the offsets may depend on whether the transmission in that subframe is for a DM-RS transmission schedule, among other factors.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0134">Embodiments contemplate a channel interleaver of UL-SCH data, ACK-NACK, RI, and/or CQI/PMI. A channel interleaver may implement a time-first mapping of modulation symbols onto the transmit waveform. The interleaver may be done by filling a matrix with N<sub>symb</sub><sup>PUSCH </sup>columns and/or the number of rows that may be used to transmit at least some, or all, the data concatenated with CQI/PMI. In some embodiments, perhaps when configured with a reduced DM-RS transmission schedule, among other scenarios, the number of columns of the matrix may be determined by using N<sub>symb</sub><sup>PUSCH</sup>=(2(N<sub>symb</sub><sup>UL</sup>&#x2212;1)&#x2212;N<sub>SRS</sub>+1). In some embodiments, the WTRU may use N<sub>symb</sub><sup>PUSCH</sup>=(2N<sub>symb</sub><sup>UL</sup>&#x2212;N<sub>SRS</sub>) and may ensure that when data, HARQ-ACK, RI, and/or CQI/PMI information is written into the matrix, among other scenarios, the WTRU may skip one or more matrix entries that may be occupied by blank values. These blank values may be used to insert a reduced DM-RS.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0135">There may be column sets for the insertion of HARQ-ACK and/or RI symbols. These column sets may ensure that HARQ-ACK and/or RI may be as close as possible to DM-RS. The column sets may be modified for the use of a reduced DM-RS transmission schedule. In some embodiments, perhaps for a single DM-RS per subframe, and perhaps located in a single time slot, among other scenarios, the HARQ-ACK and/or RI may be located (e.g., solely located) in the slot with DM-RS. In some embodiments, the symbol(s) for HARQ-ACK may be the one or two symbols (or more) closest to the DM-RS symbol and the symbol(s) for the RI may be the next one or two symbols (or more) closest to the DM-RS. For example, for DM-RS in symbol x of a subframe, the HARQ-ACK may be transmitted in symbols x&#x2212;1 and x+1 and the RI may be transmitted in symbols x&#x2212;2 and x+2. In some embodiments, the WTRU may be configured to use one or more symbols for the HARQ-ACK and/or RI. In some embodiments, perhaps for an DM-RS in symbol x of a subframe, among other scenarios, the HARQ-ACK may be located in symbols x&#x2212;2, x&#x2212;1, x+1, x+2 and/or the RI may be located in symbols x&#x2212;4, x&#x2212;3, x+3, x+4. In some embodiments, the HARQ-ACK may be located in symbols x&#x2212;3, x&#x2212;1, x+1, x+3 and/or the RI may be located in symbols x&#x2212;4, x&#x2212;2, x+2, x+4. In some embodiments, perhaps given that the DM-RS may be located near the beginning or end of a subframe, among other factors, there may not be enough symbols on one or more, or both, sides to accommodate using multiple symbols for HARQ-ACK and/or RI. In some embodiments, the symmetry constraint may be removed. For example, for an DM-RS in symbol 3, the HARQ-ACK may be located in symbols 2, 4 and 5 and/or the RI may be located in symbols 1, 6 and 7. As another example, the HARQ-ACK may be located in symbols 2, 4 and 6 and/or the RI may be located in symbols 1, 5 and 7.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0136">Embodiments contemplate modified Orthogonal Cover Code (OCC) for a DM-RS transmission schedule. The use of orthogonal cover codes on the DM-RS may enable an increase in number of layers that can be supported and/or the ability to perform MU-MIMO. One or more embodiments contemplate that it may be useful to modify OCC behavior where a reduced DM-RS may be used, among other scenarios, for example. A DM-RS transmission schedule may be used to use one or more orthogonal cover codes (OCC) on a DM-RS, for example, to enable MU-MIMO. A DM-RS transmission schedule may be used to provide uplink control information (UCI) on the PUSCH, for example, with reduced DM-RS.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0137">A DM-RS transmission schedule may be repeated over one or more pairs of subcarriers. A DM-RS transmission schedule may be repeated over x subcarriers. This repetition can be over multiple SC-FDMA symbols. For example, in a solution where DM-RS is transmitted in a single SC-FDMA symbol, the first x subcarriers may transmit a first symbol of the sequence, the second x subcarriers may transmit a second symbol of the sequence, and so on. This may be repeated for one or more, or each, transmission layer, whereby one, or more, or each, layer may be multiplexed on the same REs. In an example where the DM-RS may be in a first SC-FDMA symbol for one set of subcarriers and may be in a second SC-FDMA symbol for another (e.g., possibly disjoint) set of subcarriers, the sequence may be repeated such that one or more, or every, symbol in the sequence may occur once or more in the first SC-FDMA symbol and/or once or more in the second SC-FDMA symbol, on another subcarrier. For example, the DM-RS may be located in even subcarriers of SC-FDMA symbol 3 and in odd subcarriers of SC-FDMA symbol 10. The first layer's DM-RS sequence may be denoted by [a b c d e . . . ]. In such scenarios, the symbol &#x2018;a&#x2019; may be placed in subcarrier 0 of SC-FDMA symbol 3 and/or subcarrier 1 of SC-FMDA symbol 10. Symbol &#x2018;b&#x2019; may be placed in subcarrier 2 of SC-FDMA symbol 3 and/or subcarrier 3 of SC-FDMA symbol 10, and so on. This may be repeated for one or more other DM-RS layers, whereby one or more, or each, layer may be multiplexed on the same REs.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0138">In some embodiments, perhaps in order to allow for the proper demodulation of one or more, or each transmission layer, among other reasons, OCC may be used in conjunction with cyclic shifts of the DM-RS transmission schedule. In some embodiments, perhaps where the DM-RS may be repeated in multiple subcarriers (e.g., whether on the same SC-FDMA symbol or not), among other scenarios, a different OCC vector per layer can be applied over multiple subcarriers. For example, a first OCC vector &#x2018;y&#x2019; can be applied on one layer of DM-RS sequence symbols and another OCC vector &#x2018;z&#x2019; can be applied on another layer.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0139">In some embodiments, perhaps where DM-RS may be transmitted on a single SC-FDMA symbol and/or the DM-RS sequence symbols may be repeated over x subcarriers, among other scenarios, one or more, or each, OCC vector may also be of length x and/or the OCC can be applied as described herein. For example, for a first layer, one or more, or each, set of x subcarriers carrying the first sequence of DM-RS may be multiplied by &#x2018;y&#x2019;. For a second layer, one or more, or each, set of x subcarriers carrying the second sequence of DM-RS may be multiplied by &#x2018;z&#x2019;.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0140">Although features and elements are described above in particular combinations, one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that each feature or element can be used alone or in any combination with the other features and elements.
