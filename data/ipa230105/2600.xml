level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Polyolefins, especially the homo- and copolymers from the class of polyethylenes, polypropylenes and polybutenes, form the largest class of the commonly used plastics and register the largest production volumes globally. Substantial fields of application of these materials are films, packagings and a very wide variety of injection moulded parts, for example for automotive manufacture. Especially in automotive manufacture it is important to produce these injection moulded parts with a well-modulated balance of strength and impact resistance in order to ensure the best possible everyday usability.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to ensure this balance it is common practice to employ mixtures comprising a component intended to ensure strength, usually a crystalline polypropylene, and a further component intended to ensure impact resistance, often a polyethylene-rich component. The latter component is often rubberlike and also tacky and the proportion of this component in the production process therefore cannot be increased as desired since the mixture would otherwise no longer be processable due to parts of the plant becoming gummed up.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to increase the quality of heterophasic polymer mixtures, in particular those comprising polyethylene and polypropylene, additives are often used to compatibilize the polypropylene matrix having a crystalline structure which is responsible for strength with the soft, impact-absorbing polyethylene-rich fraction.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">EP 0884353 A1 describes a synergistic combined composition comprising a random ethylene/propylene copolymer and a random ethylene/&#x3b1;-olefin copolymer having a low to very low density, wherein the &#x3b1;-olefin contains at least 4 carbon atoms. It further relates to polyolefin compositions, in particular polypropylene compositions, comprising the combined composition. The random ethylene/&#x3b1;-olefin copolymer has an MFI of 0.1 to 30 dg/min.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">US 2018134884 A1 describes the use of C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>-block copolymers and styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene (SEBS) rubber components having an MFI of not more than 30 dg/min.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">US 2019218383 A1 describes polymer compositions comprising from 1% to 30% by weight of a copolymer obtainable by reaction of ethylene with an &#x3b1;-olefin having 3 to 10 carbon atoms. The copolymer has an MFI of 100 to 2000 dg/min and a molecular weight distribution (MWD) between 1 and 5.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">WO 2011/119486 A1 describes the production of an &#x201c;impact-modified&#x201d; mixture based on polyolefins (PP or HDPE) using an ethylene-&#x3b1;-olefin copolymer having an MWD of well below 5.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">CA 2102542 A1 describes a gas phase process for producing a C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>3 </sub>copolymer having a maximum MFI of 500 and mentions the fact that the material is obtained in a &#x201c;non-sticky&#x201d; form downstream of the gas phase reactors. It is further described that a high rubber content in the process is a problem.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In recent times there has been a further need to be able to process polypropylene- and/or polyethylene-containing recyclates into mixtures which after processing have material characteristics similar to those obtainable using virgin polyethylene and/or polypropylene.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The problem addressed by the present invention was therefore that of providing blends of polyolefins which solve one or more of the abovementioned problems.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">It was found, surprisingly, that blends containing at least two different polyolefins which contain as a further constituent an amorphous poly-alpha-olefin which is based on the monomers ethene, propene and 1-butene and has a viscosity at 190&#xb0; C. of 200 mPa*s to 200,000 mPa*s can solve one or more of the recited problems.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a scanning electron micrograph of the fracture edge of the test specimen according to example 1.11, prepared and recorded as described in example 2; and</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a scanning electron micrograph of the fracture edge of the test specimen according to example 1.12, prepared and recorded as described in example 2.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present invention therefore provides blends containing at least two different polyolefins which are characterized in that they contain as a further constituent an amorphous poly-alpha-olefin (APAO) which is based on the monomers ethene, propene and 1-butene and has a viscosity at 190&#xb0; C. determined according to the method reported hereinbelow in the methods of measurement section of 200 mPa*s to 200,000 mPa*s, wherein it contains polyethylene and polypropylene as at least two different polyolefins and wherein the polyethylene has a melt flow index [MFI 2.16 kg@190&#xb0; C.] determined according to the method ISO 1133 reported in the description of less than 10 g/10 min, preferably of 0.01 to 2 g/10 min, and the polypropylene has a melt flow index [MFI 2.16 kg@230&#xb0; C.] determined according to the method reported in the description of less than 50 g/10 min, preferably of 0.01 to 25 g/10 min.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The present invention further provides a process for producing a blend according to the invention and the use thereof as defined in the claims and more particularly described hereinbelow. The blends according to the invention have the advantage that they exhibit improved material characteristics. The blends according to the invention in particular exhibit good/improved impact resistance and good/improved expansion behavior at a moderate loss of tensile strength.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">A further advantage of the blends according to the invention is that they exhibit a good phase compatibility of polyethylene and polypropylene when polyethylene and polypropylene are present as different polyolefins.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Due to the use of the APAO the blends according to the invention may also contain larger amounts of recyclate, in particular polyethylene and/or propylene recyclate, without the material characteristics deteriorating to the extent that the material is no longer usable for the intended purpose.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The separation of polymer waste is currently often not yet operable in a single variety manner so that for example PE recyclates still contain small amounts of PP polymers and PP recyclates still contain small amounts of PE polymers. Especially for blends containing such non-single-variety recyclates the use according to the invention of the APAO is particularly advantageous.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The blends according to the invention, the process according to the invention and the use according to the invention of the blends are described by way of example hereinafter, without any intention that the invention be restricted to these illustrative embodiments.

A Mettler Toledo DSC1 instrument was employed and the evaluation was carried out by means of Stare 10.0 software. For semicrystalline polymer samples the influence of thermal history is removed only upon melting of the entire sample; the determination of T<sub>g </sub>therefore requires a second heating run to obtain reproducible results at the defined heating and cooling rate. A uniform heating rate of 10 K/min to Tg+50&#xb0; C. and cooling rate of 20 K/min to Tg&#x2212;50&#xb0; C. should preferably be employed. The glass transition temperature is the sample temperature at which half of the change in specific heat capacity [0.5 &#x394;c<sub>P</sub>] is achieved. It is the temperature of the intersection of the middle line between the extrapolated baselines before and after the glass transition with the measured curve.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Molecular weight determination: Mw stands for weight-average molecular weight and Mn stands for number-average molecular weight. The molecular weights Mw and Mn are determined by HT-GPC [high-temperature gel permeation chromatography] as described in DIN 55 672. Specifically, analytical HT-GPC is performed at 150&#xb0; C. using a PL220 oven (Agilent, Waldbronn) with integrated isocratic pump. 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB) (Merck, Darmstadt) spiked with &#x2dc; 1 g/L butylhydroxytoluene (BHT) was used as the mobile phase with a flow rate of 1 mL/min and one Agilent PLgel Olexis Guard (50&#xd7;7.5 mm, precolumn) and three Agilent PLgel Olexis (300&#xd7;7.5 mm) columns were used as the stationary phase. Detection was performed by means of an IR detector (model IR4, PolymerChar, Valencia, Spain). The datasets were evaluated using a polystyrene calibration (EasiCal PS-1, Agilent) using WinGPC software (Polymer Standards Service, Mainz). The polydispersity (Mw/Mn), also known as molecular weight distribution, is obtained by dividing the weight-average molecular weight by the number-average molecular weight.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Viscosity at 190&#xb0; C.: The viscosity is determined at 190&#xb0; C. by measurements with a rotary viscometer as per DIN 53 019.

This was obtained from Zentrum f&#xfc;r Messen und Kalibrieren &#x26; Analytik GmbH and issued with an accompanying calibration certificate. Instrument calibration is performed only upon changing the DKD oil using DKD oil from ZMK&#x26; ANALYTIK GmbH. This is performed using cone 7. An initial measurement of the new DKD oil is initially taken. This is followed by calibration of the instrument. The Newtonian standard sample is weighed in directly onto the spindle. This comprises placing it upside down in a 100 ml Erlenmeyer flask and weighing in the appropriate amount. The spindle is subsequently mounted in the viscometer and lowered. After maintaining preheating for at least 3 min, &#x2018;Spindle&#x2019; is depressed in the control panel and confirmed with &#x2018;Enter&#x2019;. The prompt &#x2018;Calibrate YES/NO&#x2019; appears. Selecting &#x2018;YES&#x2019; initiates calibration mode. The desired temperature and the dynamic viscosity (see current calibration certificate) of the fluid are subsequently inputted and confirmed. It should be noted here that the viscosity figure must be entered in cP (cP=mPas). In response to the prompt &#x2018;SPEED&#x2019; 10 s-1 is inputted and confirmed with &#x2018;Enter&#x2019;. The calibration is then initiated with &#x2018;Run&#x2019;.
