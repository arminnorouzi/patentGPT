relative to each other. Like reference numerals designate corresponding parts throughout the several views.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The present disclosure describes a flat panel display (i.e., display) that can be used with a computing device (e.g., mobile phone, tablet, etc.). The front surface of a mobile device includes a display typically operating as a graphic user interface (GUI) and one or more optical devices operating as sensors/emitters in areas below the display and facing the front surface. The one or more optical devices can be configured for a variety of functions, including (but not limited to) sensing lighting conditions (e.g. an ambient light sensor), sensing proximity of objects near the display (e.g., electromagnetic sensor), capturing images (e.g., a fingerprint sensor).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">A proximity sensor may include a transmitter and a receiver of electromagnetic radiation, which are used to determine proximity of the display to an object that reflects electromagnetic radiation transmitted by the transmitter, which radiation is then reflected by the object and received by the receiver. For example, when a percentage of the transmitted radiation intensity received at the receiver, after being reflected by an object, exceeds a threshold value, a signal from the proximity sensor may determine that the display is closer to the object than a threshold distance.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">A fingerprint sensor also may include a transmitter and a receiver of electromagnetic radiation, which are used to image a fingerprint on a finger pressed to the display. For example, radiation can be transmitted from a transmitter of the fingerprint sensor, reflected off the finger, and then detected by the receiver. A fingerprint pattern can be determined based on the reflected light received at the receiver and may be compared to a stored data associated with a fingerprint.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">An ambient light sensor may include a receiver of light and may determine an amount of ambient light received by the sensor.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Light sensors are used in many mobile devices. Recent advances in emissive display technology (e.g., active matrix organic light emitting diode (AMOLED)) facilitate extending the emissive (i.e., active) area of the display towards (e.g., to) the edges of the mobile device. By extending the active area of the display towards the edges of the mobile device, a user may experience the benefits of a larger display without the drawbacks of a larger device. However, this may leave insufficient space for light sensors or other optical devices outside the area of the emissive display on the front side of the mobile device.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The emissive display disclosed herein is configured to share the front surface of a mobile device with one or more sensors so that the active area of the display can be extended to the edges, without the need for leaving a gap in the display, or space around the display, for the light sensor(s). Accordingly, one or more portions of the disclosed display covering the light sensors can be configured so that the light sensor(s), positioned behind the display, can transmit and receive electromagnetic radiation through the display. Generally, an air gap separates the back side of the display panel from the light sensor(s).</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Ideally, when a light sensor is located under the display panel light would pass unimpeded through the display panel to the sensor. However, in reality, light is scattered, absorbed, and reflected by elements within the display panel. Some the reflected and/or scattered light may interfere with the operation of the pixel circuits in the display panel, causing unintended operation of at least some of the pixel circuits. In particular, light (e.g., ambient light that passes through the display) can reflect off an interface between a back side of the display panel and an air gap between the panel and a light sensor and then strike semiconductor circuits that control the pixel luminance of OLEDs above the air gap. This reflected light can interfere with the intended luminance of the OLEDs, such that the OLEDs may have a different intensity and/or color than they are programmed to produce.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">To mitigate this effect, structures are disclosed herein that reduce the amount of light reflected from the interface between a back side of the display panel and an air gap between the panel and a light sensor. For example, an antireflection polarizer or an attenuator can be placed at the interface to reduce reflections.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Traditionally, the display and the optical devices located on a surface of the device that includes the display have occupied separate areas of the front surface. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> depicts a mobile device <b>101</b> having a display <b>110</b> and a light sensor (e.g., ambient light sensor, proximity sensor, etc.) <b>111</b> that occupy different portions of the front surface.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrates a mobile device <b>102</b> with a display <b>112</b> that extends towards the edges of the device and that occupies a larger portion of the surface of the device <b>102</b> than does the display <b>110</b> of device <b>101</b>. Unlike mobile devices in which the display is excluded from an area reserved for optical devices, the light-emitting (i.e., active) area of the display <b>112</b> extends over substantially the entire front surface. Accordingly, nearly the entire front surface of the mobile device <b>102</b> may be used to present color, black-and-white, or gray-scale images, graphics, and/or characters. In some implementations, the display <b>112</b> can include one or more areas <b>120</b> behind which (i.e., below which) a light sensor or emitter may be disposed.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The size, shape, and/or position of the area <b>120</b> may be implemented variously. For example, the area <b>120</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> has a rounded (e.g., circular) shape and is positioned apart from edges of the display <b>112</b>, but this need not be the case. For example, the area <b>120</b> can have rectangular in shape and can be positioned along an edge of the display <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> depicts a side, cross-sectional view of a mobile device having a display <b>112</b> with areas <b>120</b>A, <b>120</b>B through which electromagnetic radiation can be transmitted to an underlying optical device, for example, a fingerprint sensor, an ambient light sensor, or a proximity sensor. The mobile device can include multiple optical devices <b>140</b>A, <b>140</b>B, each positioned behind a different area <b>120</b>A, <b>120</b>B. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> depicts a side, cross-sectional view of a mobile device having a display <b>112</b> with a single region <b>120</b>C for use by the multiple optical devices <b>140</b>A, <b>140</b>B. The optical devices <b>140</b>A, <b>140</b>B may transmit and/or receive electromagnetic radiation <b>125</b> through the areas <b>120</b>A, <b>120</b>B, <b>120</b>C.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a side, cross-sectional view of an emissive display (e.g., an AMOLED display) suitable for use with the mobile device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. While the principles of the disclosure may be applied to display technologies other than AMOLED displays, the implementation of an AMOLED display will be considered throughout the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the AMOLED display <b>300</b> includes a plurality of layers that make up a display panel <b>360</b>. The layers include a cover glass layer <b>310</b> that can form the front surface of the mobile device <b>102</b>. In a possible implementation, the display <b>300</b> can include a polarizer film layer <b>315</b>. The display <b>300</b> can also include a touch sensor layer <b>320</b> that includes touch sensor electrodes <b>322</b>. Pixels <b>337</b> for the display are formed from a cathode layer <b>330</b>, an OLED emitter stack <b>335</b>, and separate elements of an anode layer <b>336</b>. Elements of the anode layer <b>336</b> may be reflective so that light emitted from the OLED emitter stack <b>335</b> is directed in a vertical (z) direction from the anode layer <b>336</b>. An element of the anode layer <b>336</b> can be coupled to a thin film transistor (TFT) semiconductor structure <b>340</b> that includes a source, a gate, and a drain, which can be controlled by electrical signals transmitted over signal lines <b>342</b>. The display <b>300</b> can further include a transparent barrier layer <b>345</b> that includes, for example, SiNx or SiONx and a transparent substrate layer <b>350</b> that includes, for example, polyimide (PI) and/or polyethylene terephthalate (PET). An opaque layer/film <b>370</b> for mechanical support, heat spreading, and electrical shielding can be located below the display panel <b>360</b> to protect the display from localized hot spots due to heat-generating elements in the mobile device, such as, for example, a CPU, a GPU, etc., as well as from electrical signals/electrical noise from electrical components in the device located below the display <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The layers of the display <b>300</b> may include transparent and non-transparent circuit elements. For example, the TFT structure <b>340</b>, the pixels <b>337</b>, the signal lines <b>342</b>, and/or touch sensor electrodes <b>322</b> may all block light from propagating through the display <b>300</b>.

An opening in the back cover layer <b>526</b> allows light from outside the display panel to pass through the panel and through the opening <b>528</b> to reach the sensor.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Two paths <b>530</b>, <b>532</b> of light passing through the display panel <b>500</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, with each path showing a possible reflection of light within the panel. In one path <b>532</b>, light can traverse the transparent elements of the display panel and be reflected by a top surface of the back cover <b>526</b>, such that the light is then directed back into the panel <b>500</b>. However, the amount of light reflected from beam path <b>532</b> from the top surface of the back cover <b>526</b> can be relatively small due to the low reflectivity of the back cover <b>526</b> (e.g. 0.1% of the light in the incoming light). In another path <b>530</b>, light can traverse the transparent elements of the display panel and be reflected by an the interface between a transparent layer (e.g., PET layer <b>524</b>) and an air gap between the panel and a light sensor located below an opening <b>528</b> in the back cover <b>526</b> (i.e., as a result of a mismatch in the indices of refraction between air and the transparent layer), which also results in the reflection of light from the interface back into the panel <b>500</b>.

For example, although semiconductor circuit elements <b>520</b> are shielded from direct light that enters the front surface of the panel through the cover window layer <b>506</b> (e.g., by the anodes <b>518</b> or the OLEDs themselves), reflected light (e.g., high-intensity, short wavelength light) that strikes semiconductor circuit elements <b>520</b> can increase the TFT leakage current of a circuit that controls the emission of light from a pixel. In some cases, the increased leakage current can be due to the photelectric effect caused by the reflected light on the circuit. The increased TFT leakage current for a circuit can cause a pixel controlled by the circuit to appear darker than intended. Because the semiconductor layer and the associated pixel circuits located over the opening <b>528</b> in the back cover <b>526</b> are struck by higher intensity reflected light, as compared with the rest of the display regions that are covered by the back cover <b>526</b>, the display panel <b>500</b> may appear to have odd dark spots above the locations of under-the-display light sensors.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a schematic diagram another implementation of a display panel <b>600</b> and a sensor <b>602</b> located under the display panel <b>600</b> illustrating light propagating through the display panel to the sensor.
