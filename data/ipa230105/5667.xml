To meet the demands for lower inductance and downsizing, opposing plate portions of these busbars may be often disposed in proximity against each other. A pair of P and N terminals for external connection on a free end side of the opposing plate portions may be mechanically and electrically joined to terminals for cable connection extended from an external electric device. Conventionally, an insulating member may be interposed between the opposing plate portions to ensure that these portions are certainly insulated from each other. On the other hand, an enough creepage distance should desirably be secured in order to avoid the occurrence of dielectric breakdown.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0003">The terminals for external connection to be joined to the terminals for cable connection may be spaced away from the base ends of the busbars embedded in the mold resin and may be accordingly subject to a large moment under the action of an external force. What is more, the busbars are very thin, plate-like members.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0004">The busbar including the electrically conductive, thin metal plate, may be likely to deform, for example, warp or bend, in a direction perpendicular to its plate surface.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0005">A known technique for high precision in relative positioning of the paired busbars and the insulating member is to fit projections on front and back surfaces of the insulating member into holes of the opposing plate portions to fix the positions of these three members.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0006">Known examples of the insulating member may include the insulating paper and the insulating sheet (patent documents 1 and 2).

While an operator may have to use his/her hand and fingers to adhere the insulating paper (or sheet) to the plate portion along its circumference, this handwork may be very difficult to perform without accidentally shifting relative positions of the target members. The insulating paper (sheet), while being adhered to the plate portion, may be often mishandled, for example, easily creased, sagged, corrugated, distorted, displaced from its target position, or may lose parallelism in direction.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">As a result of positional and dimensional inaccuracies and/or poor precision in relative positioning, the opposing plate portions may fail to have a predetermined creeping distance therebetween, which may invite the risk of insulation failure, or desirable low inductance may be simply impossible.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">To meet the demands for high precision in relative positioning and positional and dimensional accuracies, careful handling with an expertise may be required, which, however, may raise certain issues related to the work efficiency and production cost.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">There may be other issues to be addressed; the very thin and soft insulating paper (sheet) may hardly retain its original shape or increase the resistance to stress of the components disposed in proximity including the opposing plate portions. The components disposed in proximity, therefore, may be likely to deteriorate and deform after continued use over time, possibly inviting the risk of breakdown of the capacitor.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention was accomplished to address these issues of the known art and is directed to, by pursuing higher precision in relative positioning and higher positional and dimensional accuracies of the opposing plate portions and the insulating member, provide the components disposed in proximity with higher resistance to stress and is also directed to achieving improved productivity and lower production cost.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Technical Solution</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">To this end, the present invention provides the following technical features.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">A busbar structure for use in a capacitor,</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">the busbar structure comprising:</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">a capacitor element comprising, at axial ends on both sides thereof, electrodes disposed in a pair and having different polarities;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">a first busbar and a second busbar each having a plate-like shape, the first and second busbars respectively comprising a base end portion, a side plate portion, an opposing plate portion, and terminals for external connection,</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">the base end portion being connectable to the electrode of the capacitor element, the side plate portion extending from the base end portion and being disposed along the side surface of the capacitor element, the opposing plate portion extending upward from the side plate portion, the terminals for external connection extending from the opposing plate portion;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">an insulating member interposed between the opposing plate portions of the first and second busbars in a manner that the opposing plate portions are disposed in proximity against each other; and</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">a mold resin that covers all of the capacitor element and the base end portions and the side plate portions of the first and second busbars,</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">the insulating member being integral only with one of the first or second busbars by insert molding in which one of the opposing plate portions of the first or second busbar is used as an insert target and filled with a resin material which is a source material of the insulating member,</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">the resin material of the insert molding being poured to run toward a back-surface side from a front-surface side of the one opposing plate portion, the front-surface side not facing the other one of the opposing plate portions of the first or second busbar so as to entirely enclose the one opposing plate portion,</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">the terminal for external connection extending from the one of the opposing plate portions being extended in manner that protrudes upward from an end of the insulating member,</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">a surface of the other one of the opposing plate portions facing the one of the opposing plate portions being allowed to contact the insulating member on the back-surface side.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The technical features described herein according to the present invention may provide the following technical effects.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The insulating member made of a mold resin may be superior in hardness and shape retainability to the insulating paper or sheet and may be thus difficult to deform. The insert molding, instead of handwork, is used to integrate the insulating member with one of the opposing plate portions in the first or second busbar. This may promise desirably high precision in relative positioning and positional and dimensional accuracies of the opposing plate portions and the insulating member.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">By thus allowing the insulating member to contact the surface of one of the opposing plate portions facing the other of the opposing plate portions, whether the insulating member is experiencing loss of the filling resin and/or have any resin-missing voids may be easily checked before any contact is made between the components to be assembled.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The insulating member containing a resin as its source material may excel in shape retainability, which may improve handleability of the insulating member and one of the opposing plate portions that are integrally formed. Further advantageously, the insert molding may offer remarkably higher productivity than an operator's handwork and may accordingly allow lower production cost. In addition to that, unfavorable events that are often associated with the insulating paper (sheet) may certainly be avoidable, for example, creasing, sagging, corrugation, distortion, and displacement.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The present invention may include, other than the aspects described thus far, other various aspects and modified examples. The busbar structure for use in the capacitor described herein may be configured as described below.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">1] According to an aspect, the insulating member may include an insulation active portion, a reinforcing portion, and a connecting portion. The insulation active portion is disposed on the back-surface side of the one of the opposing plate portions and is interposed between the back-surface side and the other one of the opposing plate portions. The reinforcing portion is disposed on the front-surface side of the one of the opposing plate portions. The connecting portion connects the insulation active portion and the reinforcing portion into an integral unit. In the insulating member, lower end regions of the insulation active portion, the reinforcing portion and the connecting portion that are close to the capacitor element is embedded in the mold resin.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">According to this configuration, the reinforcing portion on the front- surface side of the plate portions is integral with and continuous to the insulation active portion on the back-surface side with the connecting portion being interposed therebetween, and the connecting portion in part connects the insulation active portion and the reinforcing portion to each other. Further, the lower end regions of the insulation active portion, reinforcing portion and connecting portion are embedded in the mold resin that covers the base ends and the side plate portions of the two busbars. This may promise desirably high precision in, as well as positioning of the opposing plate portions per se, positioning of the opposing plate portions and the insulating member, and may further provide a sufficient fixing strength at roots of the opposing plate portions. The busbar structure thus characterized may greatly improve the resistance to stress of the components disposed in proximity and may successfully prevent the risk that the components disposed in proximity deteriorate and deform after continued use over time and possibly invite the risk of breakdown of the capacitor.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">2] The connecting portion may cover an upper edge, edges on lateral sides, and a bent portion of the one of the opposing plate portions, the bent portion being continuous from the one of the opposing plate portions to the side plate portion. This structural feature may assure a sufficient strength of the whole insulating member including the insulation active portion, reinforcing portion and connecting portion.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">3] The connecting portion may be supported by allowing a bottom surface thereof to contact the upper surface of the capacitor element. The positions and postures of the opposing plate portions may be further stabilized by thus having the connecting portion of the insulating member supported by the upper surface of the capacitor element.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">4] The connecting portion may include a horizontal support that supports a lower surface of the side plate portion in the other one of the first and second busbars. This may conduce to better stability of the position and posture of the other busbar.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">5] The connecting portion may include an engaging member that controls relative displacement of the other one of the opposing plate portions. This may also conduce to better stability in the position and posture of the other busbar.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Advantageous Effects</heading><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The present invention may provide the following advantages important for low inductance; facilitated checkup of possible loss of the filling resin and/or any resin-missing voids, improved reliability in relative positioning and positional and dimensional accuracies of the opposing plate portions and the insulating member, and improved resistance to stress of the components disposed in proximity. Further, the present invention may successfully offer improved productivity and lower production cost.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0009" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of principal structural components of a capacitor according to an example of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective view of a capacitor element and a second busbar according to the example.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a side cross-sectional view of a first busbar with an insulating member being attached thereto according to the example.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>a </i></figref>is a front cross-sectional view of the insulating member- attached first busbar according to the example.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>b </i></figref>is a front cross-sectional view of a second busbar with an insulating member being attached thereto according to the example.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a side cross-sectional view of an assembly (of structural components) according to the example.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a side cross-sectional view of the capacitor according to the example.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a side cross-sectional view of a capacitor according to another example of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a perspective view of principal structural components, illustrating two opposing plate portions; a second plate portion, and a first plate portion with an insulating member being attached thereto.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0010" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The busbar structure for use in the capacitor described herein are more specifically described below based on different embodiments of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>6</b></figref> are illustrated a capacitor element <b>1</b>, a first busbar <b>2</b>, a second busbar <b>3</b>, an insulating member <b>4</b>, a mold resin <b>5</b>, and an exterior case <b>6</b>.
