Areas with high acoustical isolation (commonly referred to as &#x2018;soundproofed&#x2019;) are requested and required for a variety of purposes. Apartments, condominiums, hotels, schools and hospitals all require walls, ceilings and floors that are specifically designed to reduce the transmission of sound in order to minimize or eliminate the disruption to people in adjacent rooms. Soundproofing is particularly important in buildings adjacent to public transportation including highways, airports and railroad lines. Additionally, theaters and home theaters, music practice rooms, recording studios and others require increased noise abatement for acceptable listening levels. Likewise, hospitals and general healthcare facilities have begun to recognize acoustical comfort as an important part of a patient's recovery time. One measure of the severity of multi-party residential and commercial noise control issues is the widespread emergence of model building codes and design guidelines that specify minimum Sound Transmission Class (STC) ratings for specific wall structures within a building. Another measure is the broad emergence of litigation between homeowners and builders over the issue of unacceptable noise levels. To the detriment of the U.S. economy, both problems have resulted in major builders refusing to build homes, condominiums and apartments in certain municipalities; and in cancellation of liability insurance for builders.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">When a problem arises and the project success is at risk, the building owner must remediate the existing constructed building partitions. Various construction techniques and products have emerged to address the problem of noise control, but few are well suited to a situation of post-construction remediation. Choices include: additional gypsum drywall layers; the addition of resilient channels plus additional isolated drywall panels; and the addition of mass-loaded vinyl barriers plus additional drywall panels; cellulose-based sound board. All of these changes incrementally help reduce the noise transmission, but not to such an extent that identified problems areas would be considered fully mitigated (restoring privacy or comfort). The noise may come from rooms above or below the occupied space, or from an outdoor noise source. In fact, several of the above named methods only offer a two to eight decibel improvement in acoustical performance over that of standard construction techniques that have no regard for acoustical isolation. Such a small improvement represents a just noticeable difference, not a soundproofing solution. A popular example solution is that of an additional layer of gypsum wallboard added to an existing wall assembly. This addition only improves the wall's acoustical performance by two to three decibels overall. Such a difference would not be perceptible under normal living conditions. To be truly effective (yielding an improvement in acoustical performance of ten decibels or more), one side of the wall is typically demolished and reconstructed with additional soundproofing measures and materials. This traditional approach involves the burden of additional, costly construction materials, or extra labor expense due to complicated designs and additional assembly steps, and oftentimes, both expensive materials and labor.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">More recently, an alternative building noise control product having laminated structures and utilizing a viscoelastic glue has been introduced to the market. The foregoing structures are disclosed and claimed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,181,891 issued Feb. 27, 2007 to the assignee of the present application. The contents of this patent are incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Laminated structures disclosed and claimed in the '891 patent include gypsum board layers and these laminated panels eliminate the need for additional materials such as resilient channels, mass loaded vinyl barriers, and additional layers of drywall during initial construction. The resulting system offers excellent acoustical performance improvements of up to 15 decibels in some cases. However, these structures are better suited for new construction than for the acoustical remediation of existing walls or other building partitions. A first shortcoming of this solution is the cost of the premanufactured panel. Such panels consist of five to 11 layers of materials carefully laminated in prescribed manufacturing method. As a result, the panels typically cost significantly more than traditional drywall panels of the same general dimensions. Further, such panels cannot be cut using the traditional tools used in the drywall installation trades. Rather than using a box cutter or utility knife to score the panel for fracture by hand, the panels must be scored multiple times and broken with great force over the edge of a table or workbench. Often times, the quality of the resulting break (in terms of accuracy of placement and overall straightness) is poor. In practice, skilled trades typically resort to the use of power tools such as saws and rotary cutters. This adds to the dust generation, the time required to install the panels, and the time required for site cleanup.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An alternative to the premanufactured panels mentioned above is that of the field application of a viscoelastic glue to regular drywall panels. In this method of noise control, the tradesperson or building owner purchases standard gypsum drywall and a quantity of viscoelastic glue, packaged in buckets or caulking tubes. The tradesperson then distributes the glue via a caulk gun or trowels it across the surface of an unmounted sheet of drywall. After the glue is allowed to dry, the installer tilts the coated drywall sheet onto an existing wall assembly. Viscoelastic glues of the type described here are available from Serious Materials of Sunnyvale, Calif. and Green Glue Company of Fargo, N. Dak. The foregoing method of self-assembly has the opportunity to effectively mitigate noise, but is has many obvious shortcomings. First, for a typical architectural installation, the glue must be spread across many hundreds, if not thousands of square feet of gypsum panels. This requires an expansive and inconvenient lay down area for such an activity. Second, the spreading of so much glue in a controlled manner requires considerable effort and labor expense. It is not typical for the drywall trades to spread glue and manually create such assemblies. Special crews need to be trained in the method and many refuse to take on this additional responsibility. Those who do perform the task may pass on exceptional labor charges for the task to the owner of general contractor. In many cases, the installed cost of the final assembly is greater than that of the premanufactured panels. Another shortcoming of this method is the inconsistent assembly technique. The performance of the assembly is very dependent upon the quality of the glue application (including glue layer thickness and coverage). With individual field application of the critical glue component, one cannot guarantee the final performance of a given assembly. Many of these assemblies underperform the glue manufacturers' expectations by five to 20 decibels.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, what is needed is a new material and a new method of construction to reduce the transmission of sound from a given room to an adjacent area while simultaneously minimizing the materials required and the cost of installation labor during construction.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A figure of merit for the sound reducing qualities of a material or method of construction is the material or wall assembly's Sound Transmission Class (STC). The STC rating is a classification which is used in the architectural field to rate partitions, doors and windows for their effectiveness in blocking sound. The rating assigned to a particular partition design as a result of acoustical testing represents a best fit type of approach to a curve that establishes the STC value. The test is conducted in such a way as to make it independent of the test environment and yields a number for the partition only and not its surrounding structure or environment. The measurement methods that determine an STC rating are defined by the American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM). They are ASTM E 90, &#x201c;Standard Test Method Laboratory Measurement of Airborne Sound Transmission Loss of Building Partitions and Elements,&#x201d; and ASTM E413 &#x201c;Classification for Sound Insulation,&#x201d; used to calculate STC ratings from the sound transmission loss data for a given structure. These standards are available on the Internet at http://www.astm.org.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with the present invention, a new laminated structure and associated manufacturing process are disclosed which significantly improve both the material's installation efficiency and the ability of a wall, ceiling, floor or door to reduce the transmission of sound from one architectural space (e.g. room) to an adjacent architectural space, or from the exterior to the interior of an architectural space (e.g. room), or from the interior to the exterior of an architectural space.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The structures include a lamination of two or more different materials. In accordance with one embodiment, a laminated drywall cladding comprises a composite of one layer of selected thickness gypsum board, and a layer of selected thickness sound dissipating adhesive. The sound dissipating adhesive is applied directly to a surface of the gypsum board on the liner or back paper surface of the gypsum board. In one embodiment, the glue layer is a specially formulated QuietGlue&#xae;adhesive, which is a viscoelastic material, of a specific thickness. In another embodiment the glue layer is a layer of intumescent glue called Fire-Enhanced (FE) Quiet Glue&#xae; adhesive. Formed on a surface of one gypsum board, the glue layer is about 1/32 inch thick. In one instance, a 4 foot&#xd7;8 foot panel constructed using a 1/32 inch thick layer of glue has a total thickness of approximately &#x215d; inches. A double-sided wall structure constructed using standard &#x215d; inch thick gypsum panels, single wood studs, R13 fiberglass batts in the stud cavity, has a STC rating of approximately 34. With the addition of a layer of the laminated drywall cladding panel screwed to each side provides an STC value of approximately 55. If additional layers of standard gypsum were screwed to a wall rather than the laminated drywall cladding panel, the STC would be approximately an STC 39. The result is a reduction in noise transmitted through the wall structure is approximately 21 decibels when using the laminated drywall cladding panel as compared a 5 decibel improvement to the same structure using common (untreated) gypsum boards of equivalent mass and thickness.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In alternative embodiments of the present invention, cellulose-based boards or cement-based boards can be used instead of gypsum board.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of

It should be understood, however, that the laminated structure of this invention will be oriented vertically when placed on vertical walls, doors or other vertical partitions, as well as horizontally or even at an angle when placed on ceilings and floors. Therefore, the reference to bottom and top layers is to be understood to refer only to these layers as oriented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and not in the context of the vertical use of this structure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows laminated structure <b>100</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. A bottom layer <b>101</b> is gypsum board and in one embodiment is &#xbd; inch thick. Of course, many other combinations and thicknesses can be used for this layer as desired. The thickness is limited only by the acoustical attenuation (i.e., STC rating) desired for the resulting laminated structure and by the weight of the resulting structure which will limit the ability of workers to install the laminated panel on walls, ceilings, floors and doors for its intended use.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The gypsum board suitable for use for bottom layer <b>101</b> typically is fabricated using standard well-known techniques and thus the method for fabricating the gypsum board will not be described.

Glue <b>102</b>, made of a viscoelastic polymer, has the property that the kinetic energy in the sound which interacts with the glue, when constrained by surrounding layers, will be significantly dissipated by the glue thereby reducing 10 the sound's total energy across a broad frequency spectrum, and thus the sound energy which will transmit through the resulting laminar structure. Typically, viscoelastic glue <b>102</b> is made of the materials as set forth in TABLE 1, although other glues having similar characteristics to those set forth directly below TABLE 1 can also be used in this invention.

This fire enhanced glue is made of a viscoelastic polymer doped with fire retardants, has the property of sound dissipation. In other words, when energy in the sound interacts with the glue when constrained by surrounding layers, it will be significantly dissipated thereby reducing the sound's amplitude across a broad frequency spectrum. As a result, the energy of sound which will transmit through the resulting laminated structure is significantly reduced.

Intumescent compositions are materials which, when heated above their critical temperature, will bubble and swell, thereby forming a thick non-flammable multi-cellular insulative barrier, up to 200 or more times their original thickness. When applied as intumescent coatings they can provide the protective, serviceable and aesthetic properties of non-fire-retardant coatings or layers without occupying any additional initial volume. Intumescent coatings are discussed in detail in Intumescent Coating Systems, Their Development and Chemistry, H. L. Vandersall, J. Fire &#x26; Flammability, Vol. 2 (April 1971) pages 97-140, the content of which article is herein incorporated by reference.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0045">Although the majority of commercially available intumescent coatings provide a substantially carbonaceous foam, it is within the scope of this invention to employ inorganic foaming mixtures, (e.g. phosphate/borate) mixtures, expandable graphite intercalation compounds, or a combination of both. The intumescent materials which may be employed in the practice of this invention should swell to at least about two times their original thickness when heated <b>5</b> above their critical temperature.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0046">Expandable graphite intercalation compounds are also known as expanding graphite and are commercially available. They are compounds, which contain foreign components intercalated between the lattice layers of the graphite. Such expandable graphite intercalation compounds usually are 10 prepared by dispersing graphite particles in a solution, which contains an oxidizing agent and a guest compound, which is to be intercalated. Usually, nitric acid, potassium chlorate, chromic acid, potassium permanganate and the like are used as oxidizing agent.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00002" num="00002"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 2</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Fire-Enhanced (FE) Quiet Glue&#x2009;&#xae; </entry></row><row><entry>Adhesive Chemical Makeup</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="2"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="84pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="133pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>WEIGHT %</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="84pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="56pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="56pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>COMPONENTS</entry><entry>Min</entry><entry>Max</entry><entry>Preferred</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="84pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="56pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="21pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="56pt" align="char" char="."/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>acrylate polymer</entry><entry>30</entry><entry>70</entry><entry>41</entry></row><row><entry>ethyl acrylate, methacrylic</entry><entry>0</entry><entry>3.0</entry><entry>0.3</entry></row><row><entry>acid, polymer with ethyl-2-</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>propenoate</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>hydrophobic silica</entry><entry>0</entry><entry>1.0</entry><entry>0.2</entry></row><row><entry>paraffin oil</entry><entry>0</entry><entry>3.0</entry><entry>1.5</entry></row><row><entry>silicon dioxide</entry><entry>0</entry><entry>1.0</entry><entry>0.1</entry></row><row><entry>sodium carbonate</entry><entry>0</entry><entry>3.0</entry><entry>0.6</entry></row><row><entry>stearic acid, aluminum salt</entry><entry>0</entry><entry>1.0</entry><entry>0.1</entry></row><row><entry>surfactant</entry><entry>0</entry><entry>2.0</entry><entry>0.6</entry></row><row><entry>rosin ester</entry><entry>0</entry><entry>20</entry><entry>7</entry></row><row><entry>Zinc Borate</entry><entry>0</entry><entry>25</entry><entry>12</entry></row><row><entry>Melamine Phosphate</entry><entry>0</entry><entry>10</entry><entry>6</entry></row><row><entry>Ammonium Polyphosphate</entry><entry>0</entry><entry>10</entry><entry>6</entry></row><row><entry>Hexahydroxy methyl ethane</entry><entry>0</entry><entry>5.0</entry><entry>1.5</entry></row><row><entry>Cl Pigment Red Dispersion</entry><entry>0</entry><entry>1.0</entry><entry>0.02</entry></row><row><entry>water</entry><entry>10</entry><entry>40</entry><entry>23</entry></row><row><entry>2-Pyridinethiol, 1-oxide,</entry><entry>0</entry><entry>3.0</entry><entry>1</entry></row><row><entry>sodium salt</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables><br/>The preferred formulation is but one example of a fire-resistant viscoelastic glue.<br/>Other formulations may be used to achieve similar results and the range given is an example of successful formulations investigated here.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0047">The physical solid-state characteristics of FE QuietGlue&#xae; adhesive include:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0048">1) a broad glass transition temperature below room temperature;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0049">2) mechanical response typical of a rubber (i.e., elongation at break, low elastic modulus);</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0050">3) strong peel strength at room temperature;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0051">4) weak shear strength at room temperature;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0005" num="0052">6) does not dissolve in water (swells poorly);</li>        <li id="ul0004-0006" num="0053">7) peels off the substrate easily at temperature of dry ice; and</li>        <li id="ul0004-0007" num="0054">8) forms an expanding char layer when exposed to flame.<br/>FE QuietGlue&#xae; adhesive may be obtained from Serious Materials, 1250 Elko Drive, Sunnyvale, Calif., 94089.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0045" num="0055">Optionally a layer of film <b>103</b> is placed on the top of the structure and carefully pressed in a controlled manner with respect to uniform pressure (pounds per square inch), temperature and time.

Laminated structure <b>100</b>-<b>8</b> is similar to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>-H, with the exception that in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>-J fire resistant, viscoelastic glue layer <b>106</b> is utilized instead of viscoelastic glue layer <b>102</b> utilized in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>-H. As will of course be appreciated, the fire-resistant viscoelastic glue layer <b>106</b> provides additional fire intrusion protection while at the same time achieving the sound transmission reduction which is achieved by using a viscoelastic glue layer. The construction of laminated structure <b>100</b>-<b>8</b> follows the same techniques utilized above in previous embodiments and accordingly will not be repeated.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> illustrates an example of an optional embodiment of applying glue <b>102</b> to less than 100 percent of the panel surface. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> illustrates a pattern for applying the glue layer <b>102</b> as vertical strips on a 4&#x2032;&#xd7;8&#x2032; gypsum sheet. The terms &#x201c;vertical&#x201d; and &#x201c;horizontal&#x201d;, &#x201c;top&#x201d; and &#x201c;bottom&#x201d; apply only to the figures of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B, <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref> as shown for the purpose of discussion. The panel <b>100</b> may be installed in any orientation. Looking to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, &#x201c;n&#x201d; vertical strips of glue <b>102</b> provide a six inch spacing between the centers of adjacent strips for less than six inch spacing between strips. For example, for a 4&#x2032;&#xd7;8&#x2032; gypsum sheet, there are a minimum of n=9 vertical strips across the top/bottom four-foot span. A 4&#x2032;&#xd7;8&#x2032; sheet has 4,608 sq. inches of surface area. For twenty percent coverage, each strip is ((4608/96)/9)*(0.20) or about one inch wide, ninety-six inches long. For eighty percent coverage, each strip is about 4.25 inches wide, 96 inches long. In one embodiment there are more strips, spaced more closely together. For example seventeen vertical strips (that is, n=17) approximately one half inch wide on approximately three inch centers provides approximately twenty percent coverage. Other combinations of strip width and spacing may be used. The strips may be applied horizontally instead of vertically.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> is another example of a pattern for applying the glue <b>102</b>, shown as patches on a 4&#x2032;&#xd7;8&#x2032; panel. Each patch is spaced apart by six inches edge-to-edge. For the example shown, with a maximum spacing of six inches, nine 5 patches are applied in the horizontal direction and seventeen in the vertical direction, providing a matrix of circles as shown. The area of each patch, described as an effective diameter of a circle is found as:</p><p id="p-0059" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>D</i>=2&#x221a;{square root over (4608&#xd7;((% coverage)/(17&#xd7;9)&#xd7;&#x3c0;))}<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0060" num="0069">Using the above formula, for twenty percent coverage each patch is 10 approximately 2% inches diameter, and for eighty percent coverage each patch is approximately 5 34 inches in diameter. Though the patches are referred to as circles, the shape is not important. As with strips, more circles of a smaller diameter may be used. For example, 300 circles of two inch diameter provide twenty percent coverage. In some embodiments a large number of smaller 15 patches of glue <b>102</b> is used to insure keeping the laminate suitable for attachment to the host wall assembly when pieces are cut for installation over a small area.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0070">A variety of patterns may be used in applying the glue <b>102</b> during construction of the laminated panel <b>100</b>. A consideration in selecting a pattern is to insure that when a laminated panel <b>100</b> is cut during installation there will be some glue <b>102</b> near the panel cut edge, thus providing a bond at the cut edge to diminish the likelihood of panel <b>100</b> coming apart due to handling. For example, the pattern of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> might be cut vertically on the right side next to the left edge of a vertical strip, resulting in a significant gap in glue <b>102</b> coverage down the cut edge (assuming the piece to the left is the portion being installed). Accordingly, some patterns are used that improve edge coverage, regardless of the location of the cutting line. One example of such a pattern is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, wherein the glue pattern is wavy. A typical straight cut of the laminated panel <b>100</b> with a glue <b>102</b> pattern as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> would result in some glue <b>102</b> at the cut edge. As with vertical or horizontal straight strips, the wavy strips are spaced a maximum distance apart, the maximum spacing being a half wavelength of sound in the frequency of interest for the material being used for panel <b>101</b>. The pattern shown is FIG. <b>3</b>B is another embodiment of a glue <b>102</b> pattern wherein there is likely to be glue <b>102</b> coverage to a typical cut edge. The pattern shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> may be made, for example, by a random path of a glue gun. Complete coverage of an edge by glue <b>102</b> is not required; partial glue <b>102</b> coverage of individual edges will generally hold the resulting laminated panel <b>100</b> pieces to the host wall assembly for installation. The foregoing glue application patterns are of course equally applicable to all of the laminated structures disclosed herein, as well as being applicable to fire-resistant, viscoelastic glue <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> and the cross-sectional view shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> illustrate a wall structure <b>420</b> which includes laminated panel <b>100</b> after removal of film <b>103</b>, with glue layer <b>102</b> attached to a base layer <b>410</b> of existing gypsum wallboard.

Wall structure <b>520</b> includes studs <b>502</b>, <b>504</b>, <b>506</b>, upper and lower 2&#xd7;4 members <b>518</b> and <b>514</b>, along with batt-type insulation <b>412</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows the results of sound testing for a structure as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, wherein the performance exhibited by curve <b>601</b> is representative of the wall assembly illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. Sound attenuation values (STC numbers) were essentially the same for all samples yielding, an STC of approximately 49. It is known to those practicing in this field that a similar configuration with standard &#x215d; inch drywall on both sides of standard 2&#xd7;4 wood stud construction yields curve <b>602</b> and an STC of approximately 34. Accordingly, this invention yields a 15 STC point improvement over standard drywall in this particular construction.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0074">In fabricating the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the viscoelastic glue <b>102</b> is first applied in a prescribed manner with full coverage or in a selected pattern, typically to 1/16 inch thickness, although other thicknesses can be used if desired, onto surface <b>104</b> of gypsum board <b>101</b>. Film layer <b>103</b> is then placed over the viscoelastic glue layer <b>102</b>. Depending on the drying and dehumidification techniques deployed, anywhere from five minutes to forty-eight hours are required to totally dry the glue in the case that the glue is water-based. A solvent-based viscoelastic glue can be substituted.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0075">Laminated structures according to the present invention are particularly well suited for attachment to existing lightweight wall assemblies having gypsum wallboard faces. For installation, first the release film <b>103</b> is removed from the composite panel and a composite panel is attached to one or both gypsum faces of the existing wall assembly. Initial attachment is via the adhesion of the viscoelastic glue, but installation is best completed by screwing the panel to the stud assembly through the existing gypsum wall board. Attachment of the laminated structures to the existing wall board structure can of course be accomplished by other techniques, such as to the existing wall board without attachment to the stud assembly, or with a combination of both techniques. Accordingly, the newly created laminated structure created by the bonded gypsum panels, as well as with other laminated structures described herein, provides a significant improvement in the sound transmission class number associated with the structures and thus reduces significantly the sound transmitted from one room to adjacent rooms while simultaneously providing for traditional scoring and hand fracture during installation. Additionally, when Fire Enhanced QuietGlue&#xae; adhesive is utilized in the laminated structure, fire intrusion is lessened.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0076">The dimensions given for each material in the laminated structures of this invention can be varied as desired to control cost, overall thickness, weight, anticipated moisture and temperature control requirements, and STC results.
