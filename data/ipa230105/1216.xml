More specifically, embodiments of the present description relate to an external charging device for powering an implantable medical device.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Background Discussion</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Medical devices having one or more implantable components, generally referred to as implantable medical devices (IMDs), may be used to monitor a patient's condition and/or to deliver therapy to the patient. In particular, devices such as electrical stimulation or treatment devices, implantable pacemakers, defibrillators, hearing aids, organ assistant or replacement devices, and other partially or completely implanted medical devices have been successful in performing lifesaving and/or lifestyle enhancing functions for a number of years.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Often, an external component or device is employed to provide power to, and/or to communicate with, the IMD. In long term or chronic uses, IMDs may include a rechargeable power source (e.g., including one or more capacitors or batteries) that extends the operational life of the medical device to weeks, months, or even years longer than a non-rechargeable device. When the energy stored in the IMD rechargeable power source has been depleted, the patient may recharge the power source via the external component, which is typically placed adjacent to or near the patient's skin. Since the rechargeable power source is implanted in the patient and the charging device is external to the patient, this charging process may be referred to as transcutaneous (through the skin) charging. In some examples, transcutaneous charging may be performed via inductive coupling between a primary coil in the external component and a secondary coil in the IMD, the external component and the IMD thus acting in concert to form an inductive transcutaneous power link.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">One drawback to such closed-loop inductive coupling is that the external component often generates heat, which can cause discomfort or otherwise harm a patient or damage a patient's apparel. Improvements have been achieved by use of closed-loop sensing systems that monitor the temperature of the external component and modulate or stop operation of the inductive coupling based on feedback from a sensor. However, this results in additional potential failure modes and overly complicates and adds cost to the system. Also, efficiency may be reduced as a result of modulation of the inductive coupling resulting from the closed-loop control.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, there is a need for providing a mechanism to improve temperature control in these types of biomedical devices.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The technology of the present disclosure is directed to systems and methods for providing an external inductive transcutaneous power link with open-loop temperature control for powering/charging an IMD or providing for communication with an IMD via inductive coupling with the IMD.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one aspect of the technology of the present disclosure, open-loop temperature control is provided in the form of one or more aerogel-based thermal regulation/dissipation layers disposed between the patient's skin and an induction coil of an external inductive transcutaneous power device (referred to herein as an &#x201c;EPD&#x201d; for convenience). The one or more thermal regulation/dissipation layer(s) receive and/or absorb heat generated from the induction coil within an aerogel layer, and passively regulate dissipation of heat from the aerogel layer to minimize heat transfer to the patient. In an embodiment, an aerogel layer dissipates heat more slowly than heat is generated by the induction coil such that the aerogel layer slows or otherwise limits a rate of heat dissipation.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Further aspects of the technology described herein will be brought out in the following portions of the specification, wherein the detailed description is for the purpose of fully disclosing embodiments of the technology without placing limitations thereon.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The technology described herein will be more fully understood by reference to the following drawings which are for illustrative purposes only:</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an exploded perspective view of an embodiment of an EPD with open-loop temperature control according to the technology of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an assembled perspective view of the EPD of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a perspective view of an EPD disposed in a band worn around a patient to form a wearable EPD according to the technology of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> is a partial cross-sectional view of a thickness represented by region A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, showing a schematic view of an embodiment of the EPD of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> is a partial cross-sectional view of a thickness represented by region A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, showing a schematic view of another embodiment of the EPD.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref> is a partial cross-sectional view of a thickness represented by region A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, showing a schematic view of another embodiment of the EPD.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref> is a partial cross-sectional view of a thickness represented by region A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, showing a schematic view of another embodiment of the EPD.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> is a partial cross-sectional view of a thickness represented by region B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, showing a schematic view of an embodiment of the wearable EPD.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> is a partial cross-sectional view of a thickness represented by region B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, showing a schematic view of another embodiment of the wearable EPD.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref> is a partial cross-sectional view of a thickness represented by region B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, showing a schematic view of another embodiment of the wearable EPD.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In various applications, an IMD may be used to monitor a patient's condition and/or deliver therapy to a patient. By way of example, an IMD may be a device such as an electrical stimulation or treatment device, an implantable pacemaker, a defibrillator, a hearing aid, an organ assistant or replacement device, or other partially or completely implanted medical device.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Embodiments of the present disclosure include systems and methods for providing an EPD with open-loop temperature control for powering/charging, and/or for providing for communication with, an IMD via inductive coupling. Communication may be, for example, unilaterally or bilaterally exchanging signals, data, or commands.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Often, and in particular use cases involving long term or chronic treatment or therapy, the IMD will include a rechargeable power source (e.g., one or more capacitors or batteries) that can extend the operational life of the IMD to weeks, months, or even years beyond that of a non-rechargeable device. When energy stored in the IMD rechargeable power source has been diminished or depleted, the patient may recharge the power source via an EPD. The EPD, which may alternatively be referred to as an &#x201c;external controller&#x201d; or &#x201c;external charging unit&#x201d;, is configured to be positioned at a location external to the body and adjacent to or near the skin. The EPD wirelessly couples to the IMD by way of inductive coupling between a primary coil in the EPD and a secondary coil in the IMD. Inductive coupling will generally be improved as the primary coil and the secondary coil approach alignment with each other, and also will generally be improved as the primary coil and the secondary coil are brought closer to each other (a distance between is reduced).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The EPD of the present description, variably detailed in example embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>, is configured to operate in an open-loop configuration to passively dissipate heat that is inherently generated as a result of the activation of the primary induction coil in the EPD. This controlled heat dissipation is primarily achieved via an aerogel barrier disposed between the induction coil and the patient's skin surface. The aerogel layer is configured to absorb or otherwise receive heat generated from the induction coil and passively regulate (e.g., slow the rate of) dissipation of heat from the EPD to reduce or minimize possible heat transfer to the patient.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">While the system and methods of the technology of the present disclosure are configured to operate without closed-loop temperature control, it is appreciated that the systems and methods may also be used to complement or otherwise be incorporated with an EPD having some form of closed-loop control (e.g., temperature feedback).</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an exploded perspective view of an embodiment of an EPD <b>10</b> with open-loop temperature control according to the technology of the present disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a corresponding assembled perspective view of EPD <b>10</b> according to an embodiment.

The wire windings of induction coil <b>12</b>, as well as other circuits/logic that may be included with induction coil <b>12</b>, may be encased in or otherwise contained by an over-mold (e.g., a polymeric or other material molded over). Upper housing <b>16</b><i>a </i>and lower housing <b>16</b><i>b </i>may be a biocompatible plastic or polymer, although other materials are contemplated. Upper housing <b>16</b><i>a </i>and lower housing <b>16</b><i>b </i>may be secured together via screw, bolt or other fastener <b>28</b> as housing <b>16</b> shown in the assembled view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, to encase induction coil <b>12</b>, core <b>20</b>, and other associated componentry. Lead wires <b>18</b> extend through housing <b>16</b>, and may be coupled to a connector (e.g., micro USB, USB Mini) for coupling lead wires <b>18</b> and induction coil <b>12</b> to a power source or controller (not shown). Construction, materials, and components selected for and used with induction coil <b>12</b>, core <b>20</b>, lead wires <b>18</b>, and housing <b>16</b> may vary.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In operation, an electric current supplied via lead wires <b>18</b> is passed through induction coil <b>12</b>, creating a magnetic field used in providing power to (or communicating with) an IMD (e.g., IMD <b>50</b> in patient <b>52</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) via inductive coupling. When a current is applied to inductive coil <b>12</b> of EPD <b>10</b>, and EPD <b>10</b> is aligned to an extent with a secondary coil (not shown) of IMD <b>50</b>, electrical current is induced in the secondary coil within the patient. Circuitry (not shown) associated with the IMD can use the current to charge a rechargeable power source (e.g., a battery) within the IMD, and may also use the current to power the IMD and/or to communicate with EPD <b>10</b>. Inductive coupling inherently generates heat at induction coil <b>12</b>, emanating outward from surfaces <b>22</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). Because of the proximity of induction coil <b>12</b> to the patient, such heat may irritate or harm a patient, such as when EPD <b>10</b> is worn for an extended period of time.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Accordingly, one or more passive heat dissipation layer(s) <b>14</b><i>a/</i><b>14</b><i>b </i>are disposed between induction coil <b>12</b> and a patient to provide open-loop temperature control with respect to EPD <b>10</b>. Heat dissipation layer(s) <b>14</b><i>a/</i><b>14</b><i>b </i>may be constructed from a single material or multiple materials. For example, heat dissipation layer <b>14</b><i>a </i>or <b>14</b><i>b </i>may include an aerogel layer disposed adjacent to or between layers of other material(s), or heat dissipation layer <b>14</b><i>a </i>or <b>14</b><i>b </i>may include multiple aerogel layers interspersed between layers of other material(s), or heat dissipation layer <b>14</b><i>a </i>or <b>14</b><i>b </i>may include multiple aerogel layers stacked one against another. When multiple aerogel layers are used, each aerogel layer may have different physical properties and different heat dissipation profiles. Aerogel heat dissipation layer(s) <b>14</b><i>a/</i><b>14</b><i>b </i>may also include or be integrated with one or more non-aerogel insulative materials or layers.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Heat dissipation layer <b>14</b><i>a </i>and/or <b>14</b><i>b </i>are configured to receive (e.g., absorb) heat generated from induction coil <b>12</b>, and can therefore act as a heat barrier between induction coil <b>12</b> and the patient's skin surface.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In an embodiment, heat dissipation layer <b>14</b><i>a </i>and/or <b>14</b><i>b </i>includes a silica aerogel (e.g., Enova&#xae; aerogel by Cabot Corporation).
