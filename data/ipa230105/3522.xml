In the case of these laser systems a distinction is drawn between rotary lasers, which generate the linear laser marking by rotation of a beam deflection optical unit about an axis of rotation, and line lasers, which generate the linear laser marking by means of a beam shaping optical unit, for example a cylindrical lens, a prism or a conical mirror. In order that the known laser systems can be used without protective measures in the form of protective goggles and reflectors, the laser power must be limited in order to prevent damage to the human eye. For laser systems in laser class 2 or 2M, the maximum permissible laser power is 1 mW.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">As a result of the laser power being limited to values of less than 1 mW, known laser systems in laser class 2 or 2M have the disadvantage that the linear laser marking on the projection surface is poorly visible. It holds true here that the visibility of the linear laser marking is all the worse, the wider the laser marking on the projection surface, since the visibility decreases as the power density decreases. Moreover, the quality of the linear laser marking on the projection surface is dependent on the distance between the laser system and the projection surface.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">EP 2 411 762 B1 discloses the typical set-up of a laser system for generating a linear laser marking with an opening angle of 360&#xb0;. The laser system comprises a laser beam source, which generates a divergent laser beam and emits it along a propagation direction, a beam shaping optical unit, which is embodied as a collimation optical unit and reshapes the divergent laser beam into a collimated laser beam, and a conical mirror embodied as a right cone having a cone axis and a reflective lateral surface, wherein the conical mirror is arranged in the beam path of the laser beam downstream of the collimation optical unit and the cone axis is oriented coaxially with respect to the optical axis of the collimation optical unit.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The laser system known from EP 2 411 762 B1 has the disadvantage that a sharply delimited laser marking is not generated on the projection surface. The laser marking consists of a primary line and at least one secondary line. The occurrence of a plurality of lines is caused by the fact that the laser beam source generates a laser beam having a plurality of orders of diffraction which are diffracted differently at the cone vertex of the conical mirror and occur as adjacent lines on the projection surface.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 7,497,018 B2 discloses a known laser system for generating a laser marking on a projection surface. The laser system comprises a laser beam source, a collimation optical unit having a first optical axis, a conical mirror having a cone axis, and a deflection mirror arranged between the collimation optical unit and the conical mirror. The laser beam source generates a divergent laser beam that impinges on the collimation optical unit and is reshaped into a collimated laser beam. The collimated laser beam impinges on the deflection mirror, which deflects the laser beam by 90&#xb0; in the direction of the conical mirror. The conical mirror generates a laser beam that propagates in a plane perpendicular to the collimated laser beam and generates a linear laser marking on the projection surface. The cone axis of the conical mirror is arranged parallel and offset with respect to the first optical axis of the collimation optical unit. As a result of the parallel offset, the center of the collimated laser beam does not impinge on the cone vertex, but rather on the reflective lateral surface of the conical mirror.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The laser system known from U.S. Pat. No. 7,497,018 B2 has the disadvantage that no closed linear laser marking with an opening angle of 360&#xb0; is generated on a projection surface. The linear laser marking on the projection surface is limited to opening angles of less than 180&#xb0;. The laser system is not suitable for generating a closed linear laser marking.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">An object of the present invention is to develop a laser system which makes it possible to generate a sharply delimited, highly visible linear laser marking with an opening angle of 360&#xb0; on a projection surface. Moreover, the laser system is intended to be embodied as compactly as possible.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention provides a laser system (<b>10</b>; <b>40</b>; <b>60</b>; <b>90</b>; <b>110</b>) for generating a linear laser marking (<b>38</b>; <b>54</b>; <b>88</b>; <b>104</b>) on a projection surface (<b>37</b>; <b>53</b>; <b>87</b>; <b>103</b>), comprising:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0010">a laser beam source (<b>11</b>; <b>61</b>), which generates a laser beam (<b>28</b>; <b>78</b>) and emits it along a propagation direction (<b>29</b>; <b>79</b>),</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0011">an offset device (<b>16</b>; <b>66</b>) having a first interface (<b>21</b>; <b>71</b>), at which a first deflection of the laser beam is effected, and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0012">a conical mirror (<b>14</b>; <b>64</b>), which is embodied as a right cone having a cone axis (<b>15</b>; <b>65</b>) and a reflective lateral surface (<b>26</b>; <b>76</b>), wherein the conical mirror (<b>14</b>; <b>64</b>) is arranged in the beam path of the laser beam downstream of the offset device (<b>16</b>; <b>66</b>), characterized in that the offset device (<b>16</b>; <b>66</b>) is embodied as rotatable about an axis of rotation (<b>17</b>; <b>67</b>), wherein the axis of rotation (<b>17</b>; <b>67</b>) is arranged coaxially with respect to the cone axis (<b>15</b>; <b>65</b>).</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0011" num="0013">According to the invention, the laser system is characterized in that the offset device is embodied as rotatable about an axis of rotation, wherein the axis of rotation of the offset device is arranged coaxially with respect to the cone axis. The laser system according to the invention generates a linear laser marking which has an opening angle of 360&#xb0; and which is sharply delimited and highly visible on the projection surface. By virtue of the offset device, the optical axis of the laser beam is displaced relative to the cone axis and the laser beam does not impinge on the cone vertex of the conical mirror, such that diffraction effects at the cone vertex which can result in an unsharp laser marking are reduced.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0014">The conical mirror generates a linear laser beam with an opening angle that is less than 180&#xb0;. As a result of the rotation of the offset device, a linear laser marking with an opening angle of 360&#xb0; is generated on the projection surface. The laser system according to the invention has the advantage over a conventional rotary laser that lower rotational speeds are possible, resulting in better visibility of the laser marking on the projection surface. In the case of conventional rotary lasers, the punctiform laser beam has to be moved with a high rotational speed in order to generate a closed linear laser marking on the projection surface for the eye of the user.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0015">Preferably, the offset device comprises a second interface, at which a second deflection of the laser beam is effected, wherein the propagation direction of a laser beam entering the offset device is arranged parallel to the propagation direction of a laser beam emerging from the offset device. An offset device having a first and a second interface enables a compact set-up of the laser system. In the case of an offset device having only a first interface, the laser beam source and the offset device and also further optical elements arranged between laser beam source and offset device must be embodied as rotatable; in the case of an offset device having a first and a second interface, it is sufficient for the offset device to be embodied as rotatable.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0016">Preferably, the laser system comprises a first beam shaping optical unit embodied as a collimation optical unit and having a first optical axis, wherein the first optical axis is oriented parallel to the cone axis. The extent of the laser system according to the invention by the collimation optical unit has the advantage that a divergent laser beam can be collimated. The collimated laser beam has better visibility on the projection surface by comparison with a divergent laser beam, since the power density is greater. The visibility of a linear laser marking is all the better, the narrower the laser marking on the projection surface, since the visibility increases as the power density increases.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0017">Preferably, the laser system comprises a second beam shaping optical unit embodied as a focusing optical unit with a focal length and having a second optical axis, wherein the second beam shaping optical unit is arranged in the beam path of the laser beam between the laser beam source and the first beam shaping optical unit and the second optical axis is oriented parallel to the cone axis. The extension of the laser system according to the invention by a focusing optical unit has the advantage that the beam diameter of the laser beam can be adapted. A focusing optical unit is defined as an optical element which has a finite focal length and focusses an impinging laser beam, wherein the beam diameter of the laser beam is minimal in the focus position. A focused laser beam has a smaller beam diameter than a non-focused laser beam in the region of the focus position. The smaller beam diameter has the advantage that the first beam shaping optical unit, the offset device and the conical mirror can have smaller dimensions.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0018">Particularly preferably, the focal length of the focusing optical unit is adjustable. A focusing optical unit with an adjustable focal length has the advantage that the width of the linear laser marking on the projection surface can be altered by means of the focusing optical unit. The narrower the linear laser marking on the projection surface, the more accurately the operator can perform the leveling or marking work. Moreover, a sharply delimited linear laser marking has better visibility for the operator since the available power of a maximum of 1 mW is distributed over a smaller area and a higher power density results.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0019">In a preferred embodiment, the offset device is embodied as a reflective offset device and the deflection of the laser beam at the first interface and the second interface is effected by reflection. A laser system according to the invention comprising a reflective offset device has the advantage that the first interface and the second interface can be integrated into separate optical elements which can be adjustable independently of one another.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0020">Particularly preferably, the first interface is embodied as adjustable about a first tilt axis and/or the second interface is embodied as adjustable about a second tilt axis, wherein the first tilt axis and the second tilt axis are oriented perpendicularly to the axis of rotation. A reflective first interface that is adjustable about a first tilt axis and/or a reflective second interface that is adjustable about a second tilt axis afford(s) the possibility of altering the angle of incidence of the laser beam on the lateral surface. The aim is to generate by means of the conical mirror a linear laser beam with a propagation plane that extends perpendicularly to the cone axis.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0021">In a further development, the laser system comprises a distance measuring device, wherein the distance measuring device is suitable for determining a distance between the laser system and the projection surface. The extension of the laser system according to the invention by a distance measuring device has the advantage that the focal length of the focusing optical unit can be adapted to the distance between the laser system and the projection surface.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0022">Exemplary embodiments of the invention are described hereinafter with reference to the drawing.
