id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to safety door hinge pin springs, and, more particularly, to a temperature activated door spring for promoting fire safety. Even more particularly, the present invention relates to a replacement insert for a door hinge, specifically a spring-powered insert, that replaces a door's existing hinge pin and applies stored mechanical force to close the attached door to prevent ingress of adverse conditions.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">According to a September 2017 report from the National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) U.S. fire departments responded to an estimated average of 358,500 home structure fires per year during 2011-2015. These fires caused an average of 2,510 civilian deaths, <b>12</b>,<b>300</b> civilian injuries, and $6.7 billion in direct property damage per year. Seventy percent of reported home fires and 84% of the home fire deaths occurred in one- or two-family homes. The remainder occurred in apartments or other multi-family housing. Estimates were derived from the U.S. Fire Administration's National Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS) and the National Fire Protection Association's fire department experience survey. (NFPA, &#x201c;Home Structure Fires,&#x201d; 2017).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Further, according to the same report, Home fire deaths occur more often in cooler months and between 11:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. In 2011-2015, 47% of home structure fires and 56% of home structure fire deaths occurred in the five months of November through March. Reported home fires peaked around the dinner hours of 5:00 to 8:00 p.m. While just one-fifth (20%) of reported home fires occurred between 11:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m., half (52%) of the home fire deaths resulted from fires reported during these hours (Id).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As is known by fire-fighting professionals and fire departments, having a bedroom door closed can protect belongings inside even when temperatures reach 1,000 degrees. Having one's door closed can make a 900 degree difference in a fire. As a result having a door that automatically closes can be a life saver. While fire doors are required to separate a living space from a garage, for example, standard fire doors are kept in the closed position unless propped open (which is not recommended). For bedrooms and other interior rooms of a home it would be desirable to have the option of keeping a door open without the need for a door jam or the like.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Such devices are available but have several drawbacks. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 8,955,194 issued Feb. 17, 2015 to Teta teaches a closure mechanism for a door actuated during a fire, which causes the door to automatically close. However, Teta teaches a mechanism that requires replacement of an entire hinge with a new hinge that includes a spring mechanism within the hinge. As a result, it is cumbersome to install since the entire hinge must be replaced and it requires a fairly complex set of internal parts.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to overcome the drawbacks of the prior art, the disclosure herein describes a closure mechanism for a door that is actuated during a fire. The closure mechanism automatically closes the door. Installation of the closure mechanism is easily accomplished by placing it on an existing door hinge and t<b>1</b>olding it in place by a hinge pin.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The disclosure further describes a replacement insert for a door hinge, particularly a spring-powered insert, that replaces a door's existing hinge pin and applies stored mechanical force to close the door to prevent ingress of adverse conditions, such as fire, gas, smoke, biohazards, and the like. Indeed, there exists no known automatic release door closers in hinge pin replacement form that will close a door in case of such adverse environmental conditions without intervention. Likewise, there exists no known device for an electronically triggered automatic door closer module with purely mechanical failsafe backup for abnormal environmental conditions.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">This summary is provided to introduce, in a simplified form, a selection concepts that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This summary is not intended to identify key features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Disclosed herein is a temperature activated door spring device including a spring having a coil, an upper arm and a lower arm contiguous with the coil. The coil includes an inner hinge pin hole and has a circumferential edge sized to mount on the top of a hinge knuckle. A collar is affixed within the inner hinge pin hole wherein the inner hinge pin hole is encompassed by the collar and is sized to accept an inserted hinge pin. A pellet hole is located proximate an extended end of the upper arm, wherein the pellet hole is sized to accept a fusible pellet. An upper portion of the pellet hole traverses through the upper arm and a lower portion of the pellet hole traverses through the lower arm so that when a fusible pellet is inserted into the pellet hole it holds the upper arm and the lower arm together in a spring loaded position.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention's intended purpose is to prevent or slow the spread or ingress of hazardous environmental conditions by closing a door or doors automatically and without manual intervention or input when an adverse condition is detected. The present invention accomplishes this purpose by providing a preferably spring-powered replacement insert for a door hinge. The replacement insert applies stored mechanical force to close the associated door to prevent movement of the adverse condition from room to room.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Adverse conditions that can trigger the present invention include, but are not limited to, temperature or humidity, the presence of fire, gas, and/or smoke, the presence of volatile compounds, contaminations, allergens, particulate and atomized compounds and/or vapors, carcinogenic compounds, and airborne biohazards, for example. Other conditions that may trigger the device of the present invention, in preferable embodiments, include detection of intrusion, Al analysis, and/or predicted trends in the environment. Some preferable embodiments of the device may additionally be triggered due to light or sound conditions, through ultrasound or infrasound detection, and/or by radio or electromagnetic radiation detection or by other electronic triggers, such as radio, optical, sonic, ultrasonic, or quantum methods of communication.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The device includes a spring that is preferably pre-tensioned in manufacturing and retained using a quick-release rachet mechanism. The quick release is activated preferably electronically through an onboard controller that reads data from onboard sensors and receives signals from remote activators. Upon receiving an activation condition, the onboard controller activates the device's internal motor, which is connected to a partial free rotation split junction clutch that allows for limited free rotation before engaging a driving spur gear. The driving spur gear interfaces to a mating set of teeth on a mechanical switch that is connected to the affector shaft. The affector shaft includes a hemisection keyway, and when the affector shaft rotates the hemisection keyway clear of the ratchet pawl ramping it away from the ratchet teeth, this disengages the ratchet and releases the spring potential. The spring thus imparts leverage force to the door hinge, closing the door and impeding the movement of the adverse condition(s) through the doorway.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In case of electronic trigger failure, preferable embodiments of the present invention's device include a purely mechanical failsafe backup consisting of a fusible shunt and a trigger leaf operating in concert with a secondary spring. When the device detects certain adverse conditions, particularly thermal adverse conditions indicating the presence of fire, the fusible shunt releases and allows the secondary spring to apply torsion to rotate the mechanical switch, thereby releasing the main spring to close the door.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Notably, preferable embodiments of the device are also capable of interfacing with similar and dissimilar devices, operating in concert and/or controlling such other devices to assist in preventing movement of adverse conditions by closing doors. For example, the present invention may interface with a building's fire detection systems. Such preferable embodiments may interface with such other devices' sensors or other monitoring features to trigger activation upon detection of an adverse condition by such other devices.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">To accomplish the objectives of the present invention, preferable embodiments of the device include a concentric axial metal dowel pin sized similar to existing door hinge pins that retain the two leaves of a hinge. The device can thus be used to replace such hinge pins on one or more hinges of any number of doors within a location, arming each such door with automatic closing technology in the case of an adverse environmental condition. Preferable embodiments of the device feature two counter rotating pins, the first of which is attached to a pully in which a ring gear of ratchet teeth rotates around a smooth molded bearing. Each counter rotating pin is preferably peripherally axially mounted and coincidental when homed. Upon detection of an adverse condition activating the device, the two peripherally mounted axial pins counter rotate and impart force against the door and its components, such as door hinges, door jam, molding, etc., driving the door into a closed position. The device also includes a mechanically retained spring that preferably stores a sufficient amount of energy to close an unhindered door of typical size and weight with or without electrical potential or manual intervention.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The main actuation spring coils around the central core of the unit below the triggers and above the rotating arms of the device. The main spring is retained at the top end within a notch on the overhanging cover of the central core, and the lower end of the spring is retained with a ledge in the upper part of the ring gear. The present invention's device also preferably includes a resettable ratchet quick release mechanism that allows for re-setting and winding of the main spring, which provides the dosing force upon activation due to detection of an adverse condition.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Preferable embodiments of the present invention also include a shaft with a keyway that, when rotated, mechanically draws the ratchet mechanism pawl into the free position to allow the main spring energy to release and close the door. When the shaft is in the home position, the keyway allows the spring to drive the ratchet mechanism pawl into the ratchet teeth, preventing unwinding but permitting winding of the device.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Preferable embodiments of the device further include a switch lever on top of the ratchet affector shaft. A spool concentric to the ratchet affector shaft hosts the mechanical failsafe spring, and above the pool and mechanical failsafe spring is preferably a ledge with a center pin to retain a diametrically aligned toroidal disc magnet. The switch lever also preferably features an arm with a right angle vertical surface to receive the mechanical backup trigger spring and features spur gear teeth beneath and concentrically radial to the affector shaft.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Preferable embodiments of the device also include a spur gear coupled to a motor with a limited free rotation split junction clutch, which allows the motor to drive the switch to home or activated positions. While in the home position, the clutch permits activation of the switch by the backup failsafe without engaging the motor or being forced to overcome the idle motor resistance.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Preferable embodiments of the present invention also feature a temperature responsive mechanical failsafe that operates to activate the device in the event of an electronic trigger failure despite the detection of an adverse condition. Accordingly, the mechanical failsafe operates as a secondary trigger to activate the device and close the door in the event of a fire despite the electronic trigger's failure.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The mechanical failsafe preferably includes a cylindrical heatsink that spans the circumference of the middle body housing. A fusible shunt is preferably attached to the heatsink, and a trigger leaf is preferably attached to the shunt. This design retains a small spring that is situated concentrically, with the spool of the switch and its other arm braced against the housing of the middle body. When the heatsink reaches the failsafe temperature, the fusible shunt releases the trigger and the spring pushes the switch into the tripped position, releasing the ratchet and the main spring's stored energy to close the door.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Preferable embodiments of the device also include an electronic angle sensor that tracks the position of the switch through a mounted, diametrically opposed ring magnet, which detects the motor angle and mechanical trip.

Table <b>1</b> lists a plurality of alloys having melting temperatures in the range considered useful for a temperature activated door spring. In one useful example, fusible pellet may comprise a material with a melting point in the range of <b>107</b>&#xb0; F-<b>208</b> &#xb0; F. In other useful examples, the fusible pellet can be selected from the group consisting of an alloy of bismuth with lead and/or tin, Wood's metal, Rose's metal Field's metal, an alloy of bismuth with lead, tin, indium, cadmium and/or thallium and combinations thereof as shown in Table <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Having described the components of a temperature activated door spring, it is considered beneficial to the understanding of the principles herein to describe the operation of the safety mechanism. In one example, the temperature activated door spring operates as a closure mechanism for a door that is actuated during a fire. When activated, the door spring causes the door to automatically close.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The temperature activated door spring may be installed on an existing door hinge and held in place by a hinge pin inserted into knuckles affixed to the hinge. The spring is placed on the door hinge pin, preferably on the upmost hinge knuckle, and then the pin and mechanism is placed in the door hinge. A rotationally tensioned spring holds the temperature activated door spring in a loaded position which is locked-in by a fusible pellet or bond. When installed, the temperature activated door spring is located above the surface of the top hinge knuckle.
