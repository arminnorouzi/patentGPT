disclosure relates generally to secondary batteries, and more specifically, to carrier ion loading of secondary batteries during or subsequent to formation.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In rocking-chair battery cells, both a positive electrode and a negative electrode of a secondary battery comprises materials into which carrier ions, such as lithium, inserts and extracts. As the battery is discharged, carrier ions are extracted from the negative electrode and inserted into the positive electrode. As the battery is charged, the carrier ions are extracted from the positive electrode and inserted into the negative electrode.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Silicon has become a promising candidate to replace carbonaceous materials as the anode because of its high specific capacity. For instance, graphite anodes formed from LiC<sub>6 </sub>may have a specific capacity of about 370 mill-amp hours per gram (mAh/g), while crystalline silicon anodes formed from Li<sub>15</sub>Si<sub>4 </sub>may have a specific capacity of about 3600 mAh/g, a nearly 10 fold increase over graphite anodes. However, the use of silicon anodes has been limited, due to the large volumetric changes (e.g., 300%) in silicon when Li carrier ions are inserted into silicon anodes. This volumetric increase along with the cracking and pulverization associated with the charge and discharge cycles has limited the use of silicon anodes in practice. In addition, the use of silicon anodes has been limited due to its poor initial columbic efficiency (ICE), which leads to a capacity loss during the initial formation of secondary batteries that utilize silicon anodes.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is therefore desirable to improve the performance of secondary batteries that utilize silicon-based anodes, and more specifically, to mitigate the issues that silicon anodes exhibit with respect to their poor ICE.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one aspect, an auxiliary electrode for a secondary battery includes a conductive layer, a first carrier ion supply layer, and a second carrier ion supply layer. The conductive layer has a first major surface in an X-Y plane, and the conductive layer includes a material that is electrically conductive and has a first surface area. Each of the first carrier ion supply layer and the second carrier ion supply layer includes a material that supplies carrier ions for an electrode of the secondary battery. The first carrier ion supply layer covers a first region of the first major surface of the conductive layer and the second carrier ion supply layer covers a second region of the first major surface of the conductive layer. The first region and the second region are separated by a third region of the conductive layer extending between the first region and the second region. The third region is configured to be folded along a Y-axis direction such that in a folded configuration, the first region and the second region are substantially parallel. The third region is substantially perpendicular to the first region and the second region in the folded configuration.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another aspect, a buffering system includes a secondary battery, an auxiliary electrode, and an enclosure. The secondary battery has major surfaces that oppose each other and electrical terminals, with each of the electrical terminals coupled to one of a positive electrode and a negative electrode of the secondary battery. The secondary battery includes a microporous separator between the negative electrode and the positive electrode that is permeated with an electrolyte in ionic contact with the negative electrode and the positive electrode. The negative electrode includes anodically active silicon or an alloy thereof, and the negative electrode has a coulombic capacity for carrier ions. The positive electrode includes a cathodically active material, and the positive electrode has a coulombic capacity for the carrier ions. The negative electrode coulombic capacity exceeds the positive electrode coulombic capacity. The auxiliary electrode contacts the major surfaces of the secondary battery. The auxiliary electrode includes a first separator layer, a conductive layer, a population of carrier ion supply layers, a second separator layer, and a conductive tab. The first separator layer includes a material that is ionically permeable. The conductive layer includes a material that is electrically conductive, and the conductive layer has a first surface contacting the first separator layer and a second surface opposing the first surface. The second surface is segmented into a first region disposed at a first end of the conductive layer, a second region disposed at a second end of the conductive layer that opposes the first end, and a third region disposed between the first region and the second region. The population of carrier ion supply layers each include a material that supplies the carrier ions for the positive electrode of the secondary battery. A respective one of the carrier ion supply layers are disposed within the first region and the second region of the conductive layer. The second separator layer includes a material that is ionically permeable. The second separator layer separates the carrier ion supply layers within the first region and the second region of the conductive layer from the major surfaces of the secondary battery. The conductive tab includes a material that is electrically conductive. The conductive tab has a first end coupled to the second surface of the conductive layer within the third region of the conductive layer, and a second end distal to the first end. The enclosure encapsulates the auxiliary electrode and the secondary battery, with the electrical terminals and the second end of the conductive tab electrically extending from a perimeter of the enclosure.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In yet another aspect, a method of buffering a secondary battery with carrier ions using an auxiliary electrode is provided. The secondary battery has major surfaces that oppose each other and electrical terminals. The method includes placing the auxiliary electrode in contact with the major surfaces of the secondary battery to form an auxiliary subassembly. Each of the electrical terminals is coupled to one of a positive electrode and a negative electrode of the secondary battery. The secondary battery includes a microporous separator between the negative electrode and the positive electrode that is permeated with an electrolyte in ionic contact with the negative electrode and the positive electrode. The negative electrode includes anodically active silicon or an alloy thereof, and the negative electrode has a coulombic capacity for carrier ions. The positive electrode includes a cathodically active material, and the positive electrode has a coulombic capacity for the carrier ions. The negative electrode coulombic capacity exceeds the positive electrode coulombic capacity. The auxiliary electrode includes an electrically conductive layer, carrier ion supply layers disposed on the electrically conductive layer that are proximate to the major surfaces of the secondary battery, a separator layer disposed between the carrier ion supply layers and the major surfaces of the secondary battery, and an electrically conductive tab coupled to the electrically conductive layer. The method further includes installing the auxiliary subassembly in an enclosure, where the electrical terminals of the secondary battery and the electrically conductive tab of the auxiliary electrode electrically extend from a perimeter of the enclosure. The method also includes transferring the carrier ions from the positive electrode to the negative electrode to at least partially charge the secondary battery by applying a potential voltage across the electrical terminals of the secondary battery. The method further includes transferring the carrier ions from the carrier ion supply layers of the auxiliary electrode to at least one of the positive electrode and the negative electrode of the secondary battery by applying a potential voltage across the electrically conductive tab of the auxiliary electrode and one of the electrical terminals of the secondary battery. The method further includes transferring the carrier ions from the positive electrode to the negative electrode to charge the secondary battery by applying a potential voltage across the electrical terminals of the secondary battery until the negative electrode has greater than 100% of the positive electrode coulombic capacity stored as the carrier ions.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Various refinements exist of the features noted in relation to the above-mentioned aspects.

The use of an auxiliary anode mitigates the initial loss of carrier ions in the secondary battery during initial formation, thereby providing a technical benefit of, for example, increasing the capacity of the secondary battery after formation. Further, the introduction of additional carrier ions after battery formation mitigates the cycle-based decrease in carrier ions that are typically lost through secondary reactions, thereby providing a technical benefit of decreasing the cycle-by-cycle capacity loss in a secondary battery. Further still, the introduction of additional carrier ions after battery formation improves the cycling performance of the secondary battery by maintaining the anode of the secondary battery at a lower potential voltage at discharge, as the anode includes additional carrier ions. In some embodiments, the auxiliary anode is removed from the secondary battery after formation, thereby providing a technical benefit of increasing the energy density of the battery.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of a secondary battery <b>100</b> of an exemplary embodiment, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts a unit cell <b>200</b> for the secondary battery <b>100</b>.

When a secondary battery is charged for the first time, the carrier ions are extracted from the cathode and introduced into the anode. As a result, the anode potential is lowered significantly (toward the potential of the carrier ions), and the cathode potential is increased (to become even more positive). These changes in potential may give rise to parasitic reactions on both the cathode and the anode, but sometimes more severely on the anode. For example, a decomposition product comprising lithium (or other carrier ions) and electrolyte components, known as solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), may readily form on the surfaces of carbon anodes. These surfaces or covering layers are carrier ion conductors, which establish an ionic connection between the anode and the electrolyte and prevent the reactions from proceeding any further.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">Although formation of the SEI layer is desired for the stability of a half-cell system comprising the anode and the electrolyte, a portion of the carrier ions introduced into the cells via the cathode is irreversibly bound and thus removed from cyclic operation, i.e., from the capacity available to the user. As a result, during the initial discharge, fewer carrier ions are returned to the cathode from the anode than was initially provided by the cathode during the initial charging operation, leading to irreversible capacity loss. During each subsequent charge and discharge cycle, the capacity losses resulting from mechanical and/or electrical degradation to the anode and/or the cathode tend to be much less per cycle, but even the relatively small carrier ion losses per cycle contribute significantly to reductions in energy density and cycle life as the battery ages. In addition, chemical and electrochemical degradation may also occur on the electrodes and cause capacity losses. To compensate for the formation of SEI (or another carrier ion-consuming mechanism such as mechanical and/or electrical degradation of the negative electrode), additional or supplementary carrier ions may be provided from an auxiliary electrode after formation of the battery.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">In general, the positive electrode <b>208</b> of the secondary battery <b>100</b> (e.g., the collective population of the cathode structures <b>206</b> in the secondary battery <b>100</b>) preferably has a reversible coulombic capacity that is matched to the discharge capacity of the negative electrode <b>209</b> (e.g., the collective population of the anode structures <b>207</b> in the secondary battery <b>100</b>). Stated differently, the positive electrode <b>208</b> of the secondary battery <b>100</b> is sized to have a reversible coulombic capacity that corresponds to the discharge capacity of the negative electrode <b>209</b> which, in turn, is a function of the negative electrode <b>209</b> end of discharge voltage.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">In some embodiments, the negative electrode <b>209</b> of the secondary battery <b>100</b> (e.g., the collective population of the anode structures <b>207</b> in the secondary battery <b>100</b>) is designed to have a reversible coulombic capacity that exceeds the reversible coulombic capacity of the positive electrode <b>208</b>.

Transferring or buffering carrier ions to the secondary battery mitigates carrier ion losses during formation due to, for example, SEI, thereby providing a technical benefit of improving the capacity of the secondary battery. Further, transferring or buffering carrier ions to the secondary battery provides the negative electrode of the secondary battery additional carrier ions beyond the coulombic capacity of the positive electrode of the secondary battery, thereby providing a reservoir of addition carrier ions over the cycle life of the secondary battery, further mitigating carrier ion loss during cycling due to side reactions which remove the carrier ions from availability during cycling. The result of the additional carrier ions at the negative electrode provides a further technical benefit of reducing the amount of capacity loss in the secondary battery from one discharge-charge cycle to the next, thereby improving the overall capacity of the secondary battery during its cycle life.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0169">The following embodiments are provided to illustrate various aspects of the present disclosure.
