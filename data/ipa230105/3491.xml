The additional mass of the central protrusion <b>210</b> is at the center of the throwing member <b>110</b>, such that this additional mass gives the piece a central point of gravity when thrown end-over-end; and has very little effect on the rotational inertia of the throwing member <b>110</b>. This means that, given a &#x201c;standard throw&#x201d;, the throwing member <b>110</b> will spin at a similar rate as if the additional central mass were not present. Conversely, the additional mass added farther toward the ends of the stems at the suction cups (farther away from the central protrusion), this will significantly increase the throwing member's <b>110</b> rotational inertia. This will mean that the throwing member <b>110</b>, given the same &#x201c;standard throw&#x201d;, will spin at a significantly slower rate than that of a throwing member <b>110</b> with a smaller rotational inertia.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0074">In another related embodiment, the stems <b>222</b>, <b>224</b> can be configured with a length from the central protrusion <b>210</b> to the base of the suction cup, as well as a diameter of the stem, to allow the perfect balance of flexibility and rigidness.
