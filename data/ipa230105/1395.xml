Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates generally to the fields of chemistry and materials science. More particularly, it concerns compositions comprising therapeutic agents encapsulated in nanoporous materials and further encapsulated, entrapped, embedded, dispersed within, or complexed to pharmaceutically acceptable polymers. Also described herein are methods for stabilizing, protecting, and delivering therapeutic agents to a subject in need thereof.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">II. Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Proteinaceous therapeutics are moving to the forefront of medicine for their specificity in treatments, favorable side effect profiles, and their potential in personalized medicine (Leader et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2016). Unfortunately, many of these proteins are structurally metastable (Thirumalai et al., 2011) and they can undergo drastic conformational changes at elevated temperatures, in organic solvents, and at pHs different from physiological conditions (Mallamace et al., 2016; Carmichael et al., 2015). These problems limit proteins to short-term low-temperature storage that require costly infrastructure in place to keep them stable throughout shipping. Researchers have been motivated by these limitations and have begun to develop new methods that can enhance protein stability (Pisal et al., 2006; LeClair et al., 2018; Sridhar et al., 2018; Welch et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2017; Vrdoljak et al., 2016).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Metal-organic framework (MOF) encapsulation has been shown (Doonan et al., 2017) to stabilize enzymes (Alsaiari et al., 2018; Liang et al., 2015), viruses (Li et al., 2016; Li et al., 2018), and antibodies (Wang et al., 2016) while providing structural and chemical protection. MOFs are highly porous crystalline materials made of metal-ion clusters linked by organic ligand struts (Rosi et al., 2002; McGuire et al., 2015) that have shown promise for use in gas storage (Banerjee et al., 2008) and separation (Hayashi et al., 2007; Li et al., 2018), catalysis (Huxley et al., 2018; Otake et al., 2018), sensing (Fan et al., 2018), and small molecule drug delivery (Zhuang et al., 2014; Adhikari et al., 2015; Zheng et al., 2016; La&#x17a;aro et al., 2018). Recently, researchers have shown that MOFs can immobilize (Majewski et al., 2017; Ricco et al., 2018) and stabilize biomacromolecules (Nadar et al., 2018; Li et al., 2016). In particular, coating proteins in zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) is proving to be a promising method for protection against conditions normally adverse to proteins, and there have been many promising advancements in this area (Nadar et al., 2018; Hoop et al., 2018; Maddigan et al., 2018; Liao et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2018). In particular, biomimetic mineralized growth (Liang et al., 2015; Li et al., 2016; Ricco et al., 2018) of ZIF-8 directly onto the surface of a protein has emerged as a means to encapsulate enzymes and insulin using only protein, zinc salts, and methylimidazole directly in water (Wang et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2018). Because ZIF-8 can grow on protein surfaces of different sizes, charge states, and morphologies, this process is quite &#x201c;agnostic&#x201d; to the biomolecule host inside the ZIF (Li et al., 2018; Maddigan et al., 2018). This differs from other equally elegant methods that use bespoke MOFs with tuned (Deng et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2018; Li et al., 2016) pore sizes to encapsulate specific biomolecules or polymer-encapsulated proteins coated with ZIF and formed in organic protic solvents (Zhang et al., 2016; Lyu et al., 2014).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For instance, the inventors' lab biomimetically encapsulated tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) within a ZIF-8 shell (TMV@ZIF) and found the encapsulation process to be high yielding and promoted by a modest affinity for zinc ions toward the proteinaceous surface (Li et al., 2018). This affinity leads to high local concentrations of zinc, which promotes a mineralization process that results in either core&#x2014;shell or monolithic crystals of bionanoparticles (Liang et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2007). It is unclear, however, how or if the nucleation and growth affects the secondary or tertiary structure at the protein surface. If the protein surface of a therapeutic protein is altered as a result of the nucleation process, unwanted immunological reactions may occur as human proteins would not be recognized as &#x201c;self&#x201d; and antigens for encapsulated vaccines would raise antibodies against a misfolded protein rendering this strategy moot (Xu et al., 2016; Maurer et al., 2005; Stephanopoulos et al., 2011). Furthermore, a variety of therapeutic agents exhibit limitations, such as thermal instability. As such, there exists a need for compositions and methods for the delivery of therapeutic agents having improved properties.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some aspects, the present disclosure provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a) a therapeutic agent; b) a metal-organic framework (MOF) or a coordination polymer; and c) a pharmaceutically acceptable polymer; wherein the therapeutic agent is encapsulated within the metal-organic framework or coordination polymer to form an encapsulated therapeutic agent, and wherein the encapsulated therapeutic agent is further encapsulated, entrapped, embedded, dispersed within, or complexed to the pharmaceutically acceptable polymer.

In some embodiments, the compositions disclosed herein are formulated in a manner amenable for the treatment of human and/or veterinary patients. In some embodiments, formulation comprises admixing or combining one or more of the compositions disclosed herein with one or more of the following excipients: lactose, sucrose, starch powder, cellulose esters of alkanoic acids, cellulose alkyl esters, talc, stearic acid, magnesium stearate, magnesium oxide, sodium and calcium salts of phosphoric and sulfuric acids, gelatin, acacia, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and/or polyvinyl alcohol. In some embodiments, e.g., for oral administration, the pharmaceutical formulation may be tableted or encapsulated. In some embodiments, the compositions may be dissolved or slurried in water, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, ethanol, corn oil, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, sesame oil, benzyl alcohol, sodium chloride, and/or various buffers. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical formulations may be subjected to pharmaceutical operations, such as sterilization, and/or may contain drug carriers and/or excipients such as preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, encapsulating agents such as lipids, dendrimers, polymers, proteins such as albumin, nucleic acids, and buffers.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Pharmaceutical formulations may be administered by a variety of methods, e.g., orally or by injection (e.g. subcutaneous, intravenous, and intraperitoneal). Depending on the route of administration, the compositions disclosed herein may be further coated in a material to protect the compound from the action of acids and other natural conditions which may inactivate the compound. To administer the active compound by other than parenteral administration, it may be necessary to coat the compound with, or co-administer the compound with, a material to prevent its inactivation. In some embodiments, the active compound may be administered to a patient in an appropriate carrier, for example, liposomes, or a diluent. Pharmaceutically acceptable diluents include saline and aqueous buffer solutions. Liposomes include water-in-oil-in-water CGF emulsions as well as conventional liposomes.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The compounds disclosed herein may also be administered parenterally, intraperitoneally, intraspinally, or intracerebrally. Dispersions can be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and mixtures thereof and in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations may contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions (where water soluble) or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (such as, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be achieved by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, sodium chloride, or polyalcohols such as mannitol and sorbitol, in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent which delays absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate or gelatin.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The compositions disclosed herein can be administered orally, for example, with an inert diluent or an assimilable edible carrier. The compounds and other ingredients may also be enclosed in a hard or soft-shell gelatin capsule, compressed into tablets, or incorporated directly into the patient's diet. For oral therapeutic administration, the compounds disclosed herein may be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of ingestible tablets, buccal tablets, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, and the like. The percentage of the therapeutic agent in the compositions and preparations may, of course, be varied. The amount of the compositions in such pharmaceutical formulations is such that a suitable dosage will be obtained.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The therapeutic compositions may also be administered topically to the skin, eye, ear, or mucosal membranes. Administration of the therapeutic compound topically may include formulations of the compounds as a topical solution, lotion, cream, ointment, gel, foam, transdermal patch, or tincture. When the therapeutic compound is formulated for topical administration, the compound may be combined with one or more agents that increase the permeability of the compound through the tissue to which it is administered. In other embodiments, it is contemplated that the topical administration is administered to the eye. Such administration may be applied to the surface of the cornea, conjunctiva, or sclera. Without wishing to be bound by any theory, it is believed that administration to the surface of the eye allows the therapeutic compound to reach the posterior portion of the eye. Ophthalmic topical administration can be formulated as a solution, suspension, ointment, gel, or emulsion. Finally, topical administration may also include administration to the mucosa membranes such as the inside of the mouth. Such administration can be directly to a particular location within the mucosal membrane such as a tooth, a sore, or an ulcer. Alternatively, if local delivery to the lungs is desired the therapeutic compound may be administered by inhalation in a dry-powder or aerosol formulation.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In some embodiments, it may be advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the patients to be treated; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of therapeutic compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. In some embodiments, the specification for the dosage unit forms of the invention are dictated by and directly dependent on (a) the unique characteristics of the therapeutic compound and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and (b) the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such a therapeutic compound for the treatment of a selected condition in a patient. In some embodiments, active compounds are administered at a therapeutically effective dosage sufficient to treat a condition associated with a condition in a patient.

K<sub>m </sub>values for humans and various animals are well known. For example, the K<sub>m </sub>for an average 60 kg human (with a BSA of 1.6 m<sup>2</sup>) is 37, whereas a 20 kg child (BSA 0.8 m<sup>2</sup>) would have a K<sub>m </sub>of 25. K<sub>m </sub>for some relevant animal models are also well known, including: mice K<sub>m </sub>of 3 (given a weight of 0.02 kg and BSA of 0.007); hamster K<sub>m </sub>of 5 (given a weight of 0.08 kg and BSA of 0.02); rat K<sub>m </sub>of 6 (given a weight of 0.15 kg and BSA of 0.025) and monkey K<sub>m </sub>of 12 (given a weight of 3 kg and BSA of 0.24).</p><p id="p-0076" num="0074">Precise amounts of the therapeutic composition depend on the judgment of the practitioner and are specific to each individual. Nonetheless, a calculated HED dose provides a general guide. Other factors affecting the dose include the physical and clinical state of the patient, the route of administration, the intended goal of treatment and the potency, stability and toxicity of the particular therapeutic formulation.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0075">The actual dosage amount of a composition of the present disclosure or formulation comprising a composition of the present disclosure administered to a patient may be determined by physical and physiological factors such as type of animal treated, age, sex, body weight, severity of condition, the type of disease being treated, previous or concurrent therapeutic interventions, idiopathy of the patient and on the route of administration. These factors may be determined by a skilled artisan. The practitioner responsible for administration will typically determine the concentration of active ingredient(s) in a composition and appropriate dose(s) for the individual patient. The dosage may be adjusted by the individual physician in the event of any complication.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0076">In some embodiments, the therapeutically effective amount typically will vary from about 0.001 mg/kg to about 1000 mg/kg, from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 750 mg/kg, from about 100 mg/kg to about 500 mg/kg, from about 1 mg/kg to about 250 mg/kg, from about 10 mg/kg to about 150 mg/kg in one or more dose administrations daily, for one or several days (depending of course of the mode of administration and the factors discussed above).

For example, it is understood that the minimum number of carbon atoms in the groups &#x201c;alkyl<sub>C&#x2264;8)</sub>&#x201d;, &#x201c;alkanediyl<sub>(C&#x2264;8)</sub>&#x201d;, &#x201c;heteroaryl<sub>(C&#x2264;8)</sub>&#x201d;, and &#x201c;acyl<sub>(C&#x2264;8)</sub>&#x201d; is one, the minimum number of carbon atoms in the groups &#x201c;alkenyl<sub>(C&#x2264;8)</sub>&#x201d;, &#x201c;alkynyl<sub>(C&#x2264;8)</sub>&#x201d;, and &#x201c;heterocycloalkyl<sub>(C&#x2264;8)</sub>&#x201d; is two, the minimum number of carbon atoms in the group &#x201c;cycloalkyl<sub>(C&#x2264;8)</sub>&#x201d; is three, and the minimum number of carbon atoms in the groups &#x201c;aryl<sub>(C&#x2264;8)</sub>&#x201d; and &#x201c;arenediyl<sub>(C&#x2264;8)</sub>&#x201d; is six. &#x201c;Cn-n&#x201d;' defines both the minimum (n) and maximum number (n&#x2032;) of carbon atoms in the group. Thus, &#x201c;alkyl<sub>(C2-10)</sub>&#x201d; designates those alkyl groups having from 2 to 10 carbon atoms. These carbon number indicators may precede or follow the chemical groups or class it modifies and it may or may not be enclosed in parenthesis, without signifying any change in meaning. Thus, the terms &#x201c;C5 olefin&#x201d;, &#x201c;C5-olefin&#x201d;, &#x201c;olefin<sub>(C5)</sub>&#x201d;, and &#x201c;olefin<sub>C5</sub>&#x201d; are all synonymous. Except as noted below, every carbon atom is counted to determine whether the group or compound falls with the specified number of carbon atoms. For example, the group dihexylamino is an example of a dialkylamino<sub>(C=12) </sub>group; however, it is not an example of a dialkylamino<sub>(C=6) </sub>group. Likewise, phenylethyl is an example of an aralkyl<sub>(C=8) </sub>group. When any of the chemical groups or compound classes defined herein is modified by the term &#x201c;substituted&#x201d;, any carbon atom in the moiety replacing the hydrogen atom is not counted. Thus methoxyhexyl, which has a total of seven carbon atoms, is an example of a substituted alkyl<sub>(C1-6)</sub>.

When the term is used to modify an atom, it means that the atom is not part of any double or triple bond. In the case of substituted versions of saturated groups, one or more carbon oxygen double bond or a carbon nitrogen double bond may be present. And when such a bond is present, then carbon-carbon double bonds that may occur as part of keto-enol tautomerism or imine/enamine tautomerism are not precluded.

Introduction</heading><p id="p-0132" num="0114">The inventors chose TMV, a 300 nm&#xd7;18 nm tubular RNA plant virus, as a model vaccine biomacromolecule owing to extensive data on its in vivo performance as a carrier for engineered and chemically conjugated (Rybicki et al., 2014; Banik et al., 2015; Gasanova et al., 2016) epitopes in vaccine development (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). This chemical modifiability, which can occur on both interior and exterior surfaces independently, has given TMV a unique appeal beyond vaccine development as the structure tolerates attachment of dyes (Masarapu et al., 2017), sensors (Dharmarwardana et al., 2018; B&#xe4;cker et al., 2017), contrast agents (Anderson et al., 2017), and bioactive molecules (Pitek et al., 2017; Finbloom et al., 2016). The multivalent nature of TMV comes from its 2130 identical coat proteins arranged helically around a 4 nm central pore where the viral RNA is located. This allows many bioconjugations to the same virus particle, increasing local concentration of active sites and immobilizing them, which is one reason it is thought to be such a useful platform for vaccine development (Rybicki et al., 2014; Banik et al., 2015; Gasanova et al., 2016).</p><p id="p-0133" num="0115">Because TMV is an established preclinical vaccine platform, it is a reasonable model to test the efficacy of thermal protection when encapsulated inside ZIF-8. While it is possible to remove the ZIF-8 shell to obtain pristine TMV, the inventors wondered if this additional step was unnecessary. Indeed, it happens slowly in biological media, may present a method to formulate &#x201c;slow release&#x201d; agents for proteins an area of active research interest (Cosse et al., 2017; Ren et al., 2013). The inventors thus sought to determine if they could simply leave the TMV inside the protective ZIF-8 shell and inject this composite subcutaneously in a mouse model as a method to slowly release TMV, producing an immune response similar to injecting native TMV subcutaneously.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0116">The inventors can quantify changes to the surfaces of TMV as a result of ZIF-8 growth and removal using anti-TMV antibodies measured in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A damaged or unfolded protein at the virus surface will not interact strongly with their complementary antibodies and this loss of affinity will manifest as a diminished ELISA response. The TMV@ZIF composite was subjected to stressors, including heat and denaturing solvents, the ZIF shell was removed, and the recovered protein was examined by ELISA to confirm surface intactness. Tobacco plant infection and in vivo studies further demonstrate the viability of ZIF-8 as a protective shell. Finally, the inventors conducted longitudinal in vivo studies to ascertain the toxicity and immunogenicity of the TMV@ZIF-8 when implanted subcutaneously. These results show that this strategy has considerable potential to operate concurrently as a substrate to stabilize proteins at above ambient conditions as well as deliver them effectively intact and in a more linear dose.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="1">B. Results and Discussion</heading><p id="p-0135" num="0117">TMV@ZIF can be prepared in a number of different morphologies (Li et al., 2018) ranging from bulky rhombic dodecahedra containing hundreds of viruses to discrete rod-shaped core&#x2014;shell bionanoparticles with a shell thickness tunable from 10 to 40 nm. Each of these morphologies have different colloidal and dispersion characteristics and for this study the following criteria were considered: (i) the composite made had to be dispersible in solution for easy in vivo injection, and (ii) the kinetics of shell dissolution should allow for complete dissolution of all in vivo administered ZIF-8 by the end of a 1-month study. When the inventors attempted to suspend rhombic dodecahedra, they settled out of solution too quickly and clogged the syringe. This is in line with literature reports that particles larger than 1000 nm tend to settle rather quickly, making them a difficult material for injection (Majewski et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2018). The inventors chose to continue forward with rods, as the &#x2dc;350 nm particle size allow for them to be easily dispersed into solution and the shell exfoliates more rapidly than the larger rhombic dodecahedra. They thus set out to determine whether the ZIF-8 shell would increase the stability of TMV and if it could be delivered in vivo. The encapsulation of TMV into ZIF-8 crystals was obtained by mixing TMV (0.111 mg) with an aqueous solution of 2-methylimidazole (400 mM, 3.0 mL), followed by an aqueous solution of zinc acetate (20 mM, 1.5 mL) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). After 16 h, the TMV@ZIF particles were collected by centrifugation at 4300 g and the shell diameter and rod-like morphology were verified by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, top panel, a). The morphology of TMV@ZIF is clearly different from the common rhombic dodecahedral native ZIF-8 crystals.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0118">TMV@ZIF was then stressed under various conditions to determine the stability of the encapsulated virus surface. Stability versus various solvents was tested: soaking in methanol, ethyl acetate, and 6 M guanidinium chloride a common protein denaturant63 overnight. Thermal stabilitywas tested by heating TMV@ZIF to 100&#xb0; C. for 20 mM. After stressing, samples retained their rodlike morphology, as seen in SEM (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, top panel, b-e). The post-stressed composites were exfoliated in EDTA, desalted, and resuspended in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer. The protein concentrations were then determined by the Lowry assay, and all samples were diluted to 5.0&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;4 </sup>mg/mL and the ELISA response was determined. Because changes in the viral protein surface were being investigated, the ELISA results were normalized to naked non-stressed TMV (100%) and buffer blank (0%) for comparison between the two. The inventors were pleased to discover that the process of the shell formation and exfoliation did not significantly alter the protein surface and that the shell confers considerable protection to TMV when exposed to high temperatures. For instance, the percent difference between naked TMV and TMV@ZIF when heated to 100&#xb0; C. for 20 min was 165.0% (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, bottom, Table S1). Likewise, the percent difference between protected and unprotected exposure to the strongly denaturing guanidinium chloride was 199.2% (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, bottom). The inventors were also able to demonstrate that the ZIF was able to confer protection against other denaturing organic solvents (Table 11).</p><p id="p-0137" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>ELISA values of stressed TMV, stressed TMV@ZIF,</entry></row><row><entry>and their percent differences.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="56pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="70pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="56pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>Percent</entry></row><row><entry>Stress</entry><entry>Naked</entry><entry>Encapsulated</entry><entry>Difference</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Non-Stressed</entry><entry>102.8 &#xb1; 2.3%&#x2002;</entry><entry>108.9 &#xb1; 3.6%&#x2002;</entry><entry>&#x2003;3.9%</entry></row><row><entry>Heated</entry><entry>&#x2002;6.447 &#xb1; 0.188%</entry><entry>97.53 &#xb1; 1.52%</entry><entry>165.0%</entry></row><row><entry>Methanol</entry><entry>43.02 &#xb1; 3.26%</entry><entry>92.49 &#xb1; 2.63%</entry><entry>55.42%</entry></row><row><entry>6M Guanidine</entry><entry>&#x2002;0.09033 &#xb1; 0.08277%</entry><entry>70.70 &#xb1; 3.78%</entry><entry>199.2%</entry></row><row><entry>HCl</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>Ethyl Acetate</entry><entry>69.72 &#xb1; 2.25%</entry><entry>90.81 &#xb1; 2.84%</entry><entry>18.33%</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0138" num="0119">The inventors then set out to determine whether encapsulating TMV would damage the RNA. To assess the protection that TMV@ ZIF has on the RNA of TMV, <i>Nicotiana benthamiana </i>plants were inoculated with phosphate buffer as a negative control and TMV@ZIF, TMV@ZIF exfoliated with EDTA, and native TMV as a positive control. The infection of <i>N. benthamiana </i>depends on the disassembly of the capsid to liberate the intact viral RNA and begin replication. Consequently, any damage to the RNA will reduce viral load in plants.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0120">Inoculated leaves were collected after 10 days post infection. Visually, the control plants remained green and the other plants withered (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, top panel). ELISA was performed on 1 g of leaves macerated in 10 mL of extraction buffer and centrifuged to remove the large plant matter. Because the relative amount of TMV present in the leaf matter was being investigated, the ELISA results were fit to a standard curve of native TMV and the results are reported as apparent TMV concentration in &#x3bc;g/mL. The TMV@ZIF, exfoliated TMV@ ZIF, and native TMV plants showed a clear increase in ELISA response compared to the buffer-inoculated plants, with percent differences of 164.32% (a 10-fold increase), 167.01% (an 11-fold increase), and 175.29% (a 15-fold increase), respectively (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, bottom panel). This indicates that the TMV remains virulent and that the RNA survives the encapsulation and exfoliation process.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0121">The inventors next turned Their attention to in vivo studies on murine models to determine (i) whether the virus would release from the protective ZIF shell in vivo, (ii) how the anti-TMV IgG production against subcutaneously administered TMV@ZIF compares to native TMV, and (iii) the biocompatibility of the TMV@ZIF composite. In order to determine relative antibody production and optimize serum dilutions, two groups (n =4) of BALB/c test mice were either noninjected or injected subcutaneously with native TMV and blood drawn after 10 days. In the test mice, there was a clear anti-TMV ELISA response in mice injected with native TMV compared to noninjected mice after 10 days, and an optimal serum dilution range of 200&#xd7; to 5000' was found (Figure S5). To continue the investigation, 12 BALB/c mice were divided into three groups (n =4) and subcutaneously injected on day 0, 2, 4, and 6 with saline, native TMV, or TMV@ZIF. Multiple injections were administered to enhance the antibody production levels in mice. The inventors hypothesized that the TMV@ZIF would protect the encapsulated TMV in the body for as long as native TMV and result in a similar antibody production level. Sub- mandibular blood draws were conducted on day 0, 4, 7, and 35 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>). The ELISA response, which measures the production of mouse antibodies against TMV, shows that the TMV@ZIF elicits an antibody response comparable to naked TMV (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>). Antibody production typically depends upon successful uptake by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) for instance macrophages and dendritic cells in the body. This means that the shell is being removed before or during APC uptake. There is literature precedent (Hoop et al., 2018) that ZIF-8 can dissolve in the presence of cell media and it is not unexpected that ZIF-8 would dissociate in the interstitial fluids of the subcutaneous region prior to cellular uptake. The antibody levels that were detected for the composites were comparable to that of naked TMV, confirming that the TMV@ZIF does not need to be exfoliated before administration. 5 days after the last blood withdrawal, H&#x26;E-stained images were taken on various organs for each mouse to further evaluate TMV@ZIF biocompatibility. No visual difference could be determined between mice injected with saline and with TMV@ZIF (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>). This confirms the biocompatibility of TMV@ZIF, following multiple subcutaneous injections with no apparent toxicity or behavioral changes in the mice. Although some literature has shown in vitro toxicity (Hoop et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2017), this study has concluded that these results may not translate in vivo.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0122">Our method depends upon the slow degradation of ZIF-8 in vivo by physiological salts and macromolecules, suggesting that encapsulation and protein&#x2014;ZIF composite formation may be an intriguing way to prolong a linear dose of protein-based drugs. This could be especially useful for the administration of insulin and vaccines, which typically require multiple injections over time to achieve a sustained effect (Schade et al., 2017). Histology of the tissue at the subcutaneous site of administration at the conclusion of the study which consisted of four consecutive TMV@ZIF injections did not uncover any residual material, tissue damage, or scarring, which lead us to suspect that the full dose was being absorbed into the animal, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>. To better understand the rate at which TMV@ZIF was taken up by the mouse, the inventors conducted time-dependent in vivo imaging using TMV labeled on its interior with the red-emitting fluorophore Cy5 (Cy5-TMV, &#x3bb;<sub>ex</sub>=647 nm, &#x3bb;<sub>em</sub>=666 nm, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). This labeled TMV was encapsulated inside ZIF-8, which caused a quenching of the red fluorescence. This fluorescence of Cy5-TMV was restored in full when the shell was removed, providing a clear indication of shell removal (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>). For this study, 6 BALB/c mice were divided into two groups (n=3), shaved to remove the hair on their torso and limbs, and injected subcutaneously with either unencapsulated Cy5-TMV or Cy5-TMV@ZIF and imaged over two weeks. The images shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> show that, prior to injection, the only fluorescence comes from the hairs near the head. As shown in the series of images in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>, subcutaneous injection of Cy5-TMV decayed slowly over a period of 120 h. In contrast, the Cy5-TMV@ZIF fluoresced weakly at first, followed by an increase and then gradual decay. After 288 h, the fluorescence at the injection site for the encapsulated material returned to the baseline.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0123">The results of this study demonstrate that ZIF-8 coatings not only provide protection against denaturing solvents and heat, but the nucleation and growth of the crystalline lattice does not alter the secondary or tertiary structure of protein and protein ensembles. Further, the shell does not significantly damage the viral RNA. The ZIF-8 shells are simple to synthesize on proteins, their composites are formed in a few seconds, and are ready to use within hours. It is clear from histology data that prolonged exposure to ZIF-8 does not alter the tissue morphology at either the injection site or distal organs. Qualitatively, the inventors saw no behavior changes in mice following administration, nor did any mice become ill or die as a result of prolonged exposure to TMV@ZIF composites. On the other hand, in vivo data clearly suggest that the administration of equal quantities of immunogenic protein yielded identical antibody responses, showing that the release of the protein from the ZIF shell occurs to completion. This was further corroborated with time-dependent in vivo imaging studies, which showed a time-delayed release of the injection over the course of 14 days a property of ZIF-8 the inventors aim to exploit in subsequent studies. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that ZIF-8-based shells may provide a method to concurrently protect and deliver proteinaceous drugs safely.</p><heading id="h-0017" level="1">C.

All mice studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Texas at Dallas (Protocol # 17-05). 12 BALB/c mice were divided into three groups (n=4) and injected with saline, native TMV in saline, or TMV@ZIF suspended in saline. TMV solutions were prepared such that 200 &#x3bc;L delivered 10 &#x3bc;g of TMV. Doses of 200 &#x3bc;L of saline, TMV, or TMV@ZIF were administered subcutaneously on day 0, 2, 4, and 6 and blood was withdrawn submandibularly on day 0, 4, 7, and 35. The blood was centrifuged to remove erythrocytes, and the antiTMV IgG content of the resultant serum was determined by ELISA as described above. At the end of the study, the mice were sacrificed for histological analysis on the spleen, liver, kidney, lung, heart, and the skin at the administration site. The mice were sacrificed by carbon dioxide asphyxiation, the organs harvested, and fixed in 4% formaldehyde overnight. The fixed organs were moved to a 70% ethanol solution and processed with an ASP300 S tissue processor (Leica Biosystems, Buffalo Grove, Ill.) for dehydration into paraffin. The organs were then embedded into paraffin wax using a HistoCore Arcadia C and H paraffin embedding station (Leica Biosystems, Buffalo Grove, Ill.).

Based on their preliminary results with VLP@ZIF, the inventors anticipate that antigen@ZIF, when placed into the body, will release proteins for approximately 10 days. The objective of this aim is to create a &#x201c;delayed release&#x201d; formulation of that will not release anything (or release proteins very slowly) for the first 10 days and, after all the uncoated antigen@ZIF is exhausted, begin releasing antigen (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>). The inventors' working hypothesis is that they can imbed the antigen@ZIF into a polymer, which will prevent release of any antigens for a programmable number of days. Co-administration of the antigen@ZIF and antigen@zif@polymer will provide approximately 20 days of sustained antigen release. After 11 weeks, the inventors expect the same IgG titers following a single administration of a commixture of antigen@ZIF@polymer and antigen@ZIF as compared to multiple injections of the unencapsulated antigen. Conceptually, the antigen will be first embedded in the ZIF, which would protect it from processing. The inventors will use different ester-based polymers to encase the antigen@ZIF formulations. Each polymer was selected because its in vivo dissolution has been comprehensively studied. For instance, as polylactic acid (PLA), poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and polycaprolactone (PCL) are known for their burst release kinetics, which is actually what the inventors want&#x2014;after the degradation of the polymer, the antigen@ZIF should come out and begin its gradual dissolution and release of antigen.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0160">Encapsulation of antigens in plastic. In addition to antigen stability outside of cold storage, the control over delivery time and rate is a critical parameter toward vaccine efficacy. While ZIF coating has been proven to be an effective method for stabilizing protein structure, its rate of degradation can difficult to regulate. To address this issue, the inventors propose to encapsulate the proposed antigen@ZIF formulations in polymeric nanoparticles. Thermoplastic polyester microparticles are easy to prepare, degradable, and many aliphatic polyesters such PLA, PLGA, and polycaprolactone PCL are biocompatible. These polymers have been previously used in controlled protein delivery applications. The inventors hypothesize that in addition to the temperature stability provided by the ZIF coating, the inventors can also provide controlled delivery through encapsulation in a degradable polymer coating.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0161">Experimental Approach:</p><p id="p-0184" num="0162">Polymer Particle Preparation and Characterization. A variety of techniques for the preparation of loaded polyester microparticles with size control have been described79,81,82 some of which have incorporated porous metal coordination compounds similar ZIFs.83 The polymers (PLGA and PCL) will initially be obtained from commercial sources as polyesters with &#x2dc;10 kDa-&#x2dc;80 kDa. A typical experiment would be to use a oil/water emulsion method to produce a distribution of particle sizes (0.5-20 &#x3bc;m). Briefly: the starting polymer is dissolved in a low-boiling organic solvent (such as dichloromethane) along with &#x2dc;500 nm antigen(Cy5)@ZIF nanoparticles. To this solution, water is added and will form a second, non-miscible layer on top. This immiscible solution is stirred very quickly with a motorized stirrer at ambient temperatures such that the immiscible organic solvent is forced into the aqueous layer as nanodroplets containing polymer and antigen(Cy5)@ZIF-8. Faster stir rates result in smaller particles in the emulsion while slower stir rates produce larger particles. Over the course of this experiment, the organic solvent will slowly evaporate from the droplets (while stirring in the aqueous solution) leaving the antigen@ZIF-8 stuck in polymeric nanoparticles. The final antigen(Cy5)@ZIF@polymer can be collected by centrifugation. These particles will have some polydispersity in size and which can be separated by gradient centrifugation. Particle sizes will be characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). PXRD will be used to confirm ZIF-8 has remained in the polymeric matrix.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0163">Cargo Release Rates. A solution of the antigen(Cy5)@ZIF@polymer formulations of similar diameter will be isolated inside a 0.22 &#x3bc;M membrane at the bottom of a quartz cuvette below the beam path of a fluorimeter. The membrane porosity is small enough to prevent microparticle release but will allow antigen(cy5) diffusion into the beam path as the plastic and ZIF-8 dissolve. Fetal Bovine serum (FBS) at 37&#xb0; C. or simulated body fluid (SBF) will be added and fluorescence will be monitored over the course of a month. As the polymers degrade, the drugs will enter solution and their concentrations can be elucidated from a calibration curve. The objective is to create a formulation that delays release by approximately the same amount of time it takes for antigen@ZIF to fully dissolve. The same assay will be conducted for antigen@ZIF (not encapsulated in polymer) to generate comparable results.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0164">Check proteins. To determine yield of encapsulation the supernatant from the emulsion reaction, the pellet from the centrifugation will be treated with EDTA for 12 hours.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0165">This is sufficient time to exfoliate the ZIF to remove the antigen but should not release any antigens that are hidden inside the polymer. Total protein concentration will then be assayed. To confirm proteins inside the Antigen@ZIF@polymer remain folded, the polymer composite will be soaked in pH 8 water until the polymer shell dissolves to isolate the freed antigen@ZIF. This will then be subjected to the battery of tests described in aim 1 to confirm structure. Antigen@ZIF@polymer will be subjected to the same experimental battery as antigen@ZIF described in Aim 2 to obtain in vivo and in vitro data.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0166">Controls. The inventors will measure antigen@ZIF release rates in FBS or SBF. They will also compare hydrolysis rates of the polyester microparticles with and without embedded antigen@ZIF. Dissolution of polyester particles without antigen(Cy5)@ZIF will be prepared in a solution of FITC. The polyester will thus slowly release FITC over time. Since the crystalline viral nanoparticles will create inhomogeneous structure in the microparticles, it is likely that the rates of release will be non-linear with increasing antigen@ZIF concentration. It is anticipated that it will be possible to make microparticles for subcutaneous implant that will show no or very little release initially and for a pre-set number of days followed by sustained release. The Gassensmith and Smaldone groups have collaborated previously on slow release trans-dermal microneedle plastics derived from polyesters and have experience in designing fluorescence-based assays to monitor their release in (i) conditions that mimic interstitial fluid and (ii) within actual skin. Tuning the synthetic conditions may be necessary to achieve the desired release rates.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0167">Alternative approaches. The inventors anticipate antigen@ZIF loading into the microspheres to be high. ZIF-8 is hydrophobic and preferentially partitions into organic layers. Consequently, the inventors do not anticipate low yielding formation or problems with encapsulation as microemulsion techniques are well developed.23,78,87-90 In the inventors' hands, ZIF-8 nanoparticles below 1 um in diameter are easily suspended in aqueous solution and should actively partition into the organic phase of the emulsion. An alternative approach, however, would be to create microparticles using electrospray methods, of which there are many as this is likewise a developed area of synthesis. With regards to the cargo release rates, there could be two problems&#x2014;release that is too slow, or too fast. Beyond making the polymer shells larger, to reduce the speed of release, PLA particles could be used. PLA is a harder polyester, with greater resistance to hydrolysis under biological conditions while retaining its biocompatibility. Release that is too slow could be remedied by using either low molecular weight polyesters, or by modifying the preparation method to include porosity or increased surface area which will result in faster particle hydrolysis. If the degradation rates of the microparticles need further tuning, other additives to the polyester matrix, such as chitosan can be used to increase degradation without sacrificing biocompatibility.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0168">Testing encapsulated implants in animal models. In vivo testing is necessary to validate the inventors' observations in vitro. To do that, the inventors will test antigen@ZIF@polymer and show that mouse models produce no antibody response for several days while the polymeric shell is dissolving. Once the antigen@ZIF is free, it will slowly dissolve and antibody titers will increase. The inventors will then co-administer antigen@ZIF@polymer (the delayed release formulation) along with antigen@ZIF (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>) to create a continuous release. It is the inventors' working hypothesis that, even if the amount of protein is kept constant, this prolonged release will result in superior antibody titers as compared to a single injection of antigen.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0169">Experimental Approach:</p><p id="p-0192" num="0170">Principle experiment. Ovalbumin, CRM198, CPMV and Q&#x3b2; @ZIF@polymer formulations that produced the strongest in vitro responses will be used. Each formulation will be tested individually. For each formulation, BALB/c mice aged 6-8 weeks will be divided into three separate groups of 12 (6M and 6F) and administered 10 &#x3bc;g of protein as either un-encapsulated antigen, antigen@ZIF, or antigen@ZIF@Polymer. Particle size and composition will be determined based on results from the previous aim. Mice will receive a single injection with no follow up booster shots.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0171">Mice will be bled biweekly for serum samples and euthanized by week 11. Blood will be centrifuged, and serum tested by ELISA in various dilutions and titer will be calculated as the inverse dilution at which the sample matched the average absorbance. Ex vivo splenocytes cell suspensions will be prepared from spleens of sacrificed animals. Red blood cells will be lysed and the remaining splenocytes washed and isolated. Cells will be stimulated with the corresponding antigen in complete media. The supernatant will be collected and cytokine levels (outlined above) will be determined by ELISA. This experiment will be repeated by injecting a 1:1 mixture by protein weight of antigen@ZIF and antigen@ZIF@Polymer.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0172">In vivo imaging of release. In a separate experiment, the inventors monitor protein release by using Cy5 or Cy7 labeled antigens. They have previously shown that dye labeling does not affect ZIF formation. The inventors will follow the procedure they developed previously with TMV@ZIF. Six mice (3F and 3M) will be subcutaneously injected with 10 &#x3bc;g Cy5-antigen@ZIF@polymer in the flank and imaged every 4-12 hours until fluorescence returns to baseline.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0173">Data Analysis Plan: Sample size estimation. The inventors anticipate the variation in composition be minimal &#x3c;5%. The inventors expect that, for the novel antigens@ZIF@polymer there will be larger variances in IgG and cytokine expression, which they expect to be around 20%. To detect at least a 20% difference in the protein expression changes with a power=0.8 and a significance level of 0.05, a sample size of at least 6 mice will be necessary for each sex (12 mice per group).</p><p id="p-0196" num="0174">Controls. In addition to injection of the un-encapsulated antigen (detailed above) and protein free-ZIF, controls will include injection with just PBS, which will be a negative control. Subcutaneous injection with protein free ZIF@polymer into one leg and subcutaneous injection of the antigen in the other leg should produce the same response as injection of just the antigen. The inventors' &#x201c;booster control group&#x201d; will consist of a separate cohort of mice administered unencapsulated antigen on day 0 and given a follow up injection on day 7. All control groups will be treated the same as the experimental cohort. All samples will be administered blind to reduce experimentalist bias.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0175">Expected Outcomes. When only antigen@ZIF@polymer is administered, the inventors anticipate seeing titers appear after day 10 and increase as the antigen is begins releasing from the freed antigen@ZIF. When antigen@ZIF and antigen@ZIF@polymer are co-administered, the inventors anticipate that IgG titers and cytokine levels will rise after 24 hours and consistently remain higher for longer as compared to the single injection group. In other words, IgG titers and cytokines will decline in single bolus groups while remaining steady in the &#x201c;booster groups&#x201d;. Further, the inventors anticipate a superior splenocyte response upon challenge of the antigen in the delayed release group. The single booster shot described in the booster control groups will provide improved IgG titers for the booster group as compared to the single injection group and the inventors will consider this aim a success if co-administration of antigen@ZIF and antigen@ZIF@polymer or exceeds this booster control group.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0176">Alternative Strategies. Subcutaneous administration of the nanoparticles should remain in the interstitial space without diffusing or being distributed systematically. In mice that show no or weak responses to the subcutaneous administration of the antigen@ZIF@polymer the inventors will perform a paw pad drainage assay to verify the antigens are being taken in and delivered to the lymphatic system. Briefly, a small bolus of Cy5-antigen@ZIF@polymer is injected into the paw pad of a mouse where inflammation and drainage of particulates will occur into the lymph located in the armpit of the mouse. This lymph node can be excised and should show fluorescence from the accumulated antigen. If it does not, the nanoparticle formulations may be entering the blood stream from either poor injection technique or because the nanoparticles are too small, in which case, larger nanoparticles can be used.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0177">In summary, the inventors will have formulated a high-yielding method to create long-lasting vaccine formulations that can be stored at room temperature and administered in a single shot.</p><heading id="h-0020" level="1">Example 3&#x2014;PLGA Encapsulated ZIF-8 Nanoparticles: Sustained Release Vaccine Preparation</heading><heading id="h-0021" level="1">A.

Finally, the sample was lyophilized to get pure intense blue colored smURF protein.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0191">Preparation of smURFP@ZIF-8: Different concentrations of smURF protein (1 mg/mL, 0.2 mg/mL and 0.3 mg/mL) were employed in encapsulation protocols to encapsulate the protein into ZIF-8. A 40:640 ratio of zinc acetate and 2-methyl imidazole reacted with different amounts of smURFP protein and milliQ water resulted in smURFP encapsulated ZIF-8 powders.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0192">Preparation of smURFP@ZIF-8@PLGA microparticles: A modified s/o/w method was used to prepare the ZIF-8 microparticles. 0.05 g of smURFP@ ZIF 8 powder was obtained. 0.1 g PEG-6000 was dissolved in water to get 200 mg/mL concentration. Then the ZIF was added to that by 1:20 w/w ZIF-8: PEG ratio. The total volume was 5 mL. The solution was sonicated for 20 mins to dissolve ZIF-8. It was kept in freezer for overnight at &#x2212;80&#xb0; C. The sample was collected from freezer and kept it for lyophilization. The sample was collected from the lyophilizer and washed with dichloromethane to remove the PEG-6000. It was taken in Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged for 8000 rpm for 10 mins and the precipitate was collected. This was done for 3 times. Then the sample was kept in vacuum evaporator for drying. S/O phase was prepared by suspending 20 mg of ZIF-8 microsphere powder in 2.5 mL DCM solution containing 125 mg PLGA.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0193">PVA (2%) aqueous phase preparation: 5 gm PVA wire was taken and dissolved in enough water by boiling and stirring on a hot plate for 150&#xb0; C., 150 rpm for 2 hours to get 250 mL solution. 1% NaCl (2.5 g) was added to make 250 mL PVA aqueous solution. Then the oil phase was added to the 200 mL PVA solution and mixed with magnetic stirrer for 1.25 min at 340 rpm. Thus S/O/W emulsion was prepared.</p><heading id="h-0025" level="1">B. Characterization</heading><p id="p-0217" num="0194">Scanning Electron Microscopy: SEM images of smURFP@ZIF-8 were obtained at various concentrations (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>-<b>13</b></figref>). SEM images of smURFP@ZIF-8@PLGA were also obtained (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>A &#x26; <b>14</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0218" num="0195">Fluorescence study: Solid and liquid state fluorescence data of smURFP@ZIF-8 and smURFP@ZIF@PLGA showed maximum emission at 670 nm after excitation at 642 nm which confirms presence of smURF protein in them (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0219" num="0196">Gel Electrophoresis: smURFP@ZIF-8 particles were treated with exfoliation solution (0.5 M EDTA solution 600 pH 7.9) and then run through 1 Agarose gel to observe the presence of protein inside ZIF-8 molecules. Subsequently, the gel was imaged with Cy5 channel with Typhoon (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>A</figref>). The dark red bands indicated the presence of smURF proteins of different concentrations. The gel was also stained with comassie blue dye which also confirmed the protein inside the ZIF-8 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0220" num="0197">Powdered XRD: Powdered XRD data was taken with smart Rigaku XRD machine from 5 to 45 degrees, speed 3 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>). PXRD data clearly shows similarity of XRD pattern of ZIF-8 and smURFP@ZIF-8 indicating that encapsulation of smURFP does not change the structural integrity of ZIF-8.</p><heading id="h-0026" level="1">Example 5&#x2014;Additional Experiments</heading><p id="p-0221" num="0198">Modulation of the Size of the ZIF-8 Particles: The synthesis will be performed at room temperature and typically takes several minutes compared to hours and days in non-aqueous conditions. The obtained product ZIF-8 nanocrystals will have size of approximately 85 nm and will exhibit excellent thermal, hydrothermal and solvothermal stabilities. Tuning the stoichiometry and conditions during ZIF-8 formation will allow manipulation of the size of the resulting particles (Pan et al., 2011). With nano size ZIF-8 particles PLGA encapsulated ZIF-8 nanoparticles will be prepared instead of microspheres. This will help facilitate injection into a mouse model and provide enhanced bioavailability and kidney filtration. Further characterization of ZIF-8 and ZIF-8@PLGA nanoparticles will be performed to observe the size, shape, crystallinity and immune response after injecting into various mouse models.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0199">In vivo study: 3 male mice groups will be selected and injected with 200 &#x3bc;l of ZIF-8, PLGA and ZIF-8@PLGA in each group. Then the skin of the mice will be shaved and the presence of Cy5 dye over time will be observed by animal imager by confirming the presence of fluorescence. Measurements will be performed to evaluate the time Cy5@ZIF-8@PLGA particles persist in the blood and the kinetics of release of the Cy5 drug model.</p><p id="p-0223" num="0200">smURFP@ZIF-8@PLGA will be tested similarly. The ex vivo release of smURFP from PLGA microparticles can be monitored in different PBS solution @ 37&#xb0; C. Fluorescence intensity will be measured each day to qualify and quantify the release of smURFP from PLGA particles.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0201">All of the compositions and methods disclosed and claimed herein can be made and executed without undue experimentation in light of the present disclosure.
