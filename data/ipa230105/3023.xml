INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0002" level="1">Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a variable assembly PC member in which a plurality of hollow PC modules comprised of upper and lower flanges and webs so as to have hollows formed therein are coupled with each other in the width direction by using connectors, thereby facilitating enlargement of members and on-site assembly of members through reduction of weight of the PC member, forming members with various sizes, and enabling structural integration in the width direction.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Background Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">A reinforced concrete (RC) structure construction method for constructing a structure by placing concrete after arranging reinforcing bars in a field and installing a mold places a great deal of weight on field work, and is greatly affected by field environments and weather conditions. Therefore, the RC structure construction method has a limit in reduction of a construction period of time and it is difficult to manage quality due to poor precision. Furthermore, the RC structure construction method is manpower-dependent and has a great deal of labor costs. Recently, due to an increase in labor costs, the RC structure construction method is decreased in economic feasibility.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Recently, a precast concrete (PC) construction method which can assemble concrete members, which has been prefabricated in a factory, on the spot is adopted well.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The PC construction method can reduce a construction period of time since reducing the proportion of field work and secure excellent quality, and has less burden on an increase of labor costs and a manpower shortage since the proportion of labor costs is small. However, in a case of a large-sized structure, it is difficult to carry and assemble in a field since the PC member is heavy.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A portion of the cross section of the member is formed as the PC member due to a limitation in hoisting capacity and a problem of integration between the members, and the members are assembled and installed on the field. The rest of the cross section is formed as a half PC member which is formed by placing concrete on the field.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">For example, Korean Patent No. 10-1713632 discloses technique of reducing weight by forming hollows arranged in a plurality of columns inside a half PC slab.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, such a half PC member also has a limitation in reduction of a construction period of time since requiring cast-in-place concrete placement. Furthermore, the half PC member is disadvantageous in vibration and sagging since being applicable only to one-way slab which transfers load in the longitudinal direction of the member.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In addition, Korean Patent No. 10-1776129 discloses a prefabricated precast double structure in which a concrete rib is mounted between upper and lower PC deck plates.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, the prefabricated precast double structure is difficult to achieve a structural integration with structures neighboring in the width direction. Additionally, the prefabricated precast double structure is difficult to be applicable to structures requiring watertightness, such as wastewater treatment facilities, water tanks, and the likes since fastening bolts must pass through the structure in order to combine upper and lower PC plates and concrete ribs with each other and it is difficult to secure watertightness at a portion connected with the neighboring structure.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Accordingly, the present invention has been made to solve the above-mentioned problems occurring in the prior arts, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a variable assembly PC member which facilitates enlargement of members and on-site assembly of members due to weight-lightening of the PC member, and enables manufacturing of members having various sizes.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is another object of the present invention to provide a variable assembly PC member which is capable of achieve structural integration in the width direction as well as in the longitudinal direction.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">To accomplish the above object, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a variable assembly PC member including: a plurality of hollow PC modules, each of which has an upper flange and a lower flange spaced apart from each other, and a pair of webs connecting both ends of the upper flange and the lower flange to form a hollow therein; and connectors connecting the plurality of hollow PC modules with each other in the width direction, wherein a plurality of steel bars are provided on the upper flange and the lower flange of the hollow PC module in the width direction of the hollow PC module, and the connectors connect the steel bars of the neighboring hollow PC modules with each other, and the connector includes: a coupler coupled to an end portion of one side steel bar; a headed bar of which one end is coupled to the coupler and the other end has an expanded head; a socket of which one end is coupled to an end portion of the other side steel bar and the other end has a receiving space for receiving the expanded head of the headed bar; and a fixing cap coupled to the receiving space of the socket to press the expanded head <b>321</b> of the headed bar.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a PC steel wire is disposed to penetrate through the upper flanges and the lower flanges of the plurality of hollow PC modules so as to apply post tension.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention, non-shrinkage mortar is filled between the webs of the neighboring hollow PC modules.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention, a shim plate is provided around the PC steel wire between the webs of the neighboring hollow PC modules.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention, magnets are provided on the web around the PC steel wire of one hollow PC module, and the shim plate is attached to the magnets to fix the position.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the shim plate is formed long in the longitudinal direction of the hollow PC module, and a through hole through which the PC steel wire penetrates is formed at the position of the PC steel wire.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention, a groove portion is formed on the outside of the web of the hollow PC module in the longitudinal direction of the hollow PC module, and a water stop protruding into the groove portion is disposed on the web in the longitudinal direction of the hollow PC module.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a variable assembly PC member which is a PC slab by an All PC method in which cast-in-place concrete is not placed, the variable assembly PC member which is formed by a plurality of hollow PC modules of a rectangular cross section connected in the width direction, each of the hollow PC modules comprising an upper flange, a lower flange, and a pair of webs connecting both ends of the upper flange and the lower flange, and having a hollow formed therein, wherein steel bars are respectively disposed inside the upper flange and the lower flange of the hollow PC module in the width direction of the hollow PC module and an end portion of the steel bar is exposed to a first pocket portion formed at one side end of the upper and lower flanges, and the steel bars of the hollow PC modules abutting in the width direction are connected to each other by a connector inside the first pocket portion, and non-shrinkage mortar is filled between the neighboring hollow PC modules.
