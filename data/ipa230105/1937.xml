APPLICATION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority to Korean Patent Application No. 10-2021-0088004, filed on Jul. 5, 2021, the entire contents of which is incorporated herein for all purposes by this reference.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a remote parking control system and a fail-safe method thereof, and more particularly, relates to technologies corresponding to the fail-safe upon remote parking control.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Recently, as there has been an increase in demand for safety and convenience of a driver as well as performance of a vehicle, an advanced driver assist system (ADAS) assisting to control the vehicle based on information obtained by sensors or the like loaded into the vehicle has been applied to assist the driver while driving.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">An automatic parking technology such as a remote smart parking assist (RSPA) is a convenience function with high driver's sensitivity and has a trend that becomes more common in vehicle applications.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A conventional automatic remote parking control apparatus controls a vehicle remotely in the outside of the vehicle. Accordingly, when a braking cooperation control device abnormally operates during vehicle control in the outside, an accident may occur because the braking cooperation control device does not perform a braking request. However, because the driver is located outside the vehicle, he or she may not respond at all.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In other words, in a failure situation where a braking system does not perform a normal operation during the operation of the automatic remote parking control function, although the cooperation control device takes safety measures (driving: idle torque control, shift: N/P stage control for each vehicle speed), safety of the vehicle may fail to be ensured without braking control of the braking system in a limited situation such as a downhill.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The information disclosed in this Background of the Invention section is only for enhancement of understanding of the general background of the invention and may not be taken as an acknowledgement or any form of suggestion that this information forms the prior art already known to a person skilled in the art.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p
