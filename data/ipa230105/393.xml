In this way, in the case where the determination device <b>2</b> is applied, for example, to determination of the state of the care recipient in the facility, it is possible to determine the state of the care recipient and to notify the caregiver of the determined state even when the caregiver does not present in the room. Accordingly, when the care recipient may be in the abnormal state, the caregiver can immediately address the situation, which is an excellent effect of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">The present invention should not be limited by the foregoing embodiment, and may be embodied in other forms without departing from the gist or essential characteristics thereof. Therefore, the embodiments described herein are to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not limiting. The scope of the present invention is indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing embodiments, and all modifications and changes that come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are intended to be embraced therein.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">For example, in the forgoing embodiment, only the cases are exemplarily described, in which the signal value is larger than or smaller than the get-up determination threshold value Th<b>1</b> and/or the bed-entry determination threshold value Th<b>2</b>. However, the present invention is not limited thereto. Other determination threshold values and/or other determination methods may be appropriately set. For example, in order to determine the state such as the lying position and the sitting position, it is possible to set another determination condition whether the signal value remains, for a certain period of time, larger than or smaller than the determination threshold value(s) such as the get-up determination threshold value Th<b>1</b> and/or the bed-entry determination threshold value Th<b>2</b>. In this way, it is possible to reduce an erroneous notification because the determination is performed after the state has been certainly changed.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Furthermore, in the foregoing embodiment, when the amplitude amplification section <b>11</b> amplifies the voltage of the analog electrical signal according to the vibration, the amplification degree may be adjusted relative to the magnitude of vibration that depends on variable factors such as the thickness of the mattress and an individual difference of the care recipient, so that a certain voltage amplitude can be output. That is, the state determination device <b>2</b> can adjust the amplification rate according to the living body whose state is determined and/or the environment under which the state is determined. In this way, it is possible for each determination value (i.e. the get-up determination threshold value Th<b>1</b> and the bed-entry determination threshold value Th<b>2</b>) to have one value without being changed for every variable factor. Thus, it is not required to change the determination threshold value depending on the variable factors such as the environment in which the sensor is installed and an individual difference of the care recipient.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">Also in the foregoing embodiment, the get-up determination threshold value Th<b>1</b> and the bed-entry determination threshold value Th<b>2</b> are exemplarily indicated each as a fixed threshold value. However, the present invention is not limited thereto. These determination threshold values may be changed for a predetermined period of time according to the motion of the care recipient. As one example, the get-up determination threshold value Th<b>1</b> may be shifted to a larger value for a predetermined period of time after the signal value Sv<b>1</b>, which is already subjected to the A/D conversion processing in step S<b>1</b>, becomes larger than a certain threshold value. When there is a big motion of the care recipient by getting up on the bed from the lying position or by a body movement, the signal value Sv<b>1</b> increases, and in association with this increase, the signal value Sv<b>2</b> also increases. Thus, a certain period of time may be needed for the signal value Sv<b>2</b> to decrease after the care recipient gets up, which may cause delay of the get-up determination. Thus, when there is a big motion as above that results in the signal value Sv<b>1</b> larger than the certain threshold value, the get-up determination threshold value Th<b>1</b> can be shifted to a larger value for a predetermined period of time. With this configuration, it is possible to perform the get-up determination earlier than the conventional case in which the get-up determination threshold value Th<b>1</b> is fixed.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Also in the foregoing embodiment, the determination of the state of the living body such as the presence/absence and the position is performed based on only the envelope derived from the acquired electrical signal according to the detected vibration. However, the present invention is not limited thereto. The biological information detected by the biological information detection device <b>4</b> may be used to determine the state along with the envelope. The biological information includes a heart rate, a respiratory rate, and a pulse. As one example, in addition to the bed-entry determination based on the envelope derived from the detection by the vibration detection device <b>1</b>, the heart rate is also detected so as to confirm the bed-entry. Thus, it is possible to confirm the bed-entry state with higher accuracy.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Also, the respective values in the foregoing embodiment are all exemplarily indicated. The respective values such as the sampling interval, the sampling number in the moving-average processing, the frequency band in the LPF/BPF processing, and the threshold value may be appropriately set according to the embodiment.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">Also in the foregoing embodiment, the states are exemplarily described, in which the care recipient gets up from the lying position to be in the sitting position, and in which the care recipient takes the lying position from the absent state. However, the present invention is not limited to thereto. That is, by recording the states and setting appropriate threshold values, the state determination device <b>2</b> of the present invention can detect changes in the state according to various situations in which, for example, the care recipient takes the lying position from the sitting position, and becomes absent from the sitting position.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">Also in the foregoing embodiment, the vibration detection section <b>10</b> of the vibration detection device <b>1</b> is placed on the bed to determine the state of the care recipient. However, the present invention is not limited thereto, and can be applied to various situations. For example, the vibration detection device <b>1</b> can be used to determine the state of a driver who are sitting in the driver's seat of a vehicle, and thus prevent an abnormal state such as drowsy driving. Also in the present invention, the living body whose state is to be detected is not limited to human beings. The present invention can be applied to various cases, which includes, for example, the application to animals such as dogs or cats.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">Also in the foregoing embodiment, the vibration detection device <b>1</b> includes the amplitude amplification section <b>11</b>, and the state determination device <b>2</b> includes the A/D conversion section <b>22</b>. However, the present invention is not limited thereto. The configurations of the respective devices may be designed as necessary. That is, the vibration detection device <b>1</b> may perform the A/D conversion processing to output the digital electrical signal. Also, the state determination device <b>2</b> may amplify the analog electrical signal. Furthermore, in place of the output section <b>31</b> of the communication device <b>3</b>, the output section <b>26</b> of the state determination device <b>2</b> may perform the report processing to output the information on the determination result. In this way, the devices of the present invention may be appropriately designed.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">Furthermore in the foregoing embodiment, the processing such as the rectification processing in step S<b>2</b> and the envelope detection processing in step S<b>3</b> is described as algorithm processing of the digital electrical signal. However, the present invention is not limited thereto. The processing may be realized as processing of the analog electrical signal by an analog electrical circuit. That is, the state determination device <b>2</b> of the present invention can perform the processing by combining electronic elements such as a diode, a resistor, and a capacitor. In this case, it is possible to omit the A/D conversion processing in step S<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">However, when the processing such as the rectification processing and the envelope detection processing is executed by an analog electrical circuit configured by combining the electronic elements such as a diode, a resistor, and a capacitor, there may occur a problem that does not appear in the algorithm processing. For example, in the analog electrical circuit, sometimes it is difficult to process the electrical signal having a voltage lower than the forward voltage of the diode that performs the rectification processing. Also, there may be a problem of accuracy in the rectification processing and the envelope detection processing to a minute voltage change detected by the vibration detection section <b>10</b>. Furthermore, although the envelope detection processing such as the BPF processing and the LPF processing may also be performed by the analog electrical circuit configured by an electrical component such as an operational amplifier and by the electronic elements such as a resistor, a diode, and a capacitor, in this case there may be a problem of improvement in filter characteristics. Furthermore, in the analog electrical circuit, sometimes it is difficult to perform the moving-average processing as the envelope detection processing. Therefore, in the state determination system of the present invention, it is possible to build a further excellent system by configuring the system with the technique to process the digital electrical signal (i.e. elements, circuits, devices and the like).</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">Furthermore in the foregoing embodiment, the state of the care recipient is determined by real time. However, the present invention is not limited thereto, and can be applied to various situations. That is, in the state determination system of the present invention, the data may be recorded based on the detected vibration so that the change of the state of the care recipient may be determined and his/her behavior may be analyzed based on the recorded data at a later date.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF REFERENCE NUMERALS</heading><p id="p-0111" num="0000"><ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0110"><b>1</b> Vibration detection device</li>    <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0111"><b>10</b> Vibration detection section</li>    <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0112"><b>11</b> Amplitude amplification section</li>    <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0113"><b>12</b> Output section</li>    <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0114"><b>2</b> State determination device</li>    <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0115"><b>20</b> Control section</li>    <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0116"><b>21</b> Input section</li>    <li id="ul0002-0008" num="0117"><b>22</b> A/D conversion section</li>    <li id="ul0002-0009" num="0118"><b>23</b> Recording section</li>    <li id="ul0002-0010" num="0119"><b>230</b> State determination program</li>    <li id="ul0002-0011" num="0120"><b>24</b> Storage section</li>    <li id="ul0002-0012" num="0121"><b>25</b> Operation section</li>    <li id="ul0002-0013" num="0122"><b>26</b> Output section</li>    <li id="ul0002-0014" num="0123"><b>27</b> Communication section</li>    <li id="ul0002-0015" num="0124"><b>3</b> Communication device</li>    <li id="ul0002-0016" num="0125"><b>30</b> Communication section</li>    <li id="ul0002-0017" num="0126"><b>31</b> Output section</li>    <li id="ul0002-0018" num="0127"><b>4</b> Biological information detection device</li>    <li id="ul0002-0019" num="0128">NW Communication network</li>    <li id="ul0002-0020" num="0129">REC Recording medium</li></ul></p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
