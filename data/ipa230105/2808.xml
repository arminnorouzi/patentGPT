Among the most popular are single cell PCR, fluorescence activated flow cytometry, mass cytometry and single cell sequencing. These (fluorescence and mass-based cytometry) approaches are limited from either inability to breach the multiplexing levels of more than 100 parameters per analyte (cell in this case) or from inability to achieve high throughput (single cell sequencing). Also these methods are not appropriate or readily modified to enable cell multiplexed analysis of archived tissues and slide based samples.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Disclosed herein are several related methods for capture agent detection that are based on labeling the capture agent with DNA and subsequent detection of this DNA by primer extension.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Provided herein is a method for analyzing a planar sample. In certain embodiments, the method comprises: (a) incubating the planar sample (e.g., a tissue section such as a formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) section) with a capture agent under conditions by which the capture agent specifically binds to complementary sites in the planar sample, wherein: (i) the capture agent is linked to a double-stranded oligonucleotide that comprises a first strand and a second strand; (ii) the capture agent is linked to a double-stranded oligonucleotide by the 5&#x2032; end of the first strand; and (iii) the 3&#x2032; end of the first strand is recessed relative to the 5&#x2032; end of the second strand, thereby producing an 5&#x2032;-overhang; (b) crosslinking the capture agent to planar sample; (c) contacting the planar sample with a polymerase and a nucleotide mix, thereby adding one or more nucleotides to the overhang; and (d) reading a fluorescent signal generated by addition of the one or more nucleotides to the overhang using fluorescence microscopy, thereby producing an image showing the pattern of binding of the capture agent to the planar sample.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In certain embodiments, the method includes contacting the planar sample with a polymerase and a nucleotide mix that comprises a fluorescent nucleotide, thereby adding the fluorescent nucleotide to the overhang; and reading a fluorescent signal generated by addition of the fluorescent nucleotide to the overhang. In these embodiments, the fluorescent signal that is read may be, for example, emitted directly from the added nucleotide or may be a FRET signal generated by energy transfer, e.g., between two fluorescent nucleotides that are added to the overhang or between a first fluorescent nucleotide added to overhang and a second fluorescent nucleotide that is present in the second strand.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In alternative embodiments, extension of the first strand may remove a quencher from a quenched fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide that is hybridized to the second strand, downstream from the first strand.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Also provided herein is an capture agent that is linked to a double-stranded oligonucleotide, wherein: (i) the double-stranded oligonucleotide comprises a first strand and a second strand; (ii) the capture agent is linked to the 5&#x2032; end of the first strand; and (iii) the 3&#x2032; end of the first strand is recessed relative to the 5&#x2032; end of the second strand, thereby producing an 5&#x2032;-overhang.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Also provided herein is an capture agent composition comprising a plurality of capture agents that recognize different complementary sites.

By way of example, the presence of one or more breast cells in a lung tissue of an animal is an indication that the animal is afflicted with metastatic breast cancer.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The term &#x201c;complementary site&#x201d; is used to refer to an epitope for an antibody or aptamer, or a nucleic acid molecule if the capture agent is an oligonucleotide probe. Specifically, if the capture agent is an antibody, then the complementary site for the capture agent is the epitope in the sample to which the antibody binds. If the capture agent is an oligonucleotide probe, then the complementary site for the capture agent is a complementary sequence in a DNA or RNA molecule in the sample.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The term &#x201c;epitope&#x201d; as used herein is defined as small chemical groups on the antigen molecule that is bound to by an antibody.

This step is done under conditions by which the capture agent binds to complementary sites in the planar sample, methods for which are well known. In these embodiments, the capture agent is linked to a double-stranded oligonucleotide that comprises a first strand and a second strand (e.g., two oligonucleotide that are hybridized together) and the capture agent is linked (covalently or non-covalently via a biotin) to the double-stranded oligonucleotide by the 5&#x2032; end of the first strand, and the 3&#x2032; end of the first strand is recessed relative to the 5&#x2032; end of the second strand, thereby defining an overhang. After the capture agent has bound to the planar sample, the capture agent is cross-linked the planar sample. This crosslinking step may be done using any amine-to-amine crosslinker (e.g. formaldehyde, disuccinimiyllutarate or another reagents of similar action) although a variety of other chemistries can be used to cross-link the capture agent to the planar sample if desired. The method comprises reading a fluorescent signal generated by addition of a nucleotide in the overhang. This step may be done by contacting the planar sample with a polymerase and a nucleotide mix, thereby adding one or more nucleotides to the overhang; and reading a fluorescent signal generated by addition of the one or more nucleotides to the overhang.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">As will be described in greater detail below, the fluorescent signal may be generated by a variety of different methods. For example, in some embodiments, the flouorescent signal may be fluorescence from a fluorescent nucleotide added to the end of the primer, or a FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) signal resulting from the same. In other embodiments, the signal may generated by removing a quencher from a fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide that is also hybridized to the oligonucleotide.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In any implementation of the method, the reading step may be followed by inactivating the fluorescence after reading so that other binding events can be detected and read. In these embodiments, the fluorescence may be inactivated by peroxide-based bleaching, cleavage of fluorophore linked to nucleotide through cleavable linker (e.g. using TCEP as a cleaving reagent), base-exchange by exo+ polymerase such as Vent, or subsequent incorporation of quencher, for example.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Also, as will be described in greater detailed below, the method may be multiplexed in a way that a single planar sample can be interrogated by a plurality of different capture agents, where each antibody is linked to different oligonucleotides (i.e., oligonucleotides of different sequence). In multiplex embodiments, the planar sample may be labeled using at least 5, at least 10, at least 20, at least 30, at least 50, or at least 100, up to 150 or more capture agents that are each linked to a different oligonucleotide, and binding of the capture agents can be separately read using a fluorescence microscope equipped with an appropriate filter for each fluorophore, or by using dual or triple band-pass filter sets to observe multiple fluorophores. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,776,688.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">As summarized above, a capture agent used in the method may be linked to a double-stranded oligonucleotide that contains a 5&#x2032; overhang (i.e., a recessed 3&#x2032; end that can be extended by a polymerase).

In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the overhang is a single nucleotide overhang (e.g., an A), although a longer overhang (e.g., at least 2, at least 3, at least 4, at least 5, at least 6, at least 8, at least 10, at least 20, or at least at least 30, may be useful for other applications (e.g., multiplexed applications). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A-D</figref>, in certain cases, the overhang may contain a repeated sequence, e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 or more repeats of the same sequence of 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 nucleotides, thereby allowing the capture agent to be used in multiplexed applications as described below. In certain embodiments, the double stranded oligonucleotide may have a recessed 3&#x2032; end at the other end of the oligonucleotide (i.e., at the end closest to the capture agent). However, this end is not extendible. In certain circumstances, the double-stranded oligonucleotide may contain one or more third oligonucleotides that are hybridized to the overhang. In these embodiments, there will be a gap of 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 or more nucleotides between the second strand of the double-stranded oligonucleotide and the oligonucleotide that is hybridized to the overhang (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref>).

The duplexes are designed in such a way that each antibody has the same upper strand sequence linked, covalently or through streptavidin, to an antibody through the 5&#x2032; end. The lower strand changes from antibody to antibody. In this implementation, the general formula for the lower strand is 3&#x2032;-dideoxydC -sequence-complimentary-to-upper-strand G<sub>n</sub>A/T/C-5&#x2032;. One type of lower strand base (nucleotide G in this example) is reserved for step-wise progression and its complementary pair on the upper strand is never used in labeled form. The other three bases are complementary to labeled nucleotides and can be used to identify three capture agents per cycle.

This design ensures that: a) no two antibody species contain the same duplex and b) only three different capture agents are detected at a time. Each cycle includes: (a) a labeling step in which the three capture agents are labeled and duplexes on the rest are extended one base at a time, (b) an imaging step and (c) a destaining/deprotection step. During cycle to cycle transition the added fluorescent labels from the previous cycle are inactivated by any of the suitable methods, including but not limited to: cleavage of fluorophore off the nucleotide (if the labeled nucleotide is linked to the fluorophore through a cleavable linker); peroxide based bleaching; photobleaching; chemically-assisted photobleaching; labeled base replacement by exo+ polymerase, etc. After or simultaneously with inactivation of the fluorophores added in the previous reaction, the unlabeled &#x201c;extension&#x201d; nucleotide that has been added to the remainder of the capture agents is activated by cleavage of the protective group off its 3&#x2032; end. Cleavage of the protective group, in turn, allows that nucleotide to be extended in the next cycle. Since the A, T and C are reserved for incorporation of a labelled nucleotide, those nucleotides only occur at the end of each lower strand of the duplex. This approach is based on the chemical nature of reversible terminators, which precludes upper strand extension for more than one nucleotide at a time even on polyG stretches of the lower strand. Optionally, a quencher labeled nucleotide can be incorporated following the labeled nucleotide.

The image may be used as a diagnostic to determine whether the subject has a disease or condition, e.g., a cancer. In certain embodiments, the method may be used to determine the stage of a cancer, to identify metastasized cells, or to monitor a patient's response to a treatment, for example.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0141">In any embodiment, data can be forwarded to a &#x201c;remote location&#x201d;, where &#x201c;remote location,&#x201d; means a location other than the location at which the image is examined. For example, a remote location could be another location (e.g., office, lab, etc.) in the same city, another location in a different city, another location in a different state, another location in a different country, etc. As such, when one item is indicated as being &#x201c;remote&#x201d; from another, what is meant is that the two items can be in the same room but separated, or at least in different rooms or different buildings, and can be at least one mile, ten miles, or at least one hundred miles apart. &#x201c;Communicating&#x201d; information references transmitting the data representing that information as electrical signals over a suitable communication channel (e.g., a private or public network). &#x201c;Forwarding&#x201d; an item refers to any means of getting that item from one location to the next, whether by physically transporting that item or otherwise (where that is possible) and includes, at least in the case of data, physically transporting a medium carrying the data or communicating the data. Examples of communicating media include radio or infra-red transmission channels as well as a network connection to another computer or networked device, and the internet or including email transmissions and information recorded on websites and the like. In certain embodiments, the image may be analyzed by an MD or other qualified medical professional, and a report based on the results of the analysis of the image may be forwarded to the patient from which the sample was obtained.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0142">In some cases, the method may be employed in a variety of diagnostic, drug discovery, and research applications that include, but are not limited to, diagnosis or monitoring of a disease or condition (where the image identifies a marker for the disease or condition), discovery of drug targets (where the a marker in the image may be targeted for drug therapy), drug screening (where the effects of a drug are monitored by a marker shown in the image), determining drug susceptibility (where drug susceptibility is associated with a marker) and basic research (where is it desirable to measure the differences between cells in a sample).</p><p id="p-0145" num="0143">In certain embodiments, two different samples may be compared using the above methods. The different samples may be composed of an &#x201c;experimental&#x201d; sample, i.e., a sample of interest, and a &#x201c;control&#x201d; sample to which the experimental sample may be compared. In many embodiments, the different samples are pairs of cell types or fractions thereof, one cell type being a cell type of interest, e.g., an abnormal cell, and the other a control, e.g., normal, cell. If two fractions of cells are compared, the fractions are usually the same fraction from each of the two cells. In certain embodiments, however, two fractions of the same cell may be compared. Exemplary cell type pairs include, for example, cells isolated from a tissue biopsy (e.g., from a tissue having a disease such as colon, breast, prostate, lung, skin cancer, or infected with a pathogen etc.) and normal cells from the same tissue, usually from the same patient; cells grown in tissue culture that are immortal (e.g., cells with a proliferative mutation or an immortalizing transgene), infected with a pathogen, or treated (e.g., with environmental or chemical agents such as peptides, hormones, altered temperature, growth condition, physical stress, cellular transformation, etc.), and a normal cell (e.g., a cell that is otherwise identical to the experimental cell except that it is not immortal, infected, or treated, etc.); a cell isolated from a mammal with a cancer, a disease, a geriatric mammal, or a mammal exposed to a condition, and a cell from a mammal of the same species, preferably from the same family, that is healthy or young; and differentiated cells and non-differentiated cells from the same mammal (e.g., one cell being the progenitor of the other in a mammal, for example). In one embodiment, cells of different types, e.g., neuronal and non-neuronal cells, or cells of different status (e.g., before and after a stimulus on the cells) may be employed. In another embodiment of the invention, the experimental material is cells susceptible to infection by a pathogen such as a virus, e.g., human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), etc., and the control material is cells resistant to infection by the pathogen. In another embodiment, the sample pair is represented by undifferentiated cells, e.g., stem cells, and differentiated cells.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0144">The images produced by the method may be viewed side-by-side or, in some embodiments, the images may be superimposed or combined.
