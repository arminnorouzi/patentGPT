As 4G evolves to 5G, 5G radio access network (NR), 5G core network, 4G core network, and 4G radio access network (LTE) mix and match to form an evolution route for multiple network deployment options, such as, (1) Non-Standalone (NSA) mode: 4G core network is connected, 4G base station is a primary station, 5G base station is a secondary station, (2) Standalone (SA) mode: 5G core network is introduced but only 4G base station is connected to 5G core network, (3) Non-Standalone (NSA) mode: 5G core network is introduced, 5G base station is a primary station, 4G base station is a secondary station, and many other modes on the evolution route.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It can be seen from the afore-described evolution routes that in the NSA mode, if a terminal wants to realize 4G and 5G wireless communication at the same time, the terminal has to be equipped with a 4G signal transceiving device and a 5G signal transceiving device. However, in practical applications, when the 4G signal transceiving device and the 5G signal transceiving device are working at the same time, direct or indirect interaction may likely occur between the signals of different frequency bands. For example, cross modulation occurred between signals within a 5G N78 frequency band and a third-order harmonic of 4G uplink signals will have a serious impact on 4G downlink signals and blockage will be caused for 4G reception frequency bands. In severe cases, this may cause the 4G signal transceiving device to drop the connection. Therefore, there is a cross-modulation interference problem for signals of different frequency bands when the 4G signal transceiving device and the 5G signal transceiving device are working at the same time.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Technical Problems</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The embodiments of the present invention provides a method, device and terminal for downlink signal

The dual connectivity architecture may include an LTE/LTE-A transceiver (i.e., a 4G signal transceiving device) and a NR transceiver (i.e., a 5G signal transceiving device). The full name of LTE is Long Term Evolution. The full name of NR is New Radio. The A in LTE-A means Advanced. That is, the present invention is better applicable to a dual connectivity architecture made up by 4G LTE/LTE-A and 5G NR, especially suitable for an EN-DC dual connectivity architecture, where the E stands for E-UTRA, which indicates a 4G radio access network, the N stands for NR, which indicate 5G new radio, and DC stands for Dual Connectivity. The LTE transceiver includes the first signal transmitter <b>10</b> and the first signal receiver <b>30</b> and the NR transceiver may include the second signal transmitter <b>20</b> (and a second signal receiver). The frequency band at which the first signal transmitter <b>10</b> is 1920 MHz to 1980 MHz, the frequency band at which the first signal receiver <b>30</b> operates is 2110 MHz to 2170 MHz, and the frequency band at which the second signal transmitter <b>20</b> operates is 3300 MHz to 3800 MHz, that is, N78 frequency band in the 5G NR specification. Specifically, the high-order harmonic is a third-order harmonic. More specifically, in other embodiments of the present invention, processes may be formulated below, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Step <b>20</b>, when an LTE transceiver is connected, transmitting an LTE uplink signal along an LTE uplink direction by an LTE signal transmitter in the dual connectivity architecture, and receiving, by an LTE signal receiver in the dual connectivity architecture, a signal transmitted along an LTE downlink.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Step <b>21</b>, transmitting an uplink signal within N78 frequency band along a 5G NR uplink direction by a 5G NR signal transmitter in the dual connectivity architecture.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In Step <b>22</b>: the uplink frequencies of LTE band 1 are 1920 MHz to 1980 MHz, the downlink frequencies of LTE band 1 are 2110 MHz to 2170 MHz, and NR N78 frequencies are 3300 MHz to 3800 MHz. When LTE band 1 (Band 1) and NR N78 frequency band are working at the same time, there is a high possibility to generate cross-modulation interference between different signals. This scenario is described as follows. Cross-modulation products generated from a mix of 3650 MHz to 3770 MHz within the NR N78 frequency band and a third-order harmonic from a 4G power amplifier (first power amplifier <b>11</b>) on the LTE band 1 uplink will fall within LTE Band 1 downlink frequency band. Signals of the NR 78 frequency band signal is coupled to the first antenna <b>13</b> via the second antenna <b>23</b> and then goes into a duplexer <b>12</b>, and thus goes into LTE downlink, as shown in the following calculations:1920&#xd7;3&#x2212;3650=2110 MHz, 1980&#xd7;3&#x2212;3770=2170 MHz, that is, a frequency band (i.e., the cross-modulation products) overlapped with signals received by the LTE signal receiver is generated. In the present embodiment, after the uplink signal within the N78 frequency band and a third-order harmonic of the LTE uplink signal go into the LTE downlink and before into the LTE signal receiver, a long open-loop wire arranged on the LTE downlink is utilized to filter out 3650 MHz to 3770 MHz uplink signal within the N78 frequency band. This is because an overlapped frequency band exists between a frequency band at which the LTE signal receiver operates and a frequency band where an interference signal formed after a mix of the 3650 MHz to 3770 MHz signal within the aforesaid frequency band and the third-order harmonic of the LTE uplink signal is located. Based on above improved technical solution, the present invention can destroy a condition for causing cross-modulation products generated by 3650 MHz to 3770 MHz within the NR N78 frequency band and the third-order harmonic from the 4G power amplifier (first power amplifier <b>11</b>) on the LTE band 1 uplink, prevent from generating the cross-modulation products, and avoid an impact on the LTE transceiver (i.e., the B1 transceiver in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>) in the dual connectivity architecture.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">It should be understood that the order described for the above steps of the present invention does not limit the order of that actually performs.
