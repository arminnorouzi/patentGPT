Further, it is also very difficult for man-made legged robots to traverse obstacles that are in their walking pathways. Though extensive efforts have been made to develop legged robots that can climb a variety of surfaces, such complex manoeuvres generally also increase the power consumptions.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, there is a need for a more efficient solution to address the above issues.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to various embodiments, there is provided a method of controlling a movement of a hybrid robot including a locomotion stimulation device carried by an animal.

Thus, in an embodiment, a &#x201c;processing unit&#x201d; may be a hard-wired logic circuit or a programmable logic circuit such as a programmable processor, e.g. a microprocessor (e.g. a Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC) processor or a Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) processor).

In particular, various embodiments generally relate to a method of controlling a movement of a hybrid robot having a locomotion stimulation device carried by an animal, and an animal locomotion stimulation system for controlling a movement of a hybrid robot using an animal as a legged platform. Further, various embodiments may relate to a locomotion stimulation device, an animal locomotion control system and a method of operating the animal locomotion control system. According to various embodiments, the locomotion stimulation device may be mounted to or carried by a living animal (for example, including but not limited to mammals, reptiles, birds, amphibians, arthropods or fishes) wherein the locomotion stimulation device may be used or operated to stimulate a locomotion or movement of the animal. According to various embodiments, the animal locomotion control system may include a set of components, including the locomotion stimulation device, interconnected via a network to provide commands and/or instructions to the animal locomotion stimulation device for controlling the locomotion stimulation device to stimulate the animal's locomotion or movement so as to control or direct the locomotion or the movement of the animal. According to various embodiments, the method of operating the animal locomotion control system may include providing commands and/or instructions to the locomotion stimulation device to control the locomotion stimulation device for stimulating the animal's locomotion or movement so as to control or direct the locomotion or the movement of the animal. According to various embodiments, the locomotion or movement of the animal may be directional movement including, but not limited to, a forward movement, backward movement, a right turn, and/or a left turn. According to various embodiments, stimulation of the locomotion or movement of the animal may be for encouraging or arousing or raising a level of physiological or nervous activity in the animal associated with a tendency or inclination for the animal to move in a desired manner thereby urging or causing or induce the animal to move in the desired manner.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to various embodiments, the device and/or the system may utilize the living animal as legged robot platforms. According to various embodiments, a combination of the locomotion stimulation device and the animal may be referred to as the hybrid robot or a biological legged machine or an animal-machine hybrid robot or a cyborg animal. According to various embodiments, the device may include a very small electronic stimulator module mounted onto the animal, for example a live insect (e.g., beetles or cockroaches), via an electronic backpack. According to various embodiments, the locomotion stimulation device may also include electrodes which may be connected to the stimulator module and may be implanted into selected areas of the animal body (e.g. an insect body) such as muscles and sensory units. According to various embodiments, the stimulator module may be controlled remotely to output electrical stimulation signals to the electrodes, which may induce the desired leg motions or walking gaits to execute the desired locomotion or movements.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to various embodiments, manipulation of animal movements (such as insect movements) by electrically stimulating their muscles and sensory units via tiny remote controllers may require much less power than that for conventional man-made small-legged robots. This may be because the electrical stimulation of muscles or sensory units may only require a power of the order of 0.01 mW. Furthermore, complicated algorithms to traverse obstacles may be unnecessary because, when the animal (such as insect) encounters obstacles, the user may shut off the remote controller and let the animal (such as insect) traverse the obstacle independently.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to various embodiments, the locomotion control of the living animal, such as a living insect exemplified by a Madagascar hissing cockroach which is discussed in more detail in the following, may be based on two key aspects: (1) inducement of the desired motion/walking gaits (left/right turning, forward/backward walking) in the animal (such as insect), and (2) implementation of these elicited movements to navigate the animal towards pre-determined targets.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to various embodiments, the animal (e.g. insect such as terrestrial insect, particularly cockroach species) may possess several sensory organs helping them to collect environmental information of the surrounding. With these harvested data, the animal may be able to not only perceive the presence of obstructions then accordingly avoid or climb over, but also detect the dangerous threats then rapidly perform evasive actions. For example. two representative sensory organs in an arthropod for this procedure are antennae and cerci of the arthropod (or insect).</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">For example, the natural escape response of terrestrial cockroaches may be replicated using electrical stimulation. As another example, both mechanical and electrical provocations of one antenna of the Madagascar hissing cockroach may &#x201c;alarm&#x201d; the insect about the presence of danger at the stimulated site and subsequently &#x201c;steer&#x201d; it toward an opposite direction.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">For example, various embodiments may intentionally direct an arthropod's locomotion (or insect locomotion, e.g. the cockroach's locomotion) via the electrical stimulation of its cerci and/or abdomen. According to various embodiments, electrical stimuli driven at the arthropod's (or insect's, e.g. cockroach's) left cercus and abdomen may induce a right turn and vice versa, whereas a stimulus applied at both cerci may accelerate the arthropod (such as insect, e.g. cockroach).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Various embodiments may include an electronic backpack that provides power to stimulate and navigate the hybrid robot. According to various embodiments, the electronic backpack may carry a payload including various equipment, electronics, and sensors, depending on the desired tasks and operations. According to various embodiments, the payload may be divided into several classes or categories or types.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">First, the payload may include electronics to detect and generate location information, such as an accelerometer, an inertial measurement unit (IMU), or a global/indoor positioning system (GPS/IPS) or combination thereof. As an example, a positioning system may include beacons with known locations around a specified area and on-onboard tags to identify the location of the hybrid robots via the devices and/or system of the various embodiments as they navigate within an area (or an operating space).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Second, the payload may include communication and network electronics, such as wireless data transmission module for transmitting the locational information to a remote server or control center.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Third, the payload may include other equipment, electronics and sensors that may be required depending on the required tasks and operations, such as sensors for human sensing. Such sensors may include image and infrared sensors, acoustic sensors, pressure sensors, radar, chemical sensors, biosensors, electrochemical sensors, communication signal sensors, and any combination thereof. For other scenarios, the electronic backpack may be configured with load capacity, fastening features, lights, displays, speakers, and any combination thereof as required.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to various embodiments, the electronic backpack may include any combinations of the three classes of equipment, electronics or sensors mentioned above, and may be configured with an integrated printed circuit board. According to various embodiments, the electronic backpack may be fitted, mounted, attached, or fastened on the animal (such as insect) to form the hybrid robot. For example, on the back or abdomen of the animal (such as insect), as exemplified in the following discussion by the Madagascar hissing cockroach. According to various embodiments, the electronic backpack may be surgically implanted into the body of the animal (such as insect).</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a schematic drawing of a locomotion stimulation device <b>120</b> according to various embodiments.

According to various embodiments, if the one or the combination of the displacement, the velocity or the acceleration is less than the pre-defined minimum displacement, the pre-defined minimum velocity or the pre-defined minimum acceleration respectively despite the forward stimulation control signal being sent for the predetermined period of time, the path of the hybrid robot <b>110</b> may be considered to be obstructed.

One end of these four wires may be connected to an electronic stimulation source (i.e., electronic stimulator module on a wireless backpack or the electric stimulator <b>150</b> on the electronic backpack <b>130</b>). The insulation of the other ends may be removed using twister at the length of 1 cm for two electrodes (serving as cercal electrodes; or the first cercal-electrode insert <b>162</b> and the second cercal-electrode insert <b>164</b>) and 0.5 cm for the other two (serving as abdominal electrodes; or the first abdominal-electrode insert <b>166</b> and the second abdominal-electrode insert <b>168</b>). The Madagascar hissing cockroach <b>112</b> may then be anesthetized using carbon dioxide (or CO2) gas for immobilization. Afterward, the tips of two cerci may be trimmed off to create two small openings, and two cercal stimulating electrodes (or the first cercal-electrode insert <b>162</b> and the second cercal-electrode insert <b>164</b>) may then be inserted into these holes at a depth of 1 cm. The insertion may be fixed in position using beeswax. An insect pin (AUSTERLITZ) may be used to pierce two small holes at the second segment of the insect's abdomen where the two abdominal stimulating electrodes (or the first abdominal-electrode insert <b>166</b> and the second abdominal-electrode insert <b>168</b>) may be implanted into. The depth of implant may be 0.5 cm. The implants may be fixed in position with beeswax. The Madagascar hissing cockroach <b>112</b> may be given 30 minutes to 1 hour to recover after the implantation.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">According to various embodiments, for example in the prototype, stimulation may include bipolar square wave being employed to stimulate the Madagascar hissing cockroach <b>112</b>. The amplitude of the stimuli may be varied up to 20 Vpp, whereas the frequency may be adjusted from 10 Hz to 50 Hz, depending on individual Madagascar hissing cockroach <b>112</b>. According to various embodiments, for example in the prototype, a stimulus may be transferred to two left electrodes (or the first cercal-electrode insert <b>162</b> and the first abdominal-electrode insert <b>166</b>) to induce a right turn and vice versa, whereas an electrical stimulation of two cercal electrodes (or the first cercal-electrode insert <b>162</b> and the second cercal-electrode insert <b>164</b>) may elicit a forward acceleration from the Madagascar hissing cockroach <b>112</b>. Accordingly, electrical stimulus passed to one of the cerci and/or one side of the abdomen may produce a signal of danger making the Madagascar hissing cockroach <b>112</b> turning towards the opposite side to escape.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">According to various embodiments, for example in the prototype, the success rate based on the above described implantation and stimulation is around 80%.
