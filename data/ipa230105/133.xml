Most commonly it is used as a thickening or emulsifying agent in food products, such as nut milks, meat products, and yogurt. There are three main types of carrageenan&#x2014;iota-carrageenan, kappa-carrageenan and lambda-carrageenan. Kappa and iota-carrageenan are used as a gelling agents; however, lambda-carrageenan is used as a thickener. Kappa- and iota-carrageenan form gels (amorphous solids) in the presence of ions, such as calcium and/or potassium ions.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0039">Amorphous solids formed from carrageenan may be solid at room temperature (for example, at temperatures less than about 30&#xb0; C.), but liquid upon heating (for example, at temperatures greater than about 30&#xb0; C.). Advantageously, this property may be exploited in amorphous solid-based consumables for electronic smoking devices, since the amorphous solid is solid at room temperature and so does not leak aerosol-generating material during storage or transport. Upon heating, the amorphous solid melts and become liquid, releasing active and/or aromatic compounds contained therein. The inventors have found that as the amorphous solid sets, flavour compounds are stabilized within the amorphous solid matrix allowing a higher flavorant loading to be achieved than in non-amorphous solid compositions. The flavorant (e.g. menthol) is stabilized at high concentrations and the products have a good shelf life.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0040">In some embodiments the thermoreversible amorphous solid is liquid when heated in a non-combustible aerosol delivery device to a temperature greater than about 30&#xb0; C., for example, greater than about 35&#xb0; C., 40&#xb0; C., 45&#xb0; C., 50&#xb0; C., 55&#xb0; C., 60&#xb0; C., 65&#xb0; C., 70&#xb0; C., 80&#xb0; C., 90&#xb0; C. or 100&#xb0; C. Advantageously, the temperature at which the thermoreversible amorphous solid becomes liquid can be adjusted by optimizing the quantity of carrageenan added to the thermoreversible amorphous solid. Hence, if it is desired that the thermoreversible amorphous solid becomes liquid at a lower temperature, then the quantity of carrageenan may be reduced until the desired melting temperature is achieved. Conversely, if it is desired that the thermoreversible amorphous solid remains solid until exposed to higher temperatures then this may be achieved by increasing the quantity of carrageenan in the thermoreversible amorphous solid.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0041">In some embodiments the aerosol-generating material is liquid when heated in a non-combustible aerosol delivery device to a temperature greater than about 30&#xb0; C., for example, greater than about 35&#xb0; C., 40&#xb0; C., 45&#xb0; C., 50&#xb0; C., 55&#xb0; C., 60&#xb0; C., 65&#xb0; C., 70&#xb0; C., 80&#xb0; C., 90&#xb0; C. or 100&#xb0; C. Advantageously, the temperature at which the aerosol-generating material becomes liquid can be adjusted by optimizing the quantity of carrageenan added to the aerosol-generating material. Hence, if it is desired that the aerosol-generating material becomes liquid at a lower temperature, then the quantity of carrageenan may be reduced until the desired melting temperature is achieved. Conversely, if it is desired that the aerosol-generating material remains solid until exposed to higher temperatures then this may be achieved by increasing the quantity of carrageenan in the aerosol generating material.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0042">In some embodiments the thermoreversible amorphous solid is solid before it is heated in a non-combustible aerosol delivery device to a temperature greater than about 30&#xb0; C., for example, the thermoreversible amorphous solid is solid at temperatures lower than about 30&#xb0; C.; for example, lower than about 25&#xb0; C., 20&#xb0; C. or 15&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0043">In some embodiments the aerosol-generating material is solid before it is heated in a non-combustible aerosol delivery device to a temperature greater than about 30&#xb0; C., for example, the aerosol-generating material is solid at temperatures lower than about 30&#xb0; C.; for example, lower than about 25&#xb0; C., 20&#xb0; C. or 15&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0044">In some cases the thermoreversible amorphous solid comprises iota- and/or kappa-carrageenan in an amount from about 2 wt % to about 20 wt %, or about 3 wt % to about 15 wt %, or about 4 wt % to about 10 wt %, or about 2 wt % to about 5 wt % (all calculated on a dry weight basis); In some cases the thermoreversible amorphous solid comprises kappa-carrageenan in an amount from about 2 wt % to about 5 wt %, calculated on a dry weight basis.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0045">Suitably, the thermoreversible amorphous solid may comprise from about 20 wt % to about 50 wt %, 45 wt %, 40 wt %, 35 wt %, 30 wt % or 25 wt % of an aerosol-former material (all calculated on a dry weight basis). The aerosol-former material may act as a plasticizer. For example, the thermoreversible amorphous solid may comprise 20-40 wt %, 20-35 wt % or 20-25 wt % of an aerosol-former material. In some cases, the aerosol-former material comprises one or more compounds selected from erythritol, propylene glycol, glycerol, triacetin, sorbitol and xylitol. In some cases, the aerosol-former material comprises, consists essentially of or consists of glycerol. The inventors have established that if the content of the plasticizer is too high, the thermoreversible amorphous solid may absorb water resulting in a material that does not create an appropriate consumption experience in use. The inventors have established that if the plasticizer content is too low, the thermoreversible amorphous solid may be brittle and easily broken.

Hence, in certain embodiments the thermoreversible amorphous solid further comprises locust bean gum. Suitably, the thermoreversible amorphous solid in such embodiments comprises from 0.1 wt %-5 wt % locust bean gum wherein the weight is calculated on a dry weight basis; for example, the thermoreversible amorphous solid comprises 0.1 wt %-1.0 wt %, or 1-2 wt %, or 2-5 wt % locust bean gum wherein the weight is calculated on a dry weight basis.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0076">In some embodiments, the thermoreversible amorphous solid comprises a setting agent. Suitably the setting agent is a source of calcium; for example, calcium lactate or calcium citrate. The total amount of the setting agent, such as a calcium source, may be 0.5-5 wt % (calculated on a dry weight basis), for example 1-3 wt % or 2-4 wt %. Suitably, the total amount may be from about 1 wt %, 2.5 wt % or 4 wt % to about 4.8 wt % or 4.5 wt %. The inventors have found that the addition of too little setting agent may result in an thermoreversible amorphous solid which does not stabilize the flavorant and results in the flavor dropping out of the thermoreversible amorphous solid. The inventors have found that the addition of too much setting agent results in a thermoreversibleamorphous solid that is very tacky and consequently has poor handleability.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0077">When the thermoreversible amorphous solid does not contain tobacco, a higher amount of setting agent may need to be applied. In some cases the total amount of setting agent may therefore be from 0.5-12 wt % such as 5-10 wt %, calculated on a dry weight basis. Suitably, the total amount may be from about 5 wt %, 6 wt % or 7 wt % to about 12 wt % or 10 wt %. In this case the thermoreversible amorphous solid will not generally contain any tobacco.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0078">In examples, the setting agent comprises or consists of calcium acetate, calcium formate, calcium carbonate, calcium hydrogencarbonate, calcium chloride, calcium lactate, or a combination thereof. In some examples, the setting agent comprises or consists of calcium formate and/or calcium lactate. In particular examples, the setting agent comprises or consists of calcium formate. The inventors have identified that, typically, employing calcium formate as a setting agent results in a thermoreversible amorphous solid having a greater tensile strength and greater resistance to elongation.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0079">The thermoreversible amorphous solid may comprise a colorant. The addition of a colorant may alter the visual appearance of the thermoreversible amorphous solid. The presence of colorant in the thermoreversible amorphous solid may enhance the visual appearance of the thermoreversible amorphous solid and the aerosol-generating material. By adding a colorant to the thermoreversible amorphous solid, the thermoreversible amorphous solid may be color-matched to other components of the aerosol-generating material or to other components of an article comprising the thermoreversible amorphous solid.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0080">A variety of colorants may be used depending on the desired color of the thermoreversible amorphous solid. The color of thermoreversible amorphous solid may be, for example, white, green, red, purple, blue, brown or black. Other colors are also envisaged. Natural or synthetic colorants, such as natural or synthetic dyes, food-grade colorants and pharmaceutical-grade colorants may be used. In certain embodiments, the colorant is caramel, which may confer the thermoreversible amorphous solid with a brown appearance. In such embodiments, the color of the thermoreversible amorphous solid may be similar to the color of other components (such as tobacco material) in an aerosol-generating material comprising the thermoreversible amorphous solid. In some embodiments, the addition of a colorant to the thermoreversible amorphous solid renders it visually indistinguishable from other components in the aerosol-generating material.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0081">The colorant may be incorporated during the formation of the thermoreversible amorphous solid (e.g. when forming a slurry comprising the materials that form the thermoreversible amorphous solid) or it may be applied to the thermoreversible amorphous solid after its formation (e.g. by spraying it onto the thermoreversible amorphous solid).</p><p id="p-0074" num="0082">In some embodiments, the thermoreversible amorphous solid comprises less than 60 wt % of a filler, such as from 1 wt % to 60 wt %, or 5 wt % to 50 wt %, or 5 wt % to 30 wt %, or 10 wt % to 20 wt %.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0083">In other embodiments, the thermoreversible amorphous solid comprises less than 20 wt %, suitably less than 10 wt % or less than 5 wt % of a filler.

In some such cases the thermoreversible amorphous solid comprises at least 1 wt % of a filler, for example, at least 5 wt %, at least 10 wt %, at least 20 wt % at least 30 wt %, at least 40 wt %, or at least 50 wt % of a filler</p><p id="p-0077" num="0085">The filler, if present, may comprise one or more inorganic filler materials, such as calcium carbonate, perlite, vermiculite, diatomaceous earth, colloidal silica, magnesium oxide, magnesium sulphate, magnesium carbonate, and suitable inorganic sorbents, such as molecular sieves. The filler may comprise one or more organic filler materials such as wood pulp, cellulose and cellulose derivatives (such as methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC)). In particular cases, the thermoreversible amorphous solid comprises no calcium carbonate such as chalk.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0086">In particular embodiments which include filler, the filler is fibrous. For example, the filler may be a fibrous organic filler material such as wood pulp, hemp fiber, cellulose or cellulose derivatives (such as methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC)). Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that including fibrous filler in a thermoreversible amorphous solid may increase the tensile strength of the material. This may be particularly advantageous in examples wherein the thermoreversible amorphous solid is provided as a sheet, such as when a thermoreversible amorphous solid sheet circumscribes a rod of aerosol-generating material.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0087">In some embodiments, the thermoreversible amorphous solid does not comprise tobacco fibers.

The support functions as a support on which an aerosol-generating material layer forms, easing manufacture. The support may provide tensile strength to the aerosol-generating material, easing handling.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0095">In some cases, the support may be formed from materials selected from metal foil, paper, carbon paper, greaseproof paper, ceramic, carbon allotropes such as graphite and graphene, plastic, cardboard, wood or combinations thereof. In some cases, the support may comprise or consist of a tobacco material, such as a sheet of reconstituted tobacco. In some cases, the support may be formed from materials selected from metal foil, paper, cardboard, wood or combinations thereof. In some cases, the support itself be a laminate structure comprising layers of materials selected from the preceding lists. In some cases, the support may also function as a flavorant carrier. For example, the support may be impregnated with a flavorant or with tobacco extract.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0096">In some cases, the support may be non-magnetic.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0097">In some cases, the support may be magnetic. This functionality may be used to fasten the support to a non-combustible aerosol-provision device in use or may be used to generate particular thermoreversible amorphous solid shapes. In some cases, the substrate or aerosol-generating material may comprise one or more magnets which can be used to fasten the substrate or aerosol-generating material to an induction heater in use.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0098">In some cases, the support may be substantially or wholly impermeable to gas and/or aerosol. This prevents aerosol or gas passage through the support, thereby controlling the flow and ensuring it is delivered to the user. This can also be used to prevent condensation or other deposition of the gas/aerosol in use on, for example, the surface of a heater provided in an aerosol-generating assembly. Thus, consumption efficiency and hygiene can be improved in some cases.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0099">In some cases, the surface of the support that abuts the thermoreversible amorphous solid may be porous. For example, in one case, the support comprises paper. The inventors have found that a porous support such as paper is particularly suitable; the porous (e.g. paper) layer abuts the aerosol-generating material layer and forms a strong bond. The aerosol-generating material is formed by drying a thermoreversible amorphous solid and, without being limited by theory, it is thought that the slurry from which the thermoreversible amorphous solid is formed partially impregnates the porous support (e.g. paper) so that when the thermoreversible amorphous solid sets and forms cross-links, the support is partially bound into the thermoreversible amorphous solid. This provides a strong binding between the thermoreversible amorphous solid and the support (and between the dried thermoreversible amorphous solid and the support).</p><p id="p-0092" num="0100">Additionally, surface roughness may contribute to the strength of bond between the aerosol-generating material and the support. The inventors have found that the paper roughness (for the surface abutting the carrier) may suitably be in the range of 50-1000 Bekk seconds, suitably 50-150 Bekk seconds, suitably 100 Bekk seconds (measured over an air pressure interval of 50.66-48.00 kPa). (A Bekk smoothness tester is an instrument used to determine the smoothness of a paper surface, in which air at a specified pressure is leaked between a smooth glass surface and a paper sample, and the time (in seconds) for a fixed volume of air to seep between these surfaces is the &#x201c;Bekk smoothness&#x201d;.)</p><p id="p-0093" num="0101">Conversely, the surface of the support facing away from the aerosol-generating material may be arranged in contact with the heater, and a smoother surface may provide more efficient heat transfer. Thus, in some cases, the support is disposed so as to have a rougher side abutting the aerosol-generating material and a smoother side facing away from the aerosol-generating material.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0102">In one particular case, the support may be a paper-backed foil; the paper layer abuts the aerosol-generating material layer and the properties discussed in the previous paragraphs are afforded by this abutment. The foil backing is substantially impermeable, providing control of the aerosol flow path. A metal foil backing may also serve to conduct heat to the aerosol-generating material.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0103">In another case, the foil layer of the paper-backed foil abuts the aerosol-generating material. The foil is substantially impermeable, thereby preventing water provided in the thermoreversible amorphous solid to be absorbed into the paper which could weaken its structural integrity.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0104">In some cases, the support is formed from or comprises metal foil, such as aluminum foil. A metallic support may allow for better conduction of thermal energy to the thermoreversible amorphous solid. Additionally, or alternatively, a metal foil may function as a susceptor in an induction heating system. In particular embodiments, the support comprises a metal foil layer and a support layer, such as cardboard. In these embodiments, the metal foil layer may have a thickness of less than 20 &#x3bc;m, such as from about 1 &#x3bc;m to about 10 &#x3bc;m, suitably about 5 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0105">In some cases, the support may have a thickness of between about 0.010 mm and about 2.0 mm, suitably from about 0.015 mm, 0.02 mm, 0.05 mm or 0.1 mm to about 1.5 mm, 1.0 mm, or 0.5 mm.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0106">In some cases, the thermoreversible amorphous solid may be formed into a layer or sheet. In such cases, the sheet may have a thickness of about 0.015 mm to about 1.0 mm. Suitably, the thickness may be in the range of about 0.05 mm, 0.1 mm or 0.15 mm to about 0.5 mm or 0.3 mm. The inventors have found that a thermoreversible amorphous solid having a thickness of 0.2 mm is particularly suitable. The thermoreversible amorphous solid may comprise more than one layer, and the thickness described herein refers to the aggregate thickness of those layers.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0107">In some cases, the aerosol-generating material may be formed into a layer or sheet. In such cases, the sheet may have a thickness of about 0.015 mm to about 1.0 mm. Suitably, the thickness may be in the range of about 0.05 mm, 0.1 mm or 0.15 mm to about 0.5 mm or 0.3 mm. The inventors have found that a material having a thickness of 0.2 mm is particularly suitable. The aerosol-generating material may comprise more than one layer, and the thickness described herein refers to the aggregate thickness of those layers.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0108">The inventors have established that if the aerosol-generating material or thermoreversible amorphous solid is too thick, then heating efficiency is compromised. This adversely affects the power consumption in use. Conversely, if the aerosol-generating material or thermoreversible amorphous solid is too thin, it is difficult to manufacture and handle; a very thin material is harder to cast and may be fragile, compromising aerosol formation in use.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0109">The inventors have established that the aerosol-generating material or thermoreversible amorphous solid described herein optimizes the material properties in view of these competing considerations.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0110">The thickness stipulated herein is a mean thickness for the material.

In some embodiments, the aerosol-generating material <b>103</b> described herein may be incorporated in sheet form and in shredded form.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0159">The filter assembly <b>105</b> includes three segments, a cooling segment <b>107</b>, a filter segment <b>109</b> and a mouth end segment <b>111</b>. The consumable <b>101</b> has a first end <b>113</b>, also known as a mouth end or a proximal end and a second end <b>115</b>, also known as a distal end. The body of aerosol-generating material <b>103</b> is located towards the distal end <b>115</b> of the consumable <b>101</b>. In one example, the cooling segment <b>107</b> is located adjacent the body of aerosol-generating material <b>103</b> between the body of aerosol generating material <b>103</b> and the filter segment <b>109</b>, such that the cooling segment <b>107</b> is in an abutting relationship with the aerosol-generating material <b>103</b> and the filter segment <b>109</b>. In other examples, there may be a separation between the body of aerosol-generating material <b>103</b> and the cooling segment <b>107</b> and between the body of aerosol-generating material <b>103</b> and the filter segment <b>109</b>.

The mouth end segment <b>111</b> is located towards the proximal end <b>113</b> of the consumable <b>101</b>, adjacent the filter segment <b>109</b>. In one example, the filter segment <b>109</b> is in an abutting relationship with the mouth end segment <b>111</b>. In one embodiment, the total length of the filter assembly <b>105</b> is between 37 mm and 45 mm, more preferably, the total length of the filter assembly <b>105</b> is 41 mm.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0160">In one example, the rod of aerosol-generating material <b>103</b> is between 34 mm and 50 mm in length, suitably between 38 mm and 46 mm in length, suitably 42 mm in length.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0161">In one example, the total length of the consumable <b>101</b> is between 71 mm and 95 mm, suitably between 79 mm and 87 mm, suitably 83 mm.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0162">An axial end of the body of aerosol-generating material <b>103</b> is visible at the distal end <b>115</b> of the consumable <b>101</b>.

The air gap provides a chamber for heated volatilized components generated from the body of aerosol-generating material <b>103</b> to flow. The cooling segment <b>107</b> is hollow to provide a chamber for aerosol accumulation yet rigid enough to withstand axial compressive forces and bending moments that might arise during manufacture and whilst the consumable <b>101</b> is in use during insertion into the device <b>51</b>. In one example, the thickness of the wall of the cooling segment <b>107</b> is approximately 0.29 mm.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0165">The cooling segment <b>107</b> provides a physical displacement between the aerosol-generating material <b>103</b> and the filter segment <b>109</b>. The physical displacement provided by the cooling segment <b>107</b> will provide a thermal gradient across the length of the cooling segment <b>107</b>. In one example the cooling segment <b>107</b> is configured to provide a temperature differential of at least 40 degrees Celsius between a heated volatilized component entering a first end of the cooling segment <b>107</b> and a heated volatilized component exiting a second end of the cooling segment <b>107</b>. In one example the cooling segment <b>107</b> is configured to provide a temperature differential of at least 60 degrees Celsius between a heated volatilized component entering a first end of the cooling segment <b>107</b> and a heated volatilized component exiting a second end of the cooling segment <b>107</b>. This temperature differential across the length of the cooling element <b>107</b> protects the temperature sensitive filter segment <b>109</b> from the high temperatures of the aerosol-generating material <b>103</b> when it is heated by the device <b>51</b>. If the physical displacement was not provided between the filter segment <b>109</b> and the body of aerosol-generating material <b>103</b> and the heating elements of the device <b>51</b>, then the temperature sensitive filter segment <b>109</b> may become damaged in use, so it would not perform its required functions as effectively.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0166">In one example the length of the cooling segment <b>107</b> is at least 15 mm. In one example, the length of the cooling segment <b>107</b> is between 20 mm and 30 mm, more particularly 23 mm to 27 mm, more particularly 25 mm to 27 mm, suitably 25 mm.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0167">The cooling segment <b>107</b> is made of paper, which means that it is comprised of a material that does not generate compounds of concern, for example, toxic compounds when in use adjacent to the heater of the device <b>51</b>. In one example, the cooling segment <b>107</b> is manufactured from a spirally wound paper tube which provides a hollow internal chamber yet maintains mechanical rigidity. Spirally wound paper tubes are able to meet the tight dimensional accuracy requirements of high-speed manufacturing processes with respect to tube length, outer diameter, roundness and straightness.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0168">In another example, the cooling segment <b>107</b> is a recess created from stiff plug wrap or tipping paper. The stiff plug wrap or tipping paper is manufactured to have a rigidity that is sufficient to withstand the axial compressive forces and bending moments that might arise during manufacture and whilst the consumable <b>101</b> is in use during insertion into the device <b>51</b>.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0169">The filter segment <b>109</b> may be formed of any filter material sufficient to remove one or more volatilized compounds from heated volatilized components from the aerosol-generating material. In one example the filter segment <b>109</b> is made of a mono-acetate material, such as cellulose acetate. The filter segment <b>109</b> provides cooling and irritation-reduction from the heated volatilized components without depleting the quantity of the heated volatilized components to an unsatisfactory level for a user.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0170">In some embodiments, a capsule (not illustrated) may be provided in filter segment <b>109</b>. It may be disposed substantially centrally in the filter segment <b>109</b>, both across the filter segment <b>109</b> diameter and along the filter segment <b>109</b> length. In other cases, it may be offset in one or more dimensions. The capsule may in some cases, where present, contain a volatile component such as a flavorant or aerosol generating agent.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0171">The density of the material of the filter segment <b>109</b> controls the pressure drop across the filter segment <b>109</b>, which in turn controls the draw resistance of the consumable <b>101</b>. Therefore, the selection of the material of the filter segment <b>109</b> is important in controlling the resistance to draw of the consumable <b>101</b>. In addition, the filter segment performs a filtration function in the consumable <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0172">In one example, the filter segment <b>109</b> is made of an 8Y15 grade of filter tow material, which provides a filtration effect on the heated volatilized material, whilst also reducing the size of condensed aerosol droplets which result from the heated volatilized material.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0173">The presence of the filter segment <b>109</b> provides an insulating effect by providing further cooling to the heated volatilized components that exit the cooling segment <b>107</b>. This further cooling effect reduces the contact temperature of the user's lips on the surface of the filter segment <b>109</b>.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0174">In one example, the filter segment <b>109</b> is between 6 mm to 10 mm in length, suitably 8 mm.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0175">The mouth end segment <b>111</b> is an annular tube and is located around and defines an air gap within the mouth end segment <b>111</b>.

The ventilation holes can be made using any suitable technique, for example, one or more of the following techniques: laser technology, mechanical perforation of the cooling segment <b>307</b> or pre-perforation of the cooling segment <b>307</b> before it is formed into the consumable <b>301</b>. The ventilation holes <b>317</b> are positioned so as to provide effective cooling to the consumable <b>301</b>.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0183">In one example, the rows of ventilation holes <b>317</b> are located at least 11 mm from the proximal end <b>313</b> of the consumable, suitably between 17 mm and 20 mm from the proximal end <b>313</b> of the consumable <b>301</b>. The location of the ventilation holes <b>317</b> is positioned such that user does not block the ventilation holes <b>317</b> when the consumable <b>301</b> is in use.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0184">Providing the rows of ventilation holes between 17 mm and 20 mm from the proximal end <b>313</b> of the consumable <b>301</b> enables the ventilation holes <b>317</b> to be located outside of the device <b>51</b>, when the consumable <b>301</b> is fully inserted in the device <b>51</b>, as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>. By locating the ventilation holes outside of the device, non-heated air is able to enter the consumable <b>301</b> through the ventilation holes from outside the device <b>51</b> to aid with the cooling of the consumable <b>301</b>.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0185">The length of the cooling segment <b>307</b> is such that the cooling segment <b>307</b> will be partially inserted into the device <b>51</b>, when the consumable <b>301</b> is fully inserted into the device <b>51</b>. The length of the cooling segment <b>307</b> provides a first function of providing a physical gap between the heater arrangement of the device <b>51</b> and the heat sensitive filter arrangement <b>309</b>, and a second function of enabling the ventilation holes <b>317</b> to be located in the cooling segment, whilst also being located outside of the device <b>51</b>, when the consumable <b>301</b> is fully inserted into the device <b>51</b>. As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>, the majority of the cooling element <b>307</b> is located within the device <b>51</b>. However, there is a portion of the cooling element <b>307</b> that extends out of the device <b>51</b>. It is in this portion of the cooling element <b>307</b> that extends out of the device <b>51</b> in which the ventilation holes <b>317</b> are located.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0186">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> to <b>7</b></figref> in more detail, there is shown an example of a device <b>51</b> arranged to heat aerosol-generating material to volatilize at least one component of said aerosol-generating material, typically to form an aerosol which can be inhaled. The device <b>51</b> is a heating device which releases compounds by heating, but not burning, the aerosol-generating material.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0187">A first end <b>53</b> is sometimes referred to herein as the mouth or proximal end <b>53</b> of the device <b>51</b> and a second end <b>55</b> is sometimes referred to herein as the distal end <b>55</b> of the device <b>51</b>. The device <b>51</b> has an on/off button <b>57</b> to allow the device <b>51</b> as a whole to be switched on and off as desired by a user.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0188">The device <b>51</b> comprises a housing <b>59</b> for locating and protecting various internal components of the device <b>51</b>. In the example shown, the housing <b>59</b> comprises a uni-body sleeve <b>11</b> that encompasses the perimeter of the device <b>51</b>, capped with a top panel <b>17</b> which defines generally the &#x2018;top&#x2019; of the device <b>51</b> and a bottom panel <b>19</b> which defines generally the &#x2018;bottom&#x2019; of the device <b>51</b>. In another example the housing comprises a front panel, a rear panel and a pair of opposite side panels in addition to the top panel <b>17</b> and the bottom panel <b>19</b>.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0189">The top panel <b>17</b> and/or the bottom panel <b>19</b> may be removably fixed to the uni-body sleeve <b>11</b>, to permit easy access to the interior of the device <b>51</b>, or may be &#x201c;permanently&#x201d; fixed to the uni-body sleeve <b>11</b>, for example to deter a user from accessing the interior of the device <b>51</b>. In an example, the panels <b>17</b> and <b>19</b> are made of a plastics material, including for example glass-filled nylon formed by injection molding, and the uni-body sleeve <b>11</b> is made of aluminum, though other materials and other manufacturing processes may be used.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0190">The top panel <b>17</b> of the device <b>51</b> has an opening <b>20</b> at the mouth end <b>53</b> of the device <b>51</b> through which, in use, the consumable <b>101</b>, <b>301</b> including the aerosol-generating material may be inserted into the device <b>51</b> and removed from the device <b>51</b> by a user.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0191">The housing <b>59</b> has located or fixed therein a heater arrangement <b>23</b>, control circuitry <b>25</b> and a power source <b>27</b>. In this example, the heater arrangement <b>23</b>, the control circuitry <b>25</b> and the power source <b>27</b> are laterally adjacent (that is, adjacent when viewed from an end), with the control circuitry <b>25</b> being located generally between the heater arrangement <b>23</b> and the power source <b>27</b>, though other locations are possible.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0192">The control circuitry <b>25</b> may include a controller, such as a microprocessor arrangement, configured and arranged to control the heating of the aerosol-generating material in the consumable <b>101</b>, <b>301</b> as discussed further below.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0193">The power source <b>27</b> may be for example a battery, which may be a rechargeable battery or a non-rechargeable battery. Examples of suitable batteries include for example a lithium-ion battery, a nickel battery (such as a nickel-cadmium battery), an alkaline battery and/or the like. The battery <b>27</b> is electrically coupled to the heater arrangement <b>23</b> to supply electrical power when required and under control of the control circuitry <b>25</b> to heat the aerosol-generating material in the consumable (as discussed, to volatilize the aerosol-generating material without causing the aerosol-generating material to burn).</p><p id="p-0183" num="0194">An advantage of locating the power source <b>27</b> laterally adjacent to the heater arrangement <b>23</b> is that a physically large power source <b>27</b> may be used without causing the device <b>51</b> as a whole to be unduly lengthy. As will be understood, in general a physically large power source <b>27</b> has a higher capacity (that is, the total electrical energy that can be supplied, often measured in Amp-hours or the like) and thus the battery life for the device <b>51</b> can be longer.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0195">In one example, the heater arrangement <b>23</b> is generally in the form of a hollow cylindrical tube, having a hollow interior heating chamber (not shown) into which the consumable <b>101</b>, <b>301</b> comprising the aerosol-generating material is inserted for heating in use. Different arrangements for the heater arrangement <b>23</b> are possible. For example, the heater arrangement <b>23</b> may comprise a single heating element or may be formed of plural heating elements aligned along the longitudinal axis of the heater arrangement <b>23</b>. The or each heating element may be annular or tubular, or at least part-annular or part-tubular around its circumference. In an example, the or each heating element may be a thin film heater. In another example, the or each heating element may be made of a ceramics material. Examples of suitable ceramics materials include alumina and aluminum nitride and silicon nitride ceramics, which may be laminated and sintered. Other heating arrangements are possible, including for example inductive heating, infrared heater elements, which heat by emitting infrared radiation, or resistive heating elements formed by for example a resistive electrical winding.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0196">In one particular example, the heater arrangement <b>23</b> is supported by a stainless-steel support tube and comprises a polyimide heating element. The heater arrangement <b>23</b> is dimensioned so that substantially the whole of the body of aerosol-generating material <b>103</b>, <b>303</b> of the consumable <b>101</b>, <b>301</b> is inserted into the heater arrangement <b>23</b> when the consumable <b>101</b>, <b>301</b> is inserted into the device <b>51</b>.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0197">The or each heating element may be arranged so that selected zones of the aerosol-generating material can be independently heated, for example in turn (over time, as discussed above) or together (simultaneously) as desired.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0198">The heater arrangement <b>23</b> in this example is surrounded along at least part of its length by a thermal insulator <b>31</b>. The thermal insulator <b>31</b> helps to reduce heat passing from the heater arrangement <b>23</b> to the exterior of the device <b>51</b>. This helps to keep down the power requirements for the heater arrangement <b>23</b> as it reduces heat losses generally. The thermal insulator <b>31</b> also helps to keep the exterior of the device <b>51</b> cool during operation of the heater arrangement <b>23</b>. In one example, the thermal insulator <b>31</b> may be a double-walled sleeve which provides a low pressure region between the two walls of the sleeve. That is, the thermal insulator <b>31</b> may be for example a &#x201c;vacuum&#x201d; tube, i.e. a tube that has been at least partially evacuated so as to minimize heat transfer by conduction and/or convection. Other arrangements for the thermal insulator <b>31</b> are possible, including using heat insulating materials, including for example a suitable foam-type material, in addition to or instead of a double-walled sleeve.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0199">The housing <b>59</b> may further comprises various internal support structures <b>37</b> for supporting all internal components, as well as the heating arrangement <b>23</b>.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0200">The device <b>51</b> further comprises a collar <b>33</b> which extends around and projects from the opening <b>20</b> into the interior of the housing <b>59</b> and a generally tubular chamber <b>35</b> which is located between the collar <b>33</b> and one end of the thermal insulator <b>31</b>. The chamber <b>35</b> further comprises a cooling structure <b>35</b><i>f</i>, which in this example, comprises a plurality of cooling fins <b>35</b><i>f </i>spaced apart along the outer surface of the chamber <b>35</b>, and each arranged circumferentially around outer surface of the chamber <b>35</b>. There is an air gap <b>36</b> between the hollow chamber <b>35</b> and the consumable <b>101</b>, <b>301</b> when it is inserted in the device <b>51</b> over at least part of the length of the hollow chamber <b>35</b>. The air gap <b>36</b> is around all of the circumference of the consumable <b>101</b>, <b>301</b> over at least part of the cooling segment <b>307</b>.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0201">The collar <b>33</b> comprises a plurality of ridges <b>60</b> arranged circumferentially around the periphery of the opening <b>20</b> and which project into the opening <b>20</b>. The ridges <b>60</b> take up space within the opening <b>20</b> such that the open span of the opening <b>20</b> at the locations of the ridges <b>60</b> is less than the open span of the opening <b>20</b> at the locations without the ridges <b>60</b>. The ridges <b>60</b> are configured to engage with a consumable <b>101</b>, <b>301</b> inserted into the device to assist in securing it within the device <b>51</b>. Open spaces (not shown) defined by adjacent pairs of ridges <b>60</b> and the consumable <b>101</b>, <b>301</b> form ventilation paths around the exterior of the consumable <b>101</b>, <b>301</b>. These ventilation paths allow hot vapors that have escaped from the consumable <b>101</b>, <b>301</b> to exit the device <b>51</b> and allow cooling air to flow into the device <b>51</b> around the consumable <b>101</b>, <b>301</b> in the air gap <b>36</b>.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0202">In operation, the consumable <b>101</b>, <b>301</b> is removably inserted into an opening <b>20</b> of the device <b>51</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> to <b>7</b></figref>.
