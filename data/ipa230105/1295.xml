When the deck creation tab <b>34</b> is tapped by the player, the deck formation screen shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref> is displayed on the display <b>26</b>, which makes it possible to newly form a deck.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">In the deck formation screen, a plurality of blank fields are displayed in an upper row, and cards possessed by the player (hereinafter referred to as possessed cards) are displayed in a lower row. Furthermore, in the deck formation screen, when a possessed card displayed in the lower row is slid to the upper row, the slid possessed card is disposed in a blank field in the upper row, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>. The possessed card disposed in the upper row in the deck formation screen, as described above, enters a tentatively registered state. Furthermore, when a save tab <b>35</b> labelled as &#x201c;Save&#x201d; and provided in the deck formation screen is tapped, deck information is stored. As the deck information, a deck ID is assigned, and card set information that makes it possible to identify all the tentatively registered possessed cards is stored in association with the deck ID. Note that, although not shown, when the save tab <b>35</b> is tapped, a screen for editing the deck name is displayed, and the editing of the deck name is finished, the deck name as well as an icon displayed in the deck selection screen, etc. are stored in association with the deck ID together with the card set information.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Furthermore, the deck formation screen is also displayed in the case where an icon is tapped in the deck selection screen shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>. In this case, however, the cards constituting the deck selected in the deck selection screen are displayed in the upper row, and the possessed cards are displayed in the lower row. In this case, it is possible, through player operations, to change cards displayed in the upper row with possessed cards displayed in the lower row.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Note that, in the card battle game, a specified number of cards (e.g., 40 cards) are used. Therefore, in the deck formation screen, usually, the save tab <b>35</b> is tapped after the specified number of possessed cards are tentatively registered through player operations, whereby deck information including card set information of the specified number of cards is stored. Note that although it is possible to save deck information even in the case where the number of tentatively registered cards is less than the specified number of cards and in the case where the number of tentatively registered cards is greater than the specified number of cards, it is not possible to use the deck information in the card battle game.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">When the card-list generation tab <b>33</b><i>b </i>is tapped in the card setting screen, the card list screen shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> is displayed on the display <b>26</b>.

Furthermore, similarly for the opponent, cards that serve as the opponent's hand are distributed at random from a deck selected by the opponent. Furthermore, in the card battle game, player's turns and opponent's turns are repeated alternately. In each turn, a card selected at random from the deck is added to the hand. In his or her own turn, according to prescribed rules, the player selects a follower card or an amulet card, which will be described later, from cards disposed in his or her own hand area <b>45</b><i>a </i>and places the card into the field <b>46</b><i>a</i>, or invokes a prescribed effect by using a spell card. In the following, placing a follower card or an amulet card disposed in the hand area <b>45</b><i>a </i>or <b>45</b><i>b </i>into the field <b>46</b><i>a </i>or <b>46</b><i>b </i>or invoking a prescribed effect by using a spell card disposed in the hand area <b>45</b><i>a </i>or <b>45</b><i>b</i>, i.e., moving a card disposed into the hand area <b>45</b><i>a </i>or <b>45</b><i>b </i>into another area, will be referred to as &#x201c;playing&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">In the card battle game, the player's leader <b>41</b><i>a </i>and the opponent's leader <b>41</b><i>b </i>respectively have the physical energy <b>42</b><i>a </i>and the physical energy <b>42</b><i>b </i>set therefor, and the player who has first decreased the physical energy <b>42</b><i>a </i>or <b>42</b><i>b </i>of the opponent in the battle through attacks using cards or the like wins the battle.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> is an illustration for explaining an example follower card. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> is an illustration for explaining an example spell card. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C</figref> is an illustration for explaining an example amulet card. Next, details of cards used in the card battle game in this embodiment will be described. The cards used in the card battle game in this embodiment are each classified into one of the following card types: a follower card, a spell card, and an amulet card.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A to <b>6</b>C</figref>, irrespective of the card type, each card has set therefor a name <b>51</b>, a class <b>52</b>, a type <b>53</b>, and a cost <b>54</b>. The name <b>51</b> is set uniquely for each card. As the class <b>52</b>, a plurality of kinds of classes are provided, and each card is classified into one of those classes. As the type <b>53</b>, a plurality of kinds of types are provided, and each card is classified into one of those types or is not classified into any of those types. The cost <b>54</b> indicates play points needed for playing, and it becomes possible to play the card by consuming play points corresponding to the cost.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">The follower card shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> is a card with which it is possible to attack the opponent's leader <b>41</b><i>b </i>and follower cards disposed in the opponent's field <b>46</b><i>b </i>in the card battle game. Each follower card has set therefor a name <b>51</b>, a class <b>52</b>, a type <b>53</b>, a cost <b>54</b>, skills <b>55</b>, an attacking ability <b>56</b>, and physical energy <b>57</b>. The attacking ability <b>56</b> indicates the amount of damage that is given to the opponent's leader <b>41</b><i>b </i>or a follower card disposed in the opponent's field <b>46</b><i>b</i>, serving as the target of attack, when an attack is performed with the follower card. The physical energy <b>57</b> decreases by the amount of damage received when the follower card is damaged, and the follower card is destroyed when the physical energy <b>57</b> has become zero. The destroyed card is no longer displayed in the field <b>46</b><i>a </i>and is sent to a graveyard, which is not shown. Note, however, that as a state in which a card becomes no longer displayed in the field <b>46</b><i>b</i>, there is also a state of vanishing, in which the card is not sent to a graveyard, as opposed to destruction.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">Furthermore, it is possible to evolve a follower card by consuming the evolution points <b>43</b><i>a </i>or <b>43</b><i>b</i>. For the evolved follower card, the attacking ability <b>56</b> and the physical energy <b>57</b> are increased, or a prescribed skill <b>55</b> is added. That is, when a follower card is evolved, the ability (the skills <b>55</b>, the attacking ability <b>56</b>, and the physical energy <b>57</b>) of the card is enhanced.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">The spell card shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> has set therefor a name <b>51</b>, a class <b>52</b>, a type <b>53</b>, a cost <b>54</b>, and skills <b>55</b>. When the spell card is played, the skills <b>55</b> (effects) are invoked, and the spell card is destroyed. That is, the spell card is a card that cannot be placed into the field <b>46</b><i>a </i>or <b>46</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">The amulet card shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C</figref> has set therefor a name <b>51</b>, a class <b>52</b>, a type <b>53</b>, a cost <b>54</b>, and skills <b>55</b>. The amulet card is a card that stays in the field <b>46</b><i>a </i>and whose skills <b>55</b> are invoked when it is played.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a figure for explaining example skills <b>55</b>. Note that the skills <b>55</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> are examples, and other skills <b>55</b> may be provided, or some of the skills <b>55</b> may be omitted. Furthermore, although player's cards are assumed in the description here, the same applies to opponent's cards.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, as the skills <b>55</b>, fanfare, last_words, protection, rush, dash, killer, drain, direct_summon, when_evolved, fusion, etc. are provided. Fanfare is a skill with which the effect specified after &#x201c;Fanfare&#x201d; is invoked when a card is placed (a card is played) from the hand area <b>45</b><i>a </i>into the field <b>46</b><i>a</i>. For example, with the example of the follower card shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>, in the case where the follower card is placed in the field <b>46</b><i>a</i>, the effect &#x201c;draw one card&#x201d; is invoked, one card is determined through a lottery from the cards disposed in the deck area <b>44</b><i>a</i>, and the determined card is placed in the hand area <b>45</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">Last_words is a skill with which the effect specified after &#x201c;Last_words&#x201d; is invoked when the card is destroyed. Protection is a skill with which, in the case where a card for which protection is set is placed in the field <b>46</b><i>a</i>, the opponent is prohibited from attacking cards other than the card for which protection is set. Rush is a skill with which, in the turn in which the card is placed into the field <b>46</b><i>a</i>, it is possible to attack the follower cards of the opponent. Dash is a skill with which, in the turn in which the card is placed in the field <b>46</b><i>a</i>, it is possible to attack the follower cards and the leader <b>41</b><i>b </i>of the opponent. Killer is a skill with which, in the case where damage is given to a follower card of the opponent by performing an attack, it is possible to destroy the follower card of the opponent regardless of the physical energy of the follower card of the opponent. Drain is a skill with which, in the case where damage is given to a follower card or the leader <b>41</b><i>b </i>of the opponent in a player's turn, the physical energy <b>42</b><i>a </i>of the player's leader <b>41</b><i>a </i>is recovered by an amount corresponding to the given damage. Direct_summon is a skill with which a card is placed directly from the deck area <b>44</b><i>a </i>into the field <b>46</b><i>a </i>in the case where a preset condition is satisfied. When_evolved is a skill with which the effect specified after &#x201c;When_evolved&#x201d; is invoked when a follower card is evolved. Fusion is a skill conferred to a base card (base medium) that serves as a base of fusion, as will be described later in detail. Fusion is a skill with which a card disposed in the hand area <b>45</b><i>a </i>and satisfying a preset condition is fused as a material card (material medium), thereby enhancing (changing the ability of) that card. Note that there are cases where one card has a plurality of skills <b>55</b> set therefor in a multiplexed manner, and there are also cases where one card has no skills <b>55</b> set therefor.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">Furthermore, in this embodiment, a deck is formed by combining follower cards, spell cards, and amulet cards, and the card battle game is played by using the deck formed.

Note that deck information is also transmitted from the player terminal <b>1</b> of the opponent to the server <b>100</b>. The server <b>100</b> randomly determines who plays first and who plays second, and randomly assigns indices (e.g., numbers 1 to 40) to all the cards represented by the deck information. Furthermore, the server <b>100</b> determines three initial candidate cards as well as three change candidate cards from the cards represented by the deck information.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">Then, the server <b>100</b> transmits the following information to the player terminal <b>1</b>: play order information indicating who plays first and who plays second; index information representing the indices of player's cards; and change information representing the initial cards and change candidate cards. At the player terminal <b>1</b>, at the start of the card battle game, on the basis of the play order information, whether the player plays first or second is displayed on the display <b>26</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>. Then, at the player terminal <b>1</b>, on the basis of the change information, the three initial candidate cards are disposed in an initial card display area <b>60</b>, and a change display area <b>61</b> for disposing cards to be changed is displayed on the display <b>26</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">In the case where there is any card that the player wishes to change among the initial candidate cards, the player moves the card to be changed into the change display area <b>61</b> by performing a slide operation, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>C</figref>. Then, when an OK button <b>62</b> is tapped by the player, the card moved to the change display area <b>61</b> is returned to the deck area <b>44</b><i>a</i>, the unchanged initial candidate cards as well as the number of change candidate cards corresponding to the number of changed initial candidate cards are determined as initial cards, and initial card information representing the determined initial cards is transmitted to the server <b>100</b>. Note that the server <b>100</b> also receives initial card information from the player terminal <b>1</b> of the opponent. Upon receiving initial card information from both player terminals, the server <b>100</b> transmits, to the player terminal <b>1</b> of the player, number-of-cards information representing only the number of cards included in the initial card information of the opponent. Similarly, upon receiving initial card information from both player terminals, the server <b>100</b> transmits, to the player terminal <b>1</b> of the opponent, number-of-cards information representing only the number of cards included in the initial card information of the player.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">Upon receiving the number-of-cards information, the player terminal <b>1</b> displays a battle screen on the display <b>26</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>. At this time, the determined initial cards are disposed in the hand area <b>45</b><i>a </i>in an identifiable manner, and three cards are disposed in the hand area <b>45</b><i>b </i>in an unidentifiable manner on the basis of the received number-of-cards information of the opponent.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">Then, in the case where the player plays first, the player terminal <b>1</b> displays an image labelled as &#x201c;YOUR TURN&#x201d; on the display <b>26</b>, indicating a player's turn, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>, and then determines one index of a card present in the deck area <b>44</b><i>a </i>through a lottery. That is, here, a card present in the deck area <b>44</b><i>a </i>is picked up through a lottery. Then, the player terminal <b>1</b> disposes the card determined through the lottery in the hand area <b>45</b><i>a</i>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref>, and transmits the card information to the server <b>100</b>. Furthermore, the player terminal <b>1</b> adds one to the play points, and updates and displays the play-points displaying part <b>48</b><i>a </i>(here, sets the play points to one).</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">Then, in the case where, for example, the player places a follower card with a cost of one into the field <b>46</b><i>a </i>by performing a slide operation from among the cards disposed in the hand area <b>45</b><i>a</i>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref>, the play points are decreased by one, and the play-points displaying part <b>48</b><i>a </i>is updated and displayed. Here, in the case where the follower card placed into the field <b>46</b><i>a </i>has a skill <b>55</b> and the invocation condition is satisfied, the skill <b>55</b> whose invocation condition is satisfied is invoked. Furthermore, the player terminal <b>1</b> transmits card information representing the card placed into the field <b>46</b><i>a </i>to the server <b>100</b>. Upon receiving the card information, the server <b>100</b> transmits the received card information to the player terminal <b>1</b> of the opponent. Accordingly, at the player terminal <b>1</b> of the opponent, the card represented by the card information is placed into the field <b>46</b><i>b </i>of the opponent, and the play-points displaying part <b>48</b><i>b </i>of the opponent is updated and displayed.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">Then, when the turn end button <b>47</b> is tapped by the player, the player terminal <b>1</b> transmits turn end information indicating the end of the turn to the server <b>100</b>. Note that, at the player terminal <b>1</b>, in the case where a card whose skills <b>55</b> are invoked on condition of the end of a turn is placed in the field <b>46</b><i>a </i>or <b>46</b><i>b</i>, the skills <b>55</b> of the card are invoked. Upon receiving the turn end information, the server <b>100</b> transmits turn start information for starting an opponent's turn after the end of the player's turn to the player terminal <b>1</b> of the opponent, thereby causing the player terminal <b>1</b> of the opponent to start a turn.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">Then, at the player terminal <b>1</b> of the player, an image labelled as &#x201c;ENEMY TURN&#x201d;, indicating an opponent's turn, is displayed on the display <b>26</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref>. Then, card information representing a card determined through a lottery at the player terminal <b>1</b> of the opponent is transmitted to the server <b>100</b>. Upon receiving the number-of-cards information from the server <b>100</b>, at the player terminal <b>1</b>, the card is disposed in the hand area <b>45</b><i>b </i>in an unidentifiable manner on the basis of the number-of-cards information, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>C</figref>. Note that, at the end of a turn, usually, one card is determined through a lottery; however, only in the first turn for the player who plays second, two cards are determined through lotteries. Furthermore, at the player terminal <b>1</b>, the play points of the opponent are increased by one, and the play-points displaying part <b>48</b><i>b </i>is updated and displayed.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">Then, when the opponent finishes the turn without playing any card in the hand area <b>45</b><i>b</i>, upon receiving turn start information from the server <b>100</b>, the player terminal <b>1</b> displays an image labelled as &#x201c;YOUR TURN&#x201d; on the display <b>26</b>, indicating a player's turn, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>, and determines an index of a card present in the deck area <b>44</b><i>a </i>through a lottery. Then, the card determined through the lottery is disposed in the hand area <b>45</b><i>a</i>, and card information of the determined card is transmitted to the server <b>100</b>. Furthermore, the player terminal <b>1</b> adds one to the play points, and updates and displays the play-points displaying part <b>48</b><i>a </i>(here, sets the play points to two).</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">Furthermore, when the player slides and moves a follower card disposed in the field <b>46</b><i>a </i>to the opponent's leader <b>41</b><i>b</i>, it is determined that the opponent's leader <b>41</b><i>b </i>has been attacked with the follower card, and the physical energy <b>42</b><i>b </i>of the opponent's leader <b>41</b><i>b </i>is decreased by the attacking ability <b>56</b> of the follower card (damage is given). Furthermore, at the player terminal <b>1</b>, attack information representing the follower card used for the attack and the follower card or the leader <b>41</b><i>b </i>that has been attacked is transmitted to the server <b>100</b>. Upon receiving the attack information, the server <b>100</b> transmits the attack information to the player terminal <b>1</b> of the opponent.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">As described above, player's turns and opponent's turns are repeated alternately, and each time the player or the opponent plays a card or performs an attack, information representing the play or attack is transmitted to the server <b>100</b>, whereby the card battle game proceeds. Furthermore, the outcome is determined when the physical energy <b>42</b><i>a </i>of the player's leader <b>41</b><i>a </i>or the physical energy <b>42</b><i>b </i>of the opponent's leader <b>41</b><i>b </i>becomes zero, and the card battle game is finished.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">Next, the evolution of a follower card will be described. In the card battle game in this embodiment, in the fifth and subsequent turns of the player who plays first and in the fourth and subsequent turns of the player who plays second, it is possible to evolve a follower card by consuming the evolution points <b>43</b><i>a </i>or <b>43</b><i>b</i>. Note that, as the evolution points <b>43</b><i>a </i>or <b>43</b><i>b</i>, two points are assigned in the case of the player who plays first, and three points are assigned in the case of the player who plays second.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref> is a first illustration for explaining an example battle screen at the time of evolution. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>B</figref> is a second illustration for explaining an example battle screen at the time of evolution.

At this time, when the follower card disposed in the field <b>46</b><i>a </i>is tapped, a card detail tab <b>63</b> is displayed on the display <b>26</b>. In the card detail tab <b>63</b>, the skills <b>55</b> of the tapped card are displayed, and an evolution button <b>63</b><i>a </i>is also displayed. Note that the evolution button <b>63</b><i>a </i>is displayed only in the card detail tab <b>63</b> of a follower card, and no evolution button <b>63</b><i>a </i>is displayed in the card detail tab <b>63</b> of a spell card or an amulet card.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">The evolution button <b>63</b><i>a </i>functions as an operating part for accepting tapping by the player in the case where evolution is possible. When the evolution button <b>63</b><i>a </i>is tapped in the case where evolution is possible, the evolution points <b>43</b><i>a </i>are decreased and displayed, and the follower card is evolved and displayed, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>B</figref>. At this time, the attacking ability <b>56</b> and the physical energy <b>57</b> of the evolved follower card increase, and in the case of a follower card having when_evolved as a skill <b>55</b>, the ability is invoked. Furthermore, at the player terminal <b>1</b>, evolution information representing the evolved follower card is transmitted to the server <b>100</b>. Upon receiving the evolution information, the server <b>100</b> transmits the evolution information to the player terminal <b>1</b> of the opponent.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">Next, fusion will be described. With fusion as a skill <b>55</b>, a card having fusion set therefor as a skill <b>55</b> among the cards disposed in the hand area <b>45</b><i>a </i>serves as a base card, and the base card is enhanced by fusing, as a material card, a card disposed in the hand area <b>45</b><i>a </i>and satisfying a preset condition.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>A</figref> is a first illustration for explaining an example battle screen at the time of fusion. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>B</figref> is a second illustration for explaining an example battle screen at the time of fusion. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>C</figref> is a third illustration for explaining an example battle screen at the time of fusion. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref> is a fourth illustration for explaining an example battle screen at the time of fusion. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>B</figref> is a fifth illustration for explaining an example battle screen at the time of fusion.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">Suppose, for example, that there is a card having fusion set therefor as a skill <b>55</b> among the cards disposed in the hand area <b>45</b><i>a</i>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>A</figref>. At this time, when the card having fusion set therefor as a skill <b>55</b> is tapped, a card detail tab <b>63</b> is displayed on the display <b>26</b>.

As opposed to the other abilities (attacking ability, defensive ability, skills <b>55</b> other than fusion, etc.) that are referred to when a card is disposed in the field <b>46</b><i>a </i>or <b>46</b><i>b</i>, fusion is a skill (ability) that is referred to when a card is disposed in the hand area <b>45</b><i>a</i>. For example, as dictated in example 1 in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, fusion confers the following effects as a fanfare: X damage points (X is the number of cards fused) is given to a follower card placed in the opponent's field <b>46</b><i>b</i>; X cards of the machine type or the nature type are randomly added from the deck in the deck area <b>44</b><i>a </i>to the hand; and if cards of the machine type or the nature type have been fused, the costs of those cards are decreased by three.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">Furthermore, as dictated in example 2 in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, fusion confers the following effects as a fanfare: a card is changed to a card &#x201c;XXX&#x201d; when a follower card is fused; a card is changed to a card &#x201c;YYY&#x201d; when a spell card is fused; and a card is changed to a card &#x201c;ZZZ&#x201d; when an amulet card is fused.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">Furthermore, as dictated in example 3 in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, fusion confers, as a fanfare, the effect of adding X to the attacking ability <b>56</b> and adding X to the physical energy <b>57</b> of a follower card in the hand (X is the number of cards fused).</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">Furthermore, as dictated in example 4 in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, fusion confers, as a fanfare, the effect of recovering the physical energy <b>42</b><i>a </i>of the player's leader <b>41</b><i>a </i>by X (X is the number of cards fused).</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">Furthermore, as dictated in example 5 in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, fusion confers, as a fanfare, the effect of giving X damage points (X is the number of cards fused) to the opponent's leader <b>41</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">Furthermore, as dictated in example 6 in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, fusion confers the following effects as a fanfare: a card with the card name &#x201c;DDD&#x201d; is placed into the field <b>46</b><i>a</i>; another card with the card name &#x201c;EEE&#x201d; is placed into the field <b>46</b><i>a </i>when two or more cards have been fused; and another card with the card name &#x201c;FFF&#x201d; is placed into the field <b>46</b><i>a </i>when five or more cards have been fused.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">As described above, in the information processing system S, in a card battle game, a card disposed in the hand area <b>45</b><i>a </i>is used as a base card, and a card disposed in an area other than the field <b>46</b><i>a </i>(the hand area <b>45</b><i>a</i>) is fused with the base card as a material card, whereby the ability of the base card is enhanced. Thus, various strategies are conceivable, such as whether to enhance the ability of a base card at the cost of losing a material card disposed in the hand area <b>45</b><i>a </i>or just playing cards without performing fusion. This serves to enhance strategic intricacy in the card battle game.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">Furthermore, although cards disposed in the hand area <b>45</b><i>a </i>are usually disposed in a manner unidentifiable for the opponent of the battle, by performing fusion, the base card and the material card are identified by the opponent of the battle.
