If the same electronic main piston valve is placed into a larger diameter cylinder, then the new column of oil size would also be larger. However, the original electronic main piston valve would not be able to move through any more oil than it previously could (in the original smaller diameter cylinder body). Therefore, the ability of the electronic main piston valve to move through the new larger diameter column of oil will be inhibited. This will result in a reduced range and reduced operational characteristics.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In one embodiment, a boost valve is used to increase the overall flow of the system to allow the electronic main piston valve to be used in a larger diameter cylinder. Moreover, the boost valve will change a flow through the electronic main piston valving by adding a second parallel path. In general, the electronic main piston valving with the added boost valve configuration will allow the now boosted electronic main piston valve to be installed into a larger diameter cylinder <b>120</b> and provide a large damping force range even with the lower flow rate. In one embodiment, the boost valve amplifies the damping force on the compression side of the damper. Moreover, the boost valve can be added to almost any electronic main piston valve when the original body size of the electronic main piston valve (e.g., the diameter of the valve body) is too small for the larger diameter cylinder <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The following discussion will begin with a general description of a vehicle suspension damper, including the boost valve, in accordance with an embodiment. (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). The discussion continues with a detailed description of the boost valve, in accordance with an embodiment. (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>5</b></figref>)</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Further, in the following discussion, the term &#x201c;active&#x201d;, as used when referring to a valve or damping component, means adjustable, manipulatable, etc., during typical operation of the valve. For example, an active valve can have its operation changed to thereby alter a corresponding damping characteristic from a &#x201c;soft&#x201d; damping setting to a &#x201c;firm&#x201d; damping setting by, for example, adjusting a switch in a passenger compartment of a vehicle. Additionally, it will be understood that in some embodiments, an active valve may also be configured to automatically adjust its operation, and corresponding damping characteristics, based upon, for example, operational information pertaining to the vehicle and/or the suspension with which the valve is used. Similarly, it will be understood that in some embodiments, an active valve may be configured to automatically adjust its operation, and corresponding damping characteristics, to provide damping based upon received user input settings (e.g., a user-selected &#x201c;comfort&#x201d; setting, a user-selected &#x201c;sport&#x201d; setting, and the like). Additionally, in many instances, an &#x201c;active&#x201d; valve is adjusted or manipulated electronically (e.g., using a powered solenoid, or the like) to alter the operation or characteristics of a valve and/or other component. As a result, in the field of suspension components and valves, the terms &#x201c;active&#x201d;, &#x201c;electronic&#x201d;, &#x201c;electronically controlled&#x201d;, and the like, are often used interchangeably.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the following discussion, the term &#x201c;manual&#x201d; as used when referring to a valve or damping component means manually adjustable, physically manipulatable, etc., without requiring disassembly of the valve, damping component, or suspension damper which includes the valve or damping component. In some instances, the manual adjustment or physical manipulation of the valve, damping component, or suspension damper, which includes the valve or damping component, occurs when the valve is in use. For example, a manual valve may be adjusted to change its operation to alter a corresponding damping characteristic from a &#x201c;soft&#x201d; damping setting to a &#x201c;firm&#x201d; damping setting by, for example, manually rotating a knob, pushing or pulling a lever, physically manipulating an air pressure control feature, manually operating a cable assembly, physically engaging a hydraulic unit, and the like. For purposes of the present discussion, such instances of manual adjustment/physical manipulation of the valve or component can occur before, during, and/or after &#x201c;typical operation of the vehicle&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">It should further be understood that a vehicle suspension may also be referred to using one or more of the terms &#x201c;passive&#x201d;, &#x201c;active&#x201d;, &#x201c;semi-active&#x201d; or &#x201c;adaptive&#x201d;. As is typically used in the suspension art, the term &#x201c;active suspension&#x201d; refers to a vehicle suspension which controls the vertical movement of the wheels relative to vehicle. Moreover, &#x201c;active suspensions&#x201d; are conventionally defined as either a &#x201c;pure active suspension&#x201d; or a &#x201c;semi-active suspension&#x201d; (a &#x201c;semi-active suspension&#x201d; is also sometimes referred to as an &#x201c;adaptive suspension&#x201d;). In a conventional &#x201c;pure active suspension&#x201d;, a motive source such as, for example, an actuator, is used to move (e.g. raise or lower) a wheel with respect to the vehicle. In a &#x201c;semi-active suspension&#x201d;, no motive force/actuator is employed to adjust move (e.g. raise or lower) a wheel with respect to the vehicle. Rather, in a &#x201c;semi-active suspension&#x201d;, the characteristics of the suspension (e.g. the firmness of the suspension) are altered during typical use to accommodate conditions of the terrain and/or the vehicle. Additionally, the term &#x201c;passive suspension&#x201d;, refers to a vehicle suspension in which the characteristics of the suspension are not changeable during typical use, and no motive force/actuator is employed to adjust move (e.g. raise or lower) a wheel with respect to the vehicle. As such, it will be understood that an &#x201c;active valve&#x201d;, as defined above, is well suited for use in a &#x201c;pure active suspension&#x201d; or a &#x201c;semi-active suspension&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;down&#x201d;, &#x201c;up&#x201d;, &#x201c;down-ward&#x201d;, &#x201c;upward&#x201d;, &#x201c;lower&#x201d;, &#x201c;upper&#x201d; and other direction references are relative and are used for reference only.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a perspective view of a vehicle suspension damper <b>100</b> with a boost valve <b>225</b>, in accordance with an embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is a side-sectional view of the vehicle suspension damper <b>100</b> with a boost valve <b>225</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Vehicle suspension damper <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, includes a cylinder <b>120</b> having an interior <b>124</b>, a first end <b>132</b>, a second end <b>106</b> and defining an axis <b>136</b>.

In one embodiment, each of the front damper absorbers may be electrically connected with a linear switch (such as that which operates an automotive brake light) that is activated in conjunction with the vehicle brake. When the brake is moved beyond a certain distance, corresponding usually to harder braking and hence potential for vehicle nosedive, the electric switch connects a power supply to a motive force generator for electronic valve <b>235</b> in the front dampers causes electronic valve <b>235</b> to automatically close or partially the fluid paths <b>256</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In so doing, the closing of the electronic valve <b>235</b> fluid paths will increase the stiffness of that damper.

Adjusting the size of flow path <b>256</b> modifies the flowrate of the fluid between the compression side <b>104</b> of the cylinder <b>120</b> and the rebound side <b>134</b>, thereby varying the stiffness of a corresponding vehicle suspension damper <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">As discussed, a remotely-operable electronic valve <b>235</b> like the one described above is particularly useful with an on-/off-road vehicle. These vehicles can have more than 20&#x2033; of damper absorber travel to permit them to negotiate rough, uneven terrain at speed with usable damper absorbing function. In off-road applications, compliant dampening is necessary as the vehicle relies on its long travel suspension when encountering often large off-road obstacles. Operating a vehicle with very compliant, long travel suspension on a smooth road at road speeds can be problematic due to the springiness/sponginess of the suspension and corresponding vehicle handling problems associated with that (e.g. turning roll, braking pitch). Such compliance can cause reduced handling characteristics and even loss of control. Such control issues can be pronounced when cornering at high speed as a compliant, long travel vehicle may tend to roll excessively. Similarly, such a vehicle may include excessive pitch and yaw during braking and/or acceleration. With the remotely-operated electronic valve <b>235</b>, the working size of flow path <b>256</b> is automatically adjusted thereby modifying the communication of fluid between the compression side <b>104</b> of the cylinder <b>120</b> and the rebound side <b>134</b>. Correspondingly, the dampening characteristics of vehicle suspension damper <b>100</b> can be changed.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In addition to, or in lieu of, the simple, switch-operated remote arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, electronic valve <b>235</b> can be operated automatically based upon one or more driving conditions. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a schematic diagram of a control system <b>500</b> based upon any or all of vehicle speed, damper rod speed, and damper rod position. One embodiment of the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is designed to automatically increase dampening in a damper absorber in the event a damper rod reaches a certain velocity in its travel towards the bottom end of a damper at a predetermined speed of the vehicle. In one embodiment, the control system <b>500</b> adds dampening (and control) in the event of rapid operation (e.g. high rod velocity) of the vehicle suspension damper <b>100</b> to avoid a bottoming out of the damper rod as well as a loss of control that can accompany rapid compression of a damper absorber with a relative long amount of travel. In one embodiment, the control system <b>500</b> adds dampening (e.g., adjusts the size of the opening of flow path <b>256</b> by causing electronic valve <b>235</b> to close, open, partially close, or partially open flow path <b>256</b>) in the event that the rod velocity in compression is relatively low but the rod progresses past a certain point in the travel.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Such configuration aids in stabilizing the vehicle against excessive low-rate suspension movement events such as cornering roll, braking and acceleration yaw and pitch and &#x201c;g-out.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates, for example, a control system <b>500</b> including three variables: wheel speed, corresponding to the speed of a vehicle component (measured by wheel speed transducer <b>504</b>), piston rod position (measured by piston rod position transducer <b>506</b>), and piston rod velocity (measured by piston rod velocity transducer <b>508</b>). Any or all of the variables shown may be considered by logic unit <b>502</b> in controlling the solenoids or other motive sources coupled to electronic valve <b>235</b> for changing the working size of the opening of flow path <b>256</b> by causing electronic valve <b>235</b> to close, open, partially close, or partially open flow path <b>256</b>. Any other suitable vehicle operation variable may be used in addition to or in lieu of the variables <b>504</b>, <b>506</b>, and <b>508</b> such as, for example, piston rod compression strain, eyelet strain, vehicle mounted accelerometer (or tilt/inclinometer) data or any other suitable vehicle or component performance data.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In one embodiment, the piston's position within the damping chamber is determined using an accelerometer to sense modal resonance of the suspension damper. Such resonance will change depending on the position of the piston and an on-board processor (computer) is calibrated to correlate resonance with axial position. In one embodiment, a suitable proximity sensor or linear coil transducer or other electro-magnetic transducer is incorporated in the damping chamber to provide a sensor to monitor the position and/or speed of the piston (and suitable magnetic tag) with respect to a housing of the suspension damper.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In one embodiment, the magnetic transducer includes a waveguide and a magnet, such as a doughnut (toroidal) magnet that is joined to the cylinder and oriented such that the magnetic field generated by the magnet passes through the rod and the waveguide. Electric pulses are applied to the waveguide from a pulse generator that provides a stream of electric pulses, each of which is also provided to a signal processing circuit for timing purposes. When the electric pulse is applied to the waveguide, a magnetic field is formed surrounding the waveguide. Interaction of this field with the magnetic field from the magnet causes a torsional strain wave pulse to be launched in the waveguide in both directions away from the magnet. A coil assembly and sensing tape is joined to the waveguide. The strain wave causes a dynamic effect in the permeability of the sensing tape which is biased with a permanent magnetic field by the magnet. The dynamic effect in the magnetic field of the coil assembly due to the strain wave pulse, results in an output signal from the coil assembly that is provided to the signal processing circuit along signal lines.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">By comparing the time of application of a particular electric pulse and a time of return of a sonic torsional strain wave pulse back along the waveguide, the signal processing circuit can calculate a distance of the magnet from the coil assembly or the relative velocity between the waveguide and the magnet. The signal processing circuit provides an output signal, which is digital or analog, proportional to the calculated distance and/or velocity. A transducer-operated arrangement for measuring piston rod speed and velocity is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,952,823 and that patent is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">While transducers located at the suspension damper measure piston rod velocity (piston rod velocity transducer <b>508</b>), and piston rod position (piston rod position transducer <b>506</b>), a separate wheel speed transducer <b>504</b> for sensing the rotational speed of a wheel about an axle includes housing fixed to the axle and containing therein, for example, two permanent magnets. In one embodiment, the magnets are arranged such that an elongated pole piece commonly abuts first surfaces of each of the magnets, such surfaces being of like polarity. Two inductive coils having flux-conductive cores axially passing therethrough abut each of the magnets on second surfaces thereof, the second surfaces of the magnets again being of like polarity with respect to each other and of opposite polarity with respect to the first surfaces. Wheel speed transducers are described in U.S. Pat.

Logic unit <b>502</b> is user-programmable and, depending on the needs of the operator, logic unit <b>502</b> records the variables and, then, if certain criteria are met, logic unit <b>502</b> sends its own signal to electronic valve <b>235</b> (e.g., the logic unit <b>502</b> is an activation signal provider) to cause electronic valve <b>235</b> to move into the desired state (e.g., adjust the bypass flow rate). Thereafter, the condition, state or position of electronic valve <b>235</b> is relayed back to logic unit <b>502</b> via a boost valve monitor or the like.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In one embodiment, logic unit <b>502</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> assumes a single electronic valve <b>235</b> corresponding to a single flow path <b>256</b> of a single vehicle suspension damper <b>100</b>, but logic unit <b>502</b> is usable with any number of boost valves or groups of boost valves corresponding to any number of bypass channels, adjustable bypass ports, or groups of bypass channels or adjustable bypass ports.

In one example, electronic valve <b>235</b> is controlled based upon vehicle speed in conjunction with the angular location of the vehicle's steering wheel. In this manner, by sensing the steering wheel turn severity (angle of rotation), additional dampening (by adjusting the corresponding size of the opening of flow path <b>256</b> by causing electronic valve <b>235</b> to close, open, partially close, or partially open flow path <b>256</b>) can be applied to one vehicle suspension damper <b>100</b> or one set of vehicle suspension dampers on one side of the vehicle (suitable for example to mitigate cornering roll) in the event of a sharp turn at a relatively high speed.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In another example, a transducer, such as an accelerometer, measures other aspects of the vehicle's suspension system, like axle force and/or moments applied to various parts of the vehicle, like steering tie rods, and directs change to position of electronic valve <b>235</b> (and corresponding change to the working size of the opening of flow path <b>256</b> by causing electronic valve <b>235</b> to close, open, partially close, or partially open flow path <b>256</b>) in response thereto. In another example, electronic valve <b>235</b> is controlled at least in part by a pressure transducer measuring pressure in a vehicle tire and adding dampening characteristics to some or all of the wheels (by adjusting the working size of the opening of flow path <b>256</b> by causing electronic valve <b>235</b> to close, open, partially close, or partially open flow path <b>256</b>) in the event of, for example, an increased or decreased pressure reading.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In one embodiment, electronic valve <b>235</b> is controlled in response to braking pressure (as measured, for example, by a brake pedal (or lever) sensor or brake fluid pressure sensor or accelerometer). In still another example, a parameter might include a gyroscopic mechanism that monitors vehicle trajectory and identifies a &#x201c;spin-out&#x201d; or other loss of control condition and adds and/or reduces dampening to some or all of the vehicle's dampers (by adjusting the working size of the opening of flow path <b>256</b> by causing electronic valve <b>235</b> to close, open, partially close, or partially open flow path <b>256</b> chambers) in the event of a loss of control to help the operator of the vehicle to regain control.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, a block diagram of a modular electronic damping control system <b>600</b> is shown in accordance with an embodiment.

For example, in a smooth operating environment, e.g., on a highway or smooth road, configuration adjustments may be provided by the user via HMI <b>614</b>, or automatically applied by electronic damping control system <b>600</b>, to increase firmness in the ride. That is, to provide additional hardness that would increase feedback, feel and precise handling.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">In contrast, when rougher terrain is encountered, the user can select a rough terrain setting at HMI <b>614</b>. In contrast, the electronic damping control system <b>600</b> would receive information from one or more sensors (coupled to the suspension near dampers <b>621</b>-<b>624</b>, via the Vehicle CAN bus <b>608</b>, or the like) about the rough terrain and re-tune the vehicle suspension based on to a softer setting. That is, to provide appropriate suspension control characteristics for the vehicle. In addition, the adjustment provides a softer ride that would reduce operator/passenger felt vibrations, damper, bumps, and the like thereby reducing operator fatigue and/or.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">As described herein, the manual option includes a user selectable switch, icon on a touch display, or the like at the GUI or HMI, that allows a user to make a selection based on given characteristics, e.g., highway mode-for smooth terrain, -off-road mode-for rough terrain, a mixed mode for intermediate terrain, etc. In one embodiment, the manual option is provided at the GUI or HMI. In one embodiment, the manual option may be one or more switches that allow the use to select one or more pre-defined suspension settings. For example, the pre-defined suspension settings can include, but are not limited to, highway, offroad, mixed terrain, rock climbing, racing, performance, sport, wet, and the like.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">In an automated mode, electronic damping control system <b>600</b> automatically adjusts one or more characteristics for one or more dampers <b>621</b>-<b>624</b> based on based on one or more inputs received at the processor of SDC <b>610</b>. For example, in one embodiment, the steering inputs, vehicle roll, speed, and the like are detected and/or monitored via one or more sensors on or about the vehicle. Similarly, external conditions such as weather, terrain, ground type, and the like are also detected and/or monitored via the one or more sensors on or about the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Sensors such as but not limited to, accelerometers, sway sensors, suspension changes, visual identification technology (e.g., single or multi spectrum camera's), driver input monitors, steering wheel turning sensors, and the like. For example, one embodiment uses an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to sense rough terrain. One embodiment has an attitude and heading reference system (AHRS) that provides 3D orientation integrating data coming from inertial gyroscopes, accelerometers, magnetometers and the like. For example, in one embodiment, the AHRS is a GPS aided Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) based IMU and static pressure sensor.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Moreover, if the electronic damping control system <b>600</b> determines that one or more of dampers <b>621</b>-<b>624</b> are remotely adjustable, electronic damping control system <b>600</b> will be able to adjust those dampers automatically and on the fly. For example, electronic damping control system <b>600</b> will set the remotely adjustable dampers into a highway mode during travel down a roadway, e.g., that is configuring the remotely adjustable dampers to operate in a firmer mode, and then as the vehicle transitions to rougher terrain, the remotely adjustable dampers will be reconfigured to a softer setting to increasing absorption of damper and thereby provide a smoother ride.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">In one embodiment, the automated or user selectable settings are further adjustable based on actual conditions or as &#x201c;learned&#x201d; user settings. For example, if an operator initially sets the electronic damping control system <b>600</b> to a rough terrain setting and then the vehicle transitions to a roadway, fire road, highway, or the like. When the sensor feedback causes the electronic damping control system <b>600</b> to determine that the vehicle is no longer in rough terrain, electronic damping control system <b>600</b> would automatically change the mode to highway mode to provide a more appropriate suspension setting. However, if the operator prefers a harder feel, the operator would override any automatic &#x201c;on-the-fly&#x201d; adjustments so that off-road mode is maintained. Similarly, if the user prefers a softer ride, or has been in the seat for a long period of time, the user would adjust the stiffness mode to be a softer seat, provide a smoother ride, or the like.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">The foregoing Description of Embodiments is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the embodiments to the precise form described.
