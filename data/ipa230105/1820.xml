vehicles, a large number of vehicle batteries are replaced under warranty during vehicle transport and before customer delivery, which increases costs for the original equipment manufacturer (OEM).

Typically, during vehicle shipment from the plant, the batteries are not fully charged because this could be detrimental to battery performance and life. Conventional battery management systems and methods attempt to solve this problem by minimizing ignition-off draw (IOD) current during a &#x201c;shipping mode&#x201d; while the vehicles are in transport, but this does not fully solve the above-described problem.

This is primarily due to the batteries never being fully charged (e.g., 30-50% when leaving the plant) and the vehicles being periodically operated (e.g., on/off loading the vehicles to/from shipping trucks, lights being inadvertently left on, etc.).

These techniques maintain the battery charge at a desired level (e.g., 80-90%) until a threshold number of miles have been driven, after which a cost-based battery charge technique would be utilized. This higher level of charge, but less than full charge, provides for safe storage and maximized/optimized battery life. The primary type of battery utilized in vehicles is absorbent glass mat (AGM) batteries. However, there is also a newer type of advanced storage lithium ion (Li-Ion) battery for vehicle applications that has intelligent sensors built-in. These techniques are applicable to both Li-Ion batteries through the use of the built-in intelligent sensors, but are also applicable to AGM batteries, which include a less intelligent voltage sensor and would have a slightly different target charge level (e.g., 80-85%). The potential benefits of these techniques include reduced battery malfunctions and thereby reduced warranty costs for the OEM.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a functional block diagram of a vehicle <b>100</b> having an example battery management system <b>104</b> according to the principles of the present application is illustrated. The vehicle <b>100</b> generally comprises a powertrain <b>108</b> (e.g., an engine, an electric motor, or a combination thereof) configured to generate and transfer drive torque to a driveline <b>112</b> for vehicle propulsion. The vehicle <b>100</b> also comprises a controller <b>116</b> configured to control operation of the vehicle <b>100</b>, including primarily controlling the powertrain <b>108</b> to generate a desired amount of drive torque based on a driver input (e.g., via an accelerator pedal (not shown)). The vehicle <b>100</b> further comprises a battery <b>120</b>, a set of accessory loads <b>124</b> powered by the battery <b>120</b>. The battery management system <b>104</b> comprises the controller <b>116</b>, a set of sensors <b>128</b> configured to measure a set of parameters (voltage, current, SOC, etc.) of the battery <b>120</b>, and a recharging system <b>132</b> (an alternator, a DC-DC converter, etc.) for recharging the battery <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">As previously mentioned, the techniques of the present application are applicable to both advanced storage Li-ion (hereinafter, li-ion) and AGM implementations for the battery <b>120</b>. In a Li-ion implementation for the battery <b>120</b>, many or all of the set of sensors <b>128</b> are integrated into the battery <b>120</b>. In one exemplary Li-ion implementation for the battery <b>120</b>, the composition of the Li-ion cells of the battery is Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) composition and the set of sensors <b>128</b> integrated into the battery include a voltage sensor, a current sensor, and an SOC sensor, in addition to a set of relays that can be controlled to move charge throughout different Li-ion cells of the battery <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">This LFP composition in addition to the integrated set of sensors <b>128</b> allows for this Li-ion implementation to be safely charged and stored at higher SOC levels compared to other traditional batteries (e.g., Li-ion consumer electronic batteries) as well as the above-described AGM implementation. For example only, the Li-ion implementation could have a target SOC of 85-90%, whereas the AGM implementation could have a target SOC of 80-85%. In the AGM implementation if the battery <b>120</b>, there is also less integrated intelligence.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one exemplary AGM implementation, the battery <b>120</b> only comprises a voltage sensor of the set of sensors <b>128</b> integrated within the AGM. Other sensors of the set of sensors <b>128</b> could be external sensors to the battery <b>120</b>, which could increase costs, or the battery management technique could only monitor the voltage of the AGM implementation of the battery <b>120</b>, which would be less precise and thus the lower target SOC (or voltage level) would be utilized to avoid excessive charging that could result in a malfunction.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a flow diagram of an example battery management method <b>200</b> according to the principles of the present application is illustrated. While the method <b>200</b> is described with specific reference to the vehicle <b>100</b> and its components (e.g., the battery management system <b>104</b>), it will be appreciated that this method <b>200</b> could be applicable to any suitable vehicle battery management application. At <b>204</b>, the controller <b>116</b> determines whether the vehicle's mileage has reached a threshold mileage. When false, the method <b>200</b> proceeds to <b>212</b>. This threshold mileage is calibratable and should be sufficiently high to anticipate a majority of vehicle transportation scenarios (e.g., worst-case vehicle transport scenarios). For example only, the threshold mileage could be 50 miles. Setting the threshold mileage higher will not have a significant negative effect on vehicle fuel economy compared to a cost-based optimization technique that will be in effect at <b>208</b> after this threshold mileage is reached. This cost-based optimization technique will take into account a plurality of other operating parameters in order to optimally control battery recharging to a second target SOC for optimal vehicle efficiency/fuel economy as desired by the customer.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">This second target SOC will likely be less than the first target SOC, but it will be appreciated that there could be conditions where the cost-based optimization technique could generate the second target SOC to similar levels as the first target SOC. At <b>212</b>, the controller <b>116</b> controls recharging of the battery <b>120</b> to a first target SOC for optimal battery life and storage during vehicle transport. This could include, for example only, periodically waking up the vehicle <b>100</b> to perform trickle recharging of the battery <b>120</b> to the first target SOC. The method <b>200</b> then returns to <b>204</b> to determine whether the mileage threshold has been reached. This process will continue until the threshold mileage is finally reached at <b>204</b> and the cost-based optimization technique can fully takeover.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">It will be appreciated that the term &#x201c;controller&#x201d; as used herein refers to any suitable control device or set of multiple control devices that is/are configured to perform at least a portion of the techniques of the present application. Non-limiting examples include an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), one or more processors and a non-transitory memory having instructions stored thereon that, when executed by the one or more processors, cause the controller to perform a set of operations corresponding to at least a portion of the techniques of the present application. The one or more processors could be either a single processor or two or more processors operating in a parallel or distributed architecture.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">It should also be understood that the mixing and matching of features, elements, methodologies and/or functions between various examples may be expressly contemplated herein so that one skilled in the art would appreciate from the present teachings that features, elements and/or functions of one example may be incorporated into another example as appropriate, unless described otherwise above.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
