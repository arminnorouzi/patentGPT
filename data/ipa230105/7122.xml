Customers <b>110</b> interact with a contact center <b>150</b> using voice, email, text, and web interfaces to communicate with the agents <b>120</b> through a network <b>130</b> and one or more of text or multimedia channels. The platform that controls the operation of the contact center <b>150</b> including the routing and handling of communications between customers <b>110</b> and agents <b>120</b> for the contact center <b>150</b> is referred herein as the contact routing system <b>153</b>. The contact routing system <b>153</b> could be any of a contact center as a service (CCaS) system, an automated call distributor (ACD) system, or a case system, for example.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The agents <b>120</b> may be remote from the contact center <b>150</b> and handle communications (also referred to as &#x201c;interactions&#x201d; herein) with customers <b>110</b> on behalf of an enterprise. The agents <b>120</b> may utilize devices, such as but not limited to, work stations, desktop computers, laptops, telephones, a mobile smartphone and/or a tablet. Similarly, customers <b>110</b> may communicate using a plurality of devices, including but not limited to, a telephone, a mobile smartphone, a tablet, a laptop, a desktop computer, or other. For example, telephone communication may traverse networks such as a public switched telephone networks (PSTN), Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) telephony (via the Internet), a Wide Area Network (WAN) or a Large Area Network (LAN). The network types are provided by way of example and are not intended to limit types of networks used for communications.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The agents <b>120</b> may be assigned to one or more queues representing call categories and/or agent skill levels. The agents <b>120</b> assigned to a queue may handle communications that are placed in the queue by the contact routing system <b>153</b>. For example, there may be queues associated with a language (e.g., English or Chinese), topic (e.g., technical support or billing), or a particular country of origin. When a communication is received by the contact routing system <b>153</b>, the communication may be placed in a relevant queue, and one of the agents <b>120</b> associated with the relevant queue may handle the communication.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The agents <b>120</b> of a contact center <b>150</b> may be further organized into one or more teams. Depending on the embodiment, the agents <b>120</b> may be organized into teams based on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, skills, location, experience, assigned queues, associated or assigned customers <b>110</b>, and shift. Other factors may be used to assign agents <b>120</b> to teams.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Entities that employ workers such as agents <b>120</b> typically use a Quality Management (QM) system to ensure that the agents <b>120</b> are providing customers <b>110</b> with a high-quality product or service. QM systems do this by determining when and how to evaluate, train, and coach each agent <b>120</b> based on seniority, team membership, or associated skills as well as quality of performance while handling customer <b>110</b> interactions. QM systems may further generate and provide surveys or questionnaires to customers <b>110</b> to ensure that they are satisfied with the service being provided by the contact center <b>150</b>.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Historically, QM forms are built by adding multiple choice questions where different choices are worth different point values. The forms are then filled out manually by evaluators based on real time or recorded monitoring of agent interactions with customers. For example, a form for evaluating support interactions might start with a question where the quality of the greeting is evaluated. A good greeting where the agent introduced themselves and inquired about the problem might be worth 10 points and a poor greeting might be worth 0, with mediocre greetings being somewhere in between on the 1-10 scale. There might be 3 more questions about problem solving, displaying empathy, and closing. Forms can also be associated with one or more queues (also sometimes known as &#x201c;ring groups&#x201d;). As noted above, a queue can represent a type of work that the support center does and/or agent skills. For example, a call center might have a tier <b>1</b> voice support queue, a tier <b>2</b> voice support queue, an inbound sales queue, an outbound sales queue, and a webchat support queue. With traditional quality management based on multiple choice question forms filled outs by evaluators, it is time prohibitive to evaluate every interaction for quality and compliance. Instead, techniques like sampling are used where a small percent of each agent's interactions are monitored by and evaluator each month. This results in a less than optimum quality management process because samples are, of course, not always fully representative of an entire data set.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Disclosed implementations leverage known methods of speech recognition and intent analysis to make corrections to inputs to be fed into an Artificial Intelligence (AI) model to be used for quality management scoring of communications. An AI model can be used to detect the intent of utterances that are passed to it. The AI model can be trained based on &#x201c;example utterances&#x201d; and then compare the passed utterances, from agent/customer interactions to the training data to determine intent with a specified level (e.g., expressed as a score) of confidence. Intent determinations with a low confidence score can be directed to a human for further review. A first aspect of the invention is a method for assessing communications between a user and an agent in a call center, the method comprising: extracting text from a plurality of communications between a call center user and a call center agent to thereby create a communication record; for each of the plurality of communications: assessing the corresponding text of a communication record by applying an AI assessment model to obtain an intent assessment of one or more aspects of the communication, wherein the AI assessment model is developed by processing a set of initial training data and supplemental training data, wherein the supplemental training data is based on reviewing manual corrections to previous assessments by the assessment model.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The foregoing summary, as well as the following detailed description of the invention, will be better understood when read in conjunction with the appended drawings.

Matches with a low confidence score can be directed to a human for further review. Evaluation forms that are similar to forms used in conventional manual systems can be used. Retraining of the AI model is accomplished through individual corrections in an ongoing manner, as described below, as opposed to providing a new set of training data.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Disclosed implementations use automated transcription and intent detection and an AI model to evaluate every interaction, i.e. communication, (or alternatively a large percentage of interactions) between an agent and a customer. Disclosed implementations can leverage the evaluation flow used for manual evaluations so that the evaluators can correct the AI evaluations when appropriate. Based on such corrections, the AI model can be retrained to accommodate specifics of the business and center&#x2014;resulting in more confidence in the AI model over time.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a computer system for quality management in accordance with disclosed implementations. System <b>200</b> in includes parsing module <b>220</b> (including recording module <b>222</b> and transcription module <b>224</b>) which parses words and phrases from communications/interactions for processing in the manner descried in detail below. Assessment module <b>232</b> includes Artificial Intelligence (AI) model <b>232</b>, which includes intent module <b>234</b> that determines intent of and scores interactions in the manner described below. Intent module <b>234</b> can leverages any one of many known intent engines to analyze transcriptions of transcription module <b>224</b>. Form builder module <b>240</b> includes user interfaces and processing elements for building AI enabled evaluation forms as described below.

A good greeting where the agent introduced themselves and inquired about the problem might be worth 10 points and a poor greeting might be worth 0.

As noted above, forms can also be associated with one or more queues</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a user interface <b>300</b> of a computer-implemented form generation tool, such as form builder module <b>240</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) in accordance with disclosed implementations. User interface <b>300</b> can be used to enable forms for AI evaluation. A user can navigate the UI to select a question at drop down menu <b>302</b> for example, specify answer choices at <b>304</b> and <b>306</b>, and specify one or more examples of utterances, with corresponding scores and/or weightings, for each answer choice, in text entry box <b>304</b> for example. As an example, assuming the question &#x201c;Did the agent open the conversation in a clear manner?&#x201d; is selected in <b>302</b>, and the answers provided at <b>304</b> and <b>306</b> are &#x201c;Yes&#x201d; and &#x201c;No&#x201d; respectively, words/phrases &#x201c;hello my name is&#x201d;, &#x201c;good morning&#x201d;, &#x201c;thank you for calling our helpline&#x201d; can be entered into text box <b>308</b> as indications of &#x201c;Yes&#x201d; (i.e., a clear opening to the conversation) and words/phrases &#x201c;what is your problem?&#x201d;, &#x201c;yeah&#x201d;, &#x201c;and the like can be entered into text box <b>308</b> as indications of &#x201c;No&#x201d; (i.e., not a clear opening to the conversation).</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Form templates can be provided with the recommended best practice for sections, questions, and example utterances for each answer choice in order to maximize matching and increase confidence level. Customer users (admins) can edit the templates in accordance with their business needs. Additionally, users can specify a default answer choice which will be selected if none of the example utterances were detected with high confidence. In the example above, &#x201c;no greeting given&#x201d; might be a default answer choice, with 0 points, if a greeting is not detected. When an AI evaluation form created through UI <b>300</b> is saved, the example utterances are used to train AI model <b>232</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) with an intent for every question choice. In the example above, AI model <b>232</b> might have <b>8</b> intents: good greeting, poor greeting, good problem solving, poor problem solving, good empathy, poor empathy, good closing, poor closing, for example.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">When a voice interaction is completed, an audio recording of the interaction, created by recording module <b>222</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) can be sent to a speech transcription engine of transcription module <b>224</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) and the resulting transcription is stored in a digital file store. When the transcription is available, a message can be sent and the transcription can be processed by an intent detection engine on intent module <b>234</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). Utterances in the transcription can be enriched via intent detection by intent module <b>234</b>. An annotation, such as one or more tags, can be associated with the interaction as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> which illustrates user interface <b>400</b> and the positive or negative choices detected in the interaction being processed based on the questions in the evaluation form created with user interface <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. As shown at <b>402</b>, annotations can be associated with portions of the interaction to indicate detected intent during that portion of the interaction. For example, the annotations can be green happy faces (for positive intent), red happy faces (for negative intent), and grey speech bubbles (where there wasn't a high confidence based on the automated analysis). The corresponding positive or negative choices for the interaction, as evaluated by the AI model <b>232</b>, and the corresponding questions, are indicated at <b>404</b>. The tags can indicate intent, the question and choice associated with that intent, and whether that choice was positive, negative, or low confidence.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Based on the positive or negative choices, a new evaluation of the corresponding interaction will be generated for the agent, by assessment module <b>230</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, with a score. For example, the score can be based on a percentage of the points achieved from the detected choices with respect to the total possible score. If both positive and negative problem solving examples are detected, then the question can be assigned as the negative option (i.e., the one worth fewer points), for example, as it might be desirable for the system to err on the side of caution and detection of potential issues. As an alternative, disclosed implementations might look for a question option that has a medium number of points and use that as the point score for the utterances. Based on these positive and negative annotations detected automatically by assessment module <b>230</b>, the corresponding rating will be calculated on the evaluation form itself for that particular section. If for some questions, no intent is found with a high confidence, the default answer voice can be selected. If for some questions, intents are found, but a low confidence level, those low confidence matches will be annotated and the form can be presented to users as pending for manual review.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Evaluations accomplished automatically by assessment module <b>230</b> are presented to the user on an evaluations page user UI <b>500</b> or results module <b>250</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. Each evaluation can be tagged as &#x201c;AI Scored&#x201d;, &#x201c;AI Pending&#x201d;, &#x201c;Draft&#x201d; or &#x201c;Completed&#x201d; , in column <b>502</b>, to differentiate them from forms that were manually &#x201c;Completed&#x201d; by an evaluator employee. In this example, Draft means the evaluation was partially filled in by a person, AI Pending means the evaluation was partially filled in by the AI but there were some answers with low confidence, AI Scored means the evaluation was completely filled in by the AI, and Completed means the evaluation was completely filled in by a person or reviewed and updated by a person after it was AI Pending or AI Scored.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Of course, other relevant data, such as Score (column <b>504</b>), date of the interaction (column <b>506</b>), queue associated with the interaction (column <b>508</b>), and the like can be presented on evaluations page UI <b>500</b>. Additionally, the average score, top skill, and bottom skill widgets (all results of calculations by assessment module <b>230</b> or results module <b>250</b>) at the top of UI <b>500</b> could be based on taking the AI evaluations into account at a relatively low weighting (only 10% for example) as computer to forms completed manually by an evaluator employee. This weight may be configurable by the user.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">When an AI form cannot be evaluated automatically and scored completely by the system (e.g., the intent/answer cannot be determined on one or more particular questions), then these evaluations will show in an AI Pending state in column <b>504</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> and can be designated to require manual intervention/review/correction to move to a Completed status. Users can review these AI Pending evaluations and update the question responses selected on them. Doing this converts the evaluation to the &#x201c;Completed&#x201d; state where they are given the full weight (same as the ones completed manually from the start). Users can also choose to review and update the AI Scored evaluation, but this is an optional step which would only occur if, for example, a correction was needed. Updates that the employee evaluator made can be sent to a corrections API of AI model <b>232</b>. The corrections can be viewed on a user interface, e.g. , a UI similar to UI <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, and a non AI expert, such as a contact center agent or administrator, can view the models and corrections and can choose to add the example utterance to the intent that should have been selected, or to ignore the correction. If multiple trainers all agree to add an utterance, the new training set will be tested against past responses in an Agreements Review page of the UI <b>600</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, and, if the AI model identifies all of them correctly, an updated model will be published and used for further analysis. As a result of this process, the training set grows and the AI model improves over time.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The UI can provide a single view into corrections from multiple systems that use intent detection enrichment. For example, incorrect classifications from a virtual agent or knowledge base search could also be reviewed on the UI. Real-time alerts can be provided based on real-time transcription and intent detection to notify a user immediately if an important question is being evaluated poorly by AI model <b>232</b>. Emotion/crosstalk/silence checks can be added to the question choices on the forms in addition to example utterances. For example, for the AI model to detect Yes, it might have to both match the Yes intent via the example utterances and have a positive emotion based on word choice and tone.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates a method in accordance with disclosed implementations. At <b>702</b>, a call center communication, such as a phone call is recorded (by recording module <b>22</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, for example). At <b>704</b>, the recording is transcribed into digital format using known transcription techniques (by transcription module <b>224</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, for example). At <b>706</b>, each utterance is analyzed by an AI model (such as AI model <b>232</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) based on the appropriate form to determine intent and a corresponding confidence level of the determined intent for a question on the form. At <b>708</b>, if intent is detected with a high confidence (based on a threshold intent score for example), then the intent is annotated in a record associated with the communication at <b>710</b>. If the intent is found with a low confidence, the intent determination is marked for human review at <b>712</b> and the results of the human review are sent back to the AI model as training data at <b>714</b>. As noted above, the human review can include review by multiple persons and aggregating the responses of the multiple persons. Steps <b>706</b>, <b>708</b> and <b>710</b> (and <b>712</b> and <b>714</b> when appropriate) are repeated for each question in the form based on the determination made at <b>716</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The elements of the disclosed implementations can include computing devices including hardware processors and memories storing executable instructions to cause the processor to carry out the disclosed functionality.
