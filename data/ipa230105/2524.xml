However, if the polyethylene also has low melt-viscosity under low- or no-shear conditions, it may present an issue due to the ready deformation of the still hot article as it leaves the hot zone of the melt processing equipment. It would therefore be desirable to make polyethylene (PE) that has low melt viscosity under high shear, yet has high viscosity under low- or no-shear conditions. These properties are of use in several applications, such as, for example, foam, roofing membrane, and film.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Polyolefins typically show varying shear-thinning phenomena. Some of them, like low-density polyethylene (LDPE), have high degree of shear thinning, thus is advantageous from a processing cost perspective. It also has good green strength, i.e., could preserve its shape as it leaves the hot high-shear zone of the melt-processing machine. Its mechanical strength in its use, however, is not very high. High-density polyethylene (HDPE) on the other hand shows lower shear thinning, thus harder and costlier to process, but has much improved mechanical properties as compared to LDPE.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The presence of long-chain branching (LCB) in polyolefins, among them LCB in polyethylene, is often desirable as it enhances melt processability by shear-thinning. This phenomenon affords a given melt processing speed at reduced cost by requiring less power. LCB may also impart strain-hardening that can improve film production properties by improved bubble stability.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">To improve processability by improved shear-thinning, LCB is often introduced into HDPE by compounding HDPE lacking LCB with LDPE including LCB made in a separate process. This blending, however, brings in a broad range of LCB structures created in the LDPE process and leads to a significant reduction of the mechanical strength as compared to the parent HDPE. A better control of LCB is desirable to improve the balance of processability and mechanical properties of PE.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">LCB can also be introduced into an HDPE solution polymerization process by adding dienes with two reactive double bonds, like vinyl norbornene (VNB), alpha-omega dienes, like 1,7-octadiene, or 1,9-decadiene, and the like. Controlling LCB and avoiding gel formation, however, is often difficult in these processes.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another method of introducing LCB in HDPE is the use of free-radical initiators in the HDPE extruder. However, the cost of the initiators significantly increases the cost of production. Also, these processes are hard to control due to the difficulty of efficiently and quickly distributing the free-radical initiator in the high-viscosity polymer melt. The molecular architecture created by this process is dependent on the local concentration of free radicals. It can also lead to undesirable chain degradation and gel formation.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Yet another method of introducing LCB in HDPE is the use of vinyl-terminated macromers made in a separate upstream reactor. When the LCB-forming vinyl-terminated macromer is created in a separate reactor, only a small fraction of the vinyl-terminated macromer is incorporated into the LCB PE, the rest dilutes the product polymer. This dilution often undesirably reduces the performance of the product polymer.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In addition to the effect of LCB or lack of LCB, a narrow molecular weight distribution (MWD) tends to make high-density polyethylene (HDPE) grades having higher mechanical strength than the corresponding more conventional low-density polyethylene (LDPE) grades harder to process due to their lower shear-thinning. One method to address this this is to produce HDPE having a broader molecular weight distribution. However, introducing a broader molecular weight distribution can undesirably lead to less control over the rheological properties of the HDPE, such as the degree of shear-thinning.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">One or more embodiments of the disclosed invention include contacting an ethylene feed containing ethylene monomers with a catalyst feed containing a hafnium-based or zirconium-based single-site catalyst in a solution in a reactor so as to polymerize the ethylene monomers into long-chain-branched high density polyethylene having on average a long-chain-branch/polymer chain less than 10 and greater than 0.25.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">One or more embodiments of the disclosed invention include ethylene; a hafnium-based or zirconium-based single-site catalyst; and a long-chain-branched high density polyethylene polymerization product, wherein the long-chain branched high density polyethylene has on average a long-chain branch/polymer chain less than 10 and greater than 0.25; and wherein at least one of the ethylene, the catalyst, and the product is in solution.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">One more embodiments of the disclosed invention include maintaining a polymerization mixture at a polymerization reactor temperature at or above the crystallization temperature of the dissolved product polymer, while maintaining the polymerization mixture at steady state, where the polymerization mixture is substantially uniform in temperature, pressure, and concentration, where the polymerization mixture includes solvent, monomer including ethylene and optionally monomer copolymerizable with ethylene, a single-site catalyst system, and polymer resulting from the polymerization of the monomer, where the monomer and the polymer are dissolved in the solvent, and where the polymer is an ethylene-based polyolefin having a molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn) of less than 2.50 and greater than 2.0 and having long-chain branching wherein on average a long-chain branch/polymer chain less than 10 and greater than 0.25.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Embodiments of the solution polymerization process for making high density polyethylene with long-chain branching are described with reference to the following figures.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a graph of a plot of extensional viscosity vs. time of long-chain branched high density polyethylene for an exemplary long-chain branched polyethylene and a linear reference; and</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a graph of a &#x201c;Van Gurp-Palmen&#x201d; plot, that is phase angle vs shear modulus, for another exemplary long-chain branched polyethylene and another linear reference.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">This disclosure provides processes, compositions, and systems for producing controlled amounts of long-chain branching (LCB) in high density polyethylene (HDPE), while also producing controlled narrow molecular weight distributions for the HDPE. For example, this disclosure provides combinations of process conditions and single-site catalysts that introduce controlled amounts of LCB in polyethylene made in solution in a single reactor affording polyethylene with improved shear-thinning and better green strength. The disclosed processes, compositions, and systems solve the problem of HDPE with superior mechanical properties tending to be difficult to process due to low shear-thinning by introducing controlled levels of LCB to increase shear-thinning and thus improve melt processability, while also introducing controlled narrow molecular weight distributions. The disclosed processes, compositions, and systems eliminate the need for compounding with LDPE and thus save cost.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The present inventors have surprisingly found that these advantageous properties can be manufactured in a single solution polymerization reactor by a novel combination of reactor conditions and catalyst selection. The process could be deployed in a commercial continuous reactor operating at lower pressure in the liquid-liquid biphasic solution regime or in a commercial continuous reactor operating at higher pressure in the single liquid phase solution regime. The process of the current disclosure polymerizes ethylene at suitable reactor conditions using advantageously-selected single-site catalysts in mixed/stirred continuous reactors filled with liquid single-phase, or liquid-liquid biphasic reaction medium to yield high-density polyethylene (HDPE) with improved melt-flow properties due to increased shear-thinning.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Without being bound by theory, the present inventors believe that the improved shear-thinning of the HDPE made by the processes of this disclosure is due to the in-situ generated controlled levels of long-chain branching (LCB). The high-density polyethylene products with improved melt-flow properties made in the processes of the current disclosure will be referred to herein as long-chain-branched high density polyethylene, or LCB HDPE. The presence of LCB is reported to result in a larger drop in melt viscosity under increasing shear than what is observed with linear polymers having the same composition and molecular weight (MW), the latter of which can be also expressed as melt index (MI), which is easier and faster to obtain and widely used in industry. This LCB effect allows the processing of polymers with higher low-shear melt viscosity at reduced cost. The LCB effect enhances melt processability by shear-thinning. This phenomenon affords a given melt processing speed at reduced cost by requiring less power. The shear properties are particularly advantageous when the polymer needs to retain its shape in extrusion and are often described in the art of polymer processing as increased green strength. The other interesting property provided by the presence of LCB is strain-hardening. It manifests itself in increasing resistance to stretching at the high end of the stress-strain curve. Strain-hardening can improve film properties.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The process of this disclosure generates controlled levels of LCB without gel formation, thus avoids yield losses associated with diene or free-radical initiator use. Since it creates LCB in the process, and indeed can make LCB-containing PE even in a single reactor, without the use of additional reagents or comonomers, or the need for compounding, it reduces manufacturing cost. It also creates LCB in a targeted, controlled fashion unlike blending with LDPE, thus can afford better processability/use properties balance.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">While the processes of this disclosure can yield polyethylene products that contain LCB (LCB PE) in a single reactor, they may also be practiced in processes utilizing two or more reactors connected in parallel or series. Such combinations may advantageously be used for tailoring the molecular weight and/or the composition distributions of the product. In one embodiment of the processes of the current disclosure LCB PE could be made in one of the reactors while an ethylene-rich copolymer, like linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) could be made in a second reactor. The two reactors could be connected in series or parallel to make LLDPE that contains controlled amounts of LCB brought in by the LCB PE component. This is just but one potential example for the use of the LCB generating solution polymerization process of the current disclosure. Many other combinations yielding different products are also envisioned. The common feature of these processes is that they have at least one reactor making an LCB PE component for making useful polymer blends in a process utilizing two or more reactors in parallel or series.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In general, while pressure and temperature may be selected to ensure fouling-free operations in the processes of this disclosure, various temperatures and pressures as described in this disclosure are suitable for LCB formation. Similarly, solution processes of the current disclosure may operate in single liquid phase or in a liquid-liquid biphasic mode. Controlled LCB formation may be achieved in either single phase or biphasic operation mode when the solution polymerization reactor conditions and catalyst properties are set according to this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Embodiments of the invention are based, at least in part, on the discovery of a continuous process for solution polymerizing ethylene, optionally together with one or more comonomers, at a pressure and temperature below or above the lower critical separation temperature (LCST) to thereby produce an ethylene-based polyolefin having a controlled molecular weight distribution, Mw/Mn, of less than 2.5 and controlled long-chain branching. In one or more embodiments, this continuous solution polymerization process employs a single-site catalyst that is soluble within the polymerization mixture, and the polymerization mixture is uniform and maintained at steady state above the solution crystallization temperature of the product polymer. Aspects of the present invention advantageously provide the polymer with long-chain branching and with narrow molecular weight distribution, which has unexpectedly been achieved by the appropriate selection of process parameters and catalyst. Embodiments of the invention are therefore directed toward these polymerization processes, as well as the single liquid phase and liquid-liquid biphasic polymerization mixtures that are utilized by and produced by these processes.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">Process&#x2014;General</heading><p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to embodiments of the present invention, monomer, optionally together with one or more comonomers, single-site catalyst, and solvent are continuously combined within a reactor to form a polymerization mixture, which may be referred to as a reaction medium, that upon polymerization of the monomer and optionally the one or more comonomers also includes ethylene-based polyolefin. The polymerization mixture is maintained at a temperature and pressure either below (liquid single phase conditions) or above the LCST (liquid-liquid biphasic conditions) as a uniform polymerization system operated at steady state while a portion of the polymerization mixture is continuously removed from the reactor, where LCST is the lower critical solution temperature. The polymerization mixture is also maintained at a temperature above the crystallization temperature of the product polymer to maintain the product polymer in a dissolved state. Without being bound by theory, the present inventors believe that maintaining the variation of values of temperature and pressure in a narrow range assists to produce HDPE with a narrow molecular weight distribution. The monomer feed rate and/or monomer concentration in the reactor are adjusted according to the catalyst, temperature, and pressure to deliver the desired product properties. Without being bound by theory, the present inventors believe that adjusting the monomer feed rate and/or monomer concentration in the reactor are adjusted according to the catalyst, temperature, and pressure assists to produce HDPE with a weight-average molecular weight above a target value and/or a melt index below a target value. The reactor is maintained with sufficient circulation to ensure good mixing characterized by desirably low temperature and concentration differences in different parts of the polymerization reactor. Without being bound by theory, the present inventors believe that good mixing assists to produce HDPE with controlled long-chain branching (LCB).</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Monomer</heading><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one or more embodiments, monomer includes ethylene and optionally additional monomer(s), also termed herein comonomer(s), polymerizable with ethylene, the latter of which may be referred to as comonomer.

The active catalysts are often present as ion pairs of a cation and an anion. The cation of the active catalyst is formed from the catalyst precursor, while the anion of the active catalyst is formed from the activator. Examples of suitable activators are numerous in the literature. The most frequently used activators belong to the chemical families of metal alkyls, methyl aluminoxanes (MAO), and non-coordinating anion activators, such borates, etc.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">Catalyst Precursor Transition Metal Compounds</heading><p id="p-0043" num="0042">As suggested above, the precursor compound can include a metallocene compound, or it may include a non-metallocene transition metal compound.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In one or more embodiments, the transition metal precursor compound is a metallocene compound.

All quantities are measured gravimetrically. The TCB densities used to express the polymer concentration in mass/volume units are 1.463 g/ml at room temperature and 1.284 g/ml at 145&#xb0; C. The injection concentration is from 0.5 to 2.0 mg/ml, with lower concentrations being used for higher molecular weight samples. Prior to running each sample, the DRI detector and the viscometer are purged. Flow rate in the apparatus is then increased to 0.5 ml/minute, and the DRI is allowed to stabilize for 8 hours before injecting the first sample. The LS laser is turned on at least 1 to 1.5 hours before running the samples. The concentration, c, at each point in the chromatogram is calculated from the baseline-subtracted DRI signal, I<sub>DRI</sub>, using the following equation:</p><p id="p-0078" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>c=K</i><sub>DRI</sub><i>I</i><sub>DRI</sub>/(<i>dn/dc</i>),<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0079" num="0000">where K<sub>DRI </sub>is a constant determined by calibrating the DRI, and (dn/dc) is the refractive index increment for the system.

Under steady-state conditions, all feed rates and feed and effluent compositions, as well as pressure and temperature are substantially constant. For purposes of this specification, steady state refers to maintaining substantially constant reactor feed and effluent compositions, temperature and pressure within a specified time domain (i.e. over a given period of time). In one or more embodiments, the time domain is the time duration in which the monomer undergoes polymerization. In these or other embodiments, the time domain is the residence time that the polymerization mixture is in the polymerization reactor. In these or other embodiments, this time duration refers to the time at which the polymerization mixture is above the LCST.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0084">Relative to the meaning of steady state conditions, substantially constant temperature and pressure refers to maintaining the polymerization mixture within those temperature and pressure fluctuations that yield less than appreciable changes in the polymerization of monomer, especially with regard to the molecular weight distribution of the resulting polymer.

Relative percent difference is calculated by obtaining two measurements (e.g. two temperature measurements) at two different times during the relative time domain (e.g. during the residence time of the polymerization), calculating the absolute difference, if any, between the measurements, dividing the difference by the average of the two measurements, and then multiplying by 100%. As an example, this calculation can be described for reactor temperature by the following formula:</p><p id="p-0098" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>|&#x394;|/&#x3a3;<i>T/</i><sub>2</sub>)&#xd7;100%<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0099" num="0000">where &#x394;T is T high&#x2212;T low, and &#x3a3;T=T high+T low.

In these or other embodiments, the polymerization mixture is maintained, over the relevant time domain (e.g. during the residence time within the polymerization reactor), so as to maintain pressure fluctuations of less than 10 atm, in other embodiments less than 7 atm, and in other embodiments less than 4 atm.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0086">The skilled person will be able to readily maintain the temperature and pressure of the polymerization mixture, during the relevant time domain, within the parameters of this invention without the exercise of undue calculation or experimentation. For example, conventional means exist to manipulate and maintain the pressure of a polymerization reactor such as a continuously-stirred tank reactor (CSTR). Likewise, the temperature can be controlled by employing conventional techniques such as, but not limited to, cooling jackets by adjusting the catalyst feed rate to the reactor, which adjusts the catalyst concentration in the reactor.</p><heading id="h-0023" level="2">Mixing</heading><p id="p-0102" num="0087">During the polymerization process, the polymerization mixture is mixed or otherwise agitated to achieve at least two polymerization mixture characteristics. First, the polymerization mixture is sufficiently mixed to achieve a polymerization mixture that has one or more uniform properties.

Mixing can be accomplished either by using one or more stirrers, or by pumping around in a loop reactor, or by the churn created by the boiling reaction medium. The reactors may be fully liquid filled or may be partially filled with liquid, the second phase being a gas filled with the vapors in equilibrium with the liquid phase. When more than one reactor is used, the reactors may operate at the same or different conditions with the same or different feeds. When more than one reactor is deployed in the process of the current disclosure, they may be of the same or different reactor type, but at least one of the more than one reactors will be suitable for the process of the current disclosure and will produce LCB HDPE. They may be connected in series or in parallel, or any other combination when more than two reactors are employed.</p><heading id="h-0024" level="2">Reaction Medium</heading><p id="p-0111" num="0096">The reaction medium is a solution. The solution has the polymer in its dissolved phase and specifically not in its separated solid state even if it is split between two liquid phases. Thus, as used herein, &#x201c;solution&#x201d; refers to reaction conditions in solution and the &#x201c;solution&#x201d; may include one or more liquid phases including one or more liquids acting as solvents. The solution in a reactor may include a single liquid phase or may include a liquid-liquid biphasic system.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0097">The processes of the current disclosure can be performed in a single liquid phase or in a liquid-liquid biphasic reaction medium. In all cases, however, the polymer is dissolved in the one or two liquid phases and thus does not form a separate solid phase, like, for example, in slurry polymerization. In this regard, the currently disclosed processes are solution polymerization processes even when two liquid phases are present in the reactor.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0098">Liquid-liquid biphasic reaction media in the processes of this disclosure have two liquid phases. In liquid-liquid biphasic reaction media of this disclosure, one of the liquid phases is finely dispersed in the second, continuous liquid phase. The fine dispersion ensures no or very low concentration and temperature gradients in the dispersed liquid phase. Fine dispersion means that the size of the individual dispersed liquid domains are less than 1,000, or less than 100, or less than 10, or less than 1 micrometer. In most practical cases, the continuous phase is polymer lean, and the finely dispersed phase is polymer rich.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0099">Although the reactor of the processes of the current disclosure may contain solid particles, those solid particles do not form in the reactor. However, the polymer is dissolved in the liquid phases present in the reactor, and is not separating as a solid phase. In this regard the disclosed polymerization is a solution polymerization process. Solid particles may be fed to the reactor for various reasons, for example the catalyst precursor and/or the activator or the active catalyst may be introduced as finely dispersed solid. Advantageously, the reactors of the present disclosure are free of solids and the catalyst is also dissolved, i.e., molecularly dispersed in the reaction medium. It will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art, however, that being molecularly dispersed that is being dissolved, does not mean that the catalyst concentration must be the same in both liquid phases present in the reactor when the reaction medium is a liquid-liquid biphasic system. The same goes for all other components of the reaction medium present in the polymerization reactors of the currently disclosed processes.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0100">The feed to the polymerization reactor employed in the process of the current disclosure advantageously comprises one or more solvent, or one or more solvent blends, a monomer and one or more comonomers, one single-site active catalyst or one single-site catalyst precursor and one catalyst activator. When the catalyst precursor and catalyst activator is not combined upstream of the reactor and thus fed as active catalyst to the reactor, the active catalyst is formed in the reactor by the reaction of the catalyst precursor and the catalyst activator. The feed advantageously contains one active catalyst, or one catalyst precursor in combination with one catalyst activator for easier process control and lower cost.</p><heading id="h-0025" level="2">Compositional Characteristics of Biphasic System</heading><p id="p-0116" num="0101">When polyolefins, and among them the currently-disclosed ethylene-based polyolefins are dissolved in various solvents, such as, for example, C<sub>5</sub>-C<sub>16 </sub>alkanes, cycloalkanes, aromatic hydrocarbons, partially or fully halogenated hydrocarbons, and their blends, the solutions may undergo liquid-liquid phase separation even while the polymers stay dissolve, i.e., molecularly dispersed in the medium. The result of this phase separation can be the formation of two bulk settled phases, or one of the two phases can be dispersed in the second continuous phase. The formation of the dispersed second liquid phase causes increased light scattering, thus this phase transition is often referred to as cloud point. The term cloud point, however, sometimes is also used to describe the precipitation of the solid polymer due to its crystallization. However, herein the term cloud point refers to the cloudy liquid state that is created upon liquid-liquid, not upon liquid-solid phase separation.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0102">One of the phases forming as the result of the above-described phase separation may contain more polymer than the other. When light, low density solvents, such as, for example, C<sub>5</sub>-C<sub>8 </sub>open chain acyclic hydrocarbons are used, the polymer-rich phase has higher density than the polymer-lean phase.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0103">It can be appreciated that when such phase separation occurs in the polymerization reactor, not only the concentration of the polymer, but the concentrations of the catalyst and/or monomers might also be different in the two phases for thermodynamic reasons and/or due to phase transfer limitations between the two liquid phases present in the reactor. Such concentration differences thus may essentially create two reaction zones with different reaction conditions even without temperature and/or bulk concentration gradients in the reactor resulting in the formation of polymer fractions with different molecular weights and monomer compositions. In essence, this would yield a blend of two polymer fractions with different average molecular weights from a single reactor. In the case of copolymers, this split would also apply to the compositions of the product polymer fractions as well. Since the two fractions would be blended during product recovery, this would broaden the molecular weight, and in the case of copolymers the composition distribution, of the polymer product recovered from the reactor.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0104">The respective liquid phases of the liquid-liquid biphasic system may have unique compositional characteristics. In one or more embodiments, one phase may have a higher concentration of ethylene-based polyolefin relative to the second phase. In this regard, reference may be made to polymer-rich phase and polymer-lean phase, respectively. In one or more embodiments, the polymer-lean phase includes less than 10,000 ppm by weight, in other embodiments less than 5,000 ppm by weight, in other embodiments less than 1,000 ppm by weight, and in other embodiments less than 500 ppm by weight polymer (i.e., ethylene-based polyolefin). In these or other embodiments, the polymer-rich phase may include greater than 10, in other embodiments greater than 15, in other embodiments greater than 20, in other embodiments greater than 25, in other embodiments greater than 30, in other embodiments greater than 35, in other embodiments greater than 40% by weight polymer (i.e., ethylene-based polyolefin).</p><p id="p-0120" num="0105">In one or more embodiments, the polymer-rich phase is the dispersed phase and the polymer-lean phase is the continuous phase of the liquid-liquid biphasic system.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0106">In one or more embodiments, the polymer-rich phase and the polymer-lean phase generally have similar concentrations of monomer. In one or more embodiments, the respective monomer concentrations of the polymer-rich phase and the polymer-lean phase differ by less than 10 wt %, in other embodiments by less than 5 wt %, and in other embodiments by less than 1 wt %.</p><heading id="h-0026" level="2">Post-Polymerization Separation and Finishing</heading><p id="p-0122" num="0107">After the polymerization as described herein, the polymerization mixture is removed from the vessel in which the polymerization was conducted, and then the resultant ethylene-based polyolefin can be separated from the polymerization mixture (i.e. it is separated from the solvent and unreacted monomer). In one or more embodiments, once removed from the vessel in which the polymerization took place, the two or more polymerization mixtures (which include solutions of polymer) may be blended (i.e. solution blended off line). This may be particularly useful where multiple polymerization processes are conducted in series or in parallel. As the skilled person will appreciate, these polymer blends may be made for the purpose of improving polymer melt processability or for improving polymer performance for a particular use. For example, ethylene-based bimodal orthogonal composition distributions (BOCD) products, in which the high molecular weight (MW) component contains higher concentration of comonomers than the low MW component, are known to have improved crack resistance in injection molded products. These BOCD products can be made by blending a high MW component made in one reactor with a low MW component from another reactor. Similarly, melt processability of the polymers of the current disclosure can be improved by broadening the MWD by blending two components of different MW and/or by blending in at least one polymer component that has long-chain branching. Depending how close the molecular weights of the blend components are, the blends may or may not show bimodal (in case of two different blend components) or multimodal (in case of more than two different blend components) molecular weight and/or compositional distribution. When the components have similar MW and/or composition, the envelopes of their analytical traces may overlap so much that they appear to have a single component, though with broadened distribution.

The reactor was designed to operate at a maximum pressure and temperature of 2,000 bar (30 kpsi) and 225&#xb0; C., respectively. The nominal reactor vessel volume was 150 mL. The reactor was equipped with a magnetically coupled mechanical stirrer (Magnedrive). A pressure transducer measured the pressure in the reactor. The reactor temperature was measured using two type-K thermocouples. The reported values are the averages of the two readings. A flush-mounted rupture disk located on the side of the reactor provided protection against catastrophic pressure failure. All product lines were heated to &#x2dc;120-150&#xb0; C. to prevent fouling. The reactor had an electric heating band that was controlled by a programmable logic control (PLC) computer to maintain the desired reactor temperature. Except for the heat losses to the environment, the reactor did not have cooling (nearly adiabatic operations).</p><p id="p-0188" num="0173">The conversion in the reactor was monitored by an on-line gas chromatograph (GC) that sampled both the feed and the effluent. The GC analysis utilized the ethane impurity present in the ethylene feed as internal standard.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0174">Feed purification traps were used to control impurities carried by the monomer feed. The purification traps were placed before the ethylene feed compressor and comprised of two separate beds in series: activated copper (reduced in flowing H<sub>2 </sub>at 225&#xb0; C. and 1 bar) for 02 removal followed by a molecular sieve (5A, activated in flowing N<sub>2 </sub>at 270&#xb0; C.) for water removal.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0175">Purified liquid monomer feed was fed by a single-barrel ISCO pump (model 500D) in neat form or diluted by the same solvent as used in polymerization. The liquid monomer feeds were purified by filtration through an activated basic alumina bed followed by the addition of &#x2212;3 mL of trioctylaluminum solution (Aldrich #38,655-3)/2 L of liquid monomer feed.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0176">The catalyst feed solution was prepared inside an argon-filled dry box (Vacuum Atmospheres). The atmosphere in the glove box was purified to maintain &#x3c;1 ppm 02 and &#x3c;1 ppm water. All glassware was oven-dried for a minimum of at least 4 hours at 110&#xb0; C. and transferred hot to the antechamber of the dry box before bringing them to the box. Stock solutions of the catalyst precursor and the activator were prepared using purified toluene that was stored in amber bottles inside the dry box. Aliquots were taken to prepare fresh activated catalyst solutions. The activated catalyst solution was charged inside the argon-filled dry box to a heavy-walled glass reservoir (Ace Glass, Inc. Vineland, N.J.) and was pressurized to 5 psig with argon to send it to the catalyst feed pump in a closed line. The activated catalyst solution was delivered to the unit by a two-barrel continuous high-pressure syringe pump (PDC Machines).</p><p id="p-0192" num="0177">HPLC grade hexane (95% n-hexane, J. T. Baker) or isohexane (South Hampton Resources, Dallas, Tex.) was used as solvent. It was purged with argon for a minimum of four hours and was sent through an activated copper and a molecular sieve (5A) bed, then filtered once over activated basic alumina. The filtered hexane or isohexane was stored in a heavy-wall 4-liter glass vessel (Ace Glass, Vineland, N.J.) inside an argon-filled dry box. The solvent feed was further purified by adding &#x2dc;3-5 mL of trioctylaluminum solution (Aldrich #38,655-3) to the 4-liter reservoir of filtered hexane. 5-10 psig head pressure of argon was applied to the glass vessel to send the scavenger-containing hexane to a metal feed vessel from which the hexane was delivered to the reactor by a two-barrel continuous ISCO pump (model 500D).</p><p id="p-0193" num="0178">During the polymerizations, the reactor was first preheated to &#x2dc;10-15&#xb0; C. below that of the desired reaction temperature. Once the reactor reached the preheat temperature, the solvent pump was turned on to feed the solvent to the reactor. This solvent stream entered the reactor through a port on the top of the stirrer assembly to keep the polymer from fouling the stirrer. The monomers were fed to the reactor through a single side port. The activated catalyst solution was fed by syringe pump. The catalyst solution was mixed with the stream of flowing solvent upstream of the reactor. During the reactor line-out period the catalyst feed rate was adjusted to reach and maintain the target monomer conversion, the latter of which monitored by GC sampling. After establishing steady state reactor conditions during which all process parameters, feed rates, and monomer conversions were constant, the products were collected in a dedicated collection vessel for a time sufficient to collect the desired amounts of product. This stage of the run was called the balance period as it was used to collect the product while measuring and recording the exact feed flow rates and the length of the run. The polymer made during the balance period under steady state conditions was collected at the end of each run and weighed after vacuum-drying overnight at 50-70&#xb0; C. The total feed during the balance period combined with the product yield and composition data were used to compute monomer concentrations and monomer conversions. Aliquots of the products were used for characterization without homogenizing the entire product yield.</p><heading id="h-0033" level="2">DSC Analysis</heading><p id="p-0194" num="0179">The heat associated with phase transitions was measured on heating and cooling the polymer samples from the solid state and melt, respectively, using a TA Instruments Discovery series DSC.

The sample was cooled to &#x2212;40&#xb0; C. and then heated to 210&#xb0; C. at a heating rate of 10&#xb0; C./min to evaluate the glass transition and melting behavior for the as-received polymers. Crystallization behavior was evaluated by cooling the sample from 210 to &#x2212;40&#xb0; C. at a cooling rate of 10&#xb0; C./min. Second heating data were measured by heating this melt-crystallized sample at 10&#xb0; C./min. The second heating data thus provide phase behavior information for samples crystallized under controlled thermal history. The endothermic melting transition (first and second melt) and exothermic crystallization transition were analyzed for onset of transition and peak temperature.

For all experiments, the rheometer was thermally stable at 150&#xb0; C. for at least 30 minutes before inserting compression-molded sample of resin onto the parallel plates. To determine the samples viscoelastic behavior, frequency sweeps in the range from 0.01 to 100 rad/s were carried out at a temperature of 190&#xb0; C. under constant strain. Depending on the molecular weight and temperature, a strain of 10% was used and the linearity of the response was verified. A nitrogen stream was circulated through the sample oven to minimize chain oxidation or cross-linking during the experiments. All the samples were compression molded at 190&#xb0; C. and stabilizers were added.

The SER Testing Platform is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,578,413 &#x26; 6,691,569, which are incorporated herein for reference.

Strain hardening is observed as an abrupt upswing of the extensional viscosity in the transient extensional viscosity vs. time plot. This abrupt upswing, away from the behavior of a linear viscoelastic material, was reported in the 1960s for LDPE (reference: J. Meissner, <i>Rheology Acta</i>., v.8, (1969) p. 78) and was attributed to the presence of long branches in the polymer. A strain hardening ratio (SHR) is used to characterize the upswing in extensional viscosity and is defined as the ratio of the maximum transient extensional viscosity over three times the value of the transient zero-shear-rate viscosity at the same strain. Strain hardening is present in the material when the ratio is greater than 1.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0184">Rheological data was presented by plotting the phase angle versus the absolute value of the complex shear modulus (G*) to produce a van Gurp-Palmen plot. It is known to one of ordinary skill in the art that the plot of conventional polymers shows monotonic behavior and a negative slope toward higher G* values. Conventional polymers without long-chain branches exhibit a negative slope on the van Gurp-Palmen plot. For branched polymers, the phase angles shift to a lower value as compared with the phase angle of a conventional polymer without long-chain branches at the same value of G*.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0185">Branched structures were observed by Small Amplitude Oscillatory Shear (SAOS) measurement of the molten polymer performed on a dynamic (oscillatory) rotational rheometer. From the data generated by such a test it was possible to determine the phase or loss angle &#x3b4;, which is the inverse tangent of the ratio of G&#x2033; (the loss modulus) to G&#x2032; (the storage modulus). It is known to one of ordinary skill in the art tat for a typical linear polymer, the loss angle at low frequencies (or long times) approaches 90 degrees, because the chains can relax in the melt, absorbing energy, and making the loss modulus much larger than the storage modulus. As frequencies increase, more of the chains relax too slowly to absorb energy during the oscillations, and the storage modulus grows relative to the loss modulus. Eventually, the storage and loss moduli become equal and the loss angle reaches 45 degrees. In contrast, a branched chain polymer relaxes very slowly, because the branches need to retract first before the chain backbone can relax along its tube in the melt. This polymer never reaches a state where all its chains can relax during an oscillation, and the loss angle never reaches 90 degrees even at the lowest frequency, &#x3c9;, of the experiments. The loss angle is also relatively independent of the frequency of the oscillations in the SAOS experiment; another indication that the chains cannot relax on these timescales.</p><heading id="h-0037" level="2">Mathematical Modeling of Polymerization Medium</heading><p id="p-0201" num="0186">In the foregoing samples, the characterization of the polymerization medium was modeled to determine whether the reaction conditions created a single phase liquid solution or a liquid-liquid biphasic solution. In performing this analysis, the feed monomer content, flow rate, and reactor productivity were maintained within a tight range, which ensured comparable reactor compositions. Two reactor pressures, nominally about 40.8 and about 115.7 atm (41 and 117 bar, respectively), were used to switch between biphasic liquid and single phase liquid.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0187">The variant of the statistical associating fluid theory (SAFT) that was used to predict the phase diagrams was SAFT-1, which is described in H. Adidharma and M. Radosz (1998) Ind. Eng. Chem. Res., v.37, pp. 4453-4462. To calculate the phase boundaries, the tangent plane criterion was applied to the Gibbs free energy as defined by SAFT-1:</p><p id="p-0203" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00003" num="00003"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mrow>   <mrow>    <mrow>     <msub>      <mi>G</mi>      <mi>Mix</mi>     </msub>     <mo>(</mo>     <mrow>      <msub>       <mover>        <mi>x</mi>        <mover>         <mi>&#x3c9;</mi>         <mo>_</mo>        </mover>       </mover>       <mi>Feed</mi>      </msub>      <mo>+</mo>      <mrow>       <mi>&#x394;</mi>       <mo>&#x2062;</mo>       <mover>        <mi>x</mi>        <mover>         <mi>&#x3c9;</mi>         <mo>_</mo>        </mover>       </mover>      </mrow>     </mrow>     <mo>)</mo>    </mrow>    <mo>-</mo>    <mrow>     <msub>      <mi>G</mi>      <mi>Mix</mi>     </msub>     <mo>(</mo>     <msub>      <mover>       <mi>x</mi>       <mover>        <mi>&#x3c9;</mi>        <mo>_</mo>       </mover>      </mover>      <mi>Feed</mi>     </msub>     <mo>)</mo>    </mrow>    <mo>-</mo>    <mrow>     <mi>&#x25bd;</mi>     <mo>&#x2062;</mo>     <mrow>      <mrow>       <mi>G</mi>       <mo>&#x2061;</mo>       <mo>(</mo>       <msub>        <mover>         <mi>x</mi>         <mover>          <mi>&#x3c9;</mi>          <mo>_</mo>         </mover>        </mover>        <mi>Feed</mi>       </msub>       <mo>)</mo>      </mrow>      <mo>&#xb7;</mo>      <mi>&#x394;</mi>     </mrow>     <mo>&#x2062;</mo>     <mover>      <mi>x</mi>      <mover>       <mi>&#x3c9;</mi>       <mo>_</mo>      </mover>     </mover>    </mrow>   </mrow>   <mo>&#x2265;</mo>   <mn>0</mn>  </mrow>  <mo>&#x2062;</mo>  <mtext></mtext>  <mrow>   <mover>    <mi>x</mi>    <mover>     <mi>&#x3c9;</mi>     <mo>_</mo>    </mover>   </mover>   <mo>=</mo>   <mrow>    <mi>Feed</mi>    <mo>&#x2062;</mo>    <mtext>   </mtext>    <mi>Composition</mi>   </mrow>  </mrow>  <mo>&#x2062;</mo>  <mtext></mtext>  <mrow>   <mrow>    <mi>&#x394;</mi>    <mo>&#x2062;</mo>    <mover>     <mi>x</mi>     <mover>      <mi>&#x3c9;</mi>      <mo>_</mo>     </mover>    </mover>   </mrow>   <mo>=</mo>   <mrow>    <mi>All</mi>    <mo>&#x2062;</mo>    <mtext>   </mtext>    <mi>possible</mi>    <mo>&#x2062;</mo>    <mtext>   </mtext>    <mi>mixtures</mi>   </mrow>  </mrow> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0204" num="0000">For the polyethylene component, the SAFT-1 parameters were used (H.

In Table 6A, F3 indicates &#x3bc;-di(p-triethylsilylphenyl)silyl)(3,8-di-tert-butylfluorenylindenyl ligand, S indicates (dimethylsilylene)bis[(1,2,3,3a,7a-h)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1H-ind en-1-ylidene ligand, Zr indicates zirconium, Hf indicates hafnium, and D4 indicates dimethylanilinium-tetrakis(perfluorophenyl)borate activator.</p><heading id="h-0042" level="1">Example 4. SAFT Modeling</heading><p id="p-0227" num="0197">Our SAFT model results indicated that all runs listed in Table 5 that were performed at 1,700 psi fell in the single liquid phase regime since even the 155&#xb0; C. run temperature was at least 50&#xb0; C. below the lower critical phase separation temperature (LCST). On the other hand, the runs performed at the nominal 600 psi reactor pressure were most often above the LCST and thus the polymers were made in a liquid-liquid biphasic reaction medium.</p><heading id="h-0043" level="1">Example 5. Rheological Testing&#x2014;Extensional Viscosity Response</heading><p id="p-0228" num="0198"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows, as an example, the extensional viscosity response of the inventive HDPE 26790-170. Two test runs of results for HDPE 26790-170 are shown, HDPE 26790-170 (1) 12 and HDPE 26790-170 (2) 14, with data points for each run indicated by circles, as compared to a reference HDPE 26790-170 (LVE) 16, indicated by a straight line. It can be seen from the two runs that the results for the inventive HDPE 26790-170 are reproducible. The upturn in viscosity at about 3 seconds indicates the presence of strain hardening in the resin, which is a direct rheological indication of long-chain branching (LCB). This direct measurement of long-chain branching was not always possible for all the samples listed in Tables 5A-5C due to sample sagging. Since sagging creates measurement problems in extensional rheology testing, the zero-shear-rate viscosity of the sample needs to be higher than 10,000 Pa&#xb7;s.</p><heading id="h-0044" level="1">Example 6. Rheological Testing&#x2014;Van-Gurp-Palmen Representations</heading><p id="p-0229" num="0199">For lower viscosity samples, where this condition was not met and thus sagging occurred, shear rheology and Van-Gurp-Palmen representations was used to detect the presence of long-chain branching. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows the Van-Gurp-Palmen plot of the inventive HDPE resin 26933-047 22 compared to a linear reference (Exceed 1018) 24. The inflexion point in the 26933-047 curve 22 signals the presence of long-chain branching.</p><p id="p-0230" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00009" num="00009"><table frame="none" colsep="0"

Determination of Long-Chain Branching</heading><p id="p-0236" num="0200">To determine the degree of LCB formation, two inventive LCB HDPE products, 26933-046 and 26933-047, were also analyzed by <sup>13</sup>C NMR following the method of L. Hou et al. (2012) Polymer, v.53, pg. 4329. Based on their Mn values, these polymers had about 2,814 and 2,322 C atoms, respectively. This NMR analysis yielded, respectively, 0.54 and 0.60 LCB/1000 C atoms in the polymer. These LCB concentrations correspond to LCB numbers of 1.5 and 1.4 per average polymer chain, respectively. It should be noted that the NMR method used will count all chains that contain more than four carbon atoms. Because of the statistical nature of the macromer incorporation in the currently disclosed process, the LCB chain length varies. Since the shorter LCB fraction is less effective or may even be ineffective in creating shear thinning, the NMR-based LCB count tends to be higher than what can be estimated from rheology data. This is why it is desirable for making the inventive LCB HDPE to have the minimum MW disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0237" num="0201">All documents described herein are incorporated by reference herein, including any priority documents and/or testing procedures to the extent they are not inconsistent with this text.
