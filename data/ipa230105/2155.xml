id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method handles malfunctioning vehicles on a track system constituting part of a storage and retrieval system configured to store a plurality of stacks of storage containers. The track system forms a grid pattern of adjacent cells. The storage and retrieval system includes a plurality of remotely operated vehicles configured to move laterally on the track system, wherein each of the plurality of remotely operated vehicles comprises driving wheels, and a control system for monitoring and controlling wirelessly movements of the plurality of remotely operated vehicles. The control system performs at least the following steps by wireless data communication: detecting an anomaly in an operational condition of a vehicle on the track system, registering the vehicle with the anomalous operational condition as a malfunctioning vehicle, registering a halt position of the malfunctioning vehicle relative to the supporting track system, and setting up a two-dimensional shutdown zone on the track system. The setting up a two-dimensional shutdown zone on the track system includes a malfunctioning vehicle zone including the halt position of the malfunctioning vehicle, and an entrance zone for entry into the malfunctioning vehicle zone. The entrance zone extends between the malfunctioning vehicle zone and a location at a periphery of the track system. The control system further performs ordering the remotely operated vehicles in operation within the shutdown zone to either move out of the shutdown zone, a halt or a combination thereof, and indicating allowance of entry into the entrance zone for an external operator by at least one of: unlocking a gateway at the periphery, and producing an entry-allowed signal registrable by a human operator located at the periphery such that the human operator may enter the entrance zone through the gateway.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="127.34mm" wi="158.75mm" file="US20230002156A1-20230105-D00000.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-D00001" he="201.85mm" wi="158.75mm" file="US20230002156A1-20230105-D00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-D00002" he="241.38mm" wi="166.37mm" file="US20230002156A1-20230105-D00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00003" num="00003"><img id="EMI-D00003" he="224.45mm" wi="181.53mm" file="US20230002156A1-20230105-D00003.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00004" num="00004"><img id="EMI-D00004" he="206.67mm" wi="168.66mm" file="US20230002156A1-20230105-D00004.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00005" num="00005"><img id="EMI-D00005" he="206.67mm" wi="161.97mm" file="US20230002156A1-20230105-D00005.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00006" num="00006"><img id="EMI-D00006" he="206.67mm" wi="170.01mm" file="US20230002156A1-20230105-D00006.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00007" num="00007"><img id="EMI-D00007" he="248.07mm" wi="182.71mm" file="US20230002156A1-20230105-D00007.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00008" num="00008"><img id="EMI-D00008" he="238.59mm" wi="173.91mm" file="US20230002156A1-20230105-D00008.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00009" num="00009"><img id="EMI-D00009" he="236.90mm" wi="151.81mm" file="US20230002156A1-20230105-D00009.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00010" num="00010"><img id="EMI-D00010" he="241.05mm" wi="173.40mm" file="US20230002156A1-20230105-D00010.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure></drawings><description id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method for handling malfunctioning vehicles on a track system constituting part of a storage and retrieval system configured to store a plurality of stacks of storage containers, a storage and retrieval system and a control system carrying out the method.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> discloses a typical prior art automated storage and retrieval system <b>1</b> with a framework structure <b>100</b> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref> discloses two different prior art container handling vehicles <b>250</b> suitable for operating on such a system <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The framework structure <b>100</b> comprises upright members <b>102</b>, horizontal members <b>103</b> and a storage volume comprising storage columns <b>105</b> arranged in rows between the upright members <b>102</b> and the horizontal members <b>103</b>.

INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The present invention is set forth and characterized in the independent claims, while the dependent claims describe other characteristics of the invention.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In a first aspect, the invention concerns a method for handling malfunctioning vehicles on a track system constituting part of an automated storage and retrieval system configured to store a plurality of stacks of storage containers.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The automated storage and retrieval system further comprises a plurality of remotely operated vehicles comprising driving wheels configured to move laterally on the track system, i.e. within a horizontal plane set up by the track system, and a control system for monitoring and controlling wirelessly movements of the plurality of remotely operated vehicles.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The method performs by wireless data communication with the control system at least the

malfunctioning vehicle zone including the halt position of the malfunctioning vehicle and</li>            <li id="ul0003-0002" num="0040">an entrance zone for entry into the malfunctioning vehicle

remotely operated vehicles in operation within the shutdown zone to either move out of the shutdown zone, to halt within the shutdown zone, or a combination thereof such that at least one operable remotely operated vehicle is moved out of the shutdown zone and/or at least one operable remotely operated vehicle is brought to halt.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0046">The indication of allowance of entry into the entrance zone of step F) may for example include that the gateway is automatically opened (partly or fully) such that the human operator can enter the entrance zone or that a lock on the gateway is opened allowing a human operator to open that gateway manually.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0047">The gateway should be understood as a gate or door which allows a human operator to enter the entrance zone when open/unlocked.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0048">The entry-allowed signal may be a visible and/or audio signal indicating that the human operator can safely enter the entrance zone. The visible signal may inter alia be a light, a raised flag, a changing screen or similar, while the audio signal may be one or more alarm tones or similar.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0049">The entry-allowed signal may be any signal registrable by a human operator, and preferably a human operator located outside the gateway. Examples of positions for such signals may be at the gateway and/or on the remotely operated vehicles and/or on the malfunctioning vehicle.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0050">The notification/transmittal of an entry-allowed signal may appear on a graphical user interface (GUI) of a computer connected to the control system informing the human operator that it is safe to enter the entrance zone. Also, or alternatively, a dedicated software may be uploaded on the computer allowing the human operator to inform the system when the service of the malfunctioning vehicle has been completed and the shutdown zone can be removed. The latter software may for example use the same GUI on which the entry-allowed signal is shown.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0051">The track system comprises a plurality of parallel tracks extending in a first direction X, and a plurality of tracks extending in a second direction Y which is orthogonal to the first direction X. The track system thereby forms a grid pattern of adjacent grid cells of equal size.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0052">When the control system orders the remotely operated vehicles to halt, the remotely operated vehicles which are moving can be ordered to use their brakes to stop the remotely operated vehicle followed by for example turning off the power supply to the driving wheels. Remotely operated vehicles which are already standing still may be ordered to turn off the power supply to the driving wheels such that the operable remotely operating vehicle cannot move.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0053">The control system thereby controls which operable remotely operated vehicles are brought to halt, if any, and which operable remotely operated vehicles are moved out of the shutdown zone, if any.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0054">Any remotely operated vehicle(s) ordered to move out of the shutdown zone may be further ordered to continue operating outside the shutdown zone or it may be ordered to halt at a specific location outside the shutdown zone.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0055">The control system may, in step B, register an anomaly in one or more operational conditions of the remotely operated vehicle on the track system, such as, for example, movement patterns, temperatures, temperature distribution, battery status, stability etc, to register the remotely operated vehicle(s) with the anomalous operational condition(s) as a malfunctioning vehicle(s).</p><p id="p-0047" num="0056">In an example of the present invention, where the malfunction of the remotely operated vehicle does not affect the movement of the wheels, the method may include, between method step B and C, transmitting a shutdown command to the malfunctioning vehicle bringing the malfunctioning vehicle to a halt.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0057">The remotely operated vehicles are configured to move laterally on the track system. Each of the remotely operated vehicles comprises driving wheels and are configured to move storage containers.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0058">The control system wirelessly monitors and controls movements of the plurality of remotely operated vehicles within the system.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0059">The size of the shutdown zone includes the size of the malfunctioning zone and the size of the entrance zone. The entrance zone may be extending from the periphery of the track system having the gateway to the malfunctioning vehicle zone comprising the malfunctioning vehicle. The size of the malfunctioning vehicle zone may be adapted by the control system to ensure adequate working space for maintenance work and/or replacement work. The size of the entrance zone may be adapted by the control system to ensure adequate space for a human operator, optionally located within a service vehicle, to move from the periphery of the track system to the malfunctioning vehicle zone. Thereby the shutdown zone provides no risk for a human operator being hit by one or more operating vehicles when entering or operating within shutdown zone. Hence, the shutdown zone is flexible in size and position.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0060">In an example the shutdown zone may have the size of the entire track system where the control system in method step E orders all the operable remotely operating vehicles in operation on the track system to turn off the power supply to the driving wheels bringing them to halt.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0061">The operable remotely operating vehicle(s) brought to halt by the control system may display a signal indicating that the power supply to the driving wheels has been switched off, thereby indicating that the operable remotely operating vehicle will not move. The signal may for example be a signal detectable by a human operator such as a visual signal or an audio signal.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0062">The malfunctioning vehicle may also display such a signal indicating that the remotely operated vehicle is malfunctioning and/or indicate that the power supply to the driving wheels has been switched off.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0063">In the example that the shutdown zone has the size of the entire track system, the signal indicating that the power supply to the driving wheels has been switch off indicates to the human operator that there is no risk for the human operator being hit by one or more remotely operated vehicles when entering or operating on the track system.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0064">The control system may be configured such that any transmission of signals for turning back on the power supply to the driving wheels of a halted operable remotely operated vehicle(s) within the shutdown zone and/or at the boundary of the shutdown zone, must be executed by at least one physical intervention of an external operator such as a human or robotic operator. The physical intervention may be turning on a mechanical switch/button and/or entering a specific code, or some other equivalent operation requiring a positive action performed by a human or robotic operator.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0065">In a further example, the method further involves, subsequent to step D, updating a movement pattern of any remotely operated vehicle in operation outside the shutdown zone during and after the time of setting up the shutdown zone such that entry into the shutdown zone is avoided. In other words, the control system may ensure dynamically rerouting of any operable remotely operated vehicle outside the shutdown zone avoiding physical impact with, directly or indirectly via a service vehicle and/or the human operator during movement within the shutdown zone.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0066">In another example, the method further involves that the service vehicle is guided to the halted malfunctioning vehicle via the entrance zone after step F. The service vehicle may be operated remotely by the control system or by a human operator.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0067">The service vehicle may be guided from the gateway into the shutdown zone. In an embodiment, the service vehicle may comprise one, preferably two, caterpillar track(s) configured to drive the service vehicle on top of the track system.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0068">In another example, the service vehicle may move the malfunctioning vehicle out of the track system through the gateway. After removal of the malfunctioning vehicle, the control system can instruct the operable remotely operated vehicles to continue their tasks.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0069">After setting up the shutdown zone and before ordering the remotely operated vehicles in operation within the shutdown zone to either move out of the shutdown zone, to halt or a combination thereof, the method may further involve:<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0070">rerouting a plurality of first operable remotely operated vehicles of the remotely operated vehicles operating on the supporting track system to a position located at an edge of the malfunctioning vehicle zone extending across the tracks of the track system, and</li>        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0071">transmitting one or more signals to the plurality of first operable remotely operated vehicles, bringing them to a halt thereby making a physical barrier of first remotely operated vehicles such that the physical barrier at least partly surrounds the malfunctioning vehicle.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0061" num="0072">Further, the method may involve<ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0073">rerouting a plurality of second operable remotely operated vehicles of the remotely operated vehicles to a position located at an edge of the entrance zone extending across the tracks of the track system and</li>        <li id="ul0008-0002" num="0074">transmitting one or more signals to the plurality of second operable remotely operated vehicles, bringing the plurality of second operable remotely operated vehicles to a halt.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0062" num="0075">In other words, the method may involve rerouting a plurality of operable remotely operated vehicles to a position located at an edge of the shutdown zone extending across the tracks of the track system and transmitting one or more signals to the plurality of said operable remotely operated vehicles, bringing the plurality of operable remotely operated vehicles to a halt thereby making a physical barrier of operable remotely operated vehicles such that the physical barrier at least partly surrounds the shutdown zone.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0076">When forming a physical barrier, the operable remotely operated vehicles may be arranged adjacent each other in a closed-pack formation, or they may be spaced apart but with a gap between them of less than the width of a vehicle, preferably the smallest width of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0077">The operable remotely operated vehicles may be arranged in more than one row along part or all of the edge of the malfunctioning vehicle zone, the entrance zone and/or the shutdown zone to form a physical barrier. The operable remotely operated vehicles may be arranged in an overlapping, staggered configuration along part or all of the edge of the malfunctioning vehicle zone, the entrance zone and/or the shutdown zone to form the physical barrier.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0078">Operable remotely operated vehicles should be understood as functioning remotely operated vehicles, thus not including the malfunctioning vehicle.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0079">Preferably, the number of first and second operable remotely operated vehicles being rerouted to the boundaries of the malfunctioning vehicle zone and the entrance zone is sufficient to create a physical barrier of vehicles around the entire shutdown zone with the exception of an opening at the periphery of the track system having a minimum size to allow the human operator and/or the service vehicle to move between the periphery of the track system and the malfunctioning vehicle. If there are insufficient first and second operable remotely operated vehicles to create a physical barrier around the shutdown zone, the shutdown zone may have the size of the entire track system that the malfunctioning vehicle is located on.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0080">The boundary of the malfunctioning vehicle zone, the entrance zone or shutdown zone may be defined as a location where the one or more remotely operated vehicles are located outside the relevant zone set by the control system, but with at least one outer extremity in the horizontal plane at a position at or near position coordinates of relevant zone.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0081">Alternatively, the one or more boundary defining remotely operated vehicles may be located inside the malfunctioning vehicle zone, the entrance zone or shutdown zone set by the control system, but with at least one outer extremity in the horizontal plane at a position at or near position coordinates of the relevant zone.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0082">In a second alternative configuration, the one or more boundary defining remotely operated vehicles may be located with their lateral center position on position coordinates of the relevant zone.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0083">The position coordinates of the malfunctioning vehicle zone, the entrance zone or shutdown zone are preferably based on the particular position of the grid cells in the horizontal plane. For example, position coordinate <b>15</b>,<b>20</b> may signify the location of the grid cell X=15 and Y=20 counted from a reference lateral corner of the track system. The malfunctioning vehicle zone, the entrance zone and/or shutdown zone are preferably defined in terms of integer numbers of grid cells, to maintain the grid geometry. However, they could also be defined in other ways as appropriate.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0084">In any case, operable remotely operated vehicles can be employed to form a physical barrier extending around in part the malfunctioning vehicle. These functioning remotely operated vehicles, halted on or adjacent the boundary of the malfunctioning vehicle zone, entrance zone and/or shutdown zone (e.g. just inside or just outside) may be referred to herein as &#x201c;boundary defining vehicles&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0085">When the boundary defining operable remotely operated vehicles are brought to a halt, additional means may be performed to optimize stability of the physical barrier such as maximizing contact with the underlying track system by lowering all sets of wheels (the wheels of a first set will block any tendency for the wheels of a second set to allow the vehicle to roll in a direction perpendicular to a rolling direction of the first set of wheels and vice versa) and/or to lower/raise a storage container to a midway position through the grid so that the storage container acts as a block within an opening of the grid cell. It may also be possible to arrange the boundary defining vehicles in several layers along the horizontal plane P or staggered, at least in places. For example, a second layer of boundary defining vehicles may partly overlap the boundary defining vehicles of an innermost layer to spread the forces in the event of an impact and/or boundary defining vehicles may be staggered to resist displacement of other boundary defining vehicles that are subject to the impact.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0086">In an embodiment of the automated storage and retrieval system, the track system is divided into a plurality of regions. In an exemplary embodiment the track system has a first track system region and a second track system region, where the second track system region forms the two-dimensional shutdown zone. A vehicle blocking barrier may be arranged between the first and the second track system regions. The vehicle blocking barrier comprises a vehicle passage with a minimum lateral width in the horizontal plane allowing one of the plurality of operable remotely operated vehicles to move between the first track system and the second track system via the vehicle passage. For such an embodiment the method may further involve rerouting of at least one of the plurality of operable remotely operated vehicles (not the malfunctioning vehicle) to a position within the vehicle passage and bringing the at least one operable remotely operated vehicle to a halt such that entry into the second track system region/shutdown zone is avoided. Thus, the rerouting of the operable remotely operated vehicle(s) may be seen to plug the gap in the vehicle blocking barrier, i.e. to block the vehicle passage.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0087">A minimum lateral width is hereinafter defined as a minimum one-dimensional size of an opening, e.g. perpendicular to the direction of a remotely operated vehicle corresponding to the width of the remotely operated vehicle when seen from above.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0088">In another exemplary embodiment the automated storage and retrieval system may comprise at least one fence building remotely operated vehicle which, after step E and before step F, can be ordered to enter the track system to build a fence at least partly surrounding the shutdown zone.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0089">The above-mentioned track systems may be any kind of track system allowing vehicles to move in the two disclosed dimensions X and Y, i.e. wherein the wheels of the remotely operated vehicles can be arranged to move between adjacent grid cells.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0090">In one exemplary embodiment of the automated storage and retrieval system of the invention, the track system may comprise grid cells of plates covering the horizontal extent of the grid cell thereby separating the tracks.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0091">In another preferred exemplary embodiment of the automated storage and retrieval system, the track system may be arranged on a rail system. The rail system may comprise a first set of parallel rails arranged in a horizontal plane and extending in a first direction X and a second set of parallel rails arranged in the horizontal plane and extending in a second direction Y which is orthogonal to the first direction , the first and second sets of rails forming the grid pattern in the horizontal plane comprising a plurality of adjacent grid cells. Each grid cell comprises a grid opening defined by a pair of adjacent rails of the first set of rails and a pair of adjacent rails of the second set of rails. Each rail of the rail system may preferably be of type double track rails but may also be of type single track rails or a combination of double track rails and single track rails.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0092">The rail system of the automated storage and retrieval system may in another exemplary embodiment be a transport rail system as disclosed in the background section on which a plurality of remotely operated vehicles are configured to move laterally. The transport rail system is arranged across the top of a framework structure wherein the framework structure comprises upright members, horizontal members and a storage volume comprising storage columns arranged in rows between the upright members and the horizontal members. In these storage columns storage containers, also known as bins, are stacked one on top of one another to form stacks. The upright and horizontal members may typically be made of metal, e.g. extruded aluminum profiles. The plurality of remotely operated vehicles operating on a transport rail system is hereinafter referred to as container handling vehicles.
