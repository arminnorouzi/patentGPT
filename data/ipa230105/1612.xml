Such a molding die can be used, for example, in the manufacture of seal parts that prevent leakage of fluid on the base material with a gasket. As the typical example of such seal parts, the seal parts for separators which are laminated on both sides of a membrane/electrode assembly (hereinafter referred to as MEA) in a fuel cell are well known. In the separator of the fuel cell, it is necessary to supply the fluid for the fuel cell (such as a fuel gas containing hydrogen and an oxidant gas containing oxygen) to the MEA so as not to leak to the outside, and the endless-shaped gasket serves to seal such fluid for the fuel cell in the space enclosed by the gasket.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic view of a seal part <b>1</b>&#x2032; for the separator of the fuel cell. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view of the seal part <b>1</b>&#x2032; shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, in the seal part <b>1</b>&#x2032;, an endless-shaped gasket <b>3</b> made of an elastic material and extending along a surface of a base material <b>2</b> is formed around a vent hole <b>2</b><i>b </i>on the surface of the plate-like base material <b>2</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a schematic cross section of the seal part <b>1</b>&#x2032; along the line AA&#x2032; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, and the gasket <b>3</b> is represented as four protrusions protruding from the surface of the base material <b>2</b>.

Since such a first intermediate portion and a second intermediate portion are interposed, although the gouging may occur in the molding material cured at the intermediate portion, it is unlikely that a gouging that exposes the surface of the base material will occur. Similarly, in the seal part of the present invention, the presence of the pedestal makes the gouging that exposes the surface of the base material less likely to occur. As a result, in the present invention, the deterioration of insulation property due to gouging is suppressed.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0007" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view of a molding die according to an embodiment of the present invention for molding an endless-shaped gasket made of an elastic material and extending along a surface of a base material.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an enlarged view of the periphery of the first intermediate portion in the cross-sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view showing a cross section of a seal part in the vicinity of the gate of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a seal part for the separator of the fuel cell.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view of the seal part shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view of a conventional molding die for molding a gasket on the surface of the base material.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows a gouging that occurs in a gasket.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0008" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Embodiments of the present invention will be described below with reference to the drawings.
