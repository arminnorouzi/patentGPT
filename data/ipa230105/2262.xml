PFAS were developed in the early 1940s to be used as refrigerants and flame retardants and in materials such as fabrics and food packaging, resulting in large quantities being introduced into the environment. In 1969, they became the dominant agent for fighting fires at airports and military installations to meet MIL-F-24385 specifications. For example, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), one of the most widely used PFAS compounds, has been used as a refrigerant, in fabrics and food packaging, and as a flame retardant at airports and military installations.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The widespread applications of PFAS have led to large-scale contamination of soil and groundwater throughout the world. The presence of perfluorinated chemicals in food, human serum, groundwater, and various animal species is of great concern due to their deleterious impacts on environmental and human health. It has negative impacts on human and ecosystem health and has been detected in blood serum. Based on toxicity tests and risk assessments, the USEPA set an interim health advisory level at 0.004 ppt of PFOA, 0.02 ppt of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), final health advisory at 10 ppt of GenX chemicals and 2000 ppt of PFBS for drinking water. The primary producers of PFOA and PFOS are fluoropolymer and ammonium salt of perfluorooctanoic acid manufacturers, who are responsible for the release of &#x2dc;85% of all PFAS.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Adsorption and filtration are the most common approaches for removing PFAS from groundwater in practice today. These approaches do not destroy PFAS. Further processing is needed to dispose of the concentrated PFAS. Destroying or converting PFAS to less-toxic compounds would be more sustainable. The key challenge for destroying PFAS lies in their notorious recalcitrance that is linked to the high dissociation energy (440.99 kJ/mole) of the carbon-fluorine (C&#x2014;F) bond. Although biodegradation of some PFAS has been reported, slow rates (typically over 100 days for substantial depletion or no F<sup>&#x2212; </sup>detected) hinder practical applications. Other destruction methods, such as sonication, thermal treatment, and chemical oxidation, are able to break the C&#x2014;F bonds, but they generally require high investment costs and a high requirement for energy, temperature, or pressure, and they often give rise to hazardous secondary pollution. Only a few studies reported the alternative reductive defluorination using chemical reducing agents like ZVI (zero-valent iron) or titanium (III) citrate for PFAS removal. These reductive methods are hindered by low efficiency or activity, secondary contaminants, and poorly understood mechanisms.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, novel methods of removing PFAS contaminants are needed. PFAS treatment methods that overcome these crucial roadblocks would be major benefits for the ammunition-related water/wastewater-treatment industry.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The disclosure relates to methods related to the removal of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from contaminated water or wastewater and to systems for the practice of such methods. In some aspects, the methods are directed to the formation of a catalyst film capable of reduction defluorination of PFAS. In other aspects, the methods are directed to the formation of a biofilm that metabolizes less fluorinated counterparts of PFAS. The described systems for the removal of PFAS is synergistic system comprising a reactor with a catalyst film that reduces PFAS to less fluorinated counterparts of PFAS and a reactor with a biofilm that metabolizes less fluorinated counterparts of PFAS into CO<sub>2</sub>.

More specifically, the method involves H<sub>2</sub>-induced defluorination of PFOA coupled to biodegradation of less fluorinated octanoic acid by microorganisms.

Similar to other hydrodehalogenating processes, PFOA was adsorbed on the Pd<sup>0 </sup>surface, and the F in each C&#x2014;F bond was replaced by an adjacent activated H atom (H<sub>ads</sub>*), which also was adsorbed on the Pd<sup>0 </sup>surface via H<sub>2 </sub>dissociation. A bench-scale membrane catalyst-film reactor (MCfR) was used to examine PFOA removal and defluorination. The MCfR enabled reliable and controllable supply of H<sub>2 </sub>in the bubble-free form through nonporous membranes, onto which Pd<sup>0 </sup>nanoparticles were spontaneously synthesized and deposited at ambient temperature with high stability and longevity. In particular, the roles of PFOA adsorption and H<sub>2</sub>-driven defluorination were studied using relatively high concentrations of PFOA removal in the batch-mode MCfRs. Long-term continuous removal of PFOA at environmentally relevant concentrations in a continuously operated MCfR were also evaluated.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0085">a.

After 6 days, N<sub>2 </sub>was replaced with H<sub>2</sub>, but F<sup>&#x2212; </sup>release was not observed for the following 6 days.

The system was then re-spiked 0.01 mM PFOA, and &#x3e;99% PFOA removal along with 46% defluorination was observed within 50 hours.

Mechanistic Interpretation of the Batch Results</p><p id="p-0144" num="0130">Overall, the batch results identify two distinct adsorption patterns involved in PFOA removal by Pd<sup>0</sup>: H<sub>ads</sub>*-independent non-reactive adsorption and H<sub>ads</sub>*-dependent reactive (defluorinating) adsorption. The two adsorption patterns are associated not only with H<sub>ads</sub>*, but also with different adsorptive positions and orientations.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0131">The hypothesis of different adsorption orientations is based on DFT modeling, whose results are summarized in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>D</figref>. Because reported pK<sub>a </sub>values for PFOA are &#x2264;2.8, PFOA predominantly exists in the deprotonated form as the C<sub>7</sub>F<sub>15</sub>COO<sup>&#x2212; </sup>anion. DFT calculations reveal that, when H<sub>2 </sub>is absent (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>C</figref>), C<sub>7</sub>F<sub>15</sub>COO<sup>&#x2212; </sup>tends to bind to active Pd<sup>0 </sup>sites in a perpendicular orientation, because of its more favorable adsorption energy (&#x394;E<sub>Pd/PFOA</sub><sup>ads</sup>=&#x2212;1.28 eV) when a metal-oxygen bond can form compared to a parallel orientation (&#x394;E<sub>Pd/PFOA</sub><sup>ads</sup>=&#x2212;0.79 eV) characteristic of physisorption. The non-reactive adsorption occurs through the carboxylate head group of PFOA binding via chemisorption by the formation of a Pd&#x2014;O complex. The tail group is oriented off the surface, which keeps C&#x2014;F bonds away from the Pd surface and thus minimizes chances of contact-based hydrodefluorination even when H<sub>ads</sub>* is introduced.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0132">In contrast, when H<sub>2 </sub>is present (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>B and <b>4</b>D</figref>), the high amounts of H<sub>ads</sub>* on the surface block Pd&#x2014;O bond formation, which favors parallel binding orientation (&#x394;E<sub>Pd/PFOA</sub><sup>ads</sup>=&#x2212;0.75 eV, compared to &#x2212;0.32 eV for the perpendicular orientation) through van der Waals attraction. Parallel adsorption allows maximum contact of C&#x2014;F bonds and H<sub>ads</sub>* on Pd<sup>0 </sup>surface, which promotes catalytic reduction of PFOA via surface H addition or F/H substitution. After the reaction, defluorinated products and fluoride desorb from Pd surface, which frees Pd<sup>0 </sup>active sites for continued defluorinative adsorption of PFOA. This DFT-based atomistic-scale insight into PFOA adsorption on the Pd<sup>0 </sup>surface agrees with the adsorption trends observed experimentally.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0133">d.

On the one hand, the results reinforce that PFOA in the H<sub>2</sub>-MCfR was mainly removed through defluorinative adsorption that led to the desorption of F<sup>&#x2212; </sup>and defluorinated products,<sup>25, 49 </sup>which freed the active site with H<sub>ads</sub>* for further reductive defluorination of PFOA from the bulk liquid. On the other hand, the gradual slowing of PFOA removal and defluorination rates (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>D</figref>) suggests that active sites were becoming deactivated, probably due to the co-occurrence of non-defluorinative adsorption along with the defluorinative adsorption of PFOA.

In stage 1-4, featuring 0.5 mM OA and 0.01 mM 2-FOA in the influent, the removal of 2-FOA was stable at about 99% for more than 10 days. The results reveal that continuous substantial removal of 2-FOA with OA as primary substrate was possible for a long-term steady state. It documents that a high level of defluorination makes the fluorinated species biodegradable.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0149">After stages 1-1 to 1-4, the mono-fluorinated 2-FOA was replaced with trideca-fluorinated 1,1-dihydro-perfluorinated OA (2H-PFOA, PFOA with two Fs replaced by two Hs) at different concentrations in Stages 2 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>) to test the effects of a more fluorinated OA on the biofilm. At the end of Stage 2-2, OA removal remained &#x3e;99%, while 2H-PFOA removal gradually increased to 15% along with 1.0 &#x3bc;M of released F<sup>&#x2212; </sup>(13% of the total F in the removed 2H-PFOA). In Stages 2-2, the influent concentration of OA was decreased to 0.1 mM for a higher 2H-PFOA/OA mole ratio to 1/20 in order to selectively enrich 2H-PFOA-oxidizing bacteria. OA removal remained &#x3e;99% throughout the stage, while 2H-PFOA removal remained 16% at the end of the stage, with no significant improvement of the 2H-PFOA biodegradability from Stage 2-2. In Stage 2-4, OA was removed from the influent to selectively enrich the functional bacteria capable of degrading highly fluorinated OA without OA. In the last two weeks, a &#x2dc;24% slowdown of 2H-PFOA removal and F<sup>&#x2212; </sup>release was observed, probably caused by biomass loss for energy deficiency (90% less energy input without OA). The trend reinforces that a primary substrate (like OA) is crucial to support biofilm growth and the initial steps of reductive defluorination.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0150">In stage 2-5, the system was added back 0.1 mM OA to the influent as the primary substrate to support the biofilm growth and 2H-PFOA biodegradation. In the first 6 days, the removal of OA increased from 55% to over 99%, which indicated that the biofilm still was capable of utilizing OA as carbon and energy source, but it needed to have new synthesis to regain its early performance for OA removal; this coincides with our explanation of the gradual loss of 2H-PFOA removal. The released F<sup>&#x2212; </sup>concentration also increased from 1.8 to 8.6 &#x3bc;M, which accounts for about 14% of the total fluorine in the removed 2H-PFOA.

The released F<sup>&#x2212; </sup>concentration was 8.6 &#x3bc;M, which accounts for about 14% of the total fluorine in the removed 2H-PFOA. The latest molar ratio of released F<sup>&#x2212; </sup>to removed 2H-PFOA was about 1.8. The effluent concentration of PFOA was decreased by &#x3c;8% of the influent during the initial 14 days, but it gradually increased back to 97% of the influent. This suggests initial adsorption followed by desorption of PFOA to the reactor material or the biofilm. Overall, the 28-day results of Stage 2-6 reveal that PFOA probably was not biodegraded, but its presence had no acute effect on biodegradation of partial- or non-fluorinated OA.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0152">In stage 2-7, 2H-PFOA was removed from the influent, which left 10 &#x3bc;M PFOA and 100 &#x3bc;M OA as the substrates.

The effluent concentration of F<sup>&#x2212; </sup>was constantly below 0.1 &#x3bc;M, indicating that PFOA was not defluorinated through biodegradation in O<sub>2</sub>-MBfR. In stage 2-8, the PFOA in influent was removed and 10 &#x3bc;M 2H-PFOA added. The removal of OA did not change, staying over 99%. Within one day after 2H-PFOA re-introduction, the 2H-PFOA removal bounced back to 40%, and the system soon reached steady-state for 48% removal (or a flux of 18.3 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/d). Accordingly, the released F<sup>&#x2212; </sup>concentration reached 8.6 &#x3bc;M, which accounts for about 14% of the total fluorine in the removed 2H-PFOA, or 1.8 of the molar ratio of released F<sup>&#x2212; </sup>to removed 2H-PFOA; these values are close to those in the previous 2H-PFOA stage (Stage 2-6) before the PFOA test. Overall, the 14-day results of Stage 2-8 reveal that the biofilm maintained its capability of 2H-PFOA biodegradation and was ready for PFOA reductive defluorination products biodegradation tests.<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0153">3. Synergistic Operation of Both Catalytic Reductive Dechlorination and Oxidative Biodegradation</li></ul></p><p id="p-0170" num="0154">In this example, after achieving stable reductive defluorination of PFOA in the H<sub>2</sub>-MPfR and biodegradation of octanoic acid in the O<sub>2</sub>-MBfR, the two parts were connected the two reactors by linking the effluent tube of H<sub>2</sub>-MPfR to the influent tube of O<sub>2</sub>-MBfR; this is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>. In the synergistic system, PFOA was reductively defluorinated in H<sub>2</sub>-MPfR and converted to less- or none-fluorinated octanoic acid. The defluorinated products were further oxidize in the O<sub>2</sub>-MBfR by the biofilm with or without octanoic acid as extra substrate.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0155">To test the synergistic operation, the O<sub>2</sub>-MBfR was fed with the H<sub>2</sub>-MPfR effluent solution featuring 7 &#x3bc;M remaining PFOA, 2 &#x3bc;M F<sup>&#x2212;</sup>, and unidentified defluorinated products (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>). 0.1 mM OA was added in the solution as the primary electron donor. The removal of OA did not change, staying over 99%; this confirms that the products from H<sub>2</sub>-MPfR had no observable inhibition on OA biodegradation. After two months enrichment, the effluent F<sup>&#x2212; </sup>changes (difference between influent and effluent concentration) gradually increased from 1.5 &#x3bc;M to 2.0 &#x3bc;M and reached steady-state, indicating that the biofilm needed time to adapt to the new substrates (products of H<sub>2</sub>-based defluorination). According to HPLC-MS-MS results of O<sub>2</sub>-MBfR effluent from day 524 to 538 (first two weeks of stage 3-1), the dominant shorter chain per-fluorinated carboxylic acid (as determined by relatively high peak area) was perfluorohexanoic acid (C6) with trace-level heptafluorobutyric acid (C4). These two biodegradation products indicate that the defluorinated products in the collected H<sub>2</sub>-MPfR effluent could be 2H-PFOA and 6H-PFOA:</p><p id="p-0172" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>C<sub>8</sub>HF<sub>15</sub>O<sub>2</sub>+2H<sub>2</sub>&#x2192;C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>3</sub>F<sub>13</sub>O<sub>2</sub>+2HF<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0173" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>C<sub>8</sub>HF<sub>15</sub>O<sub>2</sub>+6H<sub>2</sub>&#x2192;C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>7</sub>F<sub>9</sub>O<sub>2*</sub>+6HF<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0174" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>3</sub>F<sub>13</sub>O<sub>2</sub>+2O<sub>2</sub>&#x2192;C<sub>6</sub>HF<sub>11</sub>O<sub>2</sub>+2HF+2CO<sub>2</sub><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0175" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>7</sub>F<sub>9</sub>O<sub>2</sub>+5O<sub>2</sub>&#x2192;C<sub>4</sub>HF<sub>7</sub>O<sub>2</sub>+2HF+4CO<sub>2</sub>+2H<sub>2</sub>O<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0176" num="0000">Other highly defluorinated products, like monofluorooctanoic acid and difluorooctanoic acid, also could be completely mineralized in the O<sub>2</sub>-MBfR.
