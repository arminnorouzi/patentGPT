In this structure, the cover member substantially covers the entire portion of the substrate including the light emitting surface except for the power supply portion. According to the structure, it provides the excellent water proof and dust proof, and in addition, connection of the light transmission member integrated with the cover member becomes strong, so that it is possible to eliminate a situation that the light transmission member is accidentally removed.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">(b) The light transmission member is formed in an elongated shape or a convex shape. In this structure, in case the light transmission member is formed in an elongated shape, as a light emission aspect, it is possible to form a new type utilizing the light transmission member, and in case the light transmission member is formed with the convex shape, it is good as a point lighting device.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">(c) The light transmission member has flexibility. In this structure, it is possible to arrange according a shape of a member to be attached, and freedom of the arrangement can be enlarged.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">(d) The cover member and the light transmission member are formed of a polyolefin type polymer. In this structure, it is possible to provide excellent characteristics superior in heat resistance and high transparency and optical characteristics. As a polyolefin type polymer, polycarbonate, acryl, polyamide, polyurethane and so on are exemplified. More preferably, cycloolefin polymer (COP) and the similar resin excellent in heat resistance and high transparency in addition to optical characteristics are preferred.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">(e) The light transmission member is arranged at an energy supply port, which is a power supply port or a fuel supply port provided at a vehicle exterior portion. This structure specifies a structure of the first embodiment explained later. According to the structure, it is possible to arrange the best lighting aspect according to the shape of the power supply opening, and to provide the excellent illuminating effect and novelty. But, in the lighting device, the device may be sufficient to adapt to the vehicle exterior member or interior member, and it is preferable, for example, for a head light, fog light, combination lamp, winker light and interior light.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">(f) The cover member is integrated with an insertion portion inserted into an attachment hole provided in a body panel or door panel, and an engaging portion to prevent extraction of the insertion portion from the attachment hole. This structure specifies the structure of the second embodiment explained later.

In the explanation, the first embodiment of the LED lighting device and its modified examples 1 and 2, and the second embodiment and its modified examples are clarified together with the operations.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">(First embodiment) The LED lighting device <b>1</b> of the first embodiment is the same as the Patent Document 1 in that the device comprises, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>(<i>a</i>) to <b>2</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref>, a transparent cover member <b>8</b> covering an LED element <b>3</b> mounted on a substrate <b>2</b> and a light emitting surface of the LED element <b>3</b>, and a light transmission member <b>9</b> operating as a light transmit path where emitted light from the light emitting surface of the LED element <b>3</b> is introduced from a light introducing end. The improved point is best specified as an exterior portion and an interior portion of the vehicle as the development goal of the LED lighting device <b>1</b>, and resides in that the light transmission member <b>9</b> is integrally formed with the LED element <b>3</b> mounted on the substrate by using a transparent resin same as the cover member <b>8</b>, namely formed by an insert molding in a state that the LED structure is arranged in the insert molding <b>30</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Here, &#x201c;the LED element <b>3</b> mounted on the substrate <b>2</b>&#x201d; is call an LED structure as required. The LED structure includes, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>(<i>a</i>) to <b>3</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref>, the substrate <b>2</b> in a rectangular shape formed of ceramics and so on, the LED element <b>3</b> as an lighting element and a resistor <b>4</b> mounted on an upper surface of the substrate <b>2</b>, and a connector <b>5</b> and so on integrally mounted under the substrate. The substrate <b>2</b> is printed with a wiring pattern, not shown, wherein the LED element <b>3</b> and the resister <b>4</b> are mounted on the fixed positions of the wiring pattern. The LED element <b>3</b> is a light emitting element called as a front mounting type.

The connector <b>5</b> includes a pair of power supply pins <b>7</b>, <b>7</b> in the form of pins mounted through an insulating material <b>6</b> in a holder, and outer power is supplies through the power supply pins <b>7</b>. Then, the LED element <b>3</b> emits light with a voltage supplied through the resister <b>4</b>. Numeral <b>7</b><i>a </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref> is an end of the power supply pin projecting on an upper surface of the substrate.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref> schematically show part of injection mold <b>30</b> forming an injection molding machine integrally molding the LED structure by an insert molding of the cover member <b>8</b> and the light transmission member <b>9</b>. The injection mold <b>30</b> is formed of a plurality of divided molds, and divides and forms an insertion space for inserting the LED structure and an injection space corresponding to the cover member <b>8</b> and the light transmission member <b>9</b>, namely a cavity <b>31</b>. And, in a state that the LED structure is inserted into the insertion space, the cavity <b>31</b> is high pressure injected with a molten transparent resin from a nozzle, not shown, of the injection molding machine through a spool and so on. On the left side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the transparent resin injected is shown with black for easy understanding. Thereafter, the injection molded article becomes, by releasing, the LED lighting device, as shown in the right side of FIG. <b>5</b>, where the LED structure is integrated with the cover member <b>8</b> and the light transmission member <b>9</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The resin to be used is, among thermoplastic resins, as cycloolefin type polymer, especially, polyolefin type polymer (COP) and a similar resin. In the COP, cycloolefin units join randomly or alternately with polymer skeletons, and polymer is amorphous. As the material characteristics, it shows excellent high optical transparency, heat resistance, low shrinkability, low hygroscopicity, and flexibility. In this example, the cover member <b>8</b> and the light transmission member <b>9</b> are formed using COP in the name of ZEONOR (registered trademark) of Nihon Zeon Co., Ltd.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref> and the right side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the cover member <b>8</b> covers, together with the light emitting surface of the LED element <b>3</b>, an upper face of the substrate <b>2</b> to a side and a lower side, except for the electricity supply portion. Numeral <b>8</b><i>a </i>is an upper side cover member coving the upper side of the substrate <b>2</b>, numeral <b>8</b><i>b </i>is a side cover member covering a surrounding area of the substrate <b>2</b>, and <b>8</b><i>c </i>is a lower side cover member covering a lower side of the substrate <b>2</b>. Numerals <b>8</b><i>d </i>and <b>8</b><i>e </i>are protruding portions due to existence of the resistance <b>4</b> and a base end <b>7</b><i>a </i>of the electricity pin, numeral <b>8</b><i>f </i>is, in the lower covering portion, a protruding portion due to existence of the solder SD to fix the resistance <b>4</b> to the substrate <b>2</b>, and numeral <b>8</b><i>g </i>is a cover portion covering the lower side of the connector <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The light transmission member <b>9</b> has a long shape, in the upper side cover member <b>8</b><i>a, </i>extending in an elongated condition in a state integrally joined at a portion covering the light emitting surface in the LED element <b>3</b>. Also, the light transmission member <b>9</b> is rectangle in a section, and has flexibility formed as a whole in a ring shape. And, in the light transmission member <b>9</b>, a portion covering the light emitting surface of the LED element <b>3</b> is a light introducing end <b>9</b><i>a, </i>an end on the opposite side is a light emitting end <b>9</b><i>b, </i>and a portion between the both ends <b>9</b><i>a, </i><b>9</b><i>b </i>introducing the emitted light from the light emitting surface of the LED element <b>3</b> and leading the light to the light emitting end <b>9</b><i>b </i>becomes a light transfer path. In this example, as explained later, the light transmission member <b>9</b> makes the shape of the light transmission member clearly recognized, such as a ring shape, not a spot, due to radiance of the light transfer path transferring the emitted light of the LED element <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Here, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>(<i>a</i>) to <b>6</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref> show an example using the LED lighting device. In the example, the LED lighting device <b>1</b> is used at an energy supply port <b>10</b> which is an power supply port provided in a vehicle. The energy supply port <b>10</b> is provided, shown in simple, at a concave portion opened and closed by a lid, not shown, formed at a rear wall of a body of the electric vehicle which is an exterior of the vehicle. In the concave portion, a charging port <b>20</b> of a connector for electric charge contacted by a charging gun on the electric supply side is arranged to be exposed. The case <b>11</b> includes a cover <b>18</b> rotated around a hinge <b>19</b>, wherein the charging port <b>20</b> is exposed in the open condition of the cover <b>18</b>, and closed in the closed condition of the cover <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Incidentally, this kind of structure is disclosed in, for example, Japanese Patent Publication No. 2012-226873. However, the publication has a structure, wherein a light source illuminating the charging port <b>20</b> is arranged at an outside of the charging port, and illuminates through a through hole provided on a hinge base portion side of the cover or an engaging portion side for engaging or disengaging the cover, so that for example, when a charging operation is made at a dark condition, the charging gun cannot be accurately and promptly contacted to the charging port. The LED lighting device <b>1</b> of the embodiment is best for the structure solving the above problem.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Namely, a case <b>11</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>(<i>a</i>) to <b>6</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref> is provided with a flange <b>12</b> projecting at an upper edge, and includes a transparent portion <b>17</b> formed in a ring shape on an inner peripheral side relative to the flange <b>12</b>, a vertical wall <b>13</b> projecting at the flange rear face and defining a groove portion <b>15</b> with respect to a surrounding wall of the case <b>11</b>, a plurality of engaging portions <b>13</b><i>a </i>provided at a low end of the vertical wall <b>13</b> and supporting slipping of the light transmission member <b>9</b> arranged in the groove portion <b>15</b>, and a frame portion <b>16</b> provided on one end side of the vertical wall <b>13</b> and attaching the substrate <b>2</b> and the connector <b>5</b> forming the LED lighting device <b>1</b>. The transparent portion <b>17</b> is formed, for example, when forming the case <b>11</b> by an injection molding, by two color molding as a wall portion with transparent or milky color. Numeral <b>14</b> is a positioning shaft <b>14</b> projecting from the flange rear face.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">And, in this structure, in the LED lighting device <b>1</b>, a substrate <b>2</b> side and the connector <b>5</b> are engaged with the flame portion <b>16</b>, and the light transmission member <b>9</b> is engaged and held relative to the groove portion <b>15</b> through the engaging portion <b>13</b><i>a. </i>In the holding condition of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref>, when the LED lighting device <b>1</b> is supplied with power from a stabilizing device through the respective power supply pins <b>7</b> and the resister <b>4</b>, the LED element <b>3</b> illuminates by the voltage thereof. In this structure, emitted light from the light emitting surface of the LED element <b>3</b> is introduced from the light introducing end <b>9</b><i>a, </i>advances through the light transmission member <b>9</b> as the light transfer path, and arrives at the light emitting end <b>9</b><i>b </i>to be emitted outside. For this reason, as the case <b>10</b> defining the energy supply portion, the light transmission member <b>9</b> is illuminated as the light transfer path, and the light thereof makes the outline of the charging part <b>20</b> to recognize through the transparent and milky wall portion which is the transparent portion <b>17</b>, so that the charging gun at the power supply device side can be quickly and accurately connected to the charging port <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">(Operation) Next, the main operation or advantages of the above LED lighting device are clarified. First, since the light emitting surface of the LED element <b>3</b> is covered by the cover member <b>8</b>, and the light transmission member <b>9</b> is integrally formed with the cover member <b>8</b>, an assembly work of the light transmission member <b>9</b> to the conventional LED structure is skipped, and the advantages of excellent water proof and dust proof are obtained. Also, since the light transmission member <b>9</b> is integrally formed with the cover member <b>8</b> covering substantially the entire part of the substrate <b>2</b>, connecting condition with the cover member can be stably maintained. These advantages prevent accidental failure in advance in case the LED lighting device <b>1</b> is used in exterior as well as interior, so that quality and reliability are improved.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Also, since the light transmission member <b>9</b> is long and has flexibility, as shown in the using example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>(<i>a</i>)-<b>6</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref>, it is possible to arrange according to a shape of a portion to be attached, so that the arrangement thereof is enlarged. Specifically, as the LED lighting device <b>1</b>, the light transmission member <b>9</b> illuminates the outline in the ring shape, not a spot, through the transparent portion <b>17</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>(<i>a</i>) to <b>6</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref> by the brightness of the light transfer path transferring the emitted light of the LED element <b>3</b>, so that, for example, the charging gun can be surely and accurately connected to the charging part <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">(Two modified examples of the first embodiment) <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>(<i>a</i>) and <b>7</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref> show modified examples 1 and 2 where the shapes of the light transfer member forming the above LED lighting device are changed. In the explanation, members and portions same as the above embodiment are assigned with the same numerals to eliminate double explanation, and changing portions are only explained.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">A light transmission member <b>9</b>A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref> is formed in a straight stick shape with a rectangular cross section. On the other hand, a light transmission member <b>9</b>B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref> is formed to be curved in an L-shape at the front side with a rectangular cross section. These devices are supposed to be attached to an exterior of a vehicle, for a light of a winker, a light of a door mirror, a light inside a bonnet or passenger compartment. The shape of the light transmission member <b>9</b> can be made other than this, and can be designed as desired according to an object to be used and a portion to be arranged.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">(Second embodiment) The LED lighting device <b>1</b>A of the second embodiment of the invention has, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>(<i>a</i>) to <b>9</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref>, a structure also serves as a hole cap or a hole plug, which is attachable or detachable relative to an attachment hole provide in a vehicle body or a panel <b>25</b> of a door.

The engaging claw <b>8</b><i>i </i>projects on the outer periphery of the insertion portion <b>8</b><i>h. </i>As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b><i>c</i></figref>, the engaging claw <b>8</b><i>i </i>changes with a reduction of a diameter in a course of inserting the insertion portion <b>8</b><i>h </i>into the attachment hole <b>25</b><i>a, </i>and when passing the attachment hole <b>25</b><i>a, </i>it elastically returns to the original condition, to elastically engage the attachment hole <b>25</b><i>a </i>to prevent extraction thereof. Incidentally, the engagement claw <b>8</b><i>i </i>projects around the entirely circumference, but it may have a structure such that the engagement claw <b>8</b><i>i </i>projects at plural portions.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">A light transmission member <b>9</b>A is integrated in a projecting shape at a portion covering the light emitting surface of the LED element <b>3</b> in the upper cover member <b>8</b><i>a. </i>And, in the light transmission member <b>9</b>A, an inside covering the light face of the LED element <b>3</b> is a light inlet end, and an outer end is a plan light emitting end <b>9</b><i>a, </i>wherein the emitted light from the ejecting face of the LED element <b>3</b> is introduced from the light inlet end, and the light is illuminated outwardly from the light emitting end.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The above LED lighting device <b>1</b>A, as one example, is combined with the hole cap or the hole plug, and improves safety, when the door is opened, by alarming a person or a car from the back to recognize an opening condition of the door by illuminating light from the LED element through the light transmission member <b>9</b><i>a. </i>In this respect, the LED lighting device <b>1</b>A is the same as the Patent Document 2, but when comparing with the Patent Document 2, it can provide easily at a lower cost.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">(Modified example of the second embodiment) <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>(<i>b</i>) and <b>10</b>(<i>a</i>)-<b>10</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref> show modified examples omitting the shape of the cover member and the connector <b>5</b> forming the LED lighting device <b>1</b>A.
