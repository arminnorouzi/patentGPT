id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">A mascara application system includes two brushes on wands, biased together, requiring force by fingers to separate brushes. Once open or separated, brushes can be positioned on opposite sides (surfaces, top and bottom) of an eyelash (speaking of the entire lash, not individual fibers). Upon release of the force, brushes close on each other, with no affirmative force required to keep them together, fingers now free to manipulate by holding, rolling, drawing, or otherwise controlling the handle portion. A receptacle portion containing mascara product may receive, and seal the applicator with or without relative rotation, depending on the embodiment. The best functional embodiment requires no rotation of the squeegee seal, but instead causes the squeegee to move brushes and wands radially outward with limited movement (toggling) in almost any direction when partially withdrawn through the squeegee.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="140.46mm" wi="93.13mm"

Originally, mascara was applied to eyelashes with applicators made of bone and ivory. The modern applicator wand was developed in the 1960s, and efforts have continued to make better applicators. Various types of brushes have been devised. Fat brushes create voluptuous, voluminous lashes; skinny brushes coat each lash perfectly while separating and not clumping (adhering together individual lash hairs, fibers); and curved wands help curl lashes.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Many technological advances have shaped the industry, from adding fibers or supplementing formulations with collagen and keratin, to creating uniquely shaped brushes, to &#x201c;notice-me&#x201d; packaging that enhances product attributes and entices consumers to purchase. However, the basic structure of a wand applicator, with a single brush, has remained essentially unchanged. Accordingly, the proper application of mascara typically involves separately coating the upper and under sides of a top lash, using only one wand and one brush.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Mascara is the universally, most-preferred cosmetic. It is also the most time-consuming cosmetic to adequately apply. The three main features a consumer wants from her mascara and applicator are volume, length and separation, each of which may require a different type of applicator. Some cosmetic companies offer dual-ended mascara containers, with one brush on either end to try to facilitate different ones of these three purposes.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">This disclosure relates to mascara application systems that include applicators with two brushes. Mascara is held in a receptacle portion of a container into which brushes are inserted to be loaded with mascara. Applicators with handle portions, held in a cap portion of the container, space the brushes apart from one another when pressure is applied to the handle portion. The brushes are positioned adjacent to one another, actually interleaving, when no pressure is applied to counter the bias force tending to push the brushes together. This countering force may be applied by a user to the handle portion or to the wands holding the brushes.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A dual brush mascara applicator according to one embodiment comprises a handle including a first arm and a second arm. At one end, each of the first arm and the second arm includes a handle portion. At the opposite end, each of the first arm and the second arm includes an applicator end. A first mascara brush is positioned at or on the applicator end of the first arm, and a second mascara brush is positioned at or on the applicator end of the second arm. The first arm crosses the second arm so that transverse movement of the handle portion of the first arm relative to the handle portion of the second arm causes an opposite transverse movement of the first brush relative to the second brush.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Alternatively, a pair of uncrossed arms may be biased toward one another. This may provide less material available to deflect, causing early failure.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The dual brush mascara applicator may further include a mascara container including a first opening for the first brush, a second opening for the second brush, and squeegee attachments associated with the first and second openings for removing excess mascara from the first and second brushes.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The dual brush mascara applicator may also include an applicator container for the handle portions of the first and second arms. The applicator container may include a movable member for applying transverse force to the first arm and/or the second arm to cause transverse movement of the first arm and/or the second arm.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Methods for applying mascara are also disclosed. In such a method, with the brushes in an open arrangement (i.e., spaced apart from one another), they may be placed on opposite sides of lashes to which mascara is to be applied. Once the brushes are in place, they may be placed in a closed arrangement (i.e., against one another), enabling the two brushes to engage the lashes, and to work together for easy application of mascara to the eyelashes.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Other features, as well as various features and advantages, of the disclosed subject matter will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art through consideration of the ensuing description, the accompanying drawings and the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;reverse tweezers&#x201d; or &#x201c;reverse action&#x201d; refer to apparatuses that include a mechanism that causes separate tips at one end of the apparatus to move away from one another as corresponding handle portions at an opposite end of the apparatus are pushed transversely towards each other. Conversely, the release of the transverse force that was pushing adjacent handle portions of the apparatus together results in causing movement of the tips of the apparatus towards each other.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">A mascara applicator that incorporates these features includes two brushes mounted on a handle that operates by a reverse tweezers action. Each of the arms of the handle includes a handle portion at one end and a wand at the other end. The brushes of such an applicator, which are located at ends of the wands, may work together in tandem to simultaneously apply mascara to the upper and under sides of a top lash.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Mascara may be applied to the brushes in a mascara container that has separate, adjacent (e.g., parallel, etc.) ports to accept each wand and its corresponding brush. In the reverse tweezers mechanism, the two wands are connected together so that the brushes are normally (when the applicator arms are in a relaxed state) in a closed arrangement, where they may be nestled together, and the wands may be moved apart from each other as a user squeezes the handle portions of the arms together.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Thus, wands and brushes move apart from one another, or open, when pressure is applied to the handle portions, and the brush ends move towards one another, or close, when the pressure on the handle portions is released.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The two-brush reverse action apparatus of the present invention enables a user to spread the brushes to accept an eyelash and then release the pressure on the arms, so that the brushes return to their closed nestled position applying a steady pressure to the brushes in contact with the eyelash. The user may then smoothly pull the mascara applicator forward and upward, away from her lashes, leaving a residue of mascara on either side of her lashes. This action is repeated as necessary to achieve a desired appearance. The apparatus also enables a user to achieve desired amounts of volume, length and separation of their lashes, using a combination of brush shapes, styles and mediums on the ends of the wands.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The present disclosure also provides for a movable outer container, which is also referred to herein as an &#x201c;applicator container,&#x201d; for the handle portions of the arms of the reverse action applicator. The applicator container has movable parts so that when pressure is applied the handle portions of the arms, the reverse action mechanism is actuated to move the wands and brushes away from each other. When the pressure is released, the reverse action mechanism is de-actuated, enabling the wands and brushes to move back together.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The movable container may include one or more movable members that actuate(s) one or both of the handle portions of the applicator. In some embodiments, the movable members may define pressure points on the container that, when pushed or pressed together, move the handle portions of the arms of the applicator. This action opens the wands for positioning the brushes over the user's lashes. Thereafter, when the user releases the pressure on the movable member(s) of the applicator container, the wands of the applicator may close, bringing the brushes together.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">A mascara container may have a dual portal with dual squeegees to house to contain the dual wands of the applicator when the applicator is not in use or when the application of mascara to the brushes is desired. These dual portals enable the dual wands and brushes to slide in and out of the portals. Each portal may include a squeegee member that removes any excess mascara from its corresponding brush as the wands are pulled from the mascara container. The squeegee members may also help seal the mascara from the surrounding air when the wands of the applicator have been removed to apply mascara, as well as when the wands of the applicator are housed in the portals.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Alternative embodiments may include additional benefits such as registration and alignment between the brushes, manufacturing of the system by component. Thereafter assembly of components may be accomplished without external fasteners, penetrations, glues, solvents, heat, or the like. Barbed extensions may snap into blind holes or cavities, with or without, but typically without having, and not requiring, access to an opposite side of the hole being fitted into by the barb.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Securement means fastening by any means available. Coupler is any material that is part of a connection between to pieces or regions, and is often a fastener independent from each. An apparatus in accordance with the invention may be sized for mascara application, but may also be large enough for hair coloring, hair coloring, hair straightening, other grooming functions, or the like.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Typically, solvents are involved with pastes and liquid products, so airtight reservoirs are used. Airtight means that evaporation of volatile constituents of the contained product in a closed container may be ignored as negligible over the term of use of the contents of the container. Evaporation whenever the container is in an open condition will continue, of course.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Directions are typically considered to be axial in a longitudinal direction, radial being orthogonal thereto, lateral or transverse being the same, but usually in a back-and-forth sense across the axial axis. A circumferential direction is centered on the axis. In general, rotation about an axial axis is as with aircraft directions, roll, with pitch being rotation orthogonal thereto (nominally up and down; vertical) and yaw being pivoting orthogonal to both of them (nominally in a horizontal plane).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">A mortise is an opening in a member, such as an aperture in an arm of a device. A tenon is a member penetrating a mortise. Herein, any opening penetrated by a member is a mortise. The penetrating member is a tenon, as in construction, but not necessarily in a fixed relation as in construction.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">A transverse direction is orthogonal to an axial direction. When Cartesian coordinates are used, one direction is axial, one transverse, and one lateral, all mutually orthogonal. In radial coordinates, any radial direction is transverse or lateral to the axial axis direction. Force and pressure are used in the common engineering or technical sense, pressure being force per unit of area supporting the force.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">A brush is used by way of example, and is characterized by bristles. Any time a &#x201c;brush&#x201d; is described in this disclosure, it also stands for, represents, or may be thought of as a head, the distribution member of a device for applying (distributing) a material, usually applied to hair of some type.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">For example, in certain embodiments of an apparatus and method in accordance with the invention the bristles may be replaced by teeth of a comb, sponges holding a wet or dry material to be applied, jaws or one half of a jaw or forceps formed by the two arms, or some other gripping mechanism. Even a mold, such as a rubber mold used in curling eyelashes may be placed at the ends of the arms or wands as a &#x201c;head.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The concept of a biased-toward-closure applicator is that manipulation may be done without the need to apply a radial or lateral or transverse force (meaning any direction orthogonal to an axial or longitudinal direction) to keep the heads of the wands or arms together. Thus, the hand and fingers of a user are free to move in any direction suitable for applying a material to a subject. This freedom of motion facilitates the full range of motion of a hand of a user, constrained only by the object to be treated, whether eyelash, hair of the head, a group of selected strands, bangs, beard, or moustache. Likewise the material applied may be mascara, hair dressing, hair setting gel or liquid, moustache wax, hair color, or the like.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The foregoing features of the present invention will become more fully apparent from the following description and appended claims, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

The arms <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> cross over at point <b>20</b>, which may be located somewhat centrally along the length of the applicator <b>10</b>. The portions of the arms <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> that are located on the distal side of point <b>20</b> are referred to as wands <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>. Brushes <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> are attached to the distal ends of the wands <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>, respectively.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">The applicator <b>10</b> may be made of a flexible material that can bend when pressure is applied. Accordingly, when a pinching pressure <b>30</b> is applied to the handle portions of arms <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>, they tend to move closer together, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Since the arms <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> cross over at point <b>20</b>, that action of the arms has an opposite effect on the wands <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> and their brushes <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>, causing the wands <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> and their respective brushes <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> to move away from each other, as shown by arrows <b>32</b>.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Thus, the diameter of the handle portion <b>12</b> depresses and expands when pinching pressure <b>30</b> is applied, so that the user may spread the distal ends of the two wands <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> with attached brushes <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>, and then close the wands <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> and their respective brushes <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> in order to have the brushes <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> surround or hug a user's lashes.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, another embodiment of an applicator <b>50</b> is shown. That applicator <b>50</b> comprises a first arm <b>52</b> and a second arm <b>54</b> that cross over each other. The proximal ends of the arms <b>52</b> and <b>54</b> may be connected to oval tab <b>55</b> or they may be connected to each other in any other suitable manner to form a flexible hinge at the proximal end of the applicator <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">A pressure point <b>56</b> may be located on a proximal part of arm <b>54</b> and a pressure point <b>58</b> may be located on a proximal part of arm <b>56</b>. Distal ends <b>60</b> and <b>62</b> of the arms <b>52</b> and <b>54</b>, which are located on a distal side of a location where the arms <b>52</b> and <b>54</b> cross over one another, may be connected to wands <b>64</b> and <b>66</b>, respectively. Brushes <b>70</b> and <b>72</b> are respectively secured to the distal ends of the wands <b>64</b> and <b>66</b>.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> through <b>6</b></figref>, this crossed-over structure of arms <b>52</b> and <b>54</b> creates a reverse tweezers mechanism. That is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, when transverse or pinching pressure <b>57</b> is applied by a user against pressure points <b>56</b> and <b>58</b>, the distal ends <b>60</b> and <b>62</b> of the arms <b>52</b> and <b>54</b> tend to move in the opposite transverse direction, away from each other. Consequently, an outward force <b>73</b> causes the wands <b>64</b> and <b>66</b> and the brushes <b>70</b> and <b>72</b> to move away from each other. Conversely, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, when the transverse or pinching pressure is released from the pressure points <b>56</b> and <b>58</b>, the distal ends <b>60</b> and <b>62</b> of the arms <b>52</b> and <b>54</b> tend to move back together. Consequently, the wands <b>64</b> and <b>66</b> and the brushes <b>70</b> and <b>72</b> also move back together, to their original resting positions.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref>, an embodiment of a process for using an applicator to apply mascara is depicted. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, applicator container <b>80</b> is shown as containing a reverse tweezers mechanism of a handle portion of an applicator, to be discussed in more detail hereafter. A user pinches pressure points <b>90</b> and <b>92</b> on the applicator container <b>80</b>, causing wands <b>82</b> and <b>84</b> to separate. Brushes <b>86</b> and <b>88</b> on the ends of wands <b>82</b> and <b>84</b>, which are laden with mascara for application to the eyelash <b>98</b>, also separate. A separation space <b>94</b> between the brushes <b>86</b> and <b>88</b> enables the user to place a set of her lashes <b>98</b> (e.g., lashes on an upper eyelid, lashes on a lower eyelid, etc.) between the brushes <b>86</b> and <b>88</b>.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows the user releasing pressure from the pressure points <b>90</b> and <b>92</b>, thereby causing the wands <b>82</b> and <b>84</b> to move towards each other and the separation space <b>94</b> to diminish. The brushes <b>86</b> and <b>88</b> come together on the top side and the bottom side, respectively, of the lashes <b>98</b>. The user draws container applicator <b>80</b> away and up from the lashes <b>98</b>, causing the brushes <b>86</b> and <b>88</b> to deposit and distribute the mascara over the lashes <b>98</b> as the brushes <b>86</b> and <b>88</b> are pulled in a forward direction across and off of the lashes <b>98</b>.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">The dual brushes working together in tandem with each other may achieve multiple functionality of providing a desired volume, a desired length and a desired amount of eyelash separation. A thicker circumference brush holds more mascara within its bristles so it achieves a more voluminous look. A thinner circumference brush with multiple bristles achieves a longer looking lash. And a thinner circumference brush with thinner, more separated bristles achieves lash separation. In the present embodiment, the upper brush <b>86</b> may have a thicker circumference to focus on applying mascara in a manner that makes the lashes <b>98</b> appear to be thicker. The lower brush <b>88</b> may have a thinner circumference to apply mascara in a manner that makes the lashes <b>98</b> appear to be longer. However, any combination of brushes may be used to achieve a desired appearance.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, a mascara container <b>100</b> is shown. A mascara receptacle <b>102</b> is located at the bottom of the mascara container <b>100</b>. A top portion <b>104</b> of the container may include a wall <b>106</b> with a smaller outer dimension than the corresponding outer dimension of the wall of the receptacle <b>102</b>, with a ledge defining a boundary between the outer surfaces of the receptacle <b>102</b> and the outer surfaces of the wall <b>106</b>. This difference in dimensions may accommodate an end of an applicator container (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>) or otherwise facilitate coupling of an applicator container to the mascara container <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">The applicator <b>50</b> may be placed in the mascara container <b>100</b>, so that the wands <b>64</b> and <b>66</b> and their respective brushes <b>70</b> and <b>72</b> extend into the mascara receptacle <b>102</b> for storage and/or to receive the mascara therein. The mascara container <b>100</b> may have a dual-squeegee portal (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>) to accommodate the two wands <b>64</b> and <b>66</b> and brushes <b>70</b> and <b>72</b> of the applicator <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">The user may apply slight pressure to the arms <b>52</b> and <b>54</b> of the applicator <b>50</b> the wands <b>64</b> and <b>66</b> enough to enable them to align with and to be inserted into their respective portal (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>) of the receptacle <b>102</b> of the mascara container <b>100</b>. Once the brushes <b>70</b> and <b>72</b> are in place within their respective portals, they may gather mascara within the receptacle <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">Excess mascara may be squeegeed off of the brushes <b>70</b> and <b>72</b> as they are pulled out of the portals. The mascara receptacle <b>102</b> may also be a holding chamber where the brushes <b>70</b> and <b>72</b> reside, or are stored, until the next usage. The mascara receptacle <b>102</b> may have either a single chamber for receiving both brushes <b>70</b> and <b>72</b> or two separate chambers, each corresponding to a single portal and being configured to receive a single brush <b>70</b>, <b>72</b>.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the mascara container <b>100</b> holds the applicator <b>50</b> therein. The mascara container <b>100</b> is configured to be coupled with an applicator container <b>120</b>. The applicator container <b>120</b> houses the upper, or proximal, part of the applicator <b>50</b>, including the proximal ends of the arms <b>52</b> and <b>54</b> and any pressure points <b>56</b> and <b>58</b> thereof. A lower portion <b>108</b> of the applicator container <b>120</b> is sized to fit snugly over and/or around the wall <b>106</b> of the top portion <b>104</b> of the mascara container <b>100</b> so that the applicator container <b>120</b> and the mascara container <b>100</b> may fit snugly together and releasably couple to one another.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">The space <b>122</b> (cavity <b>122</b>) in the handle portion <b>126</b> (top <b>126</b>, or cap <b>126</b>) receives the tab <b>55</b>. The walls <b>134</b>, <b>136</b> may be movable or flexible to support motion needed to apply (transmit) finger pressure to the pressure points <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> acting to separate the brushes <b>70</b>, <b>72</b>.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the applicator container <b>120</b> is shown separated from the mascara container <b>102</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref>), with the proximal portion of the applicator <b>50</b> in the applicator container. The applicator container <b>120</b> may include protrusions <b>140</b> and <b>142</b> (e.g., convex members, etc.) on an inside surface of the applicator container <b>120</b>. The protrusions <b>140</b> and <b>142</b> may be configured to engage corresponding pressure pads <b>56</b> and <b>58</b> of the applicator <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">For example, the protrusions <b>140</b> and <b>142</b> may be in close proximity, in contact with, etc., the pressure pads <b>56</b> and <b>58</b>. The applicator container <b>120</b> may be configured in such a way that, when a transverse force is applied to appropriate opposite locations on the outer surface of the applicator container <b>120</b>, force may be transmitted to the handle portions of the arms <b>52</b> and <b>54</b> (e.g., via convex members <b>140</b> and <b>142</b> to pressure tabs <b>56</b> and <b>58</b>, etc.). This action will cause the arms <b>52</b> and <b>54</b> to move closer together the brushes <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> farther apart.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">By means of the reverse tweezer structure discussed above, the wands <b>64</b> and <b>66</b> move apart from one another, causing the brushes <b>70</b> and <b>72</b> to separate, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. Thus, the brushes <b>70</b> and <b>72</b> may be positioned above and beneath a user's lashes <b>98</b>, then closed by releasing pressure (force).</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, an exploded view of an embodiment of the applicator container <b>120</b> includes two members <b>150</b> and <b>152</b> (e.g., substantially semi-cylindrical members, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, etc.) that may be associated with one another in a manner that enables them to move relative to each other. This movement imparts the applicator container <b>120</b> with flexibility, making it possible to squeeze the members <b>150</b> and <b>152</b> and, thus, the arms <b>52</b> and <b>54</b> together. This action results in the reverse tweezer action of the applicator <b>50</b>, causing the wands <b>64</b> and <b>66</b> and, thus, the brushes <b>70</b> and <b>72</b> to separate.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, a tool <b>156</b> at the top of the mascara container <b>100</b>, above the receptacle <b>102</b>, removes excess mascara from the brushes <b>70</b> and <b>72</b> as the brushes are pulled from receptacle <b>102</b>. This tool <b>156</b> may include a pair of squeegees, one at or near the top of a port through which each brush <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> enters and exits the receptacle <b>102</b>. Alternately, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, the tool <b>156</b> may be a squeegee <b>160</b> comprising a flexible, resilient material that defines the ports <b>162</b> and <b>164</b> through which the brushes <b>70</b> and <b>72</b> enter and exit the receptacle <b>102</b>. Other mechanisms may alternately be used to remove excess mascara from the brushes.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, another embodiment includes a container <b>170</b> with an applicator, similar to the applicator shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> through <b>3</b></figref>. In this embodiment, the applicator container <b>172</b> has an actuator <b>174</b> constructed as a strip along on one side. Applying pressure to the actuator <b>174</b> actuates the reverse tweezer mechanism of the handle portion of the applicator within the applicator container <b>172</b>, causing the wands <b>175</b> and <b>176</b> and their respective brushes <b>177</b> and <b>178</b> to move away from each other in a reverse tweezer action, such as that described above. The container <b>170</b> also includes a mascara container <b>180</b>, constructed similarly to the mascara container shown in and described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref>. It has a chamber for mascara, dual ports for accepting the wands <b>175</b> and <b>176</b> and the brushes <b>177</b> and <b>178</b> and one or more squeegees (not shown). Actually, constricting bristles will force (extrude) mascara from between them and off the brushes, even without flexible squeegees. Elastomeric apertures make a better seal and relax tolerances of fit.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, this embodiment of a container <b>200</b> with an applicator, is also similar to the mascara application systems shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> through <b>3</b></figref>. The applicator container <b>202</b> includes open sides, which reveal the handle portions of an applicator <b>204</b>. The applicator <b>204</b> includes arms <b>206</b> and <b>208</b> that cross over one another, and that correspond to wands <b>210</b> and <b>212</b>, which carry brushes <b>214</b> and <b>216</b>. Applying pressure to appropriate locations on opposite sides of the applicator container <b>202</b> actuates the reverse tweezers mechanism, causing the wands <b>210</b> and <b>212</b> and their corresponding brushes <b>214</b> and <b>216</b> to move away from each other. The mascara container <b>220</b> is constructed similar to the mascara container shown in and described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref>, with a chamber for mascara, dual ports for accepting the wands and brushes and one or more squeegees (not shown).</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">From the foregoing description it can be seen that the arrangement of the dual brushes may decrease the amount of time required to apply mascara, as brushes coat the upper and under sides of the user's top lash at the same time. In some embodiments, the interplay of the dual brushes working together in tandem may simultaneously add volume, lengthen lashes and separate lashes depending on the types of brushes used, a combination of eyelash appearances may result.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">A thicker circumference brush holds more mascara within its bristles so it achieves a more voluminous look. A thinner circumference brush with multiple bristles achieves a longer looking lash, and a thinner circumference brush with thinner, more separated bristles achieves lash separation. The brushes may be curved or straight, full or minimal, short or long, bristles or silicone. Some combinations of brushes may achieve various looks not easily achieved with a single mascara brush. Examples of dual brush combinations include: (a) a full top brush and a skinny bottom brush, either curved or straight to achieve volume and fullness on the top and to separate and lengthen from the bottom; (b) a full top brush and a full bottom brush, both with short lengths to achieve maximum volume and fullness; (c) top and bottom brushes formed from medium silicone and having a medium length to achieve added length and separation; and (d) top and/or bottom brushes that are sculpted to nest with each other to achieve precision and definition.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">The reverse tweezers mechanism facilitates improved user control when applying mascara. Unlike other previous mascara applicators, a steady pressure is automatically applied by the flexible reverse tweezers mechanism, which forces the brushes toward one another in a manner that surrounds and hugs the lashes. Manual pressure is needed only to position the brushes above and beneath the lashes and, in some embodiments, to position the brushes in the mascara container. This action may make the process of applying mascara more spontaneous, manageable, fluid, comfortable, ergonomic and/or efficient.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">The applicator may be associated with an applicator container that at least partially encases a proximal, handle portion of the applicator in a manner that enables actuation of the reverse tweezers mechanism. This arrangement may enable the user to apply pressure to one or both sides of the container to move the brushes apart from one another and to release the pressure so that the brushes move back together in a nestled position. In addition, the applicator container may impart the applicator, as well as an assembly of the applicator, the applicator container and the mascara container, with a sleek look.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">The mascara container may be configured to hold mascara and the brushes of the applicator. The mascara container may have dual portals through which the two brushes may be brought into contact with the mascara, and two squeegees to remove excess mascara from the brushes and return it to one or more receptacles that contain the mascara. The two portals may also provide a clean and efficient way to hold and store the dual brushes after mascara application has been completed. The dual squeegees may also help to seal the receptacle from exposure to the atmosphere and, thus, prevent drying of the mascara.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b> through <b>44</b></figref>, while continuing to refer generally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> through <b>44</b></figref>, a system <b>230</b> in accordance with the invention may include an applicator <b>228</b>.

The applicator <b>10</b> may fit within a container <b>232</b>. The container <b>232</b> may be any of the containers illustrated herein, including, for example, the containers <b>80</b>, <b>100</b>, <b>170</b>, <b>180</b>, <b>200</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the container <b>232</b> may be made up of a cap <b>234</b> or cap portion <b>234</b>. The cap <b>234</b> may operate as a handle <b>234</b> as well as a cap <b>234</b> with respect to a base <b>236</b>. The base <b>236</b> may be thought of a receptacle <b>236</b> or a reservoir <b>236</b> for a product, such as mascara. In the illustrated embodiment, the cap <b>234</b> may correspond to the top portion <b>126</b> or applicator container <b>80</b>, <b>202</b>, or the like. Meanwhile, the base <b>236</b> may correspond to the receptacle <b>102</b>, <b>180</b>, <b>220</b>, or the like.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">Herein, a reference numeral may refer to any component of a particular type. A trailing letter following a reference numeral indicates a specific instance of an item of the type identified by the reference numeral.

A statement referring to an item identified by reference numeral and trailing letter relates to the specific instances identified by that reference numeral with that trailing letter.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">Brushes <b>238</b> may be identified as a fixed brush <b>238</b><i>a </i>or a comparatively immovable or less movable brush <b>238</b><i>a, </i>and a more readily movable brush <b>238</b><i>b. </i>In the illustrated embodiments, the brushes <b>238</b> need not be the same size. In general, the brushes <b>238</b> may correspond to the brushes <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, <b>70</b>, <b>72</b>, <b>86</b>, <b>88</b>, <b>177</b>, <b>178</b>, <b>214</b>, <b>216</b>. In general, mascara brushes <b>238</b> are themselves an art and a science. Various embodiments exist, including various embodiments described herein. In general, the bristles may be formed for specialty purposes. Similarly, the comparative diameters of the brushes <b>238</b> in pairs may be modified. As illustrated, the shapes of the brushes <b>238</b> may be different in pairs in accordance with the invention.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">In an applicator <b>228</b> in accordance with the invention, arms <b>240</b> may extend from a vertex <b>18</b> at which the arms <b>240</b> connect. A fixture <b>241</b> may be used to secure the arms <b>240</b> into the cap <b>120</b> (also called a handle <b>120</b> or handle portion <b>120</b> of the container <b>100</b>. The vertex <b>18</b> also referred to sometimes as an apex <b>18</b> represents a fixed connection, whether assembled, homogenously formed, molded, or otherwise connected between the two arms <b>240</b>. The vertex <b>18</b> will typically represent or enact as a fixed anchor <b>18</b> against which the individual arms <b>240</b> may flex between their proximal ends near the vertex <b>18</b>, and their distal ends proximate the brushes <b>238</b>.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">The arms <b>240</b> may extend to wands, such as the wands <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>64</b>, <b>66</b>, <b>82</b>, <b>84</b>, <b>175</b>, <b>176</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>212</b>. On the other hand, the arms <b>240</b> may include both an arm portion and a wand portion as a single homogenous component. In other embodiments, wands and arms may be separately formed and assembled. For example, hereinabove certain embodiments include an arm <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>206</b>, <b>208</b>, and the like. Arms <b>240</b> include both any functionality by arms and wands. One reason for this is that it is currently contemplated that the arms <b>240</b> will be manufactured in the most efficient manner available. Accordingly, the arms <b>240</b> may be manufactured by homogenously forming in a metal press, metal molding process, polymeric (plastic) molding process, or the like. In some embodiments, both arms <b>240</b> may be fabricated together at the same time or molded at the same time as a unit. In other embodiments, illustrated herein, the arms <b>240</b> may be assembled.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">In certain embodiments, a system <b>230</b> in accordance with the invention may include an actuator <b>242</b>. The actuator <b>242</b> may be a mechanism <b>242</b> for separating the arms <b>240</b> from one another, thus moving them away from one another in the equilibrium or rest position to extend them apart in an extended or open position. The rest position is a position in which the brushes <b>238</b> are together, the bristles even interleaving to a certain extent, with the lash <b>98</b> of a user captured therebetween and receiving makeup (e.g., mascara) from the bristles of the brushes <b>238</b> onto the lashes <b>98</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the arms <b>240</b> are separated by a guide <b>244</b> or pin <b>244</b>. The guide <b>244</b> or pin <b>244</b> may also be referred to as a guide pin <b>244</b>. The pin <b>244</b> operates to perform several functions simultaneously. For example, the guide pin <b>244</b> may be rigidly secured to or homogenously formed with the more flexible arm <b>240</b><i>b. </i>Meanwhile, an aperture <b>246</b> in the comparatively immobile or stiffer arm <b>240</b><i>a </i>operates to receive the pin <b>244</b> therethrough. Thus, the pin <b>244</b> stabilizes the flexible arm <b>240</b><i>b </i>with respect to the comparatively less flexible arm <b>240</b><i>a </i>in order to assure constant alignment of the brushes <b>238</b> with each other in all positions. The guide pin <b>244</b> may pass through an aperture <b>246</b> in a comparatively stiffer arm <b>240</b><i>a, </i>as well as a second aperture <b>247</b> in the container <b>232</b>. For example, the pin <b>244</b> passes through the aperture <b>246</b> in the comparatively stiffer arm <b>240</b><i>a </i>stabilizing the comparatively more flexible arm <b>240</b><i>b </i>with respect to the stiffer arm <b>240</b><i>a. </i>At the same time, the pin <b>244</b> may pass through the cap <b>234</b> by way of an aperture <b>247</b>. Thus, the pin <b>244</b> is presented as an extension outside the cap <b>234</b>. In that location, the pin <b>244</b> may be depressed to spread the arms <b>240</b> apart, and consequently the brushes <b>238</b> apart.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">Nevertheless, the pin <b>244</b> needs to have a comparatively small diameter or effective diameter. An effective diameter is four times an area divided by the wetted perimeter, and is a common engineering term in fluid mechanics. The expression is sometimes used as &#x201c;effective diameter.&#x201d; For example, the pin <b>244</b> may have a circular cross section, a rectangle cross section, a hexagonal or other polygonal cross section, or the like. Thus, the pin <b>244</b> may have an effective diameter, regardless of its cross-sectional shape or area. Nevertheless, competing functionalities militate for various configurations. For example, in order to pass through the comparatively stiffer arm <b>240</b><i>a, </i>the pin <b>244</b> may need to be smaller than desired. In order to maintain its strength and stiffness, the pin <b>244</b> may need to be a larger effective diameter than desired. Meanwhile, passing through the cap <b>234</b>, the pin <b>244</b> may present a comparatively small area, requiring substantial pressure on a finger of a user trying to activate the applicator <b>10</b> by pressing on the pin <b>244</b>. Pressure is an engineering term defined as a force per unit of cross-sectional area supporting that force. Thus, stress is in pounds per square inch. Force is in pounds per square inch or force per unit of area. Thus, the force that may be applied by a thumb of a user may easily be accommodated with a comparatively large area, thus a reduced pressure. In contrast, the same amount of force on a considerably smaller area may cause discomfort. Ultimately, force applied to a thumb of a user or fingertip in which the cross-sectional area of the pin <b>244</b> were reduced to a sharp point, would cause pain due to pressure.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">In order to reduce the pressure required for a user to operate the pin <b>244</b>, the system <b>230</b> may include an actuator <b>242</b> that operates as a pressure plate <b>242</b>. For example, the actuator <b>242</b> may connect to the cap <b>234</b> that operates as a handle <b>234</b> and a cover <b>234</b> in such a way as to flex easily or deflect easily under pressure from the hand of a user. Meanwhile, formed of a suitably stiff and hard plastic or elastomeric polymer, or the like, the actuator <b>242</b> may also operate to be comparatively hard and stiff with respect to the pin <b>244</b>. Thus, the user or operator may press on the actuator <b>242</b>, and the actuator <b>242</b> takes the pressure of the pin <b>244</b> and distributes its effective force or resultant force over a much broader area. In certain embodiments, the actuator <b>242</b> may actually fit into a tray <b>248</b> or relief <b>248</b> formed in the cap <b>234</b> of the container <b>232</b>.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">The cap <b>234</b> may be secured to the base <b>236</b> or reservoir <b>236</b> by any of several mechanisms. For example, a twisting bayonet-type latch, or rotating latch is one alternative embodiment. Similarly, a sleeve <b>250</b> or collar <b>250</b>, such as a union fitting in a plumbing system may be used to connect a cap <b>234</b> to a base <b>236</b> without rotating either with respect to each other. A shoulder or the like may hold the collar <b>250</b> fixed in a longitudinal direction with respect to the cap <b>234</b>, while leaving the collar <b>250</b> completely free to rotate with respect to the cap <b>234</b>. Thus, the collar <b>250</b> may be rotated with respect to the cap <b>234</b>, and with respect to the base <b>236</b> thus engaging threads <b>252</b><i>a </i>on the collar with threads <b>252</b><i>b </i>on the base <b>236</b>.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">The base <b>236</b> may include a closure <b>254</b> having wipers <b>256</b> or edges <b>256</b> about apertures <b>258</b>. The apertures <b>258</b> may be sized to receive the arms <b>240</b>, but deflect the brushes <b>238</b>. Thus, excess product from the reservoir portion <b>236</b> will be wiped from the bristles of brushes <b>238</b> as they pass back out of the reservoir portion <b>236</b> for use. The apertures <b>258</b> may be of the same size, or may be of different sizes.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">Meanwhile, the closure may have shoulders, walls, and other fittings to fit snuggly and air tight within a top opening of the base <b>236</b>. Typically, an effective closure <b>254</b> may be made of an elastomeric material that is readily flexible. For example, a coefficient of elasticity may be engineered for the closure <b>254</b> such that it will readily secure itself within the base <b>236</b>, while also fitting sockets <b>260</b> or seal faces <b>260</b> against a stopper <b>262</b> or seal <b>262</b> formed on each of the arms <b>240</b>.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, system <b>230</b> may comprise a container <b>232</b> or case <b>232</b> formed of a cap <b>234</b> and a base <b>236</b>. These may be connected by a collar <b>250</b> that rotates with respect to each, being secured by a keeper or sleeve, such as a rim, lip, or the like that fits on a matching shoulder in the cap <b>234</b> in order to be freely rotating, but longitudinally constrained in a longitudinal direction <b>233</b><i>a </i>but free to rotate in a circumferential direction <b>233</b><i>d. </i>Of course, the horizontal directions laterally <b>233</b><i>b </i>and transversely <b>233</b><i>c </i>are constrained, by the cap <b>234</b>. Once rotating sufficiently, the collar <b>250</b> may securely snug the cap <b>234</b> and base <b>236</b> together.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, the cross-sectional shape and area of the system <b>230</b> may be in any selected shape. The instant embodiment is illustrated as hexagonal, at least in the interior shape of an end cover <b>234</b> or cap <b>234</b>.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, a front, elevation, cross-sectional view illustrates the relationship between the container <b>232</b>, shown mostly cut away, and the applicator <b>10</b>. In this embodiment, barbs <b>264</b> are used as securement mechanisms <b>264</b>. In general, barbs <b>264</b> may operate as one-way mechanisms to pass through an aperture, being compressed, depressed, or otherwise deflected to pass through an aperture, then returning to latch into an equilibrium position, but returning to that equilibrium position once having passed through a particular aperture. Thus, the barbs <b>264</b> will be matched to apertures <b>266</b>. Here, barbs <b>264</b><i>a </i>and <b>264</b><i>b </i>are illustrated. The barbs <b>264</b><i>a </i>pass through an aperture <b>266</b><i>a </i>thus securing the comparatively more flexible arm <b>240</b><i>b </i>to the less flexible arm <b>240</b><i>a </i>at or near the vertex <b>18</b> at which they join. Meanwhile, a fitting <b>268</b> is provided to fit into the cap <b>234</b> of the container <b>232</b>.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">One will note that the brushes <b>238</b><i>a, </i><b>238</b><i>b </i>are not of the same size. This may be by design in order to accomplish multiple functions, and complementary functions between the two brushes <b>238</b><i>a </i>and <b>238</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">Meanwhile, the alternative embodiments of the pin <b>244</b> in two different locations illustrate a design option. For example, at the higher position identified by a letter A, the pin <b>244</b> requires less motion, but requires more force, having less leverage on the comparatively more flexible arm <b>240</b><i>b. </i>In the position identified by the letter B, the pin <b>244</b> would be able to have a greater leverage advantage, thus requiring less force to move the arm <b>240</b><i>b </i>away from the arm <b>240</b><i>a. </i>Similarly, the collar <b>250</b> is illustrated with a shoulder <b>269</b><i>a </i>seated against a corresponding shoulder <b>269</b><i>b </i>on the cap <b>234</b>. Detents, and other capture mechanisms may be used to keep the shoulder <b>269</b><i>a </i>positioned proximate the shoulder <b>269</b><i>b </i>without moving away therefrom along the longitudinal direction <b>233</b><i>a </i>of the cap <b>234</b>.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">One also sees how the stoppers <b>262</b> secured air tight or formed with the arms <b>240</b> fit inside respective sockets <b>260</b> in order to form a seal between the socket <b>260</b> and the stopper <b>262</b>.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, an aperture <b>246</b> is shown in the arm <b>240</b><i>a </i>in one embodiment, wherein the arm <b>240</b><i>a </i>may be an I-beam shape, or a channel shape. Thus, the flanges <b>271</b><i>a </i>and the web <b>271</b><i>b </i>may form an H or I shape in the cross section of the arm <b>240</b><i>a. </i>The aperture <b>246</b> is formed therein to receive the pin <b>244</b> passing therethrough to stabilize the arms <b>240</b> with respect to one another, and provide access by the pin <b>244</b> to a position outside the case <b>232</b> or container <b>232</b>, and specifically outside the cap <b>234</b>.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>, the aperture <b>246</b> in the arm <b>240</b><i>a </i>may have a corresponding aperture <b>247</b> in the cap <b>234</b> in order to pass the pin <b>244</b> through the cap <b>234</b>. A grommet <b>270</b> therein may provide a seal, or simply reduce tolerances in order to provide a smoother motion of the pin <b>244</b> through the cap <b>234</b>. Likewise, manufacturing tolerances may be relieved by having an elastomeric material for the grommet <b>270</b>, thus permitting a larger diameter and a more gross tolerance in the aperture <b>247</b>.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>, the closure <b>254</b> may be formed of an elastomeric material to provide a socket <b>260</b> for each of the arms <b>240</b><i>a, </i><b>240</b><i>b, </i>and their respective brushes <b>238</b><i>a, </i><b>238</b><i>b </i>to pass through. Thus, apertures <b>258</b> therein are surrounded by edges <b>256</b> and effectively act as wipers <b>256</b> bending the bristles of the brushes <b>238</b> in order to remove excess product and more evenly coat the bristles of the brushes <b>238</b>.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>, the actuator <b>242</b> is illustrated in one embodiment, wherein the cap <b>234</b> contains the applicator <b>10</b>, and the pin <b>244</b> is driven by the actuator <b>242</b> to separate the arms <b>240</b><i>a, </i><b>240</b><i>b </i>from each other. Of course, the arms <b>240</b> separate from one another in order to separate the brushes <b>238</b><i>a, </i><b>238</b><i>b </i>from one another. A force <b>272</b> applied by a finger <b>274</b> of a user against the actuator <b>242</b> need not apply. A apply to a user's finger an uncomfortably large pressure, since the actuator <b>242</b> distributes load from the finger <b>274</b>, and applies the necessary force to the pin <b>244</b>.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>, as described in detail hereinabove, the arms <b>240</b> may cross. In this configuration, a pin <b>244</b> may be used to maintain alignment or registration to stabilize the arms <b>240</b><i>a </i>and <b>240</b><i>b </i>with respect to each other. Alternatively, the arm <b>240</b><i>a </i>may pass through a slot formed in the arm <b>240</b><i>b </i>(or vice versa) before securing the two arms <b>240</b><i>a, </i><b>240</b><i>b </i>together near the apex <b>18</b> or vertex <b>18</b>. The pin <b>244</b> may be replaced by one or more legs passing through the arm <b>240</b><i>a </i>or straddling the arm <b>240</b><i>a. </i>Meanwhile, an extension <b>263</b> or leg <b>263</b> may extend from the leg <b>240</b><i>a </i>as a stabilizer <b>263</b>. The stabilizer <b>263</b> as a single or double extension <b>263</b> contacts the cap <b>234</b> to render the arm <b>240</b><i>a </i>virtually fixed with respect to the handle <b>234</b> or cap <b>234</b> portion of the container <b>232</b>. Thus, only the arm <b>240</b><i>b </i>moves with respect to the handle <b>234</b> and the wand <b>240</b><i>a </i>or arm <b>240</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">Typically, the pin <b>244</b> may be placed on the opposite side of the cross over point of the vertex <b>18</b>. This provides a better leverage advantage for a user. Meanwhile, all of the advantages of a crossover configuration described hereinabove accrue to this embodiment. Meanwhile, the stability in the relative positions of both brushes <b>238</b> is assured by the registration between the arms <b>240</b>. Meanwhile, the arms <b>240</b> themselves (e.g., by one passing through the other in a captured condition), the pin <b>244</b> (e.g., fixed to an arm <b>240</b><i>b </i>and passing through an aperture <b>246</b> in the arm <b>240</b><i>a</i>), or both may provide stabilization (alignment for relative motion in a radial/transverse/orthogonal-to-axial direction) between the two arms <b>240</b>. Most importantly, precise alignment of the brushes <b>238</b> in their actuation toward opening, and returning, may be assured.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>, in one embodiment, barbs <b>264</b><i>a </i>may secure the arms <b>240</b> together near a vertex <b>18</b>.

The natural or unforced position of the arms <b>240</b><i>a, </i><b>240</b><i>b </i>is apart, the wands <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> together, and brushes <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> together.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0168">A collar <b>250</b>, provided with internal threads <b>252</b> matching external threads <b>252</b> on the receptacle <b>102</b>, is permanently and rotatably attached to the cap portion <b>120</b> by fitting a rim <b>290</b> inside the collar <b>250</b> above the rim <b>291</b> or lip <b>291</b> on the cap <b>120</b> or cap portion <b>120</b>. Thus, the collar <b>250</b> rotates freely with respect to the cap <b>120</b> or handle <b>120</b> but need not separate therefrom.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0169">Typically, the arms <b>240</b><i>a, </i><b>240</b><i>b </i>are secured by any suitable fastening mechanism, such as glue, barbs, or other mechanisms known in the art, to remain inside the cap <b>120</b>. The collar <b>250</b> in use may be threaded such that the threads <b>252</b> of the collar <b>250</b> will engage with the threads <b>252</b> of the receptacle <b>102</b> to close the container <b>100</b>. In this way, an intermediate tool <b>160</b> or squeegee <b>160</b> may fit inside the receptacle <b>102</b> captured under pressure applied by the collar rim <b>290</b> against the rim <b>291</b>, itself pressing against the rim <b>292</b> of the squeegee <b>160</b>.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0170">The openings <b>162</b> or ports <b>162</b> are provided for passage of the brushes <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> and wands <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> into and through the squeegee <b>160</b> and ultimately into the receptacle <b>102</b>. The squeegee <b>160</b> or tool <b>160</b> will typically include a seating surface <b>260</b> to contact the stoppers <b>262</b> on wands <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> sealing the receptacle <b>294</b>. Meanwhile these seals <b>295</b> on the tool <b>160</b> may fit inside relief furrows or channels formed inside the receptacle <b>102</b>, which effect tends to hold the seals <b>295</b> within the receptacle <b>102</b>. Thus, once closed completely, the cap <b>120</b> is drawn toward the receptacle <b>102</b> by the collar <b>250</b>. The rim <b>290</b> of the collar <b>250</b> draws the rim <b>291</b> of the cap <b>120</b> down against the rim <b>292</b> of the squeegee <b>160</b>. Thus, the rim <b>292</b> also seals against the lip <b>294</b> or rim <b>294</b> of the receptacle <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0171">The pressure brought to bear between the rim <b>291</b> of the cap <b>120</b> and the rim <b>294</b> of the receptacle <b>102</b> captures the flexible rim <b>292</b> captured between the rims <b>291</b>, <b>294</b> to effect closure therebetween, effecting a vapor-proof and liquid-proof seal. Meanwhile, the wands <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> include portions <b>252</b> operating as a seal <b>262</b> or stopper <b>262</b> fitted and pressed into the surfaces <b>260</b> of ports <b>162</b> in the squeegee <b>160</b>. Thus, all passages for vapor or liquid to escape from the receptacle <b>102</b> are blocked when the entire system <b>230</b> is assembled with the collar <b>250</b> providing the closing force.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0172">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>46</b></figref>, the container <b>100</b> comprising the receptacle <b>102</b> and the cap <b>120</b> is penetrated at the cap <b>120</b> by the actuators <b>242</b> extending from the arms <b>240</b><i>a, </i><b>240</b><i>b. </i>Sealing these actuators <b>242</b> with respect to the cap <b>120</b> is an exercise in complexity if not absolute futility. Thus, all sealing requirements are instead met by the stoppers <b>262</b> in contact with the sealing surfaces <b>260</b> of the ports <b>162</b>, the &#x2018;<b>0</b>&#x2019; ring seals <b>291</b> on the tool <b>160</b>, as well as the rim seals <b>291</b>, <b>292</b>, <b>294</b>.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0173">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>47</b> through <b>50</b></figref>, the profiles of the actuators <b>254</b> are more clear, and the section line for the view illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>59</b></figref> is provided. One will notice that a comparatively symmetric, circular profile exists in order to provide both a slim and trim apparatus <b>230</b> or system <b>230</b>. It becomes a convenient operational shape for rotation of the squeegee tool <b>160</b> within the receptacle <b>102</b>, and the rotation of the wands <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> within the receptacle.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0174">The ability to rotate both wands enables a user to pick up product <b>300</b> from the receptacle and to distribute that product <b>300</b> throughout the entire circumference of each brush <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>. These functionalities have been found to be valuable for several reasons, including uniformity of product <b>300</b> distribution on the brushes <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>. Moreover, interior loading is needed on brushes <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> hen contacting the eyelashes. This provides a start on creating an even distribution before any excess is wiped from the brushes <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> when passing through the squeegee <b>160</b>.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0175">On the other hand, it has been found very difficult to manufacture the squeegee tool <b>160</b> in such a way that the flexibility to seal against the receptacle <b>102</b> and the ability to rotate with respect thereto are both accommodated. Accordingly the &#x201c;dog leg&#x201d; or offset in the wands has proven satisfactory for letting the wands &#x201c;relax&#x201d; in compliance with their biasing force and hold the brushes <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> together. This reduces the tendency for mechanical creep (long term yielding in response to otherwise modest force loads) to which the plastic materials may be subject. Meanwhile, the distal ends of the wands <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> being closer together in the biased &#x201c;resting&#x201d; position will be drawn apart as they pass through the ports <b>162</b> in the squeegee tool <b>160</b>. This is advantageous for loading the brushes <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, as described hereinbelow with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>52</b>-<b>60</b></figref></p><p id="p-0177" num="0176">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>51</b> through <b>54</b></figref>, internal components are removed to show the design shapes of the cap <b>120</b> and receptacle <b>102</b> as well as the biased closed configuration of the wands <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>. When no pressure is applied to the actuators <b>242</b>, the brushes <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> are substantially interleaved or intertwined. Meanwhile, the squeegee <b>160</b> within the receptacle <b>102</b> is illustrated.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0177">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>55</b> through <b>56</b></figref>, the wands <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> are illustrated in their position taken when the biased arms <b>240</b><i>a, </i><b>240</b><i>b </i>are opposed by a force applied by a user to the actuators <b>242</b>. This position is also obtained when the wands <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> are partially withdrawn through the squeegee <b>160</b>. The squeegee <b>160</b> itself resists the bias on the wands <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> and the brushes <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> in order to aid pickup of product <b>300</b> by the brushes <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> from the receptacle <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0178">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>56</b></figref>, the position of the wands <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> and brushes <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> in the absence of force applied to the actuators <b>242</b> is to bias the arms <b>240</b><i>a, </i><b>240</b><i>b </i>apart, and the wands <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> and the brushes <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> together, toward one another.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0179">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>57</b> and <b>58</b></figref>, the squeegee <b>160</b> shows seals <b>295</b>, and the rim <b>292</b>. The ports <b>162</b> or openings <b>162</b> expose the sealing surface <b>260</b> against which the stoppers <b>262</b> of the wands <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> rest. The taper on the sealing surface <b>260</b> of the squeegee <b>160</b> makes a forcible contact with the sealing outer surface of the stopper <b>262</b>. This not only provides a seal between the stopper <b>262</b> and the sealing surface <b>260</b> of the squeegee <b>160</b>, but also tends to expand somewhat the squeegee <b>160</b> urging the squeegee <b>160</b> and its seals <b>295</b> (sealing rings <b>295</b> or built in &#x2018;0&#x2019; rings <b>295</b>) to more effectively seal against the inside walls of the receptacle <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0180">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>58</b></figref>, the lower end of the squeegee <b>160</b> forms the ports <b>162</b> into individual openings <b>162</b> terminating at a lip <b>256</b> or edge <b>256</b>. This operates as a wiper <b>256</b>, flexibly but firmly and elastically containing the wands <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> and brushes <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>. As these are withdrawn from the receptacle <b>102</b> through the squeegee <b>160</b>, they pass through the ports <b>162</b> individually.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0181">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>59</b> through <b>62</b>B</figref>, the operational sequence of the apparatus <b>230</b> appears. The sequence of operations illustrated ranges from a completely closed condition to a partially removed position on the way to an open, and then subsequently closed, position for applying product <b>300</b> to the eyelashes of a user. That sequence progresses a described hereinbelow.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0182">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>60</b></figref>, the shape of the wands <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, having a broader gap between them proximate the cap <b>120</b> and stoppers <b>262</b> or seals <b>262</b> a a closer proximity between the wands <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> near the brushes <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> causes a motion of the brushes away from one another as the wands <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> are drawn longitudinally outward from the receptacle <b>102</b> through the ports <b>162</b>. This provides several functional effects and benefits.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0183">For example, as the wider-spaced portion of the wands move through the ports <b>162</b>, the brushes <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> and wands <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> remain in their closest relationship. As the distal (lower, toward the brushes <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>) portions of the wands <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> move through the ports<b>162</b>, those wands <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> must move apart, creating and increasing a gap between the brushes <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>. This separates the brushes <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> from one another and places them near the inner surface of the receptacle <b>102</b> where they can pick up product <b>300</b> about the entire circumference of each brush <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>. Moreover, at this position, the wands are easily and freely movable back and forth (principally laterally or radially, but even circumferentially and longitudinally to some extent). Thus, this separation by overcoming the bias applied to the wands <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> provides brushes <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> fully loaded with product <b>300</b> about their entire circumferences.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0184">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>61</b></figref>, the process of withdrawing the cap <b>120</b> with its integrated arms <b>240</b><i>a, </i><b>240</b><i>b </i>and wands <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> passes all the bristles of the brushes <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> through the wipers <b>256</b> at the most constricted portion of the ports <b>162</b>. This action and movement have several very beneficial results.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0185">First, the bristles bend and distort downward as they are drawn through the wipers <b>256</b>. Thus, the brushes <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> must actually bend their bristles downward in order to even pass through the wipers <b>256</b>. This motion compresses bristles together tightly, which tends to extrude and remove excess product <b>300</b> from between the bristles of each brush <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>, leaving only a thin layer of product <b>300</b> on bristles, and some quantity between bristles of the brushes <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>. This also means any excess is basically wiped off the outer circumference of brushes <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> by the wipers <b>256</b> and returned into the receptacle <b>102</b> with the main body of the product <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0186"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>62</b>A</figref> illustrates the cross section of the arms <b>240</b><i>a, </i><b>240</b><i>b </i>and wands <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>. In the illustrated embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>62</b>B</figref>, the cross section cut line described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>62</b>A</figref>. Thus, in the illustration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>62</b>B</figref>, the crossover of the arms <b>240</b><i>a, </i><b>240</b><i>b </i>is clarified.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0187">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>63</b> through <b>64</b></figref>, the operation in the hands of a user appears in the open position and the closed position, respectively, of the brushes <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>.

Thus, as illustrated hereinabove, the brushes <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> are separated in order to be closed down onto an eyelash for application of product <b>300</b> to the eyelash <b>98</b>.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0188">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>64</b></figref>, releasing the actuation force or pressure on the actuators <b>242</b> by the finger and thumb of a user results in closure of the brushes <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> together.
