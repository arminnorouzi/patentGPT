In general, CVD and ALD processes involve the delivery of gaseous reactants to the substrate surface where a chemical reaction takes place under temperature and pressure conditions favorable to the thermodynamics of the reaction. The type and composition of the layers that may be formed using a CVD process or an ALD process are limited by the ability to deliver a chemical reactant or precursor to the substrate surface. Various solid and/or liquid precursors have been successfully used during CVD and ALD applications by delivering the precursors within a carrier gas.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">A carrier gas is in some cases passed through a heated vessel or canister, such as an ampoule or bubbler, which contains a volatile liquid precursor under conditions conducive to vaporize the precursor. In other cases, a carrier gas is passed through a heated vessel containing a solid precursor under conditions conducive to sublime the solid precursor. The sublimation process is typically performed in a vessel loaded or filled with a solid precursor, and the vessel walls are heated to sublime the solid precursor material while producing a gaseous precursor. In either case, the carrier gas combines with the vaporized precursor to form a process gas which is drawn from the vessel via dedicated conduits or gas lines to a reaction chamber.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Conventionally, a vapor deposition process that utilizes a solid precursor may suffer several problems. While a solid precursor should be provided enough heat to be sublimed into a gaseous state, the solid precursor may decompose if exposed to too much heat. Metal-organic solid precursors, which are usually very expensive, are especially susceptible to thermal decomposition and generally should be maintained within narrow temperature and pressure ranges during a sublimation process. Once decomposed, solid precursors may contaminate the remaining precursor in the vessel, the delivery system of conduits and valves, and/or the processing chamber, as well as a substrate. Furthermore, overheating a solid precursor may provide too high of a precursor concentration within the process gas, which may lead to wasted precursor that is not used or condensation of the precursor within the delivery lines or on the substrate.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Alternatively or additionally, the solid precursor may not sublime if exposed to too little heat. As the carrier gas is flowed through the vessel and impacts the solid precursor, particulates from the solid precursor may become entrained in the carrier gas and transferred into the process chamber. These solid or liquid particulates may become a source of contamination for the delivery system, processing chamber, and/or substrate. The problem of particulate contamination has been addressed in the art by including a liquid carrier material mixed with a solid precursor. However, the mixture of the liquid carrier material and the solid precursor may not be conducive outside of limited temperature and pressure ranges since the liquid carrier material may be evaporated and become a contaminant within the delivery system, the processing chamber, and/or on the substrate.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Conventionally, a precursor (as well as other liquid) induces chemical reactions by introducing various types of reactive gases into the processing (or reactive) chambers during semiconductor fabrication. In CVD processing, there is a growing preference to use liquid precursors instead of gases. The popularity of liquid precursors is based in part on physical properties that render them less harmful, flammable, corrosive, and poisonous than gaseous ones. For example, one of the more common liquids used in fabricating semiconductor devices is Tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS), which is frequently substituted for silane. With TEOS, conformal silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>) films with no detectable defects can be deposited with better step coverage and with far less hazard than when silane is used. In metal organic CVD (MOCVD) processes, liquid precursors for metals such as copper are often used because gaseous precursors are not available.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Because liquid precursors (and other process liquids) are first liquid, they are converted to a gaseous state to deliver the precursor as a gas through a delivery line. Faults in the manufacturing operation or delivery line environment, particularly that impact temperature and pressure, can lead to condensation of some of the gas in a delivery line. Such condensation can absorb and carry particles into the processing chamber and deposit the particles on the substrate, causing particle defects on the substrate and any resultant manufactured device.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Methods for detecting and recognizing potential problems in a precursor delivery system by determining an amount of precursor or concentration of precursor being used within the process gas is disclosed. Many of the above referenced problems may be remedied or otherwise mitigated with high resolution control of flow rates within a precursor delivery system. There is a need for an efficient and cost effective concentration sensor that performs under robust measuring conditions. For example, some conventional concentration sensors or monitors may include high cost specialized equipment that are not capable of measuring concentration of various precursors flowing with a variety of carrier gases. Conventional concentration sensors often involve expensive equipment such as optical sensors that are pre-calibrated and rely on specific equipment specifications and/or configurations for different carrier gases and/or precursors.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Aspects and implementations of the present disclosure address these and other shortcomings of existing technology by providing an assembly, system, and/or method for determining a concentration of a compound (e.g., a precursor) within a compound gas (e.g., a process gas). In some embodiments, the relationship between pressure, mass flow rate, and vaporization rate are employed to determine mass flow rate of a gas before and after a compound is integrated through vaporization. For example, mass flow meters may be calibrated and configured to measure flow rates before and after compound (e.g., precursor) vaporization to determine how much (e.g., concentration) of the compound is flowing through a point of a gas delivery system. In another example, the change in density (i.e., vapor pressure multiplied by molecular weight) is leveraged in combination with the inverse relationship between vapor pressure and molecular weight to determine concentration of the vaporized compound knowing that the molecular mass of the carrier is likely unchanged.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In an exemplary embodiment, a concentration sensor assembly includes a vaporization chamber including a compound. The vaporization chamber vaporizes the compound. The concentration sensor assembly may further include a first flow path connected to the vaporization chamber. The first flow path may direct a first gas (e.g., a carrier gas) to the vaporization chamber. A second flow path is coupled to the vaporization chamber. The second flow path directs a second gas (e.g., the carrier gas plus a precursor gas) out of the vaporization chamber. The second gas includes the compound gas and the first gas. A first sensor is disposed along the first flow path. The first sensor measures first data indicative of a first mass flow rate of the first gas within the first flow path. A second sensor is disposed along the second flow path. The second sensor measures second data indicative of a second mass flow rate of the second gas within the second flow path. The concentration sensor may further include a computing device coupled to the first sensor and the second sensor. The computing device determines a concentration of the compound within the second gas based on the first data and the second data. The computing device may be, for example, a programmable logic controller (PLC), a system on a chip (SoC), a computer, a field programmable gate array (FPGA), or other type of computing device.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In an exemplary embodiment, a precursor concentration delivery system includes a vaporization vessel. The vaporization vessel includes a precursor. A first flow path is connected to the vaporization vessel. The first flow path direct a carrier gas into the vaporization vessel. A second flow path is connected to the vaporization vessel. The second flow path directs a process gas out of the vaporization vessel. The process gas includes the carrier gas and the precursor. A process chamber is connected to the second flow path. The second flow path directs the process gas to the process chamber. A first flow meter is disposed along the first flow. The first flow meter measures first data indicative of a first flow rate of the carrier gas within the first flow path. A second flow meter is disposed along the second flow path. The second flow meter measures second data indicative of a second flow rate of the process gas within the second flow path. A computing device is coupled to the first flow meter and the second flow meter. The computing device determines a concentration of the precursor within the process gas based on the first data and the second data.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In an exemplary embodiment, a method includes receiving, by a processing device or computing device from a first sensor, first data indicative of a first mass flow rate of a carrier gas.

The processing device receives, from a third sensor, third data indicative of a temperature of a vaporization vessel associated with vaporizing the vaporized substance. The processing device determines a concentration of the vaporized substance within the compound gas based on the first data, the second data, and the third data. The method may include modifying a flow rate of the carrier gas. The method may include providing the concentration for display by a graphical user interface (GUI). For example, the computing device may include a display to which the determined concentration may be output.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Aspects of the present disclosure provide various technological advantages and improvements over conventional system.

For example, a carrier gas may be selectively used for a specific purpose (e.g., to reduce mass flow rate, improve chemical interaction on a surface of the surface, greater capability with a precursor, etc.) without requiring physical equipment reconfigurations. Sensor may be calibrated with updated data for the carrier gas and the precursor used and concentration measurements may be performed.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-B</figref> illustrate exemplary embodiments of a concentration sensor assembly <b>100</b>A-B, according to some embodiments. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> illustrates the concentration sensor assembly <b>100</b>A operating in a bypass or calibration mode. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrates the concentration sensor assembly <b>100</b>B operating in a gas delivery mode.

Flow rate and precursor concentration may be used to classify the precursor concentration (e.g., within a threshold bound, above a threshold bound, within a threshold bound but depleting at or above a depletion threshold, etc.)</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0098">c. System control classification&#x2014;as described previously, a computing device may control a gas flow system such as controlling flow rates of gases (e.g., carrier gas or process gas), adjusting the state of the vessel (e.g., changing temperature, pressure, etc.), and/or carrying out process chamber procedures (e.g., a CVD process or an ALD process). The machine learning model may output instructions that may be displayed and/or applied to a gas delivery system such as a remedial or prescriptive action for a vaporization system to undertake. For example, the machine learning module may detect that a precursor concentration is higher than a threshold level and may cause a vaporization system to increase a flow rate of a carrier gas (e.g., such as to dilute or lower the precursor concentration within a process gas.)</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0099" num="0099">One type of machine learning model that may be used to perform some or all of the above tasks is an artificial neural network, such as a deep neural network. Artificial neural networks generally include a feature representation component with a classifier or regression layers that map features to a desired output space. A convolutional neural network (CNN), for example, hosts multiple layers of convolutional filters. Pooling is performed, and non-linearities may be addressed, at lower layers, on top of which a multi-layer perceptron is commonly appended, mapping top layer features extracted by the convolutional layers to decisions (e.g. classification outputs). Deep learning is a class of machine learning algorithms that use a cascade of multiple layers of nonlinear processing units for feature extraction and transformation. Each successive layer uses the output from the previous layer as input. Deep neural networks may learn in a supervised (e.g., classification) and/or unsupervised (e.g., pattern analysis) manner. Deep neural networks include a hierarchy of layers, where the different layers learn different levels of representations that correspond to different levels of abstraction. In deep learning, each level learns to transform its input data into a slightly more abstract and composite representation. In a precursor classification, for example, the raw input may be mass flow measurements of carrier and/or process gasses; the second layer may compose feature data associated with a state of a vaporization chamber; the third layer may include identifying features of the carrier and/or process gas (e.g., molecular weight, density, chemical make-up). Notably, a deep learning process can learn which features to optimally place in which level on its own. The &#x201c;deep&#x201d; in &#x201c;deep learning&#x201d; refers to the number of layers through which the data is transformed. More precisely, deep learning systems have a substantial credit assignment path (CAP) depth. The CAP is the chain of transformations from input to output. CAPs describe potentially causal connections between input and output. For a feedforward neural network, the depth of the CAPs may be that of the network and may be the number of hidden layers plus one. For recurrent neural networks, in which a signal may propagate through a layer more than once, the CAP depth is potentially unlimited.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0100">In one embodiment, one or more machine learning model is a recurrent neural network (RNN). An RNN is a type of neural network that includes a memory to enable the neural network to capture temporal dependencies. An RNN is able to learn input-output mappings that depend on both a current input and past inputs. The RNN will address past and future flow rate measurements and make predictions based on this continuous metrology information. RNNs may be trained using a training dataset to generate a fixed number of outputs (e.g., to determine a concentration of a vaporizable substance at various point along a flow path of a gas delivery system). One type of RNN that may be used is a long short term memory (LSTM) neural network.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0101">Training of a neural network may be achieved in a supervised learning manner, which involves feeding a training dataset consisting of labeled inputs through the network, observing its outputs, defining an error (by measuring the difference between the outputs and the label values), and using techniques such as deep gradient descent and backpropagation to tune the weights of the network across all its layers and nodes such that the error is minimized. In many applications, repeating this process across the many labeled inputs in the training dataset yields a network that can produce correct output when presented with inputs that are different than the ones present in the training dataset.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0102">For the model training workflow <b>605</b>, a training dataset containing hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands or more carrier and process gas flow rate measurements (e.g., gas delivery data <b>610</b>) should be used to form a training dataset. In embodiments, the training dataset may also include an associated precursor classification <b>612</b> for forming a training dataset, where each data point and/or associated precursor classification may include various labels or classifications of one or more types of useful information. Each case may include, for example, data indicative of a first flow rate of a carrier gas and a second flow rate of a process gas and a determined precursor classification (e.g., precursor concentration, depletion rate, quantity stored in vaporization chamber, etc.). This data may be processed to generate one or multiple training datasets <b>636</b> for training of one or more machine learning models. The machine learning models may be trained, for example, to automate one or more processes of a precursor delivery system (e.g., increasing/decreasing flow rates of carrier and/or process gases, increasing precursor quantity within a vaporization chamber, and other processes associated with delivery a precursor).</p><p id="p-0103" num="0103">In some embodiments, a training dataset containing hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands or more carrier and process flow rate measurements (e.g., gas delivery data <b>610</b>) is used to form a training dataset. The training data set may also include an associated precursor classification <b>612</b> for forming a training dataset. The precursor classification <b>612</b> may include one or more concentration measurements (e.g., performed using a residual gas analyzer RGA or other concentration sensor).</p><p id="p-0104" num="0104">In one embodiment, generating one or more training datasets <b>636</b> includes gathering one or more gas flow measurement of a carrier gas and a process gas. The labels that are used may depend on what a particular machine learning model will be trained to do. For example, to train a machine learning model to perform precursor classification, a training dataset <b>636</b> may include data indicative of a type of gas (e.g., molecular weight, density, etc.), gas flow measurements (e.g., mass flow rates of carrier and/or process gases) and data indicative of a semiconductor processing specifications. For example, a semiconductor process may be associated with a window of precursor concentrations associated with a semiconductor processing result that meets a threshold standard.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0105">To effectuate training, processing logic inputs the training dataset(s) <b>636</b> into one or more untrained machine learning models. Prior to inputting a first input into a machine learning model, the machine learning model may be initialized. Processing logic trains the untrained machine learning model(s) based on the training dataset(s) to generate one or more trained machine learning models that perform various operations as set forth above.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0106">Training may be performed by inputting one or more of the gas delivery data <b>610</b> and precursor classifications <b>612</b> into the machine learning model one at a time. In some embodiments, the training of the machine learning model includes tuning the model to receive gas delivery data <b>610</b> (e.g., mass flow rates of a carrier gas and a process gas) and output a precursor concentration prediction (e.g., precursor classification <b>612</b>) within a threshold difference of a measured precursor concentration (e.g., performed using a residual gas analyzer RGA or other concentration sensor).</p><p id="p-0107" num="0107">The machine learning model processes the input to generate an output. An artificial neural network includes an input layer that consists of values in a data point. The next layer is called a hidden layer, and nodes at the hidden layer each receive one or more of the input values. Each node contains parameters (e.g., weights) to apply to the input values. Each node therefore essentially inputs the input values into a multivariate function (e.g., a non-linear mathematical transformation) to produce an output value. A next layer may be another hidden layer or an output layer. In either case, the nodes at the next layer receive the output values from the nodes at the previous layer, and each node applies weights to those values and then generates its own output value. This may be performed at each layer. A final layer is the output layer, where there is one node for each class, prediction and/or output that the machine learning model can produce.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0108">Accordingly, the output may include one or more predictions or inferences. For example, an output prediction or inference may include a determined concentration of a precursor within a precursor delivery system. Processing logic may then compare the predicted or inferred output to measured or known precursor classification (e.g., measured concentrations) that was included in the training data item. Processing logic determines an error (i.e., a classification error) based on the differences between the output of machine learning model and the known classification (e.g., precursor classification). Processing logic adjusts weights of one or more nodes in the machine learning model based on the error. An error term or delta may be determined for each node in the artificial neural network. Based on this error, the artificial neural network adjusts one or more of its parameters for one or more of its nodes (the weights for one or more inputs of a node). Parameters may be updated in a back propagation manner, such that nodes at a highest layer are updated first, followed by nodes at a next layer, and so on. An artificial neural network contains multiple layers of &#x201c;neurons&#x201d;, where each layer receives as input values from neurons at a previous layer. The parameters for each neuron include weights associated with the values that are received from each of the neurons at a previous layer. Accordingly, adjusting the parameters may include adjusting the weights assigned to each of the inputs for one or more neurons at one or more layers in the artificial neural network.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0109">Once the model parameters have been optimized, model validation may be performed to determine whether the model has improved and to determine a current accuracy of the deep learning model. After one or more rounds of training, processing logic may determine whether a stopping criterion has been met. A stopping criterion may be a target level of accuracy, a target number of processed images from the training dataset, a target amount of change to parameters over one or more previous data points, a combination thereof and/or other criteria. In one embodiment, the stopping criteria is met when at least a minimum number of data points have been processed and at least a threshold accuracy is achieved. The threshold accuracy may be, for example, 70%, 80% or 90% accuracy. In one embodiment, the stopping criteria is met if accuracy of the machine learning model has stopped improving. If the stopping criterion has not been met, further training is performed. If the stopping criterion has been met, training may be complete. Once the machine learning model is trained, a reserved portion of the training dataset may be used to test the model.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0110">As an example, in one embodiment, a machine learning model (e.g., precursor classifier <b>668</b>) is trained to determine precursor concentration and/or states of a precursor within a vaporization chamber. A similar process may be performed to train machine learning models to perform other tasks such as those set forth above. A set of many (e.g., thousands to millions) gas delivery measurements (e.g., mass flow rates measurements of carrier gases and/or process gases) may be collected and concentration data <b>666</b> associated with predicted or inferred concentrations associated with the input data <b>662</b> may be determined.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0111">Once one or more trained machine learning models <b>638</b> are generated, they may be stored in model storage <b>645</b>, and may be added to concentration sensor application (e.g., concentration tool <b>224</b>, system control module <b>226</b>, and/or precursor monitor <b>228</b>). Concentration sensor application may then use the one or more trained ML models <b>638</b> as well as additional processing logic to implement an automatic mode, in which user manual input of information is minimized or even eliminated in some instances.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0112">In one embodiment, model application workflow <b>617</b> includes one or more trained machine learning models that function as a system control classifier <b>667</b>, precursor concentration determiner <b>664</b>, and/or a precursor classifier <b>668</b>. These logics may be implemented as separate machine learning models or as a single combined machine learning model in embodiments.

This may include outputting a set of classification probabilities for prescriptive actions <b>672</b>. The prescriptive actions <b>672</b> may include actions notified to an controller (e.g., user and/or automated system) that when applied to a gas delivery system alter a state of the precursor delivery system (e.g., lower concentration of precursor within the process gas, lower temperature of vaporization chamber, halts operations, etc.)</p><p id="p-0114" num="0114">According to one embodiment, input data <b>662</b> may be input into precursor concentration determiner <b>664</b>, which may include a trained neural network.
