Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to airships that are lighter than air, especially airships for the stratosphere.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Recent development of light-weight and high-strength materials has promoted the interest in production of stratospheric airships. Especially, airships that are lighter-than-air for use in the stratosphere have increased attention for use as hubs in telecommunication and surveillance. However, the conditions in the stratosphere put some harsh requirements on the materials. Furthermore, long term use of the airships in the stratosphere requires that the energy is collected from solar light, which adds weight to the airship and thereby put some tight limits to the possible lifting weight as well as the weight of the airship itself relatively to the size of the airship. Increasing the size of the airship overcomes this problem, as the lifting force increases with the volume whereas the weight of the airship itself tends to increase with the surface area. However, large airships involve problems with respect to costs and practicability. The problem of providing a small stratospheric airship is still unresolved, in practice.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A general discussion on airships is found in the book &#x201c;Airship Technology&#x201d; by G. A. Khoury (Cambridge University Press 1999 with the second edition of 2012). Various experiments are going on for Stratospheric airships, for example in Aerostar International, a subsidiary of Raven Industries (http://ravenaerostar.com) and in collaboration with Southwest Research Institute and US Air Force Research Lab. Another active company is Near Space Corporation in Arizona (http://www.nsc.aero). The US Air Force ISIS project comprises a stratosphere airship with solar cells.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">An overview of the Lockheed Martin High Altitude Airship program is given in the 2013 Internet publication &#x201c;Status and Plans of High Altitude Ariship (HAA&#x2122;) Program&#x201d; by Androulakakis and Jusy, published on http://enu.kz/repository/2013/AIAA-2013-1362.pdf.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">With respect to construction of airships, there are various proposals. Whereas the large airships of the 20<sup>th </sup>century had an inner skeleton, the tendency is rather to avoid skeletons in order to save weight. As alternatives, flexible outer skeletons have been proposed, for example in US2006/192048, disclosing helical wound tensile bands forming an external light skeleton that is used for attaching power units, gondolas and tail units. The idea of straps around the hull for holding a gondola is very old and was already disclosed in FR417649 from 1910. In contrast to the flexible bands around the hull, U.S. Pat. No. 8,141,814 by Boing discloses a rigid frame around a blimp for a double rotor used according to a helicopter principle with upward thrust.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, there is still a need for improvements. Especially, there is a need a practical low-cost technical solution for small stratospheric airships.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DESCRIPTION/SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is therefore an objective to provide improvements to airships, especially small stratospheric airships. This objective is achieved with an airship as explained in more details in the following.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The airship is of the kind that is filled with Helium or Hydrogen gas so that the airship is lighter than air. The gas-filled flexible hull forms a blimp that is elongate with a longitudinal axis and with a front part having a front end and a rear end at the tail. For example, the longitudinal axis is a symmetry axis, and the hull is rotational symmetric about that axis.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A harness-structure around the hull is used for carrying solar cells, batteries, propeller engines and electronics in order not to perturb the hull and thereby minimizing risks for leakage. Accordingly, the harness-structure does not extend through the hull material but is only abutting an outer side of the hull.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The harness-structure is made of a bendable material or comprises a bendable material as the main component of the structure, in order for the harness-structure to adjust flexibly to the shape of the hull, although not necessarily being stretchable.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, the harness-structure comprises a bendable ring-belt that is extending as a ring around the hull and around the longitudinal axis. The ring-belt is provided at a distance from the front end, for example corresponding to between 25% and 50% of the entire length of the hull, the length being measured along the longitudinal axis.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiment, the ring-belt is not stretchable in order to prevent elastic pressure on the hull and the gas volume inside, while in other embodiments, at least a part of the ring-belt is made resiliently stretchable in order to snugly fit onto the hull even when the hull is changing size. The different embodiments serve different purposes and depend on the desired conditions. For a stratospheric airship, the low temperature of the environment has to be taken into account when designing a resiliently stretchable harness, as elastic materials change properties when cooled down.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The harness structure, for example the ring-belt or the side-bands or both, is used for fastening and supporting at least one of:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0014">the propeller engine or multiple propeller engines,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0015">the batteries,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0016">the solar cells, for example provided on a panel, especially a flexible panel; and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0017">control modules for controlling the overall running of the system.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0015" num="0018">For example, the batteries are provided at a location that is on the underside of the hull when oriented in normal operation. For example, the control by the control modules includes the charging procedure, the functioning of the power supply and/or the running of the engine or engines as well as the steering.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0019">Typically, two propeller engines are provided, one on either side of the hull. It is advantageous if the engines are provided close to the harness, for example at a distance from the hull of less than half or even less than a quarter of the diameter of the hull at the position of the engine. For example, the distance from the hull to the first propeller engine on one side of the hull is less than half or even less than a quarter of the distance from the first propeller to the second propeller on the other side of the hull. For example, the distance from the hull to the propeller is less than two times the propeller size.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0020">Steering can be accomplished by directional adjustable tail fins or side fins. For light weight airships, however, the fins are optionally not adjustable but fixed in direction, making is possible to fasten it to the hull by gluing. Alternatively, the fins are attached to the harness-structure. In case that the fins are not adjustable, the propeller engines are advantageously adjustable in angle in order to direct the thrust slightly upwards or downwards while pulling forward.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0021">Optionally, the harness-structure comprises bendable side-bands. For example, these are fastened to the ring-belt and extend along the outer side of the hull from the ring-belt to the tail of the hull, for example to the rear end. Typically, the side-bands are provided symmetrically on opposite sides of the hull. Optionally, the side bands are not stretchable in order to provide stability of the shape of the harness-structure. As the tail, especially the rear end, is narrower than a middle part of the hull, where the ring-belt is advantageously provided, a forward pull by propulsion units on the harness-structure would not slide of the hull but pull the tail along with the ring-belt.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0022">In some embodiments, electrical conductors are integrated in a material of the harness-structure, for example side-bands or the ring-belt or both, for conducting the electrical current. The electrical conductors are used for at least one of the following:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0023">between the solar cells and the batteries,</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0024">between the batteries and the engines,</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0025">between the solar cells and the engines.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0020" num="0026">It is an advantage if the solar cells, for example on a solar cell panel, the batteries, and the propeller engine or engines are electrically interconnected by electrical conductors that are integrated in the bendable material of the harness structure. Especially, in the case where the material of the harness-structure, for example including side-bands or the ring-belt or both, is a textile material comprising yarn, optionally woven or knitted. In this case, the electrical conductors are potentially provided as part of the material, for example, interwoven with the yarn or knitted or embroided into the material. Alternatively, the conductors are printed or laminated onto the material of the harness structure, for example side-bands and/or ring-belt.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0027">The electrical conductors can also be used for electronic signals between electronic components, especially control units. Optionally, the electrical conductors also comprise a digital databus for transmitting digital data signals between one or more control units and at least one of:<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0028">the batteries,</li>        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0029">the solar cells, and</li>        <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0030">the engine or engines.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0022" num="0031">For digital signals, optoelectronics can be used as an alternative to electrical conductors. For example, light guides for transmission of digital light signals can be integrated in the harness-structure, for example by interweaving flexible light guides into the harness textile material. Alternatively, the light guides are fastened to a surface of the harness-structure.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0032">As it appears from the following, the various components are supported by the harness structure and are independent from the hull. The hull is not perturbed by these structures, minimizing the risk for leaks. Advantageously, the components are attached to the hull only by the harness-structure that surrounds the hull. This allows production of the harness structure with all the necessary components separately from the hull. For example, the entire harness-structure is provided, and the at least partially inflated hull is inserted into the harness structure as a final stage prior to launch of the airship.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0033">Alternatively, the harness structure is fastened around the hull after at least partial inflation.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0034">Typically, the electrical conductors are flexible wires, and the fabrics of the harness-structure comprises contact locations at which there is an electrical connection between the wires and the batteries or solar cells or engines. For example, the wires are only locally extending out of the fabric at these contact locations.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0035">Typically, the flexible wires are not stretchable. However wires can be meander-formed in order to provide stretchable conductors. In case the textile material is stretchable, especially more stretchable than the wires, options for structural match between the fabric material and the conductors include meander-formed wires that are used as stretchable conductors.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0036">In some embodiments where a stretchable harness-structure is desired, the fabric includes elastomers to make the harness-structure resiliently stretchable.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0037">As a further optional feature, the ring-belt is provided with a ring-belt tensioner cooperating with the ring-belt and configured for providing contractive tension to the ring-belt in a direction towards reduction of the length of the ring-belt. This feature yields an adjustable mechanism which minimizes the risk for the ring-belt to become lose from the hull. Such tensioner also makes it possible to adjust the diameter of the ring-belt in case of change in the hull size without the need of a stretchable material of the ring-belt itself. This feature is also useful for accommodating volume variations of the hull due to temperature changes of the gas during the day and night.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0038">In a possible practical embodiment, the ring-belt tensioner comprises a first rigid arm fastened to a first location on the ring-belt, a second rigid arm fastened to a second location on the ring-belt, and a contracting resilient element connecting the first rigid arm to the second rigid arms and providing a resilient contraction force for pulling the first and the second location on the ring-belt towards each other.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0039">I a concrete embodiment, the first and second rigid arms extend outward from the ring-belt and are mutually connected at an arm-connection remote from the ring-belt, such that the first and second location and the arm-connection form a triangle, and the contracting resilient element is provided inside this triangle.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0040">Optionally, the engine is fastened to the first or second rigid arm or both, for example at the arm-connection.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0041">Advantageously, the solar cells are not fastened to the surface of the hull material. Rather, the solar cells are only fastened to the harness-structure. For example, the solar cells are fastened to a base fabric, so as to form a flexible solar cell panel, which is fastened to the hull material but not fastened to the surface of the hull material. Optionally, the base fabric is fastened to a heat insulating layer, for example foam layer, between the base fabric and the hull for minimizing heat dissipation from the solar cells to the hull. Such triple structure is also, advantageously, fastened to and supported by the harness-structure, especially the ring-belt or the side-bands or both.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0042">Typically, the harness-structure abuts the hull surface and encloses it at least partly but is not bonded to the surface material of the hull. Thus, no glue or other bonding material is used between the harness-structure and the hull surface, and the hull is not perturbed for any fastening of the harness-structure to the hull. Rather, the hull is inserted into the harness-structure, or the harness-structure is laid around the hull, and the harness structure is fixing the hull inside the harness-structure by the pressure between the outer hull surface and the inner surface of the harness-structure. This puts minimal stress on the hull material, which is desired thin and light-weight. It also implies that the hull can be easily removed from the harness-structure and replaced, keeping the harness structure as an integrated unit with power supply, power storage, engines and control units.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0043">For example, the lighter than air airship is provided according to the following method. An elongate hull is provided with a longitudinal axis and the hull inflated with gas. Separately from the hull, a harness-structure is made of a bendable material. Only after inflating the hull, the harness structure is positioned around the hull, such that the harness-structure is abutting an outer side of the hull without perturbing the hull and without extending through the hull.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0044">For example, prior to mounting of the harness-structure around the hull, the solar panel is secured to the harness structure. Also prior to such mounting, or alternatively after mounting, one or more propeller engines for forward thrust of the airship are secured to the harness-structure. Typically, two propeller engines are used, one on each of two opposite sides of the hull. Batteries, rechargeable by the solar cells of the solar panel, are also attached to the harness-structure for providing electrical power to the propeller engine or engines. Electrical conductors, advantageously integrated in the bendable material of the harness structure, are electrically interconnecting the solar cell panel, the batteries, and the propeller engine or engines.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0045">In some concrete embodiments, the harness-structure has a bendable ring-belt comprising two opposite ends provided with belt fasteners. After inflation of the hull, the harness-structure is secured around the hull by interconnecting the two belt fasteners such that the ring-belt extends as a ring around the hull and around a longitudinal axis of the hull.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0046">In order to avoid a difficult controllable buoyancy of the hull during mounting of the harness-structure, the hull is provided with a ballonet inside the hull for dividing the hull into at least two separate volumes of which at least one is for air and at least one for helium or hydrogen. The air volume, and optionally also the other volume for hydrogen or helium, is inflated prior to securing the harness-structure around the hull.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SHORT DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0038" num="0047">The invention will be explained in more detail with reference to the drawing, where</p><p id="p-0039" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a lighter-than-air airship with a harness structure and a) with hull and b) without hull;</p><p id="p-0040" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an alternative lighter-than-air airship with a harness structure and a) with hull and b) without hull;</p><p id="p-0041" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows the propeller and tensioner in greater detail</p><p id="p-0042" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic drawing of the harness-structure with integrated conductors;</p><p id="p-0043" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows an enlarged drawing of a harness ribbon;</p><p id="p-0044" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows sealed connectors;</p><p id="p-0045" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a schematic drawing of the solar cell panel;</p><p id="p-0046" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates a harness structure prior to mounting on the hull.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION/PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading><p id="p-0047" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a </i></figref>illustrates a lighter-than-air airship <b>1</b>.

The solar cells <b>12</b>&#x2032; are electrically interconnected by panel-conductors <b>26</b> on the solar cell panel <b>12</b>, for example solar cell wiring.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0062">The currents from the solar cells <b>12</b>&#x2032; to the batteries <b>11</b> and from the batteries <b>11</b> to the propeller engines <b>10</b>, and optionally from the solar cells <b>12</b>&#x2032; directly to the propeller engines <b>10</b>, are conducted through conductors <b>13</b> that are integrated in the harness-structure <b>3</b>, for example in the ring-belt <b>7</b> material, as best illustrated schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. For example, the ring-belt <b>7</b> and potentially also the side-bands <b>8</b> are made from a woven or knitted material into which the conductors <b>13</b> are interwoven. An example of a woven ribbon with integrated, interwoven conducting flexible wires <b>13</b>&#x2032; is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0063">Reference is made further to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> in the following, which illustrates a further exemplary practical embodiment.

The female part <b>21</b>B is electrically connected to the wire <b>13</b>&#x2032; and is sealed to the location <b>21</b> by a sealing material <b>24</b>, typically a polymer resin. The male part <b>22</b>A is forming an end of a cable <b>23</b>, for example connected the solar cells <b>12</b>&#x2032;, the batteries <b>11</b>, or the propeller engines <b>10</b>. Typically, such connection to the solar cells <b>12</b>&#x2032;, the batteries <b>11</b>, or the propeller engines <b>10</b> are connected to control units that ensure a proper functioning and coordinate the interplay of the various electrical and electronic components.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0064">Alternatively to interweaving, the conductors are provided on top the material of the harness structure, for example by lamination or printing. This is also a way of integrating the conductors into the material of the harness, due to the conductors <b>13</b> becoming largely irremovable parts of the material by these techniques.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0065">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the ring-belt <b>7</b> comprises a ring-belt tensioner <b>14</b> for contractive tension to the ring-belt <b>7</b>. The force is such that is tends to decrease the length of the ring-belt, thus, holding the ring-belt <b>7</b> tight on the outer surface of the hull <b>2</b>. Such ring-belt tensioner <b>14</b> is used to compensate for hull volume variations due to temperature shifts. The corresponding length variation is typically in the order of a few percent, for example less than 5% or less than 2%, of the length of the ring-belt.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0066">The ring-belt tensioner <b>30</b> comprises a first rigid arm <b>15</b>A fastened to a first location <b>16</b>A on the ring-belt <b>7</b> and a second rigid arm <b>15</b>B fastened to a second location <b>16</b>B on the ring-belt <b>7</b>. The first rigid arm <b>15</b>A and the second rigid arm <b>15</b>B are connected to a resilient contracting element <b>17</b> connecting the first rigid arm <b>15</b>A to the second rigid arm <b>15</b>B and providing a resilient contraction force for pulling the first location <b>16</b>A and the second location <b>16</b>B on the ring-belt <b>7</b> towards each other. As illustrated, the first rigid arm <b>15</b>A and the second rigid arm <b>15</b>B extend outward from the ring-belt <b>7</b> and are mutually connected at an arm-connection <b>18</b> remote from the ring-belt <b>7</b>. The first location <b>16</b>A and second location <b>16</b>B and the arm-connection <b>18</b> form a triangle, wherein the contracting resilient element <b>14</b> is provided inside this triangle. In the current illustration, the distance of the propeller engine <b>10</b> from the hull is in the order of the length of the propeller <b>9</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0067">For example, the contracting resilient element <b>14</b> is a coiled spring (not shown) inside a sleeve <b>14</b>A into which a rod <b>14</b>B resiliently extends. The sleeve <b>14</b>A and the rod <b>14</b>B are connected to the first and the second arm <b>15</b>A and <b>15</b>B, respectively.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0068">The harness structure <b>3</b> is an autonomous structure in the sense that it carries the entire electrical system without perturbing the hull <b>2</b> and without extending through the hull <b>2</b>. For example, the harness structure <b>3</b> is provided as a complete entity which is a mounted onto the hull after inflation of the hull. An advantage is that the hull can be inflated freely without the risk for wrinkles between the hull material and the harness structure <b>3</b>. Accordingly, the post-inflation attachment of the harness structure <b>3</b> to the hull <b>2</b> minimizes risk for damage to the hull <b>2</b> and minimizes the risk for creation of weak points in the hull <b>2</b> material.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0069">For example the harness-structure <b>3</b> is provided as a quasi-complete structure with a solar cell panel <b>12</b> and conductors <b>13</b> integrated in the harness material. An example is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. The harness-structure <b>3</b> of this embodiment comprises a ring-belt <b>7</b> and a further ring-belt <b>7</b>&#x2032; but no side bands. The two ring-belts <b>7</b>, <b>7</b>&#x2032; have fastened in between them the solar panel <b>12</b> in which also electrically conducting panel-conductors <b>26</b> are integrated and optional electronic components <b>29</b>, for example for measuring parameters, such as temperature and electrical load. The panel-conductors <b>26</b>, for example solar cell wiring, for current that feeds the batteries and the propeller engines <b>10</b> are electrically connected to conductors <b>13</b> that are integrated in the ring-belt <b>7</b>. The ring-belt <b>7</b> also carries a control unit <b>25</b> for electronic control of the propeller engines, the battery charging and discharging, and/or the solar cells <b>12</b>&#x2032; on the solar cell panel <b>12</b>. For example the control unit <b>25</b> is electronically connected by conductors <b>13</b>&#x2032; to the electronic components <b>29</b> for receiving parameter values, such as performance measurements and temperature of the solar cells <b>12</b>&#x2032;. Optionally, the conductor <b>13</b>&#x2032; for measurements is a digital databus. As a further option, also the further ring-belt <b>7</b>&#x2032; has conductors integrated in the harness material.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0070">When the harness-structure <b>3</b> is fastened to the inflated hull <b>2</b>, the ring-belt <b>7</b> and the further ring-belt <b>7</b>&#x2032; need to be closed as rings around the hull <b>2</b>. This can be accomplished by belt fasteners <b>28</b> that are attached to ends of the ring-belts <b>7</b>, <b>7</b>&#x2032; and which when combined close the ring-belt into a ring structure, for example by using interconnecting fastening straps <b>28</b>. This principle is similar to fastening a saddle onto a horse, which is also expressed by the term of a &#x201c;harness&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0071">Optionally, the fastening straps <b>28</b> are resiliently stretchable in order to resiliently adjust the length of the ring-belt <b>7</b>, especially during the rise of the airship <b>1</b> to high altitude, for example the stratosphere. Such resiliently stretchable fastening straps <b>28</b> can be used as an alternative or in addition to the belt tensioners <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0072">The propeller engines <b>10</b> can be pre-fastened to the belt <b>7</b> prior to fastening of the harness-structure <b>3</b> to the inflated hull <b>2</b>. Alternatively, the propeller engines <b>10</b> are fastened to the ring-belt <b>7</b> after fastening of the harness-structure <b>3</b> to the inflated hull <b>2</b>. Optionally, also the batteries <b>11</b> are fastened to the harness structure <b>3</b> after mounting of the harness-structure <b>3</b> to the hull <b>2</b>. Although, in principle the solar panel <b>12</b> can be attached to the ring-belts <b>7</b>&#x2032; <b>7</b>&#x2032; after fastening of the ring-belts <b>7</b>, <b>7</b>&#x2032; around the inflated hull <b>2</b>, it is in some embodiments preferred to provide the harness structure <b>3</b> with at rings <b>7</b>, <b>7</b>&#x2032; to which the solar panel <b>12</b> is already secured and electrically connected. This safeguards the correct distance between the rings <b>7</b>, <b>7</b>&#x2032; during the fastening, and also facilitates the provision of electrical and electronic connections between the solar panel <b>12</b> and the ring-belt <b>7</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0073">For example for a complete mounting procedure, the hull <b>2</b> is inflated fully, the harness structure <b>3</b> including the ring-belts <b>7</b>, <b>7</b>&#x2032; and the solar panel <b>12</b> are fastened around to the hull <b>2</b>, the propeller engines <b>10</b> and the batteries <b>11</b> are fastened to the ring-belt and electrically connected in subsequent steps as well as any additional pay-load.
