The contents of the PCT Application is incorporated herein by reference.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Gas turbines include a compressor that compresses air, a combustor that combusts fuel with the air compressed by the compressor to generate combustion gas, and a turbine that is driven by the combustion gas from the combustor.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Combustors generally have a transition piece (or combustion tube) through which fuel is combusted, a plurality of nozzles that inject fuel into the transition piece, an inner tube that covers the plurality of nozzles, and an acoustic damper that suppresses combustion vibration or the like. The transition piece and inner tube form a tubular shape around a combustor axis. Here, for the convenience of the following description, a direction in which the combustor axis extends is referred to as an axis direction, and one side of both sides in the axis direction is referred to as a tip side and the other side is referred to as a base end side. The transition piece is provided on the tip side of the inner tube. Additionally, the base end side of the inner tube is blocked with a base end plate or the like. Both the inner tube and the transition piece are disposed in a gas turbine casing. The acoustic damper has an acoustic cover that forms an acoustic space inside.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a combustor described in the following PTL 1, the acoustic cover is disposed outside the gas turbine casing and attached to the base end plate. The base end plate is provided with acoustic holes penetrating into the gas turbine casing from the acoustic space.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0006">[PTL 1] Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2004-183944</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">When the gas turbine is being driven, compressed air, which is the air compressed by the compressor, is present in the gas turbine casing in which the inner tube and the transition piece are disposed. For this reason, the pressure inside the gas turbine casing is higher than the atmospheric pressure. On the other hand, the pressure outside the gas turbine casing is the atmospheric pressure. In a technique described in PTL 1, since the acoustic space communicates with the gas turbine casing through the acoustic holes, the pressure in the acoustic space becomes the pressure in the gas turbine casing. That is, in the technique described in PTL 1, the pressure in the acoustic space becomes higher than the atmospheric pressure. In the technique described in the above PTL 1, since the acoustic cover forming the acoustic space is disposed outside the gas turbine casing, a pressure difference between the inside and outside of the acoustic cover becomes large, and the acoustic cover needs to have a pressure resistant structure. For this reason, the technique described in PTL 1 increases the manufacturing cost.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Thus, an object of the present disclosure is to provide a combustor and a gas turbine including the combustor capable of suppressing manufacturing cost.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A combustor as one aspect according to the present disclosure for achieving the above object includes a flange that spreads in a radial direction from an axis and is attached to a gas turbine casing; an outer tube that forms a tubular shape around the axis and is disposed in the gas turbine casing and attached to the flange; an inner tube that forms a tubular shape around the axis and is disposed on an inner peripheral side of the outer tube; an in-tube injection nozzle that is disposed on an inner peripheral side of the inner tube and attached to the flange and is capable of injecting fuel; a transition piece that forms a tubular shape around the axis, is connected to the inner tube, and allows the fuel injected from the in-tube injection nozzle to be combusted on an inner peripheral side of the transition piece; and a base-end-side acoustic damper having an outer tube forming part which is a part of a plate forming the outer tube, and an acoustic cover that forms a base-end-side space in the gas turbine casing on an outer peripheral side of the outer tube in cooperation with the outer tube forming part. In a tip side that is a side where the outer tube is disposed in a case where the flange is used as a reference, and a base end side that is a side opposite to the tip side out of both sides of an axis direction in which the axis extends, the transition piece is connected to a portion of the inner tube on the tip side and extends toward the tip side. The outer tube forming part is provided with a plurality of acoustic holes penetrating the base-end-side space from the inner peripheral side of the outer tube.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The acoustic cover of the base-end-side acoustic damper can also be provided on the base end side of the flange. In this case, the base-end-side space is located outside the gas turbine casing. For this reason, a pressure difference between the inside and outside of the acoustic cover becomes large, and the acoustic cover needs to have a pressure resistant structure. Therefore, in this case, the manufacturing cost is high.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the present aspect, since the acoustic cover of the base-end-side acoustic damper is disposed in the gas turbine casing on the outer peripheral side of the outer tube, both the pressure outside the acoustic cover and the pressure inside the acoustic cover become the pressure inside the gas turbine casing, and the acoustic cover does not need to have a pressure resistant structure. Therefore, in the present aspect, an increase in the manufacturing cost can be suppressed.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Additionally, the acoustic cover of the base-end-side acoustic damper can be provided on the outer peripheral side of the inner tube. In this case, the acoustic cover of the base-end-side acoustic damper is located in one region of the compressed air flow path between the outer tube and the inner tube. When the acoustic cover of the base-end-side acoustic damper is located in one region of the compressed air flow path, a bias occurs in the flow of compressed air in the inner tube. Specifically, for example, the flow rate of the compressed air in a region in the inner tube close to the base-end-side acoustic damper is less than the flow rate of the compressed air in a region in the inner tube far from the base-end-side acoustic damper. In this way, when a bias occurs in the flow of compressed air in the inner tube, a part of the fuel injected into the transition piece may not be completely combusted.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Thus, in the present aspect, the base-end-side acoustic damper is provided on the outer peripheral side of the outer tube to suppress the bias of the flow of the compressed air in the inner tube.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">A gas turbine as one aspect according to the present disclosure for achieving the above object includes</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">the combustor of the above aspect; a compressor capable of compressing air to supply compressed air to the combustor; a turbine capable of being driven by combustion gas generated in the combustor; and an intermediate casing.

The turbine is disposed on a second side out of a first side and the second side in a rotor axis direction in which the rotor axis extends, and has a turbine rotor that rotates about the rotor axis, and a turbine casing that covers an outer peripheral side of the turbine rotor. The compressor rotor and the turbine rotor are coupled to each other to form a gas turbine rotor. The intermediate casing is disposed between the compressor casing and the turbine casing in the rotor axis direction, and forms a space into which the compressed air, which is the air compressed by the compressor, flows.

For this reason, in the present embodiment, the area of the base-end-side hole forming region <b>68</b> is made larger than the area of the tip-side hole forming region <b>58</b> in order to enhance the effect of suppressing the combustion vibration by the base-end-side acoustic damper <b>60</b>.

However, in a case where the tip-side acoustic damper <b>50</b> does not have the air intake <b>54</b><i>h</i>, there is a concern that high-temperature gas such as combustion gas generated in the transition piece <b>45</b> may flow into the tip-side space <b>57</b> through the acoustic holes <b>52</b>.

The compressed air in the intermediate casing <b>14</b> flows into the tip-side space <b>57</b> from the air intake <b>54</b><i>h</i>.
