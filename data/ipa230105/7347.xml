Unfortunately, it can be difficult for many people to maintain the motivation to continue these fitness regimes. Work, children, spouses, schooling, and other activities may seem to get in the way of a person's fitness goals. However, fitness goals can be important to maintaining health and hopefully living a long life. Accordingly, the importance of working out cannot be understated. Thus, a need exists to help keep people motivated to continue the fitness routine to reach their goals and hopefully remain healthy and active. One way to help maintain motivation is to exercise within a workout community where members of that workout community may keep each other motivated.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In one example implementation, an embodiment includes systems and methods for displaying a workout session.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Disclosed are example embodiments of a method for displaying a workout session.

It has proven convenient at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to these signals as bits, values, elements, symbols, characters, terms, numbers or the like.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">It should be borne in mind, however, that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities. Unless specifically stated otherwise as apparent from the following disclosure, it is appreciated that throughout the disclosure terms such as &#x201c;processing,&#x201d; &#x201c;computing,&#x201d; &#x201c;calculating,&#x201d; &#x201c;determining,&#x201d; &#x201c;displaying&#x201d; or the like, refer to the action and processes of a computer system, or similar electronic computing device, that manipulates and transforms data represented as physical (electronic) quantities within the computer system's registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computer system's memories or registers or other such information storage, transmission or display.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">Finally, the algorithms and displays presented herein are not inherently related to any particular computer or other apparatus.
