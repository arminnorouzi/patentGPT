Additionally, as technology has progressed, users are increasingly using not only smartphones to access content and services, but also a variety of other devices to access content and services. Such devices include, but are not limited to, laptops, tablets, phablets, computers, and a variety of wearable devices. The wearable device space is poised to expand dramatically in the coming years. For example, certain analysts are predicting multi-billion dollars in revenue for the wearable device space alone. Currently, many users view wearable devices, such as smart watches, as accessories to their smartphones instead of as replacements. However, as wearable devices start to gain further traction with users, such users will expect such wearable devices to have similar functionality and features as their smartphones. Additionally, much like the traditional watch and fashion jewelry space, it will be common for users to own multiple devices that serve similar functions. Furthermore, an increasing number of users are becoming familiar with the Internet of Things (IoT), which is the network of physical objects embedded with software, sensors, electronics, and network connectivity that enables such objects to exchange data between each other and with various systems.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">While current technologies provide for many benefits and efficiencies, current technologies still have many shortcomings. In particular, current technologies often provide limited ways in which to authenticate users into various systems, device ecosystems, and networks. Additionally, current technologies often require users to subscribe to separate connectivity services for each device in their device ecosystem. For example, some users may purchase a wireless plan specifically for their smartphone, and may separately purchase a wireless plan specifically for their cellular-enabled tablet. As a result, this creates challenges for services providers with regard to both authentication and in the delivery of services. As a result, current methodologies and technologies associated with authenticating users and provisioning network and connectivity services may be modified so as to provide enhanced quality-of-service for users and companies. Such enhancements and improvements to methodologies and technologies may provide for improved customer satisfaction, increased security, increased ease-of-use, and substantial cost savings.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A system and accompanying methods for providing wearable authentication and management are disclosed. In particular, the system and methods may allow for the identification and authentication of users through the use of biometric data, movement signatures, and/or other authentication information specific to a user of a user device, such as a wearable device. Based on the authentication, the system and methods may deliver a number of different capabilities, experiences, and services to the user and/or the user device. In order to accomplish the foregoing, the system and methods may involve receiving biometric data, a movement signature, and/or other authentication information from a wearable device worn by a user. The system and methods may analyze the biometric data, movement signature, and/or authentication information to determine if they match biometric data, a movement signature and/or authentication information associated with a plan for connectivity services. If the biometric data, movement signature, and/or authentication information do not match the biometric data, the movement signature, and/or the authentication information associated with the plan, the system and methods may prevent the wearable device and the user from being provisioned with or utilizing the connectivity services associated with the plan.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">If, however, the received biometric data, movement signature, and/or authentication information do match the biometric data, the movement signature, and/or the authentication information associated with the plan, the system and methods may include authenticating the user and the wearable device worn by the user. Once the user and wearable device are authenticated, the system and methods may include activating and provisioning wireless connectivity for the wearable device and associating the device with the various services under the plan. In certain embodiments, the wearable device may be joined to a device ecosystem formed by the devices already serviced under the plan. The system and methods may also include delivering predefined settings tailored to the wearable device, and delivering communications that are sent to other devices in the device ecosystem also to the wearable device. In certain embodiments, the system and methods may provide for additional levels of authentication so as to allow the wearable device to securely access the user's connected home, bank accounts, office buildings, hotels, vehicles, devices, and/or programs. In certain embodiments, the system and methods may allow the wearable device to be automatically granted access to participate in high-security transactions based on the authentication.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">If the user ceases to wear the wearable device or does not utilize the wearable device for a threshold period of time, the system and methods may include deactivating the connectivity services that were provisioned for the wearable device. Additionally, the system and methods may include removing the predefined settings pushed to the wearable device after authentication. Furthermore, the system and methods may also include removing any data and content provided to the wearable device while the wearable device was being worn by the user. In certain embodiments, the system and methods may include providing notifications of unauthorized usage if the wearable device is not authenticated or the wearable device is stolen. In such embodiments, the system and methods may include tracking and monitoring the wearable device. In additional embodiments, the system and methods may include transmitting notifications to the user associated with the plan if the wearable device (or other device) has not been utilized for a selected period of time. In such a scenario, the system and methods may enable the user to terminate any services being provided to the wearable device (or other device).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Notably, the system and methods may enable users to have multiple devices without having to maintain an individual connection for each device in the users' device ecosystems. Additionally, in certain embodiments, the system and methods may more efficiently utilize network resources by only creating a connection for a device while it is being worn. The system and methods may provide for a seamless experience allowing for connectivity to connected wearable devices without the need to provision or establish a connection for each use. The systems and methods also allow for highly secure authentication allowing users to protect what is important to them, and also ensure proper access by an enterprise. Furthermore, the system and methods allow users to better manage the number of active devices on their plan and quickly understand which devices have been inactive for a given period of time. As a result of the foregoing, the system and methods allow for greater conservation of network resources, improved user satisfaction, increased authentication and security, increased ease-of-use, and substantial cost savings.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one embodiment, a system for providing wearable authentication and management is disclosed.

If the first biometric data matches the second biometric data and/or if the first movement signature matches the second movement signature, the system may perform an operation that includes authenticating the first user and the first wearable device worn by the first user for access to the connectivity services. After authenticating the first user and the first wearable device, the system may perform an operation that includes provisioning the connectivity services for the first wearable device. The system may then proceed to perform an operation that includes delivering, to the first wearable device, predefined settings established for the first wearable device in the plan for the connectivity services. Finally, the system may proceed to perform an operation that includes delivering, to the first wearable device, a communication sent to a primary device of the first user.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another embodiment, a method for providing wearable authentication and management is disclosed.

In this example scenario, there may be a first user <b>101</b> that may have a smartphone (i.e. first user device <b>102</b>), a smart watch (i.e. second user device <b>106</b>), and a tablet (i.e. third user device <b>110</b>). There may also be a second user <b>115</b> that may have a wearable smartphone (i.e. fourth user device <b>116</b>). The first user <b>101</b> may subscribe to a wireless connectivity plan with a service provider associated with communications network <b>135</b> and/or communications network <b>165</b>. The first user <b>101</b> may enroll the smartphone, the smart watch, and the tablet into the wireless connectivity plan. The smartphone and the tablet may initially belong to a device ecosystem <b>114</b>, which may allow each of the devices in the device ecosystem to share information, content, data, and communications with each other. Additionally, the first user <b>101</b> may authorize one or more other users who may borrow the first user's <b>101</b> devices and/or utilize their own devices under the plan. The authorized users may be specified in a list of authorized users, which may be stored in a user profile of the first user <b>101</b>. The first user <b>101</b> may authorize the second user <b>115</b> to utilize connectivity services subscribed to by the first user <b>101</b> under the plan.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In addition to specifying authorized users, the first user <b>101</b> may establish desired settings to be pushed to each device that is authorized by the system <b>100</b>, such as to a device authorized to join the device ecosystem <b>114</b>. The settings may indicate the amount of bandwidth associated with the connectivity services that a device should be authorized to receive and/or use, whether certain notifications should be turned off or on for a particular device, whether a certain device should be authorized to make calls, whether a certain device may send or receive text messages and/or instant messages, whether a certain device may make roaming calls, whether a certain device can access a certain type of application, whether a certain device may access the vehicle <b>175</b>, whether a certain device may access a connected home <b>178</b>, whether a device may access an account associated with hotel <b>180</b>, whether a certain device may make e-commerce transactions with shop <b>182</b>, whether a certain device may access a bank account associated with bank <b>184</b>, whether a certain device may access an account associated with entity <b>186</b>, whether there is automatic authorization to participate in certain classes of transactions with third parties, any other possible setting, or any combination thereof. In certain embodiments, the settings may be adjusted based on the capabilities and technical specifications of the device.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The first user <b>101</b> may put on the smart watch, which may prompt the first user <b>101</b> for authentication information to access the connectivity services under the plan, such as via an application of the smart watch. Authentication information may be a biometric input that may be received via the smart watch of the first user <b>101</b>. The biometric input, for example, may include a heart rate, a fingerprint, an iris scan, any other biometric input, or any combination thereof. For example, the smart watch may have a fingerprint scanner or a heart rate sensor to obtain the biometric input from the first user <b>101</b>. Additionally, another type of authentication input may be a movement signature. An accelerometer <b>109</b> of the smart watch may also measure the movements of the first user <b>101</b>, which may be utilized to generate a movement signature of the first user <b>101</b>. The movement signature, for example, may be a walking style, gait, or other movement that is unique to the first user <b>101</b>. Furthermore, the smart watch may also be configured to receive other authentication information, such as a one-time password, which may be input via an application executing on the smart watch. Whether a biometric input, movement signature input, or other authentication input is needed may be determined based on what is specified by the system <b>100</b>, in the plan, and/or in a user profile of the first user <b>101</b>. In certain embodiments, the system <b>100</b> may require one of a biometric input, a movement signature, or a password. In certain embodiments, the system <b>100</b> may require certain combinations of the aforementioned inputs to gain access to the connectivity services under the plan.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Once the biometric input, movement signature, and/or other authentication information are received from the smart watch, the smart watch may deliver the inputs to the server <b>170</b>, which may be an authentication server of communications network <b>165</b>. The server <b>170</b> may analyze the biometric input, movement signature, and/or other authentication information received from the smart watch to determine if they match stored biometric input, movement signature, and/or other authentication information contained in a user profile associated with the plan. If the inputs do not match the stored authentication information, the system <b>100</b> may block the wearable device from joining the device ecosystem <b>114</b>, from being provisioned with connectivity services under the plan, or a combination thereof. However, if the inputs do match the stored authentication information, the server <b>170</b> may authenticate the first user <b>101</b> and the smart watch. In certain embodiments, once the first user <b>101</b> and the smart watch are authenticated, wireless connectivity may be activated for the smart watch and the smart watch may be provisioned with connectivity services under the plan, such as by utilizing the servers in communications network <b>135</b>. Also, the smart watch may be joined to the device ecosystem <b>114</b> with the smartphone and tablet. Additionally, any predefined settings specified for the smart watch may be pushed to the smart watch by the servers in the communications network <b>135</b>. For example, the settings may obtained from a user profile of the first user <b>101</b> that specifies the settings, and then the settings may be pushed to the smart watch. The settings pushed to the smart watch may cause the smart watch to operate under the conditions of the settings.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Once the smart watch is authenticated, the connectivity services are activated for the smart watch, and the settings are pushed to the smart watch, the system <b>100</b> may allow one or more communications to be delivered to the smart watch. For example, an incoming call to the smartphone may be forwarded to the smart watch for the first user <b>101</b> to answer. Similarly, a text message, email, instant message, or other communication sent to the tablet or smartphone may also be sent to the smart watch. Each of the devices in the device ecosystem <b>114</b> may share communications with each other while each of the devices and/or the first user <b>101</b> are authenticated. Additionally, based on the authentication, the smart watch may be pre-authorized to access features and functionality of the vehicle <b>175</b>, the connected home <b>178</b>, the hotel <b>180</b>, the shop <b>182</b>, the bank <b>184</b>, and/or the entity <b>186</b>. Furthermore, the smart watch may also be pre-authorized to conduct certain types of transactions with third parties, such as, but not limited to, the vehicle <b>175</b>, the connected home <b>178</b>, the hotel <b>180</b>, the shop <b>182</b>, the bank <b>184</b>, and/or the entity <b>186</b> based on the authentication. For example, the smart watch may be pre-authorized to conduct an e-commerce transaction with the shop <b>182</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">If, however, the first user <b>101</b> stops wearing the smart watch and/or does not utilize the smart watch for a threshold period of time specified under the plan, the system <b>100</b> may deactivate the wireless connectivity services to the smart watch and delete any settings pushed to the smart watch. Additionally, any content and data obtained by the smart watch while the smart watch was authenticated may be optionally deleted or removed as well. Furthermore, any authorization to conduct transactions with third parties may also be removed. In certain embodiments, when the first user <b>101</b> stops wearing the smart watch and/or does not utilize the smart watch for the threshold period of time, the system <b>100</b> may relegate the smart watch to the communications network <b>165</b> until the smart watch is authenticated again. In such a scenario, the communications network <b>165</b> may serve as a walled garden that may block the smart watch from accessing the device ecosystem <b>114</b>, the connectivity services under the plan, from receiving communications associated with the devices in the device ecosystem <b>114</b>, or a combination thereof. If the first user <b>101</b> starts using the smart watch again and/or wears the smart watch again, the smart watch and the first user <b>101</b> may be authenticated again after authentication information is provided by the first user <b>101</b> a second time. In certain embodiments, the same process described above may be repeated for the second user <b>115</b> using the wearable smartphone. The first user <b>101</b> may indicate in the first user's <b>101</b> profile that the second user <b>115</b> is authorized to access connectivity services under the plan and/or join the device ecosystem <b>114</b>. If the second user <b>115</b> effectively authenticates, the system <b>100</b> may allow the wearable smartphone to exchange data and communications with the devices in the device ecosystem <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Notably, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the system <b>100</b> may perform any of the operative functions disclosed herein by utilizing the processing capabilities of server <b>160</b>, the storage capacity of the database <b>155</b>, or any other component of the system <b>100</b> to perform the operative functions disclosed herein.

The method <b>200</b> may include, at step <b>202</b>, receiving first biometric data, a first movement signature, and/or other authentication credentials from a first wearable device worn by a first user <b>101</b>. For example, the first wearable device may be a smart watch worn by the first user <b>101</b> (e.g. second user device <b>106</b>). The biometric data sent may include, but is not limited to, fingerprints, palm veins, faces, DNA, palm prints, hand geometry, iris scans, retina scans, odors, voices, height information, weight information, body temperature information, any other biometric information, or any combination thereof. The movement signature may be obtained via measurements gathered by an accelerometer (e.g. accelerometer <b>109</b>) of the smart watch.

At step <b>208</b>, the method <b>200</b> may include authenticating the first user <b>101</b> and the first wearable device worn by the first user <b>101</b> for access to the connectivity services under the plan. When authenticated, the first wearable device may join a device ecosystem <b>114</b> associated with the plan that includes one or more devices of the first <b>101</b> and/or other users.

As another example, the system <b>100</b> may determine that the smart watch is no longer being used if the first user <b>101</b> turns off the smart watch or does not use one or more functions of the smart watch for a threshold period of time. In certain embodiments, the determining may be performed by utilizing the first user device <b>102</b>, the second user device <b>106</b>, the third user device <b>110</b>, the fourth user device <b>116</b>, the server <b>140</b>, the server <b>145</b>, the server <b>150</b>, the server <b>160</b>, the server <b>170</b>, the communications network <b>135</b>, the communications network <b>165</b>, the device ecosystem <b>114</b>, any combination thereof, or by utilizing any other appropriate program, network, system, or device.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">If, at step <b>216</b>, it is determined that the first user <b>101</b> is no longer wearing the first wearable device and/or not utilizing the first wearable device, such as for a threshold period of time, the method <b>200</b> may proceed to step <b>218</b>. At step <b>218</b>, the method <b>200</b> may include deactivating the connectivity services enabled and/or provisioned for the first wearable device, removing any predefined settings pushed to the first wearable device, removing any data and/or content received by the first wearable device while the connectivity services were enabled, removing the first wearable device from the device ecosystem <b>114</b>, or any combination thereof. For example, if it is determined that the first user <b>101</b> has taken off the smart watch, the system <b>100</b> may deactivate the connectivity services for the smart watch and remove any settings and data and/or content received by the smart watch. In certain embodiments, step <b>218</b> may be performed by utilizing the first user device <b>102</b>, the second user device <b>106</b>, the third user device <b>110</b>, the fourth user device <b>116</b>, the server <b>140</b>, the server <b>145</b>, the server <b>150</b>, the server <b>160</b>, the server <b>170</b>, the communications network <b>135</b>, the communications network <b>165</b>, the device ecosystem <b>114</b>, any combination thereof, or by utilizing any other appropriate program, network, system, or device. If, however, at step <b>216</b>, it is determined that the first user <b>101</b> is still wearing the first wearable device, the method <b>200</b> may, at step <b>220</b>, maintain connectivity services for the first wearable device. Using the example above, the system <b>100</b> may continue to allow the connectivity services for the smart watch and the smart watch may share connectivity, communications, and data with the devices in the device ecosystem <b>114</b>. In certain embodiments, the maintaining of the connectivity services may be performed by utilizing the first user device <b>102</b>, the second user device <b>106</b>, the third user device <b>110</b>, the fourth user device <b>116</b>, the server <b>140</b>, the server <b>145</b>, the server <b>150</b>, the server <b>160</b>, the server <b>170</b>, the communications network <b>135</b>, the communications network <b>165</b>, the device ecosystem <b>114</b>, any combination thereof, or by utilizing any other appropriate program, network, system, or device. Notably, the method <b>200</b> may further incorporate any of the features and functionality described for the system <b>100</b> or as otherwise described herein.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The systems and methods disclosed herein may include additional functionality and features. For example, based on the functionality provided by the systems and methods, in certain embodiments, the systems and methods may provide an ecosystem <b>114</b> of devices that support users that want to have multiple cellular-connected devices under a single plan. Additionally, the systems and methods may enable service switching between the devices in the plan. Furthermore, the systems and methods may allow for the sharing of connected devices between users, such as between friends and family, which allows for the development of a sharing economy that incentivizes users to share devices under the plan. In certain embodiments, the systems and methods may include transmitting notifications to the users indicating when a particular device is not being utilized or is not being utilized a threshold amount. In such a scenario, the system <b>100</b> may recommend that the users may save money if the user disconnects the unutilized or under-utilized device from the plan.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The systems and methods may enable users to have multiple devices for one user under a plan and/or multiple users for a single device under their plan. The systems and methods may enable the users to switch seamlessly between owned devices and borrowed devices (e.g. the first user <b>101</b> may authorize the second user <b>115</b> to use one or more of the first user's <b>101</b> devices) receiving their services without significant effort or provisioning for each device. Additionally, the systems and methods save users from having to open up a separate plan for connectivity services for each device they want to use. In certain embodiments, users may have multiple devices without having to maintain an individual connection for each device. In certain embodiments, the systems and methods may allow for more efficient use of network resources by only creating a connection for a wearable device while the wearable device is being worn and/or utilized. In certain embodiments, the users may specify that the predefined settings that are to be pushed to an authenticated device are the settings that correspond with another device in the device ecosystem <b>114</b>. For example, the first user <b>101</b> may specify that the settings for the first user device <b>102</b> should be pushed to the second user device <b>106</b> when the second user device <b>106</b> is authenticated. In such a scenario, the second user device <b>106</b> may have receive the same notifications in the same way as the first user device <b>102</b>, for example. Similarly, notifications that are blocked on the first user device <b>102</b> may also be blocked on the second user device <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In certain embodiments, any device that is not currently authenticated or has failed an authentication may be regulated and relegated to the communications network <b>165</b>, which may prevent any such device from being provisioned with the connectivity services and receiving communications associated with the devices in a particular device ecosystem <b>114</b> that the user was attempting to authenticate into. In certain embodiments, if a device is stolen, the system <b>100</b> may monitor and track the location of the stolen device and share the location with the other devices in the device ecosystem <b>114</b>. In certain embodiments, when a device authenticates with the system <b>100</b>, any preferences contained in a user profile associated with the plan may be downloaded to the device that is authenticated. For example, such preferences may be any type of preference including, but not limited to, preferences associated with vehicle <b>175</b>, preferences associated with products, preferences associated with investments, preferences associated with websites, any other preferences, or a combination thereof. As an example, if a smart watch is authenticated and the first user <b>101</b> is being driven in vehicle <b>175</b>, the smart watch may transmit information contained in the profile that indicates that the first user <b>101</b> likes the air conditioning at 75 degrees, the top up, and/or that the user does not like to be driven faster than 60 miles per hour. Based on the information received from the smart watch, the vehicle <b>175</b> may automatically adjust the air conditioning settings, put the top up, and ensure that the vehicle <b>175</b> does not accelerate past 60 miles per hour. In certain embodiments, each of the devices in the system <b>100</b> may be IoT devices, which may be configured to communicatively link to each other using IoT technologies.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Referring now also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, at least a portion of the methodologies and techniques described with respect to the exemplary embodiments of the system <b>100</b> can incorporate a machine, such as, but not limited to, computer system <b>300</b>, or other computing device within which a set of instructions, when executed, may cause the machine to perform any one or more of the methodologies or functions discussed above.
