Mass of a housing of the bone-conduction speaker has an obvious impact on the amplitude of the bone-conduction speaker, and further affects the sound volume generated by the speaker. When designing a bone-conduction earphone, additional functional modules such as a headset microphone (for example, a microphone with an extension rod) and buttons sometimes need to be arranged on only one side of a bone-conduction speaker and not on the other side. The arrangement of the buttons on the bone-conduction speaker changes mass distribution of the bone-conduction speaker, and therefore affects sound volume generated by the speaker. In addition, the functional modules such as the headset microphone or buttons only need to be arranged on one side. Therefore, this arrangement may result in volume difference between speakers on the two sides (a speaker volume in one ear is high but a speaker volume in the other ear is low), and may further result in a sensory sound source shift. If there is a great difference in volume between a speaker on the left side and a speaker on the right side, long-term use of the earphone may cause hearing impairments. Therefore, a sensory sound source (also referred to as virtual sound source) needs to be adjusted, so that the sensory sound source is centered, or volume of the speakers of the earphone on both sides needs to be adjusted, so that the volume of the speakers on both sides is identical. Thus, there exist the needs for a sound output device, a sensory sound source adjustment method, and a volume adjustment method to achieve the above-mentioned goals.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The following presents a brief summary of the present disclosure to provide a basic understanding about some exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure. It should be understood that the summary is neither intended to identify key or critical parts of the present disclosure nor intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts in the present disclosure in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is discussed later in the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A bone-conduction earphone may include a left bone-conduction speaker and a right bone-conduction speaker. As described above, for the bone-conduction earphone, functional modules added to the bone-conduction speaker on one side may increase mass of a housing of the bone-conduction speaker. Consequently, volume of the speaker on the side with increased mass may be reduced. Assuming the functional modules are disposed on the left bone-conduction speaker, then volume of the left bone-conduction speaker may be different from that of the right bone-conduction speaker. An obvious sensory sound source shift may result from a great volume difference between the left speaker and the right speaker, and long-term use of the earphone may even cause hearing impairments.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">To resolve technical problems of a volume difference and sensory sound source shift resulted from uneven mass distribution of speakers of a bone-conduction earphone on two sides, the present disclosure discloses a sound output device, including: a signal processing circuit to generate, during operation, a first electrical signal and a second electrical signal based on target sound information; a first speaker, electrically connected to the signal processing circuit to receive, during operation, the first electrical signal from the signal processing circuit and convert the first electrical signal into a first sound wave; and a second speaker, electrically connected to the signal processing circuit, to receive, during operation, the second electrical signal from the signal processing circuit and convert the second electrical signal into a second sound wave, where the sound output device converts the target sound information into the first sound wave in a first duration and further converts the target sound information into the second sound wave in a second duration, and the first duration is shorter than the second duration by a time difference.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure further discloses a sound output device, including: a signal processing circuit to generate, during operation, a first electrical signal and a second electrical signal based on target sound information; a first speaker, electrically connected to the signal processing circuit to receive, during operation, the first electrical signal from the signal processing circuit and convert the first electrical signal into a first excitation to excite a first mechanical structure to generate a first sound wave; and a second speaker, electrically connected to the signal processing circuit to receive, during operation, the second electrical signal from the signal processing circuit and convert the second electrical signal into a second excitation to excite a second mechanical structure to generate a second sound wave, where volume of the first sound wave is the same as volume of the second sound wave, and given a same excitation, sound volume generated by the first mechanical structure is lower than sound volume generated by the second mechanical structure.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present disclosure further discloses a sensory sound source adjustment method for a sound output device, including: obtaining a volume difference between a first sound wave and a second sound wave generated by the sound output device, the sound output device including: a signal processing circuit to generate, during operation, a first electrical signal and a second electrical signal based on target sound information, a first speaker, electrically connected to the signal processing circuit to receive, during operation, the first electrical signal from the signal processing circuit and convert the first electrical signal into the first sound wave, and a second speaker, electrically connected to the signal processing circuit to receive, during operation, the second electrical signal from the signal processing circuit and convert the second electrical signal into the second sound wave, where the sound output device converts the target sound information into the first sound wave in a first duration and the sound output device converts the target sound information into the second sound wave in a second duration, and the first duration is shorter than the second duration by a time difference; and adjusting the time difference.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">This application further discloses a sound output device, including:</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">This application further discloses a sensory sound source adjustment method.

In a vibration test, physical quantities used for evaluating a value of a vibration or volume may include but are not limited to a speed, a displacement, a sound pressure level, and the like of a vibration source. For example, in the vibration test shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, an acceleration level (unit: dB) of the vibration source is used as a physical quantity for evaluating a vibration.

A person of ordinary skill in the art may understand that distinguishing of the foregoing frequency bands is used only as an example for providing approximate intervals. Definitions of the foregoing frequency bands may change with different industries, different application scenarios, and different classification standards. For example, in some exemplary embodiments, a low frequency band may be a frequency band ranging from about 20 Hz to about 80 Hz; an intermediate-low frequency band may be a frequency band ranging from about 80 Hz to about 160 Hz; an intermediate frequency band may be a frequency band ranging from about 160 Hz to about 1280 Hz; an intermediate-high frequency band may be a frequency band ranging from about 1280 Hz to about 2560 Hz; and a high frequency band may be a frequency band ranging from about 2560 Hz to about 20 kHz.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0058">It should be noted that although only the relationship between the sound volume generated and the mass of the housing of a bone-conduction speaker is described in the foregoing description, the first speaker <b>310</b> in the present disclosure is not limited to the bone-conduction speaker.

Specifically, the method S<b>100</b> may include: S<b>110</b>, obtaining a volume difference between the first sound wave and the second sound wave; and S<b>120</b>, adjusting a time difference between generation of the first sound wave and the second sound wave.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0098">A &#x201c;binaural effect&#x201d; is an effect in which people determine a location of sound depending on a volume difference, a time difference, a phase difference, and a tone difference between two ears. Because there is a distance between a left ear and a right ear, same sound coming from other directions than a directly front direction and a directly rear direction arrives at the two ears at different times with different volume, phases, and tones, resulting in a volume difference, a time difference, a phase difference, and a tone difference. For example, if a sound source leans to the right, the sound will arrive at the right ear first and then arrives at the left ear later. If the sound leans more to one side, a time difference will increase correspondingly. For example, if the sound source leans to the right, a distance from the sound source to the right ear is shorter than a distance from the sound source to the left ear, and the sound volume arriving at the right ear is higher than the sound volume arriving at the left ear. If the sound leans to one side more, a volume difference will increase accordingly. For example, the sound is propagated in a form of a wave, but phases of the sound wave in different spatial positions are different. Due to a spatial distance between the two ears, phases of the sound wave arriving at the two ears may be different. A myringa in an eardrum vibrates with the sound wave. A phase difference of the vibration becomes a factor for determining the location of the sound source by the brain.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0099">Human brain may determine locations of sound sources (that is, sensory sound sources) depending on the &#x201c;binaural effect&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0100">If a left ear hears sound first, the brain of a listener perceives that the sound comes from the left (a side first hearing the sound), that is, a sensory sound source perceived by the brain of the listener leans to a left side, or vice versa. The phenomenon is referred to as a &#x201c;time difference effect&#x201d; between left and right ears.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0101">If the sound volume heard by the left ear is higher than the sound volume heard by the right ear, the brain of the listener considers that the sound comes from a left direction, or vice versa. The phenomenon is referred to as a &#x201c;volume difference effect&#x201d; between left and right ears. The foregoing sensory sound source shift caused by the mass difference between the first mechanical structure and the second mechanical structure may also be understood as a &#x201c;volume difference effect&#x201d; essentially.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0102">Therefore, the shift of the sensory sound source perceived by the user, which is caused by the &#x201c;volume difference&#x201d;, may be adjusted by using the &#x201c;time difference&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;phase difference&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0103">S<b>110</b>, obtaining a volume difference between the first sound wave and the second sound wave. First, the volume difference between the first sound wave <b>21</b> and the second sound wave <b>22</b> may be obtained. A value of the sensory sound source shift caused by the volume difference may be obtained based on the volume difference. For example, if the volume of the first sound wave <b>21</b> is lower than that of the second sound wave <b>22</b> by &#x3b2;, the sensory sound source perceived by the user may shift from a center position to a direction of the second speaker <b>320</b> by &#x3b4;.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0104">S<b>120</b>, adjusting a sound generation time difference between the first sound wave and the second sound wave.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0105">In some exemplary embodiments, the shift of the sensory sound source perceived by the user, which is caused by the mass difference between the first mechanical structure <b>311</b> and the second mechanical structure, may be adjusted by adjusting the sound generation time difference between the first sound wave <b>21</b> and the second sound wave <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0106">For example, the volume of the first sound wave <b>21</b> is lower than that of the second sound wave <b>22</b>. A first duration t<sub>1 </sub>is required for the sound output device <b>300</b> to convert the target sound information <b>10</b> into the first sound wave <b>21</b> and a second duration t<sub>2 </sub>is required for the sound output device <b>300</b> to convert the target sound information <b>10</b> into the second sound wave <b>22</b>; and the first duration t<sub>1 </sub>is shorter than the second duration t<sub>2</sub>. Therefore, a moment when the first speaker <b>310</b> generates a sound is earlier than a moment when the second speaker <b>320</b> generates a sound. In some exemplary embodiments, the time of sound generation by the first speaker <b>310</b> may be earlier than the time of sound generation by the second speaker <b>320</b> by one time difference. In some exemplary embodiments, the time difference is not greater than 3 ms.

Assuming that all information other than the time of sound generation is the same for the first sound wave <b>21</b> and the second sound wave <b>22</b>. When transmission media and transmission distances are the same, a moment of hearing the first sound wave <b>21</b> by the left ear of the user is earlier than a moment of hearing the second sound wave <b>22</b> by the right ear of the user. Based on the binaural effect, the brain of the user may determine that a source location of the target sound information <b>10</b> leans to one side of the first sound wave <b>21</b> whose sound is generated earlier, that is, a left side of the user. Therefore, considering a right shift of the sensory sound source because the volume of the first sound wave <b>21</b> is lower than the volume of the second sound wave <b>22</b>, finally, the source location (that is, the sensory sound source perceived by the user) of the target sound information <b>10</b> heard by the user may also be adjusted to the center position. This resolves the right shift of the sensory sound source due to the mass of the first mechanical structure <b>311</b> being greater than the mass of the second mechanical structure <b>321</b>.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0107">In some exemplary embodiments, a sensory sound source location of the earphone may be adjusted by controlling a time difference between audio signals (that is, a time difference between the audio signals on a left sound channel and a right sound channel) of the speakers on the two sides.

For example, the first sound wave output by the first speaker may be generated earlier than the second sound wave output generated by the second speaker.

The sensory sound source adjustment method S<b>100</b> in the present disclosure may include: S<b>110</b>, obtaining a volume difference between the first sound wave and the second sound wave; and S<b>120</b>, adjusting a sound generation time difference between the first sound wave and the second sound wave. The volume adjustment method S<b>200</b> in the present disclosure may include: S<b>210</b>, obtaining a volume difference between the first sound wave and the second sound wave; and S<b>220</b>, adjusting an amplitude difference between the first excitation and the second excitation.

In the volume adjustment method S<b>200</b> of the present disclosure, the volume difference between the first speaker and the second speaker, which is caused by the mass difference between the first mechanical structure and the second mechanical structure, may be corrected by setting different coil resistivities, coil winding diameters, magnetic field strengths, and/or resistances.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0115">As may be known from the foregoing description, when differences of transmission media and transmission distances are not considered, volume of a sound wave generated by a speaker is in positive correlation with an amplitude of a mechanical structure in the speaker. If the amplitude of the mechanical structure increases, volume of the sound wave also increases. The amplitude of the mechanical structure is in positive correlation with an excitation received by the mechanical structure. For a same mechanical structure, if an excitation received by the mechanical structure increases, an amplitude of the mechanical structure also increases.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0116">In some exemplary embodiments, given a same excitation, volume of the first sound wave generated by the first mechanical structure in the sound output device may be different from volume of the second sound wave generated by the second mechanical structure. For example, in the sound output device <b>300</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the additional device <b>940</b> may increase the mass of the first mechanical structure <b>311</b> such that the mass of the first mechanical structure <b>311</b> is greater than the mass of the second mechanical structure <b>321</b> (that is, M<sub>1</sub>&#x3e;M<sub>2</sub>).

Without considering differences of transmission media and transmission distances, the volume of the first sound wave perceived by the user may be lower than the volume of the second sound wave. Certainly, in some exemplary embodiments, other reasons may also cause a volume difference between sound waves output at two ends of the sound output device. For example, without a headset microphone, a mass difference between the two ends of the earphones may be caused by various reasons such as water in one end of the earphone, thereby resulting in a volume difference between sound generated at the two ends of the earphone. For ease of understanding, a bone-conduction speaker is used as a non-limiting example in the following description.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0117">In real life, to not affect user experience, sound volume heard by the two ears of the user needs to be as consistent as possible. As may be known from the foregoing description, volume of a sound wave generated by a speaker in the sound output device may be related to an excitation generated based on an electrical signal, mass M of a mechanical structure generating a vibration, damping C of a vibrating system, rigidity K, and the like.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0118">Using the bone-conduction speaker <b>100</b> as a non-limiting example, based on the formula (6), volume of a sound wave generated by the bone-conduction speaker <b>100</b> may be affected by all the following parameters: a frequency of the excitation f (its value is equal to 1/&#x3c9;), an amplitude F<sub>0 </sub>of the excitation f, the mass m<sub>1 </sub>of the housing <b>120</b>, the mass m<sub>2 </sub>of the magnetic circuit <b>130</b>, rigidity k<sub>1 </sub>and damping c<sub>1 </sub>of the vibrating piece <b>140</b>, and rigidity k<sub>2 </sub>and damping c<sub>2 </sub>of the ear mount <b>110</b>. For example, when other parameters remain unchanged, the amplitude F<sub>0 </sub>of the excitation f is proportional to the amplitude X<sub>1 </sub>of the housing <b>120</b>. When the amplitude F<sub>0 </sub>of the excitation f increases, the amplitude X<sub>1 </sub>of the housing <b>120</b> also increases. For another example, when other parameters remain unchanged, when the mass m<sub>1 </sub>of the housing <b>120</b> of the bone-conduction speaker <b>100</b> increases, the amplitude X<sub>1 </sub>of the housing <b>120</b> decreases. Therefore, when the foregoing parameters change, the amplitude X<sub>1 </sub>of the housing <b>120</b> also changes accordingly. Without considering differences of transmission media and transmission distances, the amplitude X<sub>1 </sub>of the housing <b>120</b> is proportional to volume of the sound wave generated by the vibration of the housing <b>120</b>. When the amplitude X<sub>1 </sub>increases, the volume of the sound wave also increases; or if the amplitude X<sub>1 </sub>decreases, the volume of the sound wave also decreases.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0119">Therefore, when the excitation F and the mass M of the mechanical structure are balanced properly, a desired amplitude X may be obtained.
