Specific examples of components and arrangements are described below to simplify the disclosure. These are, of course, merely examples and are not intended to be limiting. In addition, the disclosure may repeat reference numerals and/or letters in the various examples. This repetition is for the purpose of simplicity and clarity and does not in itself dictate a relationship between the various embodiments and/or configurations discussed.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> illustrate an exemplary anti-ram crash gate assembly <b>10</b> according to one or more aspects of the disclosure described with additional reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>16</b></figref>. Crash gate assembly <b>10</b> includes a barrier <b>12</b> (i.e., gate) that in the closed position extends between a buttress post assembly <b>14</b> and a latch post assembly <b>16</b>. Buttress post assembly <b>14</b> and latch post assembly <b>16</b> are positioned on opposite sides of a roadway <b>20</b>, e.g., paved or unpaved path for motor vehicles, also referred to as an entry port. Barrier <b>12</b> can be moved laterally to the right in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, for example along a track <b>18</b>, to the open position permitting passage across the roadway <b>20</b> between the buttress and latch post assemblies. Track <b>18</b>, if utilized, may extend to latch post assembly <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the closed position, crash gate assembly <b>10</b> is an anti-ram crash barrier configured to stop the penetration of a motor vehicle <b>22</b> that crashes into barrier <b>12</b>. Barrier <b>12</b> should fully stop an impacting vehicle within a desired penetration distance. United States federal agencies (e.g., the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of State (DOS)) have developed test standards using crash tests to quantify, verify, and certify barrier performance. Such test methods were initially published by the U.S. Dept. of State in 1985 as SD-STD-02.01, which was revised in 2003 as SD-STD-02.01 Revision A, and which was replaced in 2009 with ASTM F2656-07 (Standard Test Method for Vehicle Crash Testing of Perimeter Barriers). Embodiments of the disclosed crash gate assembly <b>10</b> are configured to be crash-rated by certifying agencies such as DOD, DOS, ASTM and British Standards (BSI) and/or engineered to meet certifying agency standards. Vehicle barriers are tested by crashing a motor vehicle from a perpendicular direction into the barrier. The vehicle barrier is rated based on the test vehicles weight, the speed of impact, and the penetration of the vehicle (e.g., the cargo bed) beyond the pre-impact inside edge of the barrier. For example, a &#x201c;K&#x201d; or &#x201c;M&#x201d; designates a medium duty vehicle with a gross weight of 15,000 pounds (6810 kg). The speed ratings include K4/M30 for traveling at 28.0 to 37.9 miles per hour (mph), K8/M40 traveling at 38.0 to 46.9 mph, and K12/M50 traveling at 47.0 mph and above. The penetration ratings include P1 for less than or equal to 1 meter (3.3 ft.), P2 for 1.10 to 7 m (3.31 to 23.0 ft.), P3 for 7.01 to 30 m (23.1 to 98.4 ft.), and P4 for 30 m (98 ft.) or greater. For example, an M50-P1 crash barrier is designed to stop a medium duty truck traveling 50 mph with a penetration distance of 3.3 feet or less.
