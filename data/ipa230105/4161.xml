vehicle S&#x3e;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a schematic diagram of an appearance of an agricultural vehicle S. The agricultural vehicle S is a vehicle that travels in a field where a ridge is formed, and is used for farm work (for example, an operation of seeding, spraying agrochemicals, watering, cutting and monitoring) for growing and harvesting crops in the field. The agricultural vehicle S automatically travels along the ridge. The agricultural vehicle S includes a main body <b>1</b>, an actuating mechanism <b>2</b>, wheels <b>3</b> (a wheel <b>3</b>L and a wheel <b>3</b>R), a laser irradiation device <b>4</b>, and a control device <b>5</b>. It should be noted that although two wheels <b>3</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, it is assumed that the agricultural vehicle S has four wheels <b>3</b> including front wheels and rear wheels. The number of the wheels <b>3</b> is arbitrary.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Although the shape of the main body <b>1</b> is arbitrary, the main body <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> has a symmetrical shape. The main body <b>1</b> has the actuating mechanism <b>2</b> which has a width in the left-tight direction larger than the width of the ridge and moves above the ridge. The actuating mechanism <b>2</b> is formed by a mechanical component, such as an actuator which operates to cut off crops planted in the ridge or to harvest crops.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The wheels <b>3</b> are provided to both sides of the main body <b>1</b> and move in furrows formed between ridges. The space between the wheel <b>3</b>L and the wheel <b>3</b>R may be adjustable in accordance with the width of the ridge (that is, the space between the furrows).</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The laser irradiation device <b>4</b> is a device that radiates a pulsed laser light to the front of the agricultural vehicle S in the traveling direction, and is a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) device, for example. The laser irradiation device <b>4</b> is fixed to the front face of the main body <b>1</b> and radiates laser light in a plurality of directions towards the ridge and the furrow in front of the agricultural vehicle S to detect the laser light reflected by the ridge and the furrow. The laser irradiation device <b>4</b> switches the direction in which the laser light is radiated at every predetermined period of time, for example.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The laser irradiation device <b>4</b> identifies positions where the laser light has been reflected by the ridge and the furrow, and generates point group data corresponding to the positions where the laser light has been reflected. The point group data includes information indicating the relationship between the central direction of a range in which the laser irradiation device <b>4</b> radiates the laser light and the position where the laser light has been reflected (e.g., an angle with respect to the central direction), and a distance between the laser irradiation device <b>4</b> and the position where the laser light has been reflected. An irradiation time of one pulse of the laser light may be any length, and is 1 ns, for example, although the irradiation time affects the required resolution of the position and the distance.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The control device <b>5</b> is a device that controls a traveling direction of the agricultural vehicle S, and is a computer that operates by executing a program, for example. The control device <b>5</b> analyzes the point group data acquired from the laser irradiation device <b>4</b> to identify the direction of the ridge, and controls the orientation of the wheel <b>3</b> such that the agricultural vehicle S travels in the identified direction.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Hereinafter, the configuration and operations of the control device <b>5</b> will be described in detail</p><heading id="h-0006" level="2">&#x3c;Configuration of Control Device <b>5</b>&#x3e;</heading><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a configuration of the control device <b>5</b>.

The storage <b>51</b> stores the point group data generated by the laser irradiation device <b>4</b>. In addition, the storage <b>51</b> stores a program to be executed by the control part <b>52</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The control part <b>52</b> is a Central Processing Unit (CPU), for example. The control part <b>52</b> functions as a data acquisition part <b>521</b>, a three-dimensional data generator <b>522</b>, a direction identifying data generator <b>523</b>, a direction identification part <b>524</b>, and a travel control part <b>525</b> by executing a program stored in the storage <b>51</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The data acquisition part <b>521</b> acquires the point group data generated by the laser irradiation device <b>4</b>, from the laser irradiation device <b>4</b>. The data acquisition part <b>521</b> notifies the three-dimensional data generator <b>522</b> of the acquired point group data. The data acquisition part <b>521</b> may acquire the point group data associated with time information at a predetermined interval, and may store the point group data that the data acquisition part <b>521</b> acquired (hereinafter, sometimes referred to as &#x201c;acquired point group data&#x201d;) in the storage <b>51</b> in association with the time information.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The three-dimensional data generator <b>522</b> generates three-dimensional data indicating the three-dimensional geometry of an area irradiated with the laser light by the laser irradiation device <b>4</b>, on the basis of the point group data acquired via the data acquisition part <b>521</b>. The three-dimensional data generator <b>522</b> generates three-dimensional data on the basis of the point group data acquired by the data acquisition part <b>521</b> over a predetermined period of time. The predetermined period of time is a time required for the data acquisition part <b>521</b> to acquire a sufficient amount of point group data for the direction identification part <b>524</b> to identify the direction of the ridge.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">On the basis of the relationship between the position of the laser light irradiation source and the irradiation position of the laser light in the laser irradiation device <b>4</b>, the three-dimensional data generator <b>522</b> generates three-dimensional data corresponding to a three-dimensional geometry of a region with a horizontal plane as a reference by converting the position of the acquired point group data in a three-dimensional space. Specifically, the three-dimensional data generator <b>522</b> generates three-dimensional data in which multiple coordinates of the irradiation position that are the same height in the height direction of the agricultural vehicle S are represented by the same value.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A to <b>3</b>C</figref> are schematic diagrams of the point group data.

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A to <b>3</b>C</figref>, the larger the distance from the irradiation source of the laser irradiation device <b>4</b> to the position irradiated with the laser light is, the lighter the indicated color is.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> is a schematic diagram showing a state where the three-dimensional data generated by the three-dimensional data generator <b>522</b> is recognized from the horizontal direction (e.g., the direction of the traveling surface). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> is a schematic diagram showing a state where the point group data in a height range (&#x394;h) surrounded by two one-dot chain lines in the three-dimensional data shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>313</b></figref> is recognized from above.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A to <b>4</b>C</figref> are schematic diagrams for explaining an operation in which the three-dimensional data generator <b>522</b> generates three-dimensional data. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> shows a state where a part of the point group data is recognized from above the field, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> shows a state where a part of the point group data is recognized in the horizontal direction. In the figures, broken lines indicate laser lights, and a circle indicates a piece of point data in the point group data. The sign LO in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref> indicates the position of the laser light irradiation source, and the one-dot chain line indicates a central direction C of a laser light irradiation range.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The pieces of point data a<b>1</b>, b<b>1</b>, and c<b>1</b> correspond to positions furthest from the laser irradiation device <b>4</b> in the laser light irradiation range, and the pieces of point data a<b>2</b>, b<b>2</b>, and c<b>2</b> correspond to positions closest to the laser irradiation device <b>4</b> in the laser light irradiation range. The pieces of point data a<b>1</b>, c<b>1</b>, a<b>2</b>, and c<b>2</b> correspond to positions at which the ridges are irradiated with the laser light, and the pieces of point data b<b>1</b> and b<b>2</b> correspond to positions at which the furrow is irradiated with the laser light. In the acquired point group data, a position of each piece of point data is represented on the basis of the distance from the irradiation source LO and the angle from a central irradiation direction C of the laser light, for example.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Since the laser irradiation device <b>4</b> radiates the laser light in an inclined direction, the point data a<b>1</b> is located above the central irradiation direction C, and the point data a<b>2</b> is located below the central irradiation direction C with the central irradiation direction C of the laser light as a reference, although in fact the pieces of point data a<b>1</b> and a<b>2</b> are at the same height. Similarly, although in fact the pieces of point data b<b>1</b> and b<b>2</b> are at the same height, the point data b<b>1</b> is located above the central irradiation direction C, and the point data b<b>2</b> is located below the central irradiation direction C. Accordingly, the three-dimensional data generator <b>522</b> generates three-dimensional data by converting the coordinates of these pieces of point data into coordinates in the three-dimensional space in which the traveling direction of the agricultural vehicle S is the horizontal direction.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">To generate three-dimensional data, the three-dimensional data generator <b>522</b> first extracts acquired point group data within a predetermined range in the depth direction or the width direction. Subsequently, on the basis of each position of a plurality of pieces of point data included in the acquired point group data that was extracted, the three-dimensional data generator <b>522</b> identifies a position that is the center of the plurality of pieces of point data (e.g., the central position M in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A to <b>4</b>C</figref>). The three-dimensional data generator <b>522</b> then generates three-dimensional data by rotating the coordinates of the acquired point group data, with the identified central position M as a rotation center. That is, the three-dimensional data generator <b>522</b> generates three-dimensional data by calculating coordinates of point data in the three-dimensional space in which the traveling direction of the agricultural vehicle S is the X direction, the left-right direction is the Y direction, and the height direction is the Z direction.
