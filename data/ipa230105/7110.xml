to a flexible display and an electronic device including the same.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">With the development of electronic, information, and communication technologies, various functions are being integrated into one portable communication device or electronic device. For example, a smartphone includes functions of a sound reproduction device, an imaging device, and a digital diary, in addition to a communication function, and further various functions may be implemented in the smart phone through additional installation of applications.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As the use of personal or portable communication devices, such as smallphones, has become common, users' demands for portability and ease of use are increasing. For example, a touch screen display may provide a virtual keypad that replaces a mechanical input device (e.g., a button input device) while serving as an output device that outputs a screen (e.g., visual information). Accordingly, a portable communication device or an electronic device is capable of providing the same or further improved usability (e.g., a larger screen) while being miniaturized. On the other hand, with the commercialization of flexible, for example, foldable or rollable displays, the portability and ease of use of electronic devices are expected to further improve.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The above information is presented as background information only to assist with an understanding of the disclosure. No determination has been made, and no assertion is made, as to whether any of the above might be applicable as prior art with regard to the disclosure.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In an electronic device including a flexible display expandable by sliding, structures of the electronic device may move (e.g., slide, rotate, or pivot) relative to each other. In this case, some structures (e.g., a first housing and a partial area of the flexible display) may move into or away from another structure (e.g., a second housing).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the electronic device, a structure expandable according to sliding requires a design of a driving structure that is capable of providing a strong force without increasing the thickness of the electronic device, while a flexible display is capable of executing a slide-in/out operation for user convenience.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Aspects of the disclosure are to address at least the above-mentioned problems and/or disadvantages and to provide at least the advantages described below. Accordingly, an aspect of the disclosure is to provide a driving structure including a driving motor that is capable of providing a strong thrust, while a flexible display is capable of performing a slide-in/out operation.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Additional aspects will be set forth in part in the description which follows and, in part, will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the presented embodiments.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Solution</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In accordance with an aspect of the disclosure, an electronic device is provided. The electronic device includes a first housing, a second housing in which a rack being configured to guide a sliding of the first housing is disposed, a flexible display including a first area and a second area extending from the first area and configured to be bendable or rollable, a motor disposed on the first housing and configured to be capable of sliding relative to the second housing, the motor being configured to transmit a driving force to a gear configured to rotationally move along the rack, and a first electrical component disposed in the first housing and configured to be capable of sliding together with the motor, wherein the motor is disposed so as not to overlap the second area of the flexible display.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In accordance with another aspect of the disclosure, an electronic device is provided. The electronic device includes a first housing, a second housing configured to guide a sliding movement of the first housing, a flexible display including a first area and a second area extending from the first area and configured to be bendable or rollable, and a driving structure configured to provide automatic slide-in/out of the first housing and the flexible display. The driving structure includes a rack disposed in the second housing along the sliding direction, a motor disposed in the first housing not to overlap the second area of the flexible display, a gear rotatably connected to an end of the motor and configured to move along the rack, and a connection board disposed adjacent to the motor and the rack.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Advantageous Effects</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to various embodiments, it is possible to provide an electronic device in which the relative movement of housings and the slide-in/out operation of the flexible display are stably performed.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the electronic device according to various embodiments of the disclosure, since the motor having a driving structure for slide-in and slide-out operations of the flexible display is disposed so as not to overlap the flexible display, it is possible to enlarge a motor mounting space. Accordingly, the thickness of the electronic device can be slimmed, and a motor having a torque for improved sliding of the flexible display can be mounted.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Other aspects, advantages, and salient features of the disclosure will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description, which, taken in conjunction with the annexed drawings, discloses various embodiments of the disclosure.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0008" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The above and other aspects, features, and advantages of certain embodiments of the disclosure will be more apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram of an electronic device in a network environment according to an embodiment of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is a view illustrating a state in which a second display area of a flexible display is accommodated in a second housing, according to an embodiment of the disclosure, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> is a view illustrating a state in which the second display area of the flexible display is exposed to the outside of the second housing, according to an embodiment of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is a view illustrating a state in which a second display area of a flexible display is accommodated in a second housing, according to an embodiment of the disclosure, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> is a view illustrating a state in which the second display area of the flexible display is exposed to the outside of the second housing, according to an embodiment of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref> are exploded perspective views of an electronic device according to various embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a rear view illustrating a structure in which a portion of a cover of a second housing is excluded in a state in which the electronic device is closed, according to an embodiment of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a rear view illustrating a structure in which a portion of the cover of the second housing and a portion of a display are excluded in a state in which the electronic device is closed, according to an embodiment of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along line A-A&#x2032;
