An irradiating unit that irradiates the emission light and a detecting unit that detects the reflected light are housed inside the casing. A transmission window through which the emission light and the reflected light pass is provided on a front side of the casing.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">However, if snow, rainwater, or the like becomes attached to the transmission window, measurement accuracy of the distance measurement apparatus may decrease.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Therefore, JP-A-2015-506459 describes that, to remove snow, rainwater, and the like that is attached to the transmission window, the transmission window is provided with a heater that heats the transmission.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">As the distance measurement apparatus in which the transmission window is provided with a heater, the inventors of the present disclosure examined a configuration in which a flexible substrate in which a heater wire is formed is adhered to the transmission window. As a result, following issues were found.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">An electronic component other than the heater wire may also be mounted on the flexible substrate. For example, as the electronic component, a thermistor that detects a temperature of the transmission window and is used for heating control of the transmission window may be used. In addition, for example, the electronic component may be fixed to the flexible substrate via a conductive adhesive.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">When such a flexible substrate in which the heater wire is formed is used, a temperature of the electronic component that is mounted on the flexible substrate also increases in accompaniment with the heating of the transmission window. As a result of heating control of the transmission window being repeatedly performed, thermal expansion and thermal contraction of the electronic component are repeated. Consequently, peeling may occur at a boundary between the conductive adhesive and the flexible substrate due to difficulty in keeping up with the thermal expansion and the thermal contraction of the electronic component, and electrical reliability may decrease.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">It is thus desired to provide a distance measurement apparatus in which peeling does not easily occur in an adhesive portion of an electronic component that is mounted on a flexible substrate and electrical reliability is high.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">An exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure provides a distance measurement apparatus that is configured to measure a distance to an object by irradiating emission light and detecting reflected light from the object onto which the emission light is irradiated. The distance measurement apparatus includes a transmission window, a heater wire, and a flexible substrate. The transmission window is configured such that the emission light and the reflected light pass therethrough. The heater wire is configured to heat the transmission window. The flexible substrate is provided in the transmission window. In addition, the flexible substrate includes a surface-mounted-type electronic component, a land, and a conductive adhesive. An electrode of the electronic component is electrically connected to the land. The conductive adhesive is formed on the land and adheres the electrode of the electronic component and the land. When a longitudinal direction of a surface of the electronic component that opposes the land is an A direction (corresponding to a reference direction), a length along the A direction of a contact surface between the land and the conductive adhesive is equal to or greater than twice a length along the A direction of a mounting surface of the electrode of the electronic component</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to this configuration, a distance measurement apparatus in which peeling does not easily occur in an adhesive portion of an electronic component that is mounted on a flexible substrate and electrical reliability is high is provided.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">An exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure will hereinafter be described with reference to the drawings.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">1.
