It has been shown in a Gallup poll survey that 95% of the adult population had experienced insomnia (Rosekind, M., <i>J. Clin. Psychiatry, </i>1992, 53:4-6). The current literature maintains consistently that approximately one third of all people have sleep problems in any given year.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Sleep disorders can have serious consequences by themselves and can lead to numerous other medical problems. As a result, numerous remedies and methods have been created to deal with sleep disorders. See Treisman et al., &#x201c;Insomnia,&#x201d; Johns Hopkins POC-IT Center, 2010 pp. 1-3. Some examples of sleep medications include over-the-counter medicines such as TYLENOL PM&#x2122;, compositions containing melatonin, herbal remedies, as well as pharmaceuticals such as zolpidem, quetiapine, and many others. While some of these sleep medications may be effective, tolerance generally develops for most medications requiring increasingly higher dosages. Other sleep medications either do not work well, have serious side effects, or both. For example, some medications do not continue to work over extended periods and the patient wakes up during the night.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">There is a significant need for a sleep composition and method that is safe and effective. There is also a need for asleep composition that is effective over an extended period, and does not have significant side effects. The compositions and methods disclosed herein address these and other needs.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Compositions that provide a modified release profile of active agents are disclosed herein. Active agent is used interchangeably with the terms &#x201c;ingredient,&#x201d; &#x201c;active ingredient,&#x201d; &#x201c;compound,&#x201d; &#x201c;active compound&#x201d; or &#x201c;substance.&#x201d; The active agents can include one or more sleep promoting active agents, one or more sleep quality active agents, and/or one or more sleep recovery active agents, and optionally one or more next day active agent. For example, in some aspects, the compositions can comprise one or more sleep promoting active agents, one or more sleep quality active agents, one or more sleep recovery active agents, and optionally one or more next day active agent. In some aspects, the compositions can comprise one or more sleep promoting active agents, one or more sleep quality active agents, and optionally one or more next day active agents. In some aspects, the compositions can comprise one or more sleep promoting active agents, optionally one or more sleep recovery active agents, and one or more next day active agents. In some aspects, the composition can comprise one or more sleep quality active agents, one or more sleep recovery active agents, and optionally one or more next day active agents. In some aspects, the composition can comprise one or more sleep quality active agents and one or more next day active agents. In some aspects, the composition can comprise one or more sleep recovery active agents and one or more next day active agents.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">When administered, the disclosed compositions can provide an immediate burst release or immediate sustained release of the sleep promoting active agent, a delayed burst release or delayed sustained release of the sleep quality active agent, a delayed burst release or delayed sustained release of the sleep recovery active agent, and/or delayed burst release or delayed sustained release the next day active agent. In some aspects, the composition can provide an immediate burst release of the sleep promoting active agent within about 30 minutes, preferably within about 15 minutes of administration. The composition can also provide delayed sustained and/or delayed burst release of the sleep quality active agent within about 6 hours, such as within about 4.5 hours, from about 1 to about 6 hours, preferably from about 2 to about 5 hours, more preferably from about 2.5 to about 4.5 hours of administration. The composition can further provide delayed burst and/or delayed sustained release of the sleep recovery active agent and/or the next day active agent after about 3 hours, such as after about 4, after about 5, or after about 6 hours, preferably after about 6 to about 8.5 hours, more preferably after about 6.5 to about 8.5 hours of administration. Methods of making and using the compositions are also provided herein.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The active agents of the disclosed compositions can include a phytochemical, an herbal extract, a vitamin, a hormone, an amino acid, or mineral. For example, the sleep promoting active agent and/or the sleep quality active agent can be independently selected from the group consisting of &#x3b3;-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, hydroxytryptophan, riboflavin, melatonin, nicotinamide, picamilon, L-taurine, L-theanine, 4-amino-3-phenylbutyric acid, L-tryptophan, calcium, calcium D-glucarate, calcium gluconate, calcium lactate, zinc, iron, magnesium, magnesium glycinate, magnesium taurate, magnesium chloride, magnesium citrate, magnesium oxide, magnesium amino acid chelate, isoflavone, astaxanthin, phosphatidilserine, glutamine, phenibut 4-amino-3-phenylbutyric acid o, a milk peptide, a milk protein hydrolysate, lactium, plant extracts, blends thereof, and combinations thereof. In specific examples, the composition can include at least two sleep promoting active agents selected from the group consisting of melatonin, lactium, L-tryptophan, &#x3b3;-aminobutyric acid, and magnesium. In other specific examples, the composition can include at least two sleep quality active agents selected from the group consisting of an extract from <i>Valeriana officinalis </i>(root), an extract from <i>Melissa officinalis</i>, an extract from <i>Phellodendron amurense</i>, and an extract from <i>Humulus lupus. </i></p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The sleep recovery active agent and/or the next day active agent can be independently selected from L-theanine, L-taurine, &#x3b3;-aminobutyric acid, glycine, folic acid. (6S)-5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid or a salt thereof, inositol, riboflavin 5&#x2032;-phosphate or a salt thereof, vitamin A, vitamin B12, methylcobalamin. cyanocobalamin, vitamin B3, vitamin B5, vitamin B6, pyridoxal 5&#x2032;-phosphate, pyridoxine, vitamin B9, vitamin C, vitamin D3, a xanthine, carnosin, alpha-glycerylphosphoryl choline, lecithin, cytidine diphosphate choline, phosphatidylserine. ATP, ribose, magnesium, coenzyme Q10, plant extracts, or combinations thereof. In specific examples, the composition can include at least two sleep recovery active agents selected from the group consisting of an extract from cocao, L-theanine, vitamin B5, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and folic acid, preferably at least one of vitamin B5, vitamin B6, or vitamin B12 and at least one of an extract from cocao, L-theanine, or folic acid.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The disclosed compositions can be prepared as, for example, a single bead (such as single-layered or multilayered particles) comprising the active agents. For example, the composition can be a multilayered particle comprising any two or more of the sleep promoting active agents, the sleep quality active agents, the sleep recovery active agent, and/of the next day active agent. Each layer of the multilayered particle optionally includes a binder as described herein. In other examples, the composition can be a single-layered particle comprising the sleep promoting active agent and an optional binder. The optional binder can include a taste masking agent. In further examples, the composition can be a single-layered particle comprising the sleep quality active agent and a polymeric binder. In still further examples, the composition can be a single-layered particle comprising the sleep recovery active agent and a polymeric binder.

Additional coating layers, a thicker coating layer, and/or a crosslinked coating layer on the bead can result in a delayed and/or slower release of the active agent.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The disclosed compositions can be prepared as a combination of separate beads and/or powders. In some examples, the sleep quality active agent can be prepared as a single bead comprising one or more sleep quality active agents encapsulated by a polymeric binder. In some examples, the sleep recovery active agent and/or the next day active agent can be prepared as a single bead comprising one or more sleep recovery active agents and/or the next day active agent encapsulated by a polymeric binder. In some examples, the sleep promoting active agent can be coated onto the surface of one or more of the beads. Alternatively, the sleep promoting active agents can be a free powder used in combination with the bead comprising the sleep quality active agent and the bead comprising the sleep recovery active agent, and the next day active agent.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The sleep quality active agent can be in an amount of from about 0.5 wt % to about 55 wt %, based on the combined weight of the sleep quality active agent and the polymeric binder. The sleep recovery active agent can be in an amount of from about 0.5 wt % to about 55 wt %, based on the combined weight of the sleep recovery active agent and the polymeric binder. The next day active agent can be in an amount of from about 0.5 wt % to about 55 wt %, based on the combined weight of the next day active agent and the polymeric binder.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The composition can be dispersed in a comestible matrix as a daily oral dosage form.

The sleep promoting active agent can then be administered as a separate composition along with the single unit composition containing the sleep quality active agent, the sleep recovery active agent, and the optional next day active agent. In some examples, the sleep promoting active agent along with the single unit composition can be dispersed in the comestible matrix and can be released by ingestion such as by chewing and/or swallowing or dissolution of the comestible matrix.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0054">In some examples, the sleep promoting active agent, the sleep quality active agent, and optionally the next day active agent can be formulated as a single unit composition.

When the bead is ingested and digested, the timing of the release of the various active agents is in accordance with the timing of the bead's degradation in the gut or lower intestines. Again, the active agent can be present in each layer for example, as a nanoparticle, a microparticle or a granule (including the active agent and a binder) or in its native form (that is, the active agent alone, not mixed with a binder).
