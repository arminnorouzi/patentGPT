In particular, the present invention relates to the direct reduction of metal ore under a controlled hydrogen atmosphere to produce such direct reduced metal, and to the provision of a carbon-containing gas as a part of the same process for carburizing the reduced metal material.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The production of direct reduced metal using hydrogen as a reducing agent is well-known as such. For instance, in SE7406174-8 and SE7406175-5 methods are described in which a charge of metal ore is subjected to a hydrogen atmosphere flowing past the charge, which as a result is reduced to form direct reduced metal.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Furthermore, in Swedish application SE 1950403-4, which has not been published at the priority date of the present application, a process for direct reducing metal material under a closed hydrogen atmosphere is disclosed.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention is particularly applicable in the case of batchwise charging and treatment of the material to be reduced and carburized.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">There are several problems with the prior art, including efficiency regarding thermal losses as well as hydrogen gas usage. There is also a control problem, since it is necessary to measure when the reduction process has been finalized.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Furthermore, known methods for carburizing metal material include the use of carbon monoxide as a source of carburizing carbon. This leads to the production and release of carbon dioxide, and typically also to the production of carbon monoxide.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It would hence be desirable to achieve a thermally and energy efficient method for direct reducing and carburizing of metal material that does not lead to the release into the atmosphere of carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention solves the above described problems.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Hence, the invention relates to a method for producing direct reduced metal material, comprising the steps: a) charging metal material to be reduced into a furnace space; b) evacuating an existing atmosphere from the furnace space so as to achieve a gas pressure of less than 1 bar inside the furnace space; c) providing heat and hydrogen gas into the furnace space, so that heated hydrogen gas heats the charged metal material to a temperature high enough so that metal oxides present in the metal material are reduced, in turn causing water vapour to be formed, which provision of hydrogen gas is performed so that a pressure of more than 1 bar builds up inside the furnace space; and d) before an evacuation of gases from the furnace space back to atmospheric pressure, condensing and collecting the water vapour formed in step c in a condenser below the charged metal material; which method is characterised in that the method further comprises the step e) before an evacuation of gases from the furnace space back to atmospheric pressure, providing a carbon-containing gas to the furnace space, so that the heated and reduced metal material is carburized by said carbon-containing gas.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The invention also relates to a system for producing direct reduced metal material, comprising a closed furnace space arranged to receive charged metal material to be reduced; an atmosphere evacuation means arranged to evacuate an existing atmosphere from the furnace space so as to achieve a gas pressure of less than 1 bar inside the furnace space; a heat and hydrogen provision means arranged to provide heat and hydrogen gas to the furnace space; a control device arranged to control the heat and hydrogen provision means so that heated hydrogen gas heats the charged metal material to a temperature high enough so that metal oxides present in the metal material are reduced, in turn causing water vapour to be formed, which provision of hydrogen gas is performed so that a pressure of more than 1 bar builds up inside the furnace space; and a cooling and collecting means arranged below the charged metal material, arranged to condense and collect the water vapour before an evacuation of gases from the furnace space back to atmospheric pressure, which system is characterised in that the system further comprises a carbon-containing gas provision means arranged to provide a carbon-containing gas to the furnace space, and in that the control device is arranged to control the carbon-containing gas provision means to provide carbon-containing gas before an evacuation of gases from the furnace space back to atmospheric pressure, so that the heated and reduced metal material is carburized by said carbon-containing gas.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the following, the invention will be described in detail, with reference to exemplifying embodiments of the invention and to the enclosed drawings, wherein:</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a </i></figref>is a cross-section of a simplified furnace for use in a system according to the present invention, during a first operation state;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>b </i></figref>is a cross-section of the simplified furnace of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref><i>a, </i>during a second operation state;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic overview of a system according to the present invention;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a flowchart of a method according to the present invention;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>a </i></figref>is a schematic chart showing a possible relation between H<sub>2 </sub>partial pressure, carburizing gas partial pressure and temperature in a heated furnace space according to a first embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>b </i></figref>is a schematic chart showing a possible relation between H<sub>2 </sub>partial pressure, carburizing gas partial pressure and temperature in a heated furnace space according to a second embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>c </i></figref>is a schematic chart showing a possible relation between H<sub>2 </sub>partial pressure, carburizing gas partial pressure and temperature in a heated furnace space according to a third embodiment of the present invention;

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, two such furnaces <b>210</b>, <b>220</b> are illustrated. The furnaces <b>210</b>, <b>220</b> may be identical to furnace <b>100</b>, or differ in details. However, it is understood that everything which is said herein regarding the furnace <b>100</b> is equally applicable to furnaces <b>210</b> and/or <b>220</b>, and vice versa.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Furthermore, it is understood that everything which is said herein regarding the present method is equally applicable to the present system <b>200</b> and/or furnace <b>100</b>; <b>210</b>, <b>220</b>, and vice versa.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The furnace <b>100</b> as such has many similarities with the furnaces described in SE7406174-8 and SE7406175-5, and reference is made to these documents regarding possible design details. However, an important difference between these furnaces and the present furnace <b>100</b> is that the present furnace <b>100</b> is not arranged to be operated in a way where hydrogen gas is recirculated through the furnace <b>100</b> and back to a collecting container arranged outside of the furnace <b>100</b>, and in particular not in a way where hydrogen gas is recirculated out from the furnace <b>100</b> (or heated furnace space <b>120</b>) and then back into the furnace <b>100</b> (or heated furnace space <b>120</b>) during one and the same batch processing of charged material to be reduced.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Instead, and as will be apparent from the below description, the furnace <b>100</b> is arranged for batch-wise reducing and carburizing operation of one charge of material at a time, and to operate during such an individual batch processing as a closed system, in the sense that hydrogen gas is supplied to the furnace <b>100</b> but not removed therefrom during the batchwise reducing and carburizing process; and that carbon-containing gas is supplied to the furnace <b>100</b> but not removed therefrom during the batchwise reducing and carburizing process.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">This means that the amount of hydrogen gas present inside the furnace <b>100</b> always increases during the reduction process. After reduction has been completed, the hydrogen gas is of course evacuated from within the furnace <b>100</b>, but there is no recirculation of hydrogen gas during the reduction step. In some embodiments, as will become clear in the following, the corresponding is true also for the carbon-containing gas.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Hence, the furnace <b>100</b> is part of a closed system comprising a heated furnace space <b>120</b> which is arranged to be pressurized, such as to a pressure of more than 1 bar, such as to a pressure of at least 1.5 bar, or at least 2 bar, or at least 3 bar, or at least 4 bar, or at least 5 bar, or even at least 6 bar. At any rate, the furnace space <b>120</b> is built to withstand the operating pressures described herein. An upper part <b>110</b> of the furnace <b>100</b> has a bell-shape. It can be opened for charging of material to be processed, and can be closed in a gas-tight manner using fastening means <b>111</b>. The furnace space <b>120</b> is encapsulated with refractory material, such as brick material <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">If nothing else is said, the term &#x201c;pressure&#x201d; herein refers to a total gas pressure, in particular inside the furnace space <b>120</b>, in contrast to a &#x201c;partial pressure&#x201d; referring to the partial gas pressure of a particular gas.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Furthermore, since atmospheric pressure is about 1 bar, the expression &#x201c;pressure of more than 1 bar&#x201d; and &#x201c;pressure above atmospheric pressure&#x201d; is intended to have the same meaning. Correspondingly, the expression &#x201c;pressure of less than 1 bar&#x201d; and &#x201c;pressure below atmospheric pressure&#x201d; is intended to have the same meaning.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The furnace space <b>120</b> is arranged to be heated using one or several heating elements <b>121</b>. Preferably, the heating elements <b>121</b> are electric heating elements. However, radiator combustion tubes or similar fuel-heated elements can be used as well. The heating elements <b>121</b> do not, however, produce any combustion gases that interact directly chemically with the furnace space <b>120</b>, which must be kept chemically controlled for the present purposes. It is preferred that the only gaseous matter provided into the furnace space during the below-described main heating process is hydrogen gas and any carbon-containing gas used as a carbon source for carburizing the metal material.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The heating elements <b>121</b> may preferably be made of a heat-resistant metal material, such as a molybdenum alloy.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Additional heating elements may also be arranged in the heated furnace space <b>120</b>. For instance, heating elements similar to elements <b>121</b> may be provided at the side walls of the furnace space <b>120</b>, such as at a height corresponding to the charged material or at least to the container <b>140</b>. Such heating elements may aid heating not only the gas, but also the charged material via heat radiation.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The furnace <b>100</b> also comprises a lower part <b>150</b>, forming a sealed container together with the upper part <b>110</b> when the furnace is closed using fastening means <b>111</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">A container <b>140</b> for material to be processed (reduced and carburized) is present in the lower part <b>150</b> of the furnace <b>100</b>. The container <b>140</b> may be supported on a refractory floor of the furnace space <b>120</b> in a way allowing gas to pass beneath the container <b>140</b>, such as along open or closed channels <b>172</b> formed in said floor, said channels <b>172</b> passing from an inlet <b>171</b> for hydrogen gas and carbon-containing gas, such as from a central part of the furnace space <b>120</b> at said furnace floor, radially outward to a radial periphery of the furnace space <b>120</b> and thereafter upwards to an upper part of the furnace space <b>120</b>. See flow arrows indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a </i></figref>for these flows during the below-described initial step and main reduction and carburization step.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The container <b>140</b> is preferably of an open constitution, meaning that gas can pass freely through at least a bottom/floor of the container <b>140</b>. This may be accomplished, for instance, by forming holes through the bottom of the container <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The material to be processed comprises a metal oxide, preferably an iron oxide such as Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>and/or Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. The material may be granular, such as in the form of pellets or balls. One suitable material to be charged for batch reduction is rolled iron ore balls, that have been rolled in water to a ball diameter of about 1-1.5 cm. If such iron ore additionally contains oxides that evaporate at temperatures below the final temperature of the charged material in the present method, such oxides may be condensed in the condenser <b>160</b> and easily collected in powder form. Such oxides may comprise metal oxides such as Zn and Pb oxides.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Advantageously, the furnace space <b>120</b> is not charged with very large amounts of material to be reduced. Each furnace <b>100</b> is preferably charged with at the most 50 tonnes, such as at the most 25 tonnes, such as between 5 and 10 tonnes, in each batch. This charge may be held in one single container <b>150</b> inside the furnace space <b>120</b>. Depending on throughput requirements, several furnaces <b>100</b> may be used in parallel, and the residual heat from a batch in one furnace <b>220</b> can then be used to preheat another furnace <b>210</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and below).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">This provides a system <b>200</b> which is suitable for installation and use directly at the mining site, requiring no expensive transport of the ore before reduction. Instead, direct reduced and carburized metal material can be produced on-site, packaged under a protecting atmosphere and transported to a different site for further processing.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Hence, in the case of water-rolled iron ore balls, it is foreseen that the furnace <b>100</b> may be installed in connection to the iron ore ball production system, so that charging of the metal material into the furnace <b>100</b> in the container <b>140</b> can take place in a fully automated manner, where containers <b>140</b> are automatically circulated from the iron ore ball production system to the system <b>100</b> and back, being filled with iron ore balls to be reduced and carburized; inserted into the furnace space <b>120</b>; subjected to the reducing and carburizing hydrogen/heat/carbon-containing gas processing described herein; removed from the furnace space <b>120</b> and emptied; taken back to the iron ore ball production system; refilled; and so forth. More containers <b>140</b> may be used than furnaces <b>100</b>, so that in each batch switch a reduced and carburized charge in a particular container is immediately replaced in the furnace <b>100</b> with a different container carrying material not yet reduced and carburized. Such a larger system, such as at a mining site, may be implemented to be completely automated, and also to be very flexible in terms of throughput, using several smaller furnaces <b>100</b> rather than one very large furnace.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Below the container <b>140</b>, the furnace <b>100</b> comprises a gas-gas type heat exchanger <b>160</b>, which may advantageously be a tube heat exchanger such as is known per se. The heat exchanger <b>160</b> is preferably a counter-flow type heat exchanger. To the heat exchanger <b>160</b>, below the heat exchanger <b>160</b>, is connected a closed trough <b>161</b> for collecting and accommodating condensed water from the heat exchanger <b>160</b>. The trough <b>161</b> is also constructed to withstand the operating pressures of the furnace space <b>120</b> in a gas-tight manner.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The heat exchanger <b>160</b> is connected to the furnace space <b>120</b>, preferably so that cool/cooled gases arriving to the furnace space <b>120</b> pass the heat exchanger <b>160</b> along externally/peripherally provided heat exchanger tubes and further through said channels <b>172</b> up to the heating element <b>121</b>. Then, heated gases passing out from the furnace space <b>120</b>, after passing and heating the charged material (see below), pass the heat exchanger <b>160</b> through internally/centrally provided heat exchanger tubes, thereby heating said cool/cooled gases.

The hydrogen gas may be supplied from the containers <b>280</b> and/or <b>290</b>. Since the furnace <b>100</b> is closed, as mentioned above, substantially none of the provided hydrogen gas will escape during the process. In other words, the hydrogen gas losses (apart from hydrogen consumed in the reduction reaction) will be very low or even non-existent. Instead, only the hydrogen consumed chemically in the reduction reaction during the reduction process will be used.

In other words, the heat may advantageously be provided directly to the hydrogen gas and/or directly to the carbon-containing gas, whichever is concurrently provided (in said initial or late steps) to the furnace space <b>120</b>.

In other examples, the heat may be provided to the provided hydrogen/carbon-containing gas as a location externally to the furnace space <b>120</b>, before the thus heated hydrogen/carbon-containing gas is allowed to enter the furnace space <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">During the rest of the said initial heating step, valves <b>5</b> and <b>7</b>-<b>19</b> are closed, while valves <b>1</b>-<b>4</b> and <b>6</b> are controlled by the control device, together with the compressor <b>270</b>, to achieve a controlled provision of reused and/or fresh hydrogen gas as described in the following.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Hence, during this initial heating step, the control device <b>201</b> is arranged to control the heat and hydrogen provision means <b>121</b>, <b>280</b>, <b>290</b> to provide heat and hydrogen gas to the furnace space <b>120</b> in a way so that heated hydrogen gas heats the charged metal material to a temperature above the boiling temperature of water contained in the metal material. As a result, said contained water evaporates.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Throughout the initial heating step and the main reduction and carburizing step (see below), hydrogen gas is supplied slowly under the control of the control device <b>201</b>. As a result, there will be a continuously present, relatively slow but steady, flow of hydrogen gas, vertically downwards, through the charged material. In general, the control device is arranged to continuously add hydrogen gas so as to maintain a desired increasing (such as monotonically increasing) hydrogen partial pressure curve (and also a total pressure curve) inside the furnace space <b>120</b>, and in particular to counteract the decreased pressure at the lower parts of the furnace space <b>120</b> (and in the lower parts of the heat exchanger <b>160</b>) resulting from the constant condensation of water vapour in the heat exchanger <b>160</b> (see below). The total energy consumption depends on the efficiency of the heat exchanger <b>160</b>, and in particular its ability to transfer thermal energy to the incoming hydrogen gas from both the hot gas flowing through the heat exchanger <b>160</b> and the condensation heat of the condensing water vapour. In the exemplifying case of Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, the theoretical energy needed to heat the oxide, thermally compensate for the endothermic reaction and reduce the oxide is about 250 kWh per 1000 kg of Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. For Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, the corresponding number is about 260 kWh per 1000 kg of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">An important aspect of the present invention is that there is no recirculation of hydrogen gas during the reduction process. This has been discussed on a general level above, but in the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a </i></figref>this means that the hydrogen gas is supplied, such as via compressor <b>270</b>, through entry conduit <b>171</b> into the top part of the furnace space <b>121</b>, where it is heated by the heating element <b>121</b> and then slowly passes downwards, past the metal material to be reduced in the container <b>140</b>, further down through the heat exchanger <b>130</b> and into the trough <b>161</b>. However, there are no available exit holes from the furnace space <b>120</b>, and in particular not from the trough <b>161</b>. The conduit <b>173</b> is closed, for instance by the valves V<b>10</b>, V<b>12</b>, V<b>13</b>, V<b>14</b> being closed. Hence, the supplied hydrogen gas will be partly consumed in the reduction process, and partly result in an increased gas pressure in the furnace space <b>120</b>. This process then goes on until a full or desired reduction has occurred of the metal material, as will be detailed below.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Hence, the heated hydrogen gas present in the furnace space <b>120</b> above the charged material in the container <b>140</b> will, via the slow supply of hydrogen gas forming a slowly moving downwards gas stream, be brought down to the charged material. There, it will form a gas mixture with water vapour from the charged material and any hitherto added carbon-containing gas (see below).</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The resulting hot gas mixture will form a gas stream down into and through the heat exchanger <b>160</b>. In the heat exchanger <b>160</b>, there will then be a heat exchange of heat from the hot gas arriving from the furnace space <b>120</b> to the cold newly provided hydrogen/carbon-containing gas arriving from conduit <b>171</b>, whereby the latter will be preheated by the former. In other words, hydrogen gas to be provided in the initial step, and also hydrogen and/or carbon-containing gas provided in the main reduction and carburization step (and/or the carbon-provision step, see below), is preheated in the heat exchanger <b>160</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Due to the cooling of the hot gas flow, water vapour contained in the cooled gas will condense. This condensation results in liquid water, which is collected in the trough <b>161</b>, but also results in condensation heat. It is preferred that the heat exchanger <b>160</b> is further arranged to transfer such condensation thermal energy from the condensed water to the cold hydrogen/carbon-containing gas to be provided into the furnace space <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The condensation of the contained water vapour will also decrease the pressure of the hot gas flowing downwards from the furnace space <b>120</b>, providing space for more hot gas to pass downwards through the heat exchanger <b>160</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Due to the slow supply of additional heated hydrogen gas, and to the relatively high thermal conductivity of hydrogen gas, the charged material will relatively quickly, such as within 10 minutes or less, reach the boiling point of liquid water contained in the charged material, which should by then be slightly above 100&#xb0; C. As a result, this contained liquid water will evaporate, forming water vapour mixing with the hot hydrogen gas.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The condensation of the water vapour in the heat exchanger <b>160</b> will decrease the partial gas pressure for the water vapour at the lower end of the structure, making the water vapour generated in the charged material on average flow downwards. Adding to this effect, water vapour also a substantially lower density than the hydrogen gas with which it mixes.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">This way, the water contents of the charged material in the container <b>140</b> will gradually evaporate, flow downwards through the heat exchanger <b>160</b>, cool down and condense therein and to up in liquid state in the trough <b>161</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">It is preferred that the cold hydrogen gas supplied to the heat exchanger <b>160</b>, and also any carbon-containing gas supplied, is room tempered or has a temperature which is slightly less than room temperature.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">It is realized that this initial heating step, in which the charged material is hence dried from any contained liquid water, is a preferred step in the present method. In particular, this makes it easy to produce and provide the charged material as a granular material, such as in the form of rolled balls of material, without having to introduce an expensive and complicating drying step prior to charging of the material into the furnace space <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">However, it is realized that it would be possible to charge already dry or dried material into the furnace space <b>120</b>. In this case, the initial heating step as described herein would not be performed, but the method would skip immediately to the main reduction and carburization step (below).</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Moreover, some mechanisms of this initial heating step have been described above with reference both to added hydrogen gas and carbon-containing gas. These mechanisms are also present in the subsequent main reduction and carburization step (see below). However, in the initial heating step it is preferred that no carbon-containing gas is added. In particular, it is preferred that the only added gas during the initial heating step is hydrogen gas.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In one embodiment of the present invention, the provision of hydrogen gas to the furnace space <b>120</b> during said initial heating step is controlled to be so slow so that a pressure equilibrium is substantially maintained throughout the performance of the initial heating step, preferably so that a substantially equal pressure prevails throughout the furnace space <b>120</b> and the not liquid-filled parts of the trough <b>161</b> at all times. In particular, the supply of hydrogen gas may be controlled so that the said equilibrium gas pressure does not increase, or only increases insignificantly, during the initial heating step. In this case, the hydrogen gas supply is then controlled to increase the furnace space <b>120</b> pressure over time only after all or substantially all liquid water has evaporated from the charged material in the container <b>140</b>. The point in time when this has occurred may, for instance, be determined as a change upwards in slope of a temperature-to-time curve as measured by temperature sensor <b>123</b> and/or <b>124</b>, where the change of slope marks a point at which substantially all liquid water has evaporated but the reduction has not yet started. Alternatively, hydrogen gas supply may be controlled so as to increase the pressure once a measured temperature in the furnace space <b>120</b>, as measured by temperature sensor <b>123</b> and/or <b>124</b>, has exceeded a predetermined limit, which limit may be between 100&#xb0; C. and 150&#xb0; C., such as between 120&#xb0; C. and 130&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In a subsequent main reduction and carburization step, heat and hydrogen gas is further provided to the furnace space <b>120</b>, in a manner corresponding to the supply during the initial heating step described above, so that heated hydrogen gas heats the charged metal material to a temperature high enough in order for metal oxides present in the metal material to be reduced, in turn causing water vapour to be formed.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">During this main reduction and carburization step, additional hydrogen gas is hence supplied and heated, under a gradual pressure increase inside the furnace space <b>120</b>, so that the charged metal material in turn is heated up to a temperature at which a reduction chemical reaction is initiated and maintained.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b><i>a </i></figref>and <b>1</b><i>b, </i>the topmost charged material will hence be heated first.

This formed water vapour is continuously condensed and collected in a condenser arranged below the charged metal material. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref><i>a, </i>the condenser is in the form of the heat exchanger <b>160</b>.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0084">According to the invention, the main reduction and carburization step, including said condensing, is performed so that a pressure of more than 1 bar is built up in the furnace space <b>120</b> in relation to atmospheric pressure.

It is noted that such a pressure of more than 1 bar is a pressure which is higher than atmospheric pressure.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0085">Further according to the invention, the method further comprises a carbon-provision step, namely a step in which a carbon-containing gas is provided to the furnace space <b>120</b>, so that the metal material that has been heated by said supplied heat and reduced by reaction with said hydrogen gas is carburized by said carbon-containing gas. This provision of carbon-containing gas is performed as a part of said main reduction and carburizing step, and is performed before an evacuation of gases from the furnace space <b>120</b> back to atmospheric pressure in the furnace space <b>120</b>. Such evacuation may be performed as a step of the present method, as will be explained below, performed for instance as a part of a material cooling substep.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0086">The carbon-containing gas may be any carbon-containing gas which can chemically react with the reduced metal material so as to carburize the latter. Examples of suitable carbon-containing gases comprise various gaseous (at the temperatures and pressures prevailing in the furnace space <b>120</b> during the performance of the present method) hydrocarbons, such as methane, ethane, propane, propene and similar. Preferably, the carbon-containing gas does not contain more than trace amounts of carbon monoxide, since this will efficiently prevent both carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide from forming residual products after the finalization of the present carburization process. In particular, it is preferred that no carbon monoxide is supplied to the furnace space <b>120</b> in said carbon-provision step.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0087">As will be described and exemplified below, the carbon-provision step may be performed at least partly at the same time as the provision of hydrogen gas and heat described above.
