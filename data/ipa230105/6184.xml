These system and methods may involve the deposition of solid particles, without the need for any liquids or solvents. In some cases, the roll-to-roll systems and methods include aerosol deposition techniques, which are described in more detail further below. It has been discovered and appreciated within the context of this disclosure that aerosol deposition may be used in a roll-to-roll process. In some embodiments, the roll-to-roll processes described herein involve the use of multiple spray nozzles that scan across a substrate. In some cases, two or more spray nozzles may move or oscillate about a fixed point in order to aerosol deposit particles onto the substrate. Advantageously, the thickness of a deposited layer can be controlled, for example, via the particle feed rate and/or by the speed of the substrate, without adjacent nozzles significantly affected the deposition of particles by other nozzles within the set of nozzles.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">One challenge of such systems and methods is turbulence created by adjacent spray nozzles. However, it has been recognized and appreciated by this disclosure that, in some embodiments, staggered nozzles (e.g., connected to similar or identical feed systems) may be used to avoid turbulence issues. In some instances, the systems and methods disclosed herein may be a part of manufacturing process with multiple stations and/or multiple sets of nozzles may also be employed, and specific regions of the substrate may or may not be coated as desired by the user by controlling the arrangement and operation of the nozzles and/or the position of the substrate. The disclosed systems and methods may be used for the fabrication of battery or electrochemical cell components, such as aerosol-deposited cathodes, anodes, protective layers, electrolytes (e.g., solid electrolytes), and/or separators. However, it will be understood that this disclosure is not limited to only battery or electrochemical cell components but may be used in the fabrication of other articles or devices. Accordingly, while various embodiments may be described in the context of electrochemical cells, other applications are also described elsewhere herein, and those skilled in the art will be capable of recognizing other applications in view of the present disclosure.As mentioned above, two or more nozzles (e.g., three or more nozzles, four or more nozzles, five or more nozzles) may be used to deposit particles (e.g., solid particles, a plurality of particles). For various embodiments, multiple nozzles may be included within a set of nozzles, and each nozzle within the set may deposit a layer or portions of a layer onto a substrate (e.g., a flexible substrate). In some such embodiments, each layer may be a component of battery or electrochemical cell; however, in other such embodiments, more than one layer can make up a single battery or electrochemical cell component.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">By way of illustration, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> schematically depicts a roll-to-roll system for depositing one or more pluralities of particles as layers on a substrate (e.g., layers each comprising one or more pluralities of particles). The system includes a set of nozzles, including a first nozzle <b>110</b>, a second nozzle <b>120</b>, and a third nozzle <b>130</b>, each with a first nozzle tip <b>112</b>, a second nozzle tip <b>122</b>, and a third nozzle tip <b>132</b>, respectively. The system also includes a substrate <b>140</b> that may be positioned on a surface <b>145</b> of a roll-to-roll system <b>150</b>. The roll-to-roll system <b>150</b> is adapted and arranged to feed the substrate <b>140</b> through the system as the set of nozzles (i.e., each nozzle within the set) deposits a layer (e.g., a layer comprising at least one plurality of particles), or portions thereof, on at least a portion of the substrate <b>140</b>. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, a first plurality of particles <b>114</b> is deposited onto the substrate <b>140</b>, forming a first layer <b>116</b>A on the substrate <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some embodiments, the set of nozzles is configured to reduce or minimize turbulence generated by adjacent nozzles within the set as each nozzle deposits the particles. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> each nozzle is staggered in at least one direction relative to an adjacent nozzle. That is, first nozzle tip <b>112</b>, second nozzle tip <b>122</b>, and third tip <b>132</b> form a line along x-axis <b>135</b> (which may be aligned or parallel with the surface of the substrate <b>140</b>) but are staggered along z-axis <b>138</b> such that the three nozzle tips are not all in line in the z-direction. In such a configuration, turbulence generated by, for example, the nozzle <b>130</b> is reduced or minimized relative to nozzle <b>120</b> (and/or nozzle <b>110</b>) so that any turbulence generated by third nozzle <b>130</b> has little to no impact on deposition by either second nozzle <b>120</b> (and/or first nozzle <b>110</b>).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some embodiments, the substrate can be moved or translated from a first position to a second position in order to deposit another plurality of particles and/or another layer. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the substrate <b>140</b> has been translated such that the first layer <b>116</b>A moves from underneath first nozzle <b>110</b> to underneath the second nozzle <b>120</b>. Here, the second nozzle <b>120</b> may deposit a second plurality of particles <b>124</b> to form a second layer <b>126</b> onto the first layer <b>116</b>A without impacted the formation of a first layer <b>116</b>B formed by the first nozzle <b>110</b> adjacent to the second nozzle <b>120</b>. And while not shown in the figure, this process may continue with a third nozzle (e.g., third nozzle <b>13</b>), a fourth nozzle, and/or a fifth nozzle, and so forth, each of which may deposit one or more pluralities of particles onto the previously formed layers.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">While the arrangement of nozzles shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> may reduce or minimize turbulence generated by each nozzle within the set, it will be understood that other turbulence-reducing configurations are possible. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> shows another configuration for a set of nozzles. In the figure, the first nozzle <b>110</b>, second nozzle <b>120</b>, and third nozzle <b>130</b>, are configured such that the set of nozzles rotates about a fixed point <b>210</b> within a housing <b>220</b>. In such a configuration, the substrate <b>140</b> can be moved adjacent to the set of nozzles (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>), while the set of nozzles can rotate about the fixed point <b>210</b> such that each nozzle may deposit a layer (e.g., a layer comprising a plurality of particles) or portion thereof, the set of nozzles can rotate, and another nozzle can deposit another layer onto the substrate or onto a previously deposited layer.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>C-<b>2</b>D</figref> schematically illustrates the deposition of layers in this configuration. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, the first nozzle <b>110</b> deposits the plurality of particles <b>114</b> to form the first layer <b>116</b> on substrate <b>140</b>. The set of nozzles may then rotate about the fixed point <b>210</b> such that the position of each nozzle within the set moves from a first position to a second position (different from the first position), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>. The second nozzle <b>120</b> is now above the first layer <b>116</b> and can spray deposit the second plurality of particles <b>124</b> to form the second layer <b>126</b> onto the first layer <b>116</b>. And while not shown in the figure, nozzles in a configuration fixed about a point may also be staggered as described above and elsewhere herein, in addition to rotating about a fixed point.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">While the figures exemplify some configurations of various nozzles within a set of nozzles (e.g., staggered, configurated to rotate about a fixed point), it will be understood that other configurations are possible and may include additional nozzles (e.g., a fourth nozzle, a fifth nozzle). In some embodiments, more than one set of nozzles may be present, and each set may comprise one or more nozzles within the set.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Any suitable nozzle type may be used. In some embodiments, a set or plurality of nozzles comprises de Laval nozzle, a rocket nozzle, a conical nozzle, and/or a slit nozzle. In some embodiments, a set of nozzles includes nozzles of the same type.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, at least two nozzles within a set of nozzles are spaced apart sufficiently to deposit a plurality of particles while mitigating, reducing, or avoiding turbulence generated by adjacent nozzle sprays. The spacing of the nozzles within the set of nozzles may be selected to minimize turbulent flow from adjacent nozzles but spaced close enough to one another so as to allow for sequential deposition of pluralities of particles and/or layers while economizing coverage of the substrate. In some embodiments, the spacing between two adjacent nozzles is at least one maximum cross-sectional dimension (e.g., a diameter for circular or conically shaped nozzles) of at least one of the nozzles. The spacing between two nozzles can be measured from the tip of a nozzle (e.g., a first nozzle tip) to the tip of an adjacent nozzle (e.g., a second nozzle tip). In some embodiments, a spacing between a first tip of a first nozzle and a second tip of a second nozzle is at least 1 times a maximum cross-sectional dimension of the first nozzle, at least 1.2 times a maximum cross-sectional dimension of the first nozzle, at least 1.5 times a maximum cross-sectional dimension of the first nozzle, at least 1.7 times a maximum cross-sectional dimension of a first nozzle, or at least 2 times a maximum cross-sectional dimension of the first nozzle. In some embodiments, a spacing between a first tip of a first nozzle and a second tip of a second nozzle is less than or equal to 2 times a maximum cross-sectional dimension of the first nozzle, less than or equal to 1.7 times a maximum cross-sectional dimension of a first nozzle, 1.5 times a maximum cross-sectional dimension of the first nozzle, less than or equal to 1.2 times a maximum cross-sectional dimension of the first nozzle, or less than or equal to 1 times a maximum cross-sectional dimension of the first nozzle. Combinations of the above-referenced ranges are also possible (e.g., at least 1 times a maximum cross-sectional dimension of the first nozzle and less than or equal to 2 times a maximum cross-sectional dimension of the first nozzle). Other ranges are possible. In embodiments in which more than two nozzles are present, the spacing between each two adjacent nozzles may independently be in one or more of the above-referenced ranges. It should be understood that &#x201c;first&#x201d; and &#x201c;second&#x201d; are meant to represent different components and that these terms can be replaced by &#x201c;third&#x201d;, &#x201c;fourth&#x201d;, &#x201c;fifth&#x201d; to represent other components.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, at least some of the nozzles has particular spacing along an x-axis. In some embodiments, the x-axis is aligned (e.g., parallel) to a surface of the substrate. In some embodiments, the spacing of (at least some) of the nozzles along an x-axis between a first tip of a first nozzle and a second tip of a second nozzle is at least 1 times a maximum cross-sectional dimension of the first nozzle, at least 1.2 times a maximum cross-sectional dimension of the first nozzle, at least 1.5 times a maximum cross-sectional dimension of the first nozzle, at least 1.7 times a maximum cross-sectional dimension of a first nozzle, or at least 2 times a maximum cross-sectional dimension of the first nozzle. In some embodiments, the spacing of (at least some) of the nozzles along an x-axis between is less than or equal to 2 times a maximum cross-sectional dimension of the first nozzle, less than or equal to 1.7 times a maximum cross-sectional dimension of a first nozzle, 1.5 times a maximum cross-sectional dimension of the first nozzle, less than or equal to 1.2 times a maximum cross-sectional dimension of the first nozzle, or less than or equal to 1 times a maximum cross-sectional dimension of the first nozzle. Combinations of the above-referenced ranges are also possible (e.g., at least 1 times a maximum cross-sectional dimension of the first nozzle and less than or equal to 2 times a maximum cross-sectional dimension of the first nozzle). Other ranges are possible. In embodiments in which more than two nozzles are present, the spacing between each two adjacent nozzles may independently be in one or more of the above-referenced ranges.

In some embodiments, the z-axis is angled (e.g., perpendicular) relative to the x-axis. In some embodiments, the spacing of (at least some) of the nozzles along an z-axis between a first tip of a first nozzle and a second tip of a second nozzle is at least 1 times a maximum cross-sectional dimension of the first nozzle, at least 1.2 times a maximum cross-sectional dimension of the first nozzle, at least 1.5 times a maximum cross-sectional dimension of the first nozzle, at least 1.7 times a maximum cross-sectional dimension of a first nozzle, or at least 2 times a maximum cross-sectional dimension of the first nozzle. In some embodiments, the spacing of (at least some) of the nozzles along an z-axis between is less than or equal to 2 times a maximum cross-sectional dimension of the first nozzle, less than or equal to 1.7 times a maximum cross-sectional dimension of a first nozzle, 1.5 times a maximum cross-sectional dimension of the first nozzle, less than or equal to 1.2 times a maximum cross-sectional dimension of the first nozzle, or less than or equal to 1 times a maximum cross-sectional dimension of the first nozzle. Combinations of the above-referenced ranges are also possible (e.g., at least 1 times a maximum cross-sectional dimension of the first nozzle and less than or equal to 2 times a maximum cross-sectional dimension of the first nozzle). Other ranges are possible. In embodiments in which more than two nozzles are present, the spacing between each two adjacent nozzles may independently be in one or more of the above-referenced ranges. It should be understood that &#x201c;first&#x201d; and &#x201c;second&#x201d; are meant to represent different components and that these terms can be replaced by &#x201c;third&#x201d;, &#x201c;fourth&#x201d;, &#x201c;fifth&#x201d; to represent other components. And as noted above, in some embodiments, at least some of the nozzles within the set of nozzles are staggered relative to one another, such at least some of the tips of some of the nozzles are not collinear along the z-axis.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some embodiments, the configuration of the nozzles may reduce turbulent flow generated by a nozzle within the set. In some embodiments, a spacing (e.g., a first spacing) between the first nozzle and the second nozzle is adapted and arranged to reduce turbulence between the first nozzle and the second nozzle compared to a second spacing less than the first spacing. The spacing between a second nozzle and a third nozzle (or a subsequent nozzle) may also be adapted and arranged to reduce turbulence between the second and third nozzle (or a subsequent nozzle).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The set of nozzles may be associated with one or more hoppers. As understood by those skilled in the art, a hopper is a container that holds and provides material to be feed into a nozzle for deposition (e.g., aerosol deposition). In some embodiments, the set of nozzles may share a common hopper or each nozzle within the set of nozzles may be connected or coupled with its own hopper. In some embodiments, a nozzle is connected or coupled with more than one hopper. Each hopper may include one or more particle types of the same or different material (e.g., a cathode active material, a separator material, an anode material, a protective layer material). Particle types and materials are described elsewhere herein.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The systems and methods described herein may also include a substrate (e.g., a flexible substrate) on which particles or layer(s) (i.e., pluralities of particles that may form a layer) can be deposited. In some embodiments, the substrate is a flexible substrate capable of and/or configured to flex and bend on the roll-to-roll system so as to deliver the flexible substrate to an appropriate position within the system for deposition. The substrate may be configured to release the one or more layers from the substrate after deposition. However, in other embodiments, the substrate may be incorporated into the final electrochemical cell along with the layer(s) deposited on top of it.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">A variety of suitable substrates are known, and those skilled in the art in view of the present disclosure will be capable of selecting an appropriate substrate based on the desired properties of the substrate material, including its flexibility or ability to feed through the roll-to-roll system. In some embodiments, the substrate comprises a polymer, such as a poly(ester) (e.g., poly(ethylene terephthalate), such as optical-grade poly(ethylene terephthalate)). Additional non-limiting examples of suitable polymers include polyolefins, polypropylene, nylon, polyvinyl chloride, and polyethylene (which may optionally be metalized). In some embodiments, a substrate comprises a metal (e.g., a foil such as nickel foil and/or aluminum foil), a glass, or a ceramic material. In some embodiments, a substrate includes a film that may be optionally disposed on a thicker substrate material. For instance, in some embodiments, a substrate includes one or more films, such as a polymer film (e.g., a poly(ethylene terephthalate) film) and/or a metalized polymer film (using various metals such as aluminum and copper). A substrate may also include additional components such as fillers, binders, and/or surfactants.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Substrates suitable for use in combination with the systems and methods disclosed herein may have a variety of suitable thicknesses. In some embodiments, a substrate has a thickness of greater than or equal to 500 nm, greater than or equal to 750 nm, greater than or equal to 1 micron, greater than or equal to 2 microns, greater than or equal to 3 microns, greater than or equal to 4 microns, greater than or equal to 5 microns, greater than or equal to 10 microns, greater than or equal to 20 microns, greater than or equal to 25 microns, or greater than or equal to 50 microns. In some embodiments, a substrate has a thickness of less than or equal to 50 microns, less than or equal to 25 microns, less than or equal to 20 microns, less than or equal to 10 microns, less than or equal to 5 microns, less than or equal to 4 microns, less than or equal to 3 microns, less than or equal to 2 microns, less than or equal to 1 micron, less than or equal to 750 nm, or less than or equal to 500 nm. Combinations of the above-reference ranges are also possible (e.g., greater than or equal to 500 nm and less than or equal to 50 microns). Other ranges are possible.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">As mentioned above, the systems and methods described herein may include a roll-to-roll handling system. The roll-to-roll handling system may be configured such that it may pass a substrate across one or more drums and/or rollers as it is being transported to or from a set of nozzles. For instance, the drums and/or rollers may be configured to translate the substrate to position for spray deposition by one (or more) of the nozzles of the set of nozzles, pause translation while spray deposition occurs, and resume translation of the substrate to another position.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some embodiments, some or all of the roll-to-roll handling system is positioned in a vacuum chamber or other desirable environment. In some such embodiments, the pressure of the environment (e.g., the pressure of one or more gases in the environment) may be monitored and/or controlled (e.g., via vacuum, via one or more gas inlets and/or outlets) in order to facilitate the deposition of one or more pluralities of particles and/or layers.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some embodiments, a roll-to-roll handling system further comprises a plurality of drums. The roll-to-roll handling system may be configured such that it is configured to pass the substrate over the drums as it is being transported through the system. For instance, the drums may be configured to translate the substrate through the deposition system and/or to deposition adjacent systems. It is also possible for the roll-to-roll handling system to comprise rollers that are configured to translate the substrate through the system (e.g., in conjunction with the drums and/or instead of the drums). It should also be understood that some regions of the roll-to-roll systems may lack drums and/or rollers, while other regions may comprise two or more drums and/or two or more rollers. And, in some embodiments, the rollers and/or drum may be configured to rotate to translate the substrate forwards and/or backwards.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Some drums may be capable of and/or configured to be cooled and/or heated. The cooled or heated drum may then cool or heat any portions of the substrate disposed thereon. This may be advantageous for drums positioned in environments which would otherwise be heated or cooled by their ambient environments to temperatures that are undesirable for the portions of the substrates disposed thereon, configured to be disposed thereon, and/or for particles or layers deposited thereon. For instance, the ambient environment of the region in which a drum is positioned may be heated by a process being performed therein. By way of example, a region in which a layer is deposited from a gas may be heated by the gas and/or by a solid source of the species forming the gas that is heated to form the gas. It may be undesirable for the substrate to be heated to this same temperature for a variety of reasons. For instance, heating the substrate to this same temperature may undesirably cause substrates having a low melting point to melt and/or substrates that are thermally unstable to begin to degrade. As another example, heating the substrate to this same temperature could undesirably damage a layer (or particles within a layer). As another example, it may be easier to condense the gas to form a layer onto a cooled substrate and/or a cooled substrate may assist with the formation of a layer comprising the gas that has a desirable structure and/or morphology.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Cooling and/or heating a drum may be accomplished by use of a cooling and/or heating system in thermal communication with the drum. The cooling and/or heating system may be configured to remove heat from and/or provide heat to the drum. In some embodiments, the cooling and/or heating system may be configured to maintain the drum at a set temperature, within 1&#xb0; C. of a set temperature, or within a range differing from the set temperature by less than or equal to the resolution of a temperature sensor employed with the cooling and/or heating system. Cooling and/or heating a drum may be accomplished by a variety of suitable types of cooling systems, including a system circulating a cooled and/or heated fluid across one or more surfaces of the drum and/or through one or more walls of the drum. In some embodiments, a drum is heated by a heating system employing resistive heating. The cooling and/or heating system may further comprise a temperature sensor (e.g., as part of a feedback loop configured to maintain the cooling and/or heating system at a set temperature and/or within a set temperature range). Non-limiting examples of suitable temperature sensors include thermocouples and RTD sensors. Each drum in a modular lithium deposition system may be independently cooled and/or heated by different cooling and/or heating systems, or two or more (or all) drums in a system may be cooled and/or heated by a common cooling and/or heating system. Similarly, each drum may be cooled and/or heated to a different temperature, or two or more (or all) drums in may be cooled and/or heated to a common temperature.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some embodiments, one or more features other than a drum may assist with the maintenance of a substrate at a desired temperature. As one example, a substrate may be cooled and/or heated by exposure to a gas that is at a lower or higher temperature than the substrate. For instance, the temperature of a substrate may be modified by exposure to an inert gas. In some embodiments, the inert gas may be provided concurrently with a gas provided at a temperature higher than that of the substrate. Upon exposure to the substrate, it may have a temperature lower than that of the substrate surface exposed to it or may have a temperature similar to or higher than that of the substrate surface exposed to it. In the former case, the inert gas may directly cool the substrate. In the latter, the inert gas may cool the gas it is provided with, which may reduce or eliminate any thermal damage caused to the substrate by exposure to that gas. As another example of a feature of the system that may assist with the maintenance of a substrate at a desired temperature, in some embodiments, a shield is positioned proximate the substrate (and/or a location at which the substrate is configured to be positioned, such as a drum). In some embodiments, a shield may be positioned in between the substrate or location at which the substrate is configured to be positioned (e.g., a drum) and a source of heat (e.g., a container containing a source and/or a source, such as a source of particles and/or a source of a gas). The shield may restrict the mobility of a species (e.g., a gas, a plurality of particles) positioned between the shield and the substrate and/or may tend to maintain a relatively constant atmosphere in this location. Accordingly, a cooled gas introduced into the space between the shield and the substrate may serve to cool the substrate for an appreciable period of time and/or may block the introduction of warmer species therein. In some embodiments, a cooled gas (e.g., a cooled inert gas) may be introduced into this space by one or more ports. The ports may be in fluidic communication with a source of the cooled gas and may be capable of reversibly placing the source of the cooled gas in fluidic communication with the space positioned between the substrate and the shield. It is also possible for a shield to be configured such that one or more further species may be introduced into the space between it and a substrate. Any suitable deposition technique may be used in order to deposit a plurality of particles (e.g., on to a flexible substrate) according to the methods and systems described herein. In various embodiments, the deposition technique includes an aerosol deposition technique. Aerosol deposition, as described herein, may generally result in the collision and/or elastic deformation of at least some of the plurality of particles. In some embodiments, aerosol deposition can be carried out under conditions (e.g., using a velocity) sufficient to cause fusion of at least some of the plurality of particles to at least another portion of the plurality of particles and/or to at least some of the particles of another plurality of particles. However, other deposition methods that may be suitable include, but are not limited to, sputter deposition, electron beam deposition, and physical vapor deposition.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments, deposition (e.g., aerosol deposition) for forming a layer as described herein may be carried out such that the bulk properties of the precursor materials (e.g., solid particles) are maintained in the resulting layer (e.g., crystallinity, ion conductivity). In some embodiments, the use of aerosol deposition permits the deposition of particles formed of certain materials (e.g., ceramics) not feasible using other deposition techniques (e.g., vacuum deposition). For example, vacuum deposition (e.g., such as sputtering, e-beam evaporation) typically involves relatively high temperatures that would cause some ceramic materials to lose their bulk properties (e.g., crystallinity and/or ion conductivity) upon deposition. In other embodiments, vacuum deposition of some materials may lead to cracking of the resulting layer because such materials may have desirable mechanical properties in the crystalline state which are lost during vacuum deposition (e.g., as amorphous films) resulting in crack formation and/or mechanical stresses formed in the layer (e.g., as a result of strength and/or thermal characteristic mismatch between the substrate and the layer). In some cases, tempering of the material may not be possible after vacuum deposition for at least the aforementioned reasons. By contrast, aerosol deposition can be carried out at relatively lower temperatures, e.g., compared to certain vacuum deposition techniques, certain materials (e.g., crystalline materials) that are typically incompatible with forming certain layers (e.g., an ionically conductive layer, a protective layer) may be possible in view of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">As mentioned above, in some embodiments, the particles are deposited at a velocity sufficient to cause fusion of at least some of the particles. However, it should be appreciated, however, that in some embodiments, the particles are deposited at a velocity such that at least some (but not necessarily all) of the particles are not fused. In some embodiments, the velocity of the particles (e.g., for forming a first layer, a second layer, a third layer, etc.) is greater than or equal to 150 m/s, greater than or equal to 200 m/s, greater than or equal to 300 m/s, greater than or equal 400 m/s, or greater than or equal to 500 m/s, greater than or equal to 600 m/s, greater than or equal to 800 m/s, greater than or equal to 1000 m/s, or greater than or equal to 1500 m/s. In some embodiments, the velocity of the particles is less than or equal to 2000 m/s, less than or equal to 1500 m/s, less than or equal to 1000 m/s, less than or equal to 800 m/s, 600 m/s, less than or equal to 500 m/s, less than or equal to 400 m/s, less than or equal to 300 m/s, or less than or equal to 200 m/s. Combinations of the above-referenced ranges are also possible (e.g., greater than or equal to 150 m/s and less than or equal to 2000 m/s. Other ranges are possible. In embodiments in which more than one particle type is included in a layer, each particle type may be deposited at a velocity in one or more of the above-referenced ranges, for example, so as to control the extent of fusion within a layer and/or the gradient formed between particle types including within the layer or one or more adjacent layers.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some embodiments, deposition comprises spraying the particles (e.g., via aerosol deposition) on the surface of a substrate and/or layer (e.g., a first layer, a second layer) by pressurizing a carrier gas with the particles. In some embodiments, the pressure of the carrier gas is greater than or equal to 5 psi, greater than or equal to 10 psi, greater than or equal to 20 psi, greater than or equal to 50 psi, greater than or equal to 90 psi, greater than or equal to 100 psi, greater than or equal to 150 psi, greater than or equal to 200 psi, greater than or equal to 250 psi, or greater than or equal to 300 psi. In some embodiments, the pressure of the carrier gas is less than or equal to 350 psi, less than or equal to 300 psi, less than or equal to 250 psi, less than or equal to 200 psi, less than or equal to 150 psi, less than or equal to 100 psi, less than or equal to 90 psi, less than or equal to 50 psi, less than or equal to 20 psi, or less than or equal to 10 psi. Combinations of the above-referenced ranges are also possible (e.g., greater than or equal to 5 psi and less than or equal to 350 psi). Other ranges are possible and those skilled in the art would be capable of selecting the pressure of the carrier gas based upon the teachings of this disclosure. For example, in some embodiments, the pressure of the carrier gas is such that the velocity of the particles deposited on the first layer is sufficient to fuse at least some of the particles to one another.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some embodiments, the carrier gas (e.g., the carrier gas with the particles) is heated prior to deposition. In some embodiments, the temperature of the carrier gas is greater than or equal to 20&#xb0; C., greater than or equal to 25&#xb0; C., greater than or equal to 30&#xb0; C., greater than or equal to 50&#xb0; C., greater than or equal to 75&#xb0; C., greater than or equal to 100&#xb0; C., greater than or equal to 150&#xb0; C., greater than or equal to 200&#xb0; C., greater than or equal to 300&#xb0; C., or greater than or equal to 400&#xb0; C.

Other ranges are possible.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some embodiments, the particles are deposited under a vacuum environment (e.g., in a vacuum chamber or chamber capable of or configured to be placed under vacuum). For example, in some embodiments, the particles may be deposited in a chamber or a container in which vacuum is applied (e.g., to remove atmospheric resistance to particle flow, to permit high velocity of the particles, and/or to remove contaminants). In some embodiments, the vacuum pressure within the chamber or container is greater than or equal to 0.5 mTorr, greater than or equal to 1 mTorr, greater than or equal to 2 mTorr, greater than or equal to 5 mTorr, greater than or equal to 10 mTorr, greater than or equal to 20 mTorr, or greater than or equal to 50 mTorr.

For example, a first plurality of particles may be deposited, while a second plurality of particles is concomitantly and/or subsequently deposited such that the amount of the first plurality of particles decreases along a direction while the second plurality of particles increases along the same direction. In some embodiments, a first plurality of particles is deposited to form a first layer, and a second plurality of particles is deposited to form a second layer on top of the first layer. A gradient of the first and second pluralities of particles may be present at the interface between the first and second layers. The gradient may include a change in particle type (e.g., ionically conductive particles, non-ionically conductive particles, particles comprising cathode active material, particles comprising a separator material), but is not limited in this manner and may also include a change in other properties, such as particle dimensions (e.g., a maximum average cross-sectional transverse dimension of a plurality of particles, a particle diameter) particle composition, particle size (e.g., an average particle volume), particle density, particle hardness, and particle coatings, without limitation. The layers described herein may also include a gradient of one or more functions and/or performance characteristics, such as ion conductivity, porosity, and specific capacity, without limitation.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">As noted above, in some embodiments, the plurality of particles may be deposited (e.g., via aerosol deposition) such that a gradient (i.e., a change) of a first plurality of particles and a second plurality of particles is formed at an interface between the first layer and the second layer (e.g., an interface between a bottom surface of the first layer and a top surface of the second layer). For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref>, a gradient exists between the first plurality of particles <b>315</b> and the second plurality of particles <b>325</b>. That is, moving along an axis <b>340</b> extending from a bottom surface of the first layer <b>312</b> to a top surface of the second layer <b>322</b> (e.g., across the thicknesses of the layers), the amount of the first plurality of particles <b>315</b> decreases while the amount of the second plurality of particles <b>325</b> increases along at least a portion of this trajectory. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the formation of gradient of different pluralities of particles may lower the interfacial resistance between two adjacent layers relative to the interfacial resistance of two adjacent layers in the absent of a gradient, all other factors being equal. In the latter case without a gradient, the interface between the two layers is sharp and distinct; however, when a gradient of particles is formed between the two layers, the boundary between the interface is relaxed and, in some embodiments, a distinct demarcation between the two layers may not present. For example, as illustrated schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>E</figref>, moving along axis <b>340</b>, the particles transition from the first plurality of particles <b>315</b> to the second plurality of particles <b>325</b> within an interface <b>327</b> between the bottom surface <b>312</b> of the first layer <b>310</b> and the top surface <b>322</b> of the second layer <b>320</b>. The figure illustrates that because, in some embodiments, the transition from the first plurality of particles <b>315</b> to the second plurality of particles <b>325</b> is gradual, a clear demarcation between the two layers is not present. Of course, it should be understood that in other embodiments, a clear demarcation between the layers may be present, for example, when the gradient is a step gradient.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The presence of a gradient at an interface between two layers may be particularly advantageous for forming a cathode involving the deposition of particles comprising a cathode active material, for example, by an aerosol deposition method as described herein.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">As another advantage, in some embodiments a gradient may be formed with at least one plurality of particles comprising a material (e.g., a polymer) that melts when, for example, a battery containing the layers (e.g., as battery components) exceeds a threshold temperature. When this temperature is reached, the material melts to prevent or eliminate undesired shorting between two adjacent components. Additional advantages are described in more detail elsewhere herein.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In some embodiments, at least some of the plurality of particles may be fused to one another while maintaining a gradient of the pluralities of particles.

In some embodiments, a gradient (e.g., in one or more properties) is gradual (e.g., linear, curvilinear) between two independent portions of adjacent layers, e.g., between a surface (e.g., a top surface) of a layer (e.g., a first layer) and a surface (e.g., a bottom surface) of an adjacent layer (e.g., a second layer). In some embodiments, the gradient is present at the interface between the two layers. For example, the two adjacent layers may have an increasing amount of a second plurality of particles comprising an ionically conductive material moving from a first layer (e.g., comprising a first plurality of particles) to a second layer comprising the second plurality of particles. In some such embodiments, the first plurality of particles may comprise a material (e.g., a cathode active material) and the amount of this particle type may decrease (e.g., gradually decrease) moving from the first layer to the second layer, while the amount of the second plurality of particles may increase (e.g., gradually increase) moving from the first layer across the second layer. In another embodiment, two adjacent layers may include a step gradient in one more properties across the two layers (e.g., between a surface of a layer (e.g., a first layer) to a surface (e.g., an opposite surface) of an adjacent layer (e.g., a second layer)). In some cases, two adjacent layers, e.g., a first layer including a first plurality of particles and a second layer including a second plurality of particles, may have an abrupt transition between the first plurality of particles and the second plurality of particles. In some embodiments, a gradient is characterized by a type of function across two adjacent layers. For example, a gradient may be characterized by a sine function, a quadratic function, a periodic function, an aperiodic function, a continuous function, or a logarithmic function across the web. Other types of gradients are also possible.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In some embodiments, two or more adjacent layers (or a component comprising two or more layers) may include a gradient in one or more properties through portions of the two or more adjacent layers.

For example, an embodiment having three layers may have a first gradient in one property across the first and second layer, and a second gradient in another property across the second and third layers. The first and second gradients may be different in some embodiments (e.g., characterized by a different function along an axis from a surface of a first layer to another surface of a second layer, across a thickness of the adjacent layers), or may be the same in other embodiments. Other configurations are also possible.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In some embodiments, an amount (e.g., a density) of a first plurality of particles may increase or decrease while moving along the gradient (e.g., along an axis extending from a surface of a first layer to a surface of a second layer).

Conversely, in some embodiments, the density of the first plurality of particles of the first lay may increase when moving from the first layer to the second layer.

The selection of the material (e.g., ceramic) will be dependent on a number of factors including, but not limited to, the properties of the layer and adjacent layers, for example, used in an electrochemical cell.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">In some embodiments, a layer (e.g., a first layer, a second layer, a third layer, a fourth layer) is a protective layer configured to protect an adjacent layer from one or more species or functions. For example, in some embodiments, the protective layer may reduce or prevent the formation of dendrites from a first layer and a second layer when the protective layer is present as an intervening layer between the first layer and the second layer. In some embodiments, the protective layer provides ion conductivity of two adjacent layers (i.e., the protective layer is in between two adjacent layers) while preventing fluidic communication between the two adjacent layers. That is, the protective layer may prevent a liquid from permeating across the protective layer while still providing ionic communication between the two adjacent layers. In some embodiments, the protective layer comprises ceramic particles and/or a polymeric material. In some embodiments, the second layer is a protective layer. In some embodiments, a third and/or a fourth layer is a protective layer.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">It should be understood that the above-described particle types of layer may be used alone or in combination within a single layer or multiple layers, as this disclosure is not so limited. For example, it may be advantageous to mix a plurality of particles comprising an ionically conductive material with a plurality of non-ionically conductive particles. In some embodiments, the non-ionically conductive particles are polymeric particles where the polymeric material of the polymeric particle is configured to melt above a threshold temperature of a layer comprising both the ionically conductive particles and the polymeric particles exceeds this threshold temperature. Of course, other combinations of particles are possible. Those skilled in the art in view of the teachings of this disclosure will be capable of selecting the appropriate material for a particular particle or set of particles of a layer, either alone or in combination with other sets or plurality of particles.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">The particles described herein (e.g., inorganic particles, ceramic particles, metallic particles) may have a particular hardness. The hardness of the particles may be a factor, for example, in the particles adhering to a substrate or an adjacent layer or influencing the fusion of particles in embodiments where at least some of the particles are fused to one another. The hardness of the particles may be measured by the elastic modulus (e.g., a Young's modulus) of the particles. In some embodiments, a plurality of particles (e.g., a first plurality of particles, a second plurality of particles) has an elastic greater than or equal to 5 GPa, greater than or equal 10 GPa, greater than or equal to 20 GPa, greater than or equal to 30 GPa, greater than or equal to 40 GPa, greater than or equal to 50 GPa, greater than or equal to 100 GPa, greater than or equal to 150 GPa, greater than or equal to 200 GPa, greater than or equal to 250 GPa, or greater than or equal to 300 GPa.

Combinations of the above-referenced ranges are also possible (e.g., greater than or equal to 5 GPa and less than or equal to 300 GPa). Other ranges are possible.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">In some embodiments, a layer may be or comprise an adhesive layer. The adhesive layer may promote or facilitate adhesion of two or more adjacent layers when the adhesive layer is present as an intervening layer between the two adjacent layers. For example, in some embodiments, a half-cell may be constructed comprising an anode layer and a separate half-cell may be constructed comprising a cathode layer. In some embodiments, a separator layer and/or a solid electrolyte layer are adjacent to the anode layer and/or the cathode layer. An adhesive layer may be deposited adjacent to the anode layer and/or the cathode layer, and the anode layer and the cathode layer may be subsequently joined by placing the two adhesive layers together so that the adhesive layers are in between the anode layer and the cathode layer. In some embodiments, the adhesive layer may allow ionic and/or electronic communication between a cathode layer and an anode layer. In some embodiments, the adhesive layer comprises a polymeric material.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">In some embodiments, the thickness of the adhesive layer may be between greater than or equal to 0.001 microns and less than or equal to 50 microns. In some embodiments, an adhesive layer has a thickness of greater than or equal to 0.001 microns, greater than or equal to 1 micron, greater than or equal to 2 microns, greater than or equal to 3 microns, greater than or equal to 5 microns, greater than or equal to 10 microns, greater than or equal to 20 microns, or greater than or equal to 50 microns. In some embodiments, the thickness of an adhesive layer is less than or equal to 50 microns, less than or equal to 20 microns, less than or equal to 10 microns, less than or equal to 5 microns, less than or equal to 3 microns, less than or equal to 2 microns, less than or equal to 1 micron, or less than or equal to 0.001 microns. Combinations of the above-referenced ranges are possible (e.g., greater than or equal to 2 microns and less than or equal to 20 microns). Other ranges are possible. In embodiments in which more than one adhesive layers are present, each adhesive layer may independently have a thickness in one or more of the above-referenced ranges.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">In embodiments where the adhesive layer comprises a polymeric material, the adhesive layer may also include a crosslinked polymeric material and a crosslinking agent, the weight ratio of the polymeric material to the crosslinking agent may vary for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, the functional-group content of the polymer, its molecular weight, the reactivity and functionality of the cros slinking agent, the desired rate of crosslinking, the degree of stiffness/hardness desired in the polymeric material, and the temperature at which the crosslinking reaction may occur. Non-limiting examples of ranges of weight ratios between the polymeric material and the crosslinking agent include from 100:1 to 50:1, from 20:1 to 1:1, from 10:1 to 2:1, and from 8:1 to 4:1.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">The adhesive strength between two layers described herein, such as between a metal layer and an adhesive layer (e.g., an adhesive layer comprising a polymeric material), between a protective layer and a polymeric layer, between a current collector and a polymeric layer, and/or between a polymeric layer and a substrate, can be tailored as desired. To determine relative adhesion strength between two layers, a tape test can be performed. Briefly, the tape test utilizes pressure-sensitive tape to qualitatively assess the adhesion between a layer (e.g., a first layer) and a second layer (e.g., an adhesive layer). In such a test, an X-cut can be made through the first layer to the second layer. Pressure-sensitive tape can be applied over the cut area and removed. If the first layer stays on the second layer, adhesion is good. If the first layer comes off with the strip of tape, adhesion is poor. The tape test may be performed according to the standard ASTM D3359-02. In some embodiments, a strength of adhesion between a first layer and a second layer passes the tape test according to the standard ASTM D3359-02, meaning the second layer does not delaminate from the first layer during the test. In some embodiments, the tape test is performed after the two layers have been included in a cell, such as a lithium-ion cell or any other appropriate cell described herein, that has been cycled greater than or equal to 5 times, greater than or equal to 10 times, greater than or equal to 15 times, greater than or equal to 20 times, greater than or equal to 50 times, or greater than or equal to 100 times, and the two layers pass the tape test after being removed from the cell (e.g., the first layer does not delaminate from the second layer during the test).</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">The peel test may include measuring the adhesiveness or force required to remove a layer (e.g., first layer, a second layer, an adhesive layer) from a unit area of a surface of another layer (e.g., second layer, a third layer, an adhesive layer), which can be measured in N/m, using a tensile testing apparatus or another suitable apparatus. Such experiments can optionally be performed in the presence of a solvent (e.g., an electrolyte) or other components to determine the influence of the solvent and/or components on adhesion.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">In some embodiments, the strength of adhesion between two layers may range, for example, between 100 N/m to 2000 N/m. In some embodiments, the strength of adhesion may be greater than or equal to 50 N/m, greater than or equal to 100 N/m, greater than or equal to 200 N/m, greater than or equal to 350 N/m, greater than or equal to 500 N/m, greater than or equal to 700 N/m, greater than or equal to 900 N/m, greater than or equal to 1000 N/m, greater than or equal to 1200 N/m, greater than or equal to 1400 N/m, greater than or equal to 1600 N/m, or greater than or equal to 1800 N/m. In some embodiments, the strength of adhesion may be less than or equal to 2000 N/m, less than or equal to 1500 N/m, less than or equal to 1000 N/m, less than or equal to 900 N/m, less than or equal to 700 N/m, less than or equal to 500 N/m, less than or equal to 350 N/m, less than or equal to 200 N/m, less than or equal to 100 N/m, or less than or equal to 50 N/m.

Other strengths of adhesion are possible.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">Batteries and electrochemical cells including one or more of the components (e.g., layers, pluralities of particles) described herein may be under an applied anisotropic force. As understood in the art, an &#x201c;anisotropic force&#x201d; is a force that is not equal in all directions. In some embodiments, the electrochemical cells and/or the layers (e.g., a cathode layer, an anode layer) can be configured to withstand an applied anisotropic force (e.g., a force applied to enhance the morphology or performance of an electrode within the cell) while maintaining their structural integrity. The layers described herein may be a part of an electrochemical cell that is adapted and arranged such that, during at least one period of time during charge and/or discharge of the cell, an anisotropic force with a component normal to the active surface of a layer (e.g., a porous electroactive region of an electrode) within the electrochemical cell is applied to the cell.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">In some such cases, the anisotropic force comprises a component normal to an active surface of an electrode (e.g., a first electrode, a second electrode) within an electrochemical cell. As used herein, the term &#x201c;active surface&#x201d; is used to describe a surface of an electrode at which electrochemical reactions may take place. A force with a &#x201c;component normal&#x201d; to a surface is given its ordinary meaning as would be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art and includes, for example, a force which at least in part exerts itself in a direction substantially perpendicular to the surface. For example, in the case of a horizontal table with an object resting on the table and affected only by gravity, the object exerts a force essentially completely normal to the surface of the table. If the object is also urged laterally across the horizontal table surface, then it exerts a force on the table which, while not completely perpendicular to the horizontal surface, includes a component normal to the table surface. Those of ordinary skill will understand other examples of these terms, especially as applied within the description of this disclosure. In the case of a curved surface (for example, a concave surface or a convex surface), the component of the anisotropic force that is normal to an active surface of an electrode may correspond to the component normal to a plane that is tangent to the curved surface at the point at which the anisotropic force is applied. The anisotropic force may be applied, in some cases, at one or more pre-determined locations, in some cases distributed over the active surface of an electrode or layer. In some embodiments, the anisotropic force is applied uniformly over the active surface of a layer.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">Any of the electrochemical cell properties and/or performance metrics described herein may be achieved, alone or in combination with each other, while an anisotropic force is applied to the electrochemical cell (e.g., during charge and/or discharge of the cell).

In some embodiments, the force may be applied using compression springs. Forces may be applied using other elements (either inside or outside a containment structure) including, but not limited to Belleville washers, machine screws, pneumatic devices, and/or weights, among others. In some cases, cells may be pre-compressed before they are inserted into containment structures, and, upon being inserted to the containment structure, they may expand to produce a net force on the cell.

For example, in some embodiments, in a container comprising a base and at least one sidewall, a first plurality of particles may be deposited within the container to form a first layer. A second plurality of particles may be deposited on the first layer to form a second layer such that at least a portion of the first layer and/or at least a portion of the second layer conforms to the at least one sidewall of the container. Each plurality of particles may independently comprise at least some fused particles and/or may form a gradient with another plurality of particles as described above. By contrast, certain existing systems and methods involve fabricating discrete components of electrochemical cells and combining these components later during fabrication. However, it has been appreciated within the context of the present disclosure that one or more components of a battery may be fabricated directly within a battery container, so that components do not have to be transferred later in fabrication. Advantageously, in some embodiments, several components of a battery or the entirety of a battery may be fabricated directly in a battery container using various embodiments described herein, e.g., several components of a battery or an entire battery may be fabricated from sets of pluralities of particles (e.g., solid particles).</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">As an example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>G</figref> schematically illustrates an electrochemical cell <b>345</b> contained in battery container <b>380</b> that includes the first layer <b>310</b> and the second layer <b>320</b>, which can be a cathode layer and a solid electrolyte layer.

More generally, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that all parameters, dimensions, materials, and configurations described herein are meant to be exemplary and that the actual parameters, dimensions, materials, and/or configurations will depend upon the specific application or applications for which the teachings of the present disclosure is/are used. Those skilled in the art will recognize or be able to ascertain using no more than routine experimentation, many equivalents to the specific embodiments of the invention described herein. It is, therefore, to be understood that the foregoing embodiments are presented by way of example only and that, within the scope of the appended claims and equivalents thereto, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described and claimed. The present disclosure is directed to each individual feature, system, article, material, and/or method described herein. In addition, any combination of two or more such features, systems, articles, materials, and/or methods, if such features, systems, articles, materials, and/or methods are not mutually inconsistent, is included within the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">The indefinite articles &#x201c;a&#x201d; and &#x201c;an,&#x201d; as used herein in the specification and in the claims, unless clearly indicated to the contrary, should be understood to mean &#x201c;at least one.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">The phrase &#x201c;and/or,&#x201d; as used herein in the specification and in the claims, should be understood to mean &#x201c;either or both&#x201d; of the elements so conjoined, i.e., elements that are conjunctively present in some cases and disjunctively present in other cases. Other elements may optionally be present other than the elements specifically identified by the &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; clause, whether related or unrelated to those elements specifically identified unless clearly indicated to the contrary. Thus, as a non-limiting example, a reference to &#x201c;A and/or B,&#x201d; when used in conjunction with open-ended language such as &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; can refer, in one embodiment, to A without B (optionally including elements other than B); in another embodiment, to B without A (optionally including elements other than A); in yet another embodiment, to both A and B (optionally including other elements); etc.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">As used herein in the specification and in the claims, &#x201c;or&#x201d; should be understood to have the same meaning as &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; as defined above. For example, when separating items in a list, &#x201c;or&#x201d; or &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; shall be interpreted as being inclusive, i.e., the inclusion of at least one, but also including more than one, of a number or list of elements, and, optionally, additional unlisted items.

In general, the term &#x201c;or&#x201d; as used herein shall only be interpreted as indicating exclusive alternatives (i.e. &#x201c;one or the other but not both&#x201d;) when preceded by terms of exclusivity, such as &#x201c;either,&#x201d; &#x201c;one of,&#x201d; &#x201c;only one of,&#x201d; or &#x201c;exactly one of.&#x201d; &#x201c;Consisting essentially of,&#x201d; when used in the claims, shall have its ordinary meaning as used in the field of patent law.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">As used herein in the specification and in the claims, the phrase &#x201c;at least one,&#x201d; in reference to a list of one or more elements, should be understood to mean at least one element selected from any one or more of the elements in the list of elements, but not necessarily including at least one of each and every element specifically listed within the list of elements and not excluding any combinations of elements in the list of elements. This definition also allows that elements may optionally be present other than the elements specifically identified within the list of elements to which the phrase &#x201c;at least one&#x201d; refers, whether related or unrelated to those elements specifically identified.
