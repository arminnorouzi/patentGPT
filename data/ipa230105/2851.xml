In a DRI process, iron oxide minerals such as hematite, goethite and magnetite are reduced in their solid state at temperatures below the melting point of iron, unlike a blast furnace process where liquid iron is formed.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A DRI process typically takes place between 800&#xb0; C. and 1050&#xb0; C. by interaction with reductants, usually H<sub>2 </sub>and CO. These reducing gases are derived from natural gas or coal, with greater than 80% capacity of global DRI plants using natural gas (e.g. MIDREX and HYL plants). Due to the high gas temperatures and throughputs required, DRI plants require large scale pressurised reactor engineering, typically shaft reactors, fluidised bed reactors or rotary kilns.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Raw material requirements for many existing DRI processes are stringent, with systems typically requiring feeds in the form of pellets, or hard natural lump depending on availability and ore suitability, meaning that significant material dressing is required prior to the reduction process. Large plant footprint, height and complexity result in a high capital outlay and significant operating and maintenance costs, with typical energy consumptions for natural gas based processes of between 10 and 11 GJ per tonne DRI.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The iron and steel industry is one of the largest energy users, consuming around 7% of total world energy. Global demand for steel is expected to increase by 50% by 2050, whilst greenhouse gas emissions must be reduced to meet stringent climate change targets.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the absence of efficient methods for capture and storage of emitted CO<sub>2</sub>, it is important for the industry to reduce energy use, increase sustainability, and improve flexibility and scalability of operations.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The above discussion is not to be taken as an admission of the common general knowledge in Australia or elsewhere.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention is a process for direct reduction of iron ore in a solid state under anoxic conditions with biomass as a reductant and with electromagnetic energy as a source of energy.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention is based on a realisation that the use of biomass as a reductant and the use of electromagnetic energy as a source of energy provide an opportunity for effective and efficient production of metallic iron.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The benefits of the process of the invention are based on the ability of electromagnetic energy to volumetrically heat materials. For example, iron oxides such as hematite and goethite, and biomass strongly absorb electromagnetic energy in the form of microwave energy above about 400-600&#xb0; C. The applicant has realised that heat can be generated directly in the ore and in the biomass as a consequence of the absorption of energy to make it possible to reduce iron ore to high levels of metallisation. The applicant has realised that this opportunity applies particularly when the ore and the biomass are in close contact, for example when in a blend or agglomerated together in the form of briquettes. With the invention, heat transfer limitations of conventional processing can be minimised, resulting in significantly increased heating rates. Significantly reduced heating times result in faster reaction times and make it possible to have a substantial reduction in furnace size compared to furnace sizes for conventional DRI processes such as Midrex (can be greater than 130 m tall), and allow horizontal furnaces to be built, whilst removing the necessity for heating large gas volumes. The ability to directly generate heat within the ore and biomass as a consequence of absorption of electromagnetic energy to an extent that allows reduction of iron ore to high levels of metallisation means that it is not necessary to generate heat from combustion of natural gas.

These measurements were performed at the industrially utilised microwave frequencies of 2450 and 915 MHz.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0108">A resonant cavity perturbation method (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) was used to measure the dielectric properties of the materials from 20-1000&#xb0; C. The resonant cavity consists of a cylindrical copper cavity connected to a vector network analyser, which measures the frequency shift and change in quality factor relative to the empty resonating cavity when a sample is introduced. Finely milled samples (&#x3c;100 &#x3bc;m) were loaded into a quartz tube, (ceramic wool below the sample and open at the top to minimise air ingress) and held in a conventionally heated furnace above the cavity until the temperature set-point was reached. The tube was then moved into the cavity, and the properties determined at the industrially utilised microwave frequencies of 2450 MHz and 915 MHz.

The reduction in dielectric properties between 100-200&#xb0; C. was due to the removal of free water. The increase above 500&#xb0; C. was due to the pyrolysis of the biomass, releasing volatiles to leave carbonaceous char and ash (due to the imperfect seal on the tube it is unlikely that fully anoxic conditions would have been achieved).</p><p id="p-0105" num="0112">Not surprisingly given the above results for PBF and biomass separately, the measurement results for the blended briquettes of PBF/biomass exhibited characteristics of both the iron ore and biomass. Inflections between 100-200&#xb0; C. and between 300-400&#xb0; C. were due to removal of free water from both the iron ore and the biomass, and removal from goethite hydroxyl groups. The increase between 500-700&#xb0; C. was due to combustion of the biomass, as again the open tube did not permit a fully reducing atmosphere. The decrease above 700&#xb0; C. was due to progressive reduction of the iron oxides.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0113">Overall, both the PBF and the azolla biomass, and the blended briquettes of PBF/biomass strongly absorbed microwave energy across the full temperature range measured, at both 2450 MHz and 915 MHz, particularly below 200&#xb0; C. and above 700&#xb0; C.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">1.1.3 Penetration Depth</heading><p id="p-0107" num="0114">When an electromagnetic energy wave propagates in a dielectric material, its amplitude diminishes due to power absorption in the material. The field intensity and power falls exponentially with depth from the materials surface. Dp, the penetration depth of electromagnetic energy into a material, is defined as the depth at which the power flux falls to 1/e (0.368) of its surface value,</p><p id="p-0108" num="0115">The penetration depth in a material is a good indicator of the potential to achieve heating uniformity within a material. Penetration depth is proportional to wavelength; at higher frequencies surface heating is more likely, whilst at low frequencies volumetric heating is more readily attained. Penetration depth is important when volumetric heating of a material is required. It should be noted that some heating occurs beyond the defined penetration depth, as the electric field has not reached zero until some point after the penetration depth. Selection of the appropriate frequency is important to ensure that the dimensions of the material are not much larger than penetration depth; thus it is a key design parameter when considering process design and scale up.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0116">The penetration depths of blended PBF/biomass briquettes were calculated and are plotted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> as a function of measurement temperature.

The second thermal event is the removal of goethite hydroxyl groups and conversion to hematite; this peak is shifted slightly in the briquette sample.

The dielectric properties measured show that the PBF (iron ore fines) azolla biomass and blended briquettes all interacted strongly with microwave energy at the industrially utilised frequencies of 2450 MHz and 915 MHz. The derived microwave penetration depth of 5 cm at 915 MHz above 500&#xb0; C. verified that from a microwave heating perspective it would be possible to achieve volumetric heating of a continuous load of 5-10 cm thick (although some heating did occur beyond the defined penetration depth). There was no clear effect of power density (between 1 kW and 2 kW) on the degree of metallisation, at temperatures above 500&#xb0; C. and 30 GJ/t product microwave energy input. However the ability to provide bulk heating to the material provides the opportunity to overcome heat transfer limitations. This could lead to faster heating rates and shorter residence times, with the resulting lower plant size, direct use of sinter fines, reduced CAPEX and greater process control as possible advantages. The variable production of intermediate iron oxides, (magnetite and wustite) and side reaction products (fayalite) for different biomass loadings indicated that there is an opportunity to optimise the reduction and metallization process by altering biomass content and controlling the reductive atmosphere, leading to metallization at lower microwave energy inputs. Finally, the energy balance estimated heat losses in feasibility testing in the non-optimised system of almost 90%. Metallization at MW energy inputs of &#x2dc;2 GJ/t product could therefore be achievable in an optimised industrial process with heat losses minimised.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0164"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>&#x2014;Block Diagram of an Embodiment</p><p id="p-0159" num="0165">With reference to the block diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, in one embodiment of the invention, briquettes of a blend of a selected ratio of iron ore fines and biomass are supplied as a feed material to a pre-heating furnace <b>3</b> and pre-heated to a temperature in the range of 400-600&#xb0; C. for a pre-determined time.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0166">The pre-heating furnace <b>3</b> is designed to operate on a batch basis.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0167">The pre-heated briquettes are then transferred to a reduction assembly <b>5</b> and the iron ore fines are heated and reduced in the assembly <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0168">The assembly <b>5</b> is also designed to operate on a batch basis.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0169">The assembly <b>5</b> includes a chamber for the briquettes, a source of microwave energy, a wave guide for transferring electromagnetic energy in the form of microwave energy at 2450 MHz or other suitable frequency to the chamber, a source of inert gas, such as nitrogen, suitable pipework for supplying the inert gas to the chamber to maintain the chamber under anoxic conditions during the treatment of the briquettes in the chamber, and an outlet for discharging gas and any retained particulates that are generated during the treatment in the chamber.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0170">In use, while the chamber is maintained under anoxic conditions, microwave energy heats the iron ore fines and biomass and generates heat within both constituents of the briquettes, with the result of reduction of the iron ore fines in a solid state via the biomass within the briquettes to form a solid state metallised product.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0171">The process includes a control system for controlling the operating conditions so that iron ore is heated to a selected temperature for a selected residence time at temperature.
