end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The margin of the eyelid is the area of the anterior eye around the palpebral fissure where the outer oily-dry skin on the outside of the eyelids and body transforms into the aqueous-moist mucosa of the conjunctiva at the ocular surface. Meibomian oil glands, which are located inside the eyelid, deliver their oil onto the Fralid margin.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Many ocular diseases that are symptomatic in the eye can be treated or modulated administering a medicament to the eyelid. Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) can be caused by keratinized material blocking the orifices of the meibomian glands. Blepharitis eyelid disorders are characterized by erythematous eyelids with accumulation of debris along the eyelid margin. Malignant eyelid tumors may be associated with lash loss and erosion of normal eyelid structures. Other eyelid disorders include blepharospasm, styes, chalazion, meibomianitis, lacrimal duct obstruction, seborrheic keratosis, actinic keratosis, hidrocystoma, molluscum contagiosum, nevus, xanthelasma, blepharoptosis, coloboma, dermatochalasis, ectropion, entropion, facial palsy, and trichiasis. In some embodiments, administration is to the eyelid and not the ocular surface. In some embodiments, the medicament is applied to the eyelid and not the ocular surface. In some embodiments the ocular surface is protected by a device (e.g. a shield) as described herein. In some embodiments there is a desire to allow the medicament to stay on the eyelid (e.g., eyelid margin) and not move from that location</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Provided herein are methods and devices for administering a medicament to the eyelid (e.g., upper eyelid, lower eyelid, eyelid margin, or any combination thereof) of an individual, such as to treat an ocular disorder. In some instances, the medicament is administered (or the device is configured to provide the medicament) to the eyelid without subjecting or exposing the ocular surface to the medicament. In certain embodiments, the device comprises a first portion comprising a handle and a second portion comprising a sealing element. In certain embodiments, the second portion consists of a sealing element. In certain embodiments, the first portion comprises a medicament surface. The medicament surface can comprise a medicament recession. In certain embodiments, the ocular disorder is a disorder that demonstrates ocular symptoms (e.g., dry eye and/or ocular irritation). In specific embodiments, the ocular disorder is a disorder mediated by a dermal or glandular mechanism or disorder (e.g., meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD)). In some instances, treatment of ocular disorders mediated by dermal, glandular, or other lid disorders by administering a medicament to the eyelid, but not the ocular surface, allows for the administration of medicaments that may not otherwise be ophthalmically acceptable or desirable. In certain instances, a method provided herein utilized and/or the device provided herein is any suitable device, such as any one of the devices described herein. In certain instances, medicaments tend to move around over the ocular area (e.g. fornix or cornea) and there is a desire to enable the medicament to remain on the lid to achieve maximal therapeutic effect.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one aspect, disclosed herein is a device for applying a medicament to an eyelid (e.g., of an individual in need thereof, such as an individual suffering from an ocular or lid disorder) comprising (or a method of administering a medicament to an eyelid with a device comprising): a first portion having a distal end and a proximal end; wherein the first portion comprises the medicament surface close to the distal end, wherein the first portion is shaped and dimensioned to allow close contact between an eye lid margin and the medicament surface for an extended period of time without any additional support provided on the first portion proximal to the medicament surface.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another aspect provided herein is a device for applying a medicament to an eyelid (e.g., of an individual in need thereof, such as an individual suffering from an ocular or lid disorder) comprising (or a method of administering a medicament to an eyelid with a device comprising): a first portion having a distal end and a proximal end; a second portion configured to be inserted beneath an eyelid of a patient; and the medicament surface on the first portion and at an intersection of the first portion and the second portion, wherein the medicament surface contacts at least a section of the eyelid of the patient when the second portion is inserted beneath the eyelid of the patient.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Further, provided herein is a device for applying a medicament to an eyelid comprising a medicament surface configured to absorb or contain the medicament, wherein the medicament surface contacts at least a section of the eyelid of the patient when the device is inserted between the eyelids of a patient.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, the section of the eyelid of the patient is the lid margin of the eyelid of the patient. In some embodiments, the first portion is generally flat. In some embodiments, the first portion comprises a grip protrusion. In some embodiments, the second portion comprises a distal surface configured to contact an eye of the patient, and a proximal surface configured for contact with an inner eyelid of the patient. In some embodiments, the distal surface has a roughness of less than about 2.5 nm. In some embodiments, the distal surface conforms to the eye of the patient. In some embodiments, the distal surface is concave.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, the distal surface has a radius of curvature of about 7 mm to about 18 mm. In some embodiments, the distal surface has a radius of curvature of about 7 mm to about 8 mm, about 7 mm to about 9 mm, about 7 mm to about 10 mm, about 7 mm to about 12 mm, about 7 mm to about 14 mm, about 7 mm to about 16 mm, about 7 mm to about 18 mm, about 8 mm to about 9 mm, about 8 mm to about 10 mm, about 8 mm to about 12 mm, about 8 mm to about 14 mm, about 8 mm to about 16 mm, about 8 mm to about 18 mm, about 9 mm to about 10 mm, about 9 mm to about 12 mm, about 9 mm to about 14 mm, about 9 mm to about 16 mm, about 9 mm to about 18 mm, about 10 mm to about 12 mm, about 10 mm to about 14 mm, about 10 mm to about 16 mm, about 10 mm to about 18 mm, about 12 mm to about 14 mm, about 12 mm to about 16 mm, about 12 mm to about 18 mm, about 14 mm to about 16 mm, about 14 mm to about 18 mm, or about 16 mm to about 18 mm.

eyelid disorders are treated by applying a medicament to the eyelid, e.g. eyelid margin, for one or more therapeutic sessions. In some embodiments, the medicament is a liquid, a solid, or a semi-solid (e.g. gel, ointment, and paste). For example, some treatment of MGD involves the application of a medicament containing a keratolytic agent to the eyelid, e.g. eyelid margin. In some instances, the application involves maintaining contact between the medicament and eyelid margin for an extended period of time (e.g. at least 0.25 min, 0.5 min 1 min, at least 5 min, at least 10 min, at least 15 min, at least 20 min, at least 25 min, at least 30 min, at least 40 min, at least 50 min, at least 1 hour, at least 1.5 hours, at least 2 hours, etc.). Accordingly, the device and method disclosure herein, in some embodiments, allows the medicament to remain in contact with the eyelid margin for an extended period of time without additional support (e.g. held in place by hand or by a separate holding apparatus). In some instances, the medicaments are harmful to other ocular tissues such as the cornea. Accordingly, the device and method disclosure herein, in some embodiments, allows application of such medicaments to the eyelid, e.g. eyelid margin, of a patient while protecting the adjunct ocular tissues such as the cornea.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Certain Terms and Definitions</heading><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Unless otherwise defined, all technical terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this disclosure belongs.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">As used herein, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; include plural references unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.
