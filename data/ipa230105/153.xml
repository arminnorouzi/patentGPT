A bottom wall of the second recess <b>24</b> forms an air inlet wall <b>22</b> of which a bottom surface forms the air inlet surface p<b>3</b>, and the air inlet surface p<b>3</b> is used for allowing air to flow into the porous body <b>2</b> and flow into the e-liquid storage cavity b by means of the porous body <b>2</b>; the distance between the air inlet surface p<b>3</b> and the e-liquid contact surface p<b>1</b> is smaller than the distance between the e-liquid atomization surface p<b>2</b> and the e-liquid contact surface p<b>1</b>, which means the air inlet wall <b>22</b> has a smaller thickness than the e-liquid guide wall <b>21</b>; therefore, external air may flow into the e-liquid storage cavity b relatively smoothly.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Specifically, a surface of the porous body <b>2</b> away from the e-liquid storage cavity b is a bottom surface p<b>4</b> for the heating element <b>3</b> to attach onto, both of the e-liquid atomization surface p<b>2</b> and the air inlet surface p<b>3</b> are located within the bottom surface p<b>4</b>, and the bottom surface p<b>4</b> is a plane, that is to say, the e-liquid atomization surface p<b>2</b> and the air inlet surface p<b>3</b> are located within one same plane, which facilitates manufacturing. It is understandable that the heating element <b>3</b> may be completely located within the e-liquid atomization surface p<b>2</b>, also may be extended onto the air inlet surface p<b>3</b>, and no concrete limitation is made here. The blocking wall <b>25</b> includes an air hole <b>26</b> which is communicated with the aerosol channel a, the e-liquid guide wall <b>21</b> and the air inlet wall <b>22</b> are located at two opposite sides of the position of the air hole <b>26</b> respectively, making the overall ventilation relatively smoother. Since the bottom wall of the first recess <b>23</b> forms the e-liquid guide wall <b>21</b>, a side wall of the first recess <b>23</b> can also provide e-liquid for the e-liquid guide wall <b>21</b>, thereby better ensuring sufficient supply of e-liquid.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Between the bottom wall of the air groove <b>141</b> and the porous body <b>2</b> is formed an atomization channel c which is configured for allowing an aerosol formed by atomization of e-liquid to flow through; the atomization channel c is communicated with the air inlet <b>132</b>, the air hole <b>26</b> and the aerosol channel a, so as to discharge the aerosol formed by atomization of e-liquid to the outside of the atomization assembly. Both of the e-liquid atomization surface p<b>2</b> and the air inlet surface p<b>3</b> are located inside the atomization channel c, which not only facilitates the discharge of aerosol to the outside of the atomization assembly, but also minimizes, during the process of smoking, the difference in atmospheric pressure between insides of the e-liquid storage cavity b and the atomization channel c, so that the e-liquid may easily flow onto the e-liquid atomization surface p<b>2</b>. During smoking, external air flows into the atomization channel c from the air inlet <b>132</b>, and then, together with the aerosol inside the atomization channel c, passes through the air hole <b>26</b> and the aerosol channel a to be discharged to the outside of the atomization assembly.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">At least part of the heating element <b>3</b> is in contact with the e-liquid guide wall <b>21</b> so as to atomize the e-liquid on the e-liquid guide wall <b>21</b>, which means the heating element <b>3</b> may be embedded into the e-liquid guide wall <b>21</b> and partially extended onto the e-liquid atomization surface p<b>2</b>, or the heating element <b>3</b> is an electric heating circuit printed onto the e-liquid atomization surface p<b>2</b>, or one end of the heating element <b>3</b> is located on the e-liquid atomization surface p<b>2</b> and the other end is located on the air inlet surface p<b>3</b>. Therefore, the heating element <b>3</b> is completely or at least in part in contact with the e-liquid guide wall <b>21</b>, and no concrete limitation is made here.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the present embodiment, the heating element <b>3</b> includes a heating section <b>31</b>, an extending section <b>32</b>, a first electrical connection portion <b>33</b> and a second electrical connection portion <b>34</b>; the heating section <b>31</b> is attached onto the e-liquid guide wall <b>21</b> and is connected to the first electrical connection portion <b>33</b>; the heating section <b>31</b> is located within the e-liquid atomization surface p<b>2</b>, which means the heating section <b>31</b> is arranged extending on the e-liquid atomization surface p<b>2</b>, thereby being able to fully atomize the e-liquid on the e-liquid atomization surface p<b>2</b>. A first end of the extending section <b>32</b> is connected to a first end of the heating section <b>31</b>, the first electrical connection portion <b>33</b> is connected to a second end of the heating section <b>31</b>, and a second end of the extending section <b>32</b> is connected to the second electrical connection portion <b>34</b>; the extending section <b>32</b> has a greater cross-sectional area than the heating section <b>31</b>. The extending section <b>32</b> is arranged deviating from the e-liquid atomization surface p<b>2</b> and is attached onto the porous body <b>2</b>, thereby being able to avoid, during operation, dry burning occurring at an area of the porous body <b>2</b> where the extending section <b>32</b> is located.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Preferably, at least part of the extending section <b>32</b> is attached onto the air inlet surface p<b>3</b>, and a contact area between the extending section <b>32</b> and the porous body <b>2</b> is greater than a contact area between the heating section <b>31</b> and the porous body <b>2</b>, thereby being able to reduce the likelihood of the e-liquid dropping from the extending section <b>32</b>. It is understandable that the heating element <b>3</b> may be a metal wire, also may be an electric heating circuit printed onto the porous body <b>2</b>, and no concrete limitation is made here, as long as it can be electrified to generate heat. In addition, in some embodiments, the heating element <b>3</b> is completely located on the e-liquid atomization surface p<b>2</b>, and the porous body <b>2</b> may not be provided with the first recess <b>23</b>. Of course, the porous body <b>2</b> may not be provided with the second recess <b>24</b> either, as long as the distance between the air inlet surface p<b>3</b> and the e-liquid contact surface p<b>1</b> is smaller than the distance between the e-liquid atomization surface p<b>2</b> and the e-liquid contact surface p<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The electrode <b>4</b> is fixed on the fixing seat <b>13</b>; one end of the electrode <b>4</b> presses against the heating element <b>3</b>, and the other end of the electrode <b>4</b> is electrically connected to the battery assembly. In the present embodiment, there are two electrodes <b>4</b>; one electrode presses against the first electrical connection portion <b>33</b> and the other electrode presses against the second electrical connection portion <b>24</b>. The magnetic element <b>5</b> is fixed on the fixing seat <b>13</b> for magnetic connection with the battery assembly, so that the connection is more secure.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The present disclosure further provides an electronic cigarette, including an atomization assembly and a battery assembly configured for supplying power to the atomization assembly, wherein the atomization assembly is the one described above, having the same technical effect. The battery assembly is of an available technology, and no concrete limitation is made for the structure here.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Due to the fact that the porous body <b>2</b> includes the e-liquid atomization surface p<b>2</b> and the air inlet surface p<b>3</b> that are separately arranged, the distance between the air inlet surface p<b>3</b> and the e-liquid contact surface p<b>1</b> is smaller than the distance between the e-liquid atomization surface p<b>2</b> and the e-liquid contact surface p<b>1</b>, and air can flow into the e-liquid storage cavity b through the air inlet surface p<b>3</b>, thus, the atmospheric pressure inside the e-liquid storage cavity b is equal to or not so different from the atmospheric pressure outside the atomization assembly, the e-liquid inside the e-liquid storage cavity b can smoothly flow onto the e-liquid guide wall <b>21</b>, with sufficient supply of e-liquid. When the heating element <b>3</b> generates heat, the e-liquid guide wall <b>21</b> can provide sufficient e-liquid, and therefore burnt smell can be avoided.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Embodiment 2</heading><p id="p-0045" num="0044">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the present embodiment is similar to Embodiment 1 in structure, with the main difference lying in that the blocking seat <b>14</b> includes a second e-liquid holding tank <b>143</b>, of which a tank opening is arranged facing the porous body <b>2</b>. Specifically, the tank opening of the second e-liquid holding tank <b>143</b> is arranged facing the air inlet wall <b>22</b>, to better collect the e-liquid dropping or leaking from the air inlet wall <b>22</b>.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Embodiment 3</heading><p id="p-0046" num="0045">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the present embodiment is similar to Embodiment 1 in structure, with the main difference lying in that the blocking seat <b>14</b> includes a second e-liquid holding tank <b>143</b>, of which a tank opening is arranged facing the porous body <b>2</b>.
