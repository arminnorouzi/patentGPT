However, the color printer <b>1</b> may be configured so that power can be supplied and a synchronization signal can be transmitted using a single terminal.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0170">As an example, each of the toner memories may include only three terminals serving as electrical contacts, i.e., a power supply terminal for both supplying a supply voltage to the toner memory and transmitting a synchronization signal, a ground terminal, and a data terminal for communication of data. Since the toner memory in this configuration includes only three terminals, as described in the first embodiment, the number of electrical contacts in a drum unit that is attachable to and detachable from the color printer <b>1</b> can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0171">The drum unit in the embodiments described above uses so-called two-component toner. That is, the drum unit includes a developing roller, a developing container accommodating therein carrier, and a conveying member positioned within the developing container and capable of conveying both toner and carrier toward the developing roller. However, another configuration may be employed in the drum unit. For example, a nonmagnetic single-component toner may be used.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0172"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> illustrates a drum unit <b>650</b> according to a modification to the embodiments.

Each of the toner cartridges TC<b>2</b> includes a toner casing CA<b>2</b> that accommodates toner therein, and a developing roller <b>161</b> for supplying toner in the toner casing CA<b>2</b> to the corresponding photosensitive drum <b>51</b>. In other words, toner cartridges TC<b>2</b> for nonmagnetic single-component toner are attachable to and detachable from a frame of the drum unit <b>650</b> in this modification. Thus, the present disclosure can be applied to the drum unit <b>650</b> employing single-component toner, as well as the drum units employing two-component toner in the above embodiments.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0173">In the embodiments described above, both of the drum unit information and the control voltage information are stored in a single relay board memory.
