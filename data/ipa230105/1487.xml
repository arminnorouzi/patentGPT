This axis vertical to the Z axis is hereafter called &#x201c;X axis&#x201d; for explanatory convenience). As a result, the work is cut into a three-dimensional shape. An automatic lathe is not only used for this kind of operation, but is also used for feeding the cutting tool in a Y axis direction, which is vertical to both the Z axis and the X axis, and performing cutting processing, such as cutting off and grooving, on the work from the Y axis direction while interlocking the movement of the work in the Z axis direction and the movement of the cutting tool in the Y axis direction. (In the present invention, such an automatic lathe that is capable of processing in the Y axis direction is called a &#x201c;Y axis direction cutting automatic lathe&#x201d; for explanatory convenience.)</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the above mentioned Y axis direction automatic cutting lathe, not only standard cutting tools to place the cutting edge in the X axis direction but also cutting tools to place the corner edge of the tool in the Y axis direction and the holder thereof (in the present description, this cutting tool is called a &#x201c;Y axis direction cutting tool&#x201d; and the holder is called a &#x201c;Y axis direction cutting holder&#x201d; for explanatory convenience), can be selectively used (e.g. see Patent Publication JP2020-506074A and JP2004-148498A). In a case of an automatic lathe where a plurality of these cutting tools are disposed on a tool rest, and moved in the X axis direction and the Y axis direction so as to cut a work, it is not only critical that the origin alignment in the diameter direction is accurately performed (projection amount of the tool, that is, the distance from the tool rest to the cutting edge, is set at a predetermined amount), but it is also critical that the height of the cutting edge (core height) is accurately adjusted. Actually, in a standard turning tool, the height of the cutting edge (core height) may be adjusted in a state of placing a shim, for example.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, in the case of an automatic lathe, dispersion within a tolerance may be allowed in some cases, considering that the height (core height) is determined based on the manufacturing accuracy of the holder and the insert.

described in detail with reference to the drawings (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and the like). The cutting tool <b>1</b> is a tool that cuts a work <b>300</b> by feeding a cutting edge <b>20</b> of a cutting insert <b>10</b> when the work <b>300</b> is processed on an automatic lathe (not illustrated) or the like.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the present embodiment, in a case where a &#x201c;Y axis direction cutting holder&#x201d; can be selectively used in addition to a commonly used standard holder, in a &#x201c;Y axis direction cutting automatic lathe&#x201d; (automatic lathe configured to allow processing in the Y axis direction), a preferred embodiment of this Y axis direction cutting holder will be primarily described. In other words, in an automatic lathe used for automatically performing a turning operation, it is common that while a long work <b>300</b> is being fed in the Z axis direction, turning is performed on the work <b>300</b> by moving a cutting tool <b>1</b> along an axis vertical to the Z axis direction (an axis along the longitudinal direction of the holder <b>50</b> in the present embodiment. This axis vertical to the Z axis is hereafter called &#x201c;X axis&#x201d; for explanatory convenience.), so as to cut out a three-dimensional shape (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>). However, an automatic lathe which not only performs this operation but also allows feeding the cutting tool <b>1</b> in the Y axis direction, which is vertical to both the Z axis and the X axis, interlocking the movement of the cutting tool <b>1</b> in the Y axis direction with the movement of the work <b>300</b> in the Z axis direction, so that such cutting processing as cutting off and grooving can be performed on the work <b>300</b> in the Y axis direction, is also used. (In the present description, the automatic lathe configured to allow processing in the Y axis direction as well is called &#x201c;Y axis direction cutting automatic lathe&#x201d; for explanatory convenience.). In such a Y axis direction cutting automatic lathe, it is convenient if not only the cutting tool having a structure suitable for feeding the cutting tool in the X axis direction (that is, a tool in which the cutting insert and the holder are combined), but also a cutting tool <b>1</b> suitable for cutting in the Y axis direction (this is referred to as the &#x201c;Y axis direction cutting tool&#x201d; in the present description) can be selected and used when necessary. In the following, a holder suitable for the Y axis direction cutting tool <b>1</b> (hereafter called &#x201c;Y axis direction cutting holder&#x201d;) will be described. The Y axis here is an axis vertical to both the X axis, which is along the longitudinal direction (normally the vertical direction) of the tool holder installed in a tool rest <b>200</b>, and the Z axis, which is along the moving direction (normally the horizontal direction) of a long work (e.g. a bar) to be cut, and the Y axis is an axis extending in a direction in which a plurality of cutting tools <b>1</b> are disposed in a case of a commonly used &#x201c;comb blade type&#x201d; tool rest (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Y Axis Direction Cutting Holder</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The holder <b>50</b> of the present embodiment holds the cutting insert <b>10</b>, which performs turning on a work <b>300</b> supplied to the cutting insert <b>10</b> along a horizontal Z axis, for example (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). The holder <b>50</b> is positioned on a tool rest <b>200</b> such that the longitudinal direction thereof matches with the X axis in a vertical direction, which is vertical to the Z axis, for example. The Y axis direction cutting holder (also called &#x201c;Y axis holder&#x201d;) <b>50</b> is configured to perform turning on the work <b>300</b> using the cutting insert <b>10</b> interlocking with the movement of the work <b>300</b>, which moves in the Z axis direction, when the Y axis holder <b>50</b> moves along the horizontal Y axis which is vertical to both the X axis and the Z axis, for example (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). On the other hand, a holder that performs turning on the work <b>300</b> using the cutting insert <b>10</b> when the holder moves along the X axis (called &#x201c;X axis holder&#x201d; in the present description, for explanatory convenience, and is indicated by the reference sign <b>50</b>X in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> and the like), is configured to perform turning on the work <b>300</b> using the cutting insert <b>10</b> interlocking with the movement of the work <b>300</b> which moves in the Z axis direction when the X axis holder <b>50</b>X moves along the X axis. On the tool rest <b>200</b>, not only the Y axis holder (indicated by the reference sign <b>50</b>Y in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>), but also the X axis holder <b>50</b>X can be replaced and installed in accordance with the mode of turning. In the present embodiment, a plurality of types of holders <b>50</b> (X axis holder and Y axis holder) are disposed on the tool rest <b>200</b> along the Y axis direction in a &#x201c;comb blade&#x201d; shape, so that the tool rest <b>200</b> is moved in the X axis direction and the Y axis direction in accordance with the mode of turning, and the cutting insert <b>10</b> is appropriately selected, moved and replaced to perform a predetermined machining (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>). The cutting tool <b>1</b> is configured to be a head replacement type tool, where the head portion <b>52</b> can be detachable from the shank portion <b>53</b> of the holder <b>50</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> and the like).</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Positioning Portion of Y Axis Direction Cutting Holder</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The Y axis direction cutting holder (Y axis holder) <b>50</b> has a shape where an end portion <b>51</b> in the X axis direction (lower end portion in the case of the present embodiment) protrudes downward from the cutting edge <b>20</b> of the cutting insert <b>10</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). In the present embodiment, a positioning portion <b>51</b>P, which becomes a positioning reference to determine the projection amount of the cutting insert <b>10</b> from the tool rest <b>200</b>, is disposed on this end portion <b>51</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>). When the cutting tool <b>1</b> (holder <b>50</b> and cutting insert <b>10</b>) is installed in the tool rest <b>200</b> of the automatic lathe, the position of the tool rest <b>200</b> is adjusted in a state of contacting the positioning portion <b>51</b>P of the holder <b>50</b> with the work <b>300</b>, while considering the dimension between the corner edge <b>22</b> of the cutting edge <b>20</b> and the positioning portion <b>51</b>P, whereby the projection amount can be set to a predetermined amount specified in advance. This positioning portion <b>51</b>P is disposed at a position that is distant from the corner edge <b>22</b> (corner of the cutting edge <b>20</b>) of the cutting insert <b>10</b> installed in the holder <b>50</b> by a predetermined dimension L (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> and the like).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Mode of Positioning Portion of Holder</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">A mode of the end portion <b>51</b> of the holder <b>50</b> and the positioning portion <b>51</b>P disposed on the end portion <b>51</b> is not especially limited. For example, the end portion <b>51</b> may have a flat shape that is parallel with the YZ plane (a shape including a flat portion <b>51</b>A that includes a side or a plane vertical to the X axis), and the positioning portion <b>51</b>P may be disposed on a part of or on an entire surface of the flat portion <b>51</b>A (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>).</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Another example is that the end portion <b>51</b> has a shape including an inclined portion <b>51</b>B that includes a side or a plane inclined along the Z axis direction, and the positioning portion <b>51</b>P is disposed on a part of the inclined portion <b>51</b>B (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>). In this case, it is preferable that the inclined portion <b>51</b>B has a flat shape that is inclined so that the plane ascends toward the cutting edge <b>20</b> side in the ZX plan view, and the positioning portion <b>51</b>P is disposed at a location closest to the work in the inclined portion <b>51</b>B. Disposing the positioning portion <b>51</b>P at a location closer to the side of supplying the work <b>300</b> means disposing the positioning portion <b>51</b>P at a location close to a guide bush <b>500</b> of the work <b>300</b>, which allows to perform positioning more accurately by contacting the holder <b>50</b> with the work <b>300</b> that is not protruded from the chuck <b>400</b> or the guide bush <b>500</b> very much (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Another example is that the end portion <b>51</b> has a shape including a protruded portion <b>51</b>C which is projected in the X axis direction in the ZX plan view, and the positioning portion <b>51</b>P disposed at the tip of the protruded portion <b>51</b>C (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Further, a stepped portion <b>51</b>D, which has a stepped shape to expand a region of the positioning portion <b>51</b>P along the Y axis, may be formed on the end portion <b>51</b> of the holder <b>50</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>). In the view in the Z axis direction (XY plan view), if the width of the inclined region on the end portion <b>51</b> (indicated by reference sign <b>51</b>S in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>) along the Y axis becomes wider, the width (length) of the positioning portion <b>51</b>P along the Y axis decreases accordingly (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>). Therefore if the stepped portion <b>51</b>D, directed to the tip side (downward), is formed in the middle of the inclined region <b>51</b>S, the width of the positioning portion <b>51</b>P along the Y axis can be increased without changing the dimension L from the corner edge <b>22</b> to the positioning portion <b>51</b>P (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>). By widening the width of the positioning portion <b>51</b>P along the Y axis using this shape, the work <b>300</b> and the positioning portion <b>51</b>P of the holder <b>50</b> can be more easily contacted, and the positioning operation becomes easier.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the case of forming the above mentioned stepped portion <b>51</b>D, an oil filler port <b>54</b> may be disposed in the stepped portion <b>51</b>D (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). By filling oil to the cutting insert <b>10</b> via the oil filler port <b>54</b> disposed in the stepped portion <b>51</b>D, the cutting oil can be supplied from the side of the rake surface of the cutting insert <b>10</b>. The reference sign <b>55</b> indicates another oil filler port through which the cutting oil is supplied to the cutting insert <b>10</b> from the opposite side of the rake surface (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Disposition of Positioning Portion in Holder</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The positioning portion <b>51</b>P in the Y axis direction cutting holder (Y axis holder) <b>50</b> is preferably set such that the Y axis direction coordinate position thereof corresponds to the Y axis direction coordinate position of the positioning portion <b>51</b>P in the X axis holder <b>50</b>. This will be described using concrete examples (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>). Among the side faces of the shank portion <b>53</b> of the X axis holder <b>50</b> (<b>50</b>X), the side face on the left side in the XY plan view indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> each is assumed to be the Y axis direction reference plane <b>53</b>S, and the length in the Y axis direction from this Y axis direction reference plane <b>53</b>S to the corner edge <b>22</b> of the cutting edge <b>20</b> (Y coordinates of which origin is the Y axis direction reference plane <b>53</b>S) is assumed to be y1 (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>). In order to implement the Y axis holder <b>50</b> (<b>50</b>Y) that corresponds to such an X axis holder <b>50</b> (<b>50</b>X), the positioning portion <b>51</b>P is set such that the Y axis direction length y1 in the X axis holder <b>50</b> (<b>50</b>X) is included in the installation range from the Y axis direction reference plane <b>53</b>S of the positioning portion <b>51</b>P in the Y axis holder <b>50</b> (<b>50</b>Y) (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>). In this case, the positioning operation of the Y axis holder <b>50</b> (<b>50</b>Y) becomes easier when the X axis holder <b>50</b> (<b>50</b>X) of the tool rest <b>200</b> is replaced with the Y axis holder <b>50</b> (<b>50</b>Y). In other words, in the case of positioning of the X axis holder <b>50</b> (<b>50</b>X), the positioning operation is performed in the state of contacting the corner edge <b>22</b> of the Y axis direction length y1 at the reference position with the work <b>300</b>, but in the case of positioning of the Y axis holder <b>50</b> (<b>50</b>Y) after the replacement, the positioning portion <b>51</b>P of which Y axis direction length y1 is included in the range, contacts with the work <b>300</b> merely by moving the Y axis holder <b>50</b> (<b>50</b>Y) in the Z axis direction, therefore there is no need to adjust the Y axis position of the tool rest <b>200</b> so that the positioning portion <b>51</b>P contacts with the work <b>300</b>. As a consequence, the Y axis holder <b>50</b> (<b>50</b>Y) can be installed in the same procedure as installing the X axis holder <b>50</b> (<b>50</b>X) while contacting the corner edge <b>22</b> with the work <b>300</b>, (hence the corner edge <b>22</b> can be contacted with the work <b>300</b> at the same Y coordinate position based on the shank side face), or the adjustment program used for the X axis holder <b>50</b> (<b>50</b>X) can be used for the Y axis holder <b>50</b> (<b>50</b>Y) as well, which is convenient. If the positioning portion <b>51</b>P is pointed, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, the range is point-shaped, and if the positioning portion <b>51</b>P is a line, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>, the range is linear in accordance with the width of the line.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Types of Cutting Inserts</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the present embodiment, in a case where a part of the cutting insert <b>10</b> installed in the Y axis direction cutting holder (Y axis holder) <b>50</b> is projected from the corner edge of the cutting edge <b>20</b> in the X axis direction, the positioning portion <b>51</b>P is disposed at a position where the cutting insert <b>10</b> is projected from the corner edge of the cutting edge <b>20</b> in the X axis direction, with respect to the tool rest <b>200</b>, so that the projection amount can be adjusted while contacting the work <b>300</b> with the positioning portion <b>51</b>P when the cutting tool (the cutting insert <b>10</b> and the holder <b>50</b>) <b>1</b> is installed in the tool rest <b>200</b> of the automatic lathe. This is also true in the case where the cutting insert <b>10</b> of which rake angle does not become negative, and the projection amount can be adjusted by disposing the positioning portion <b>51</b>P described above, in the case where the end portion <b>51</b> is projected from the corner edge <b>22</b> in the X axis direction with respect to the tool rest <b>200</b>, even if the rake angle does not become negative, including the rake angle during the grooving, cutting off and screw cutting operations using the Y axis holder <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Shapes of Shank Portion and Head Portion of Holder</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the Y axis holder <b>50</b> having the above mentioned mode, the structure of a conventional Y axis holder, such as a structure to determine the projection amount from the tool rest <b>200</b> by contacting a part of the holder with the tool rest <b>200</b>, is not required. Therefore in the head portion <b>52</b> or the shank portion <b>53</b> of the Y axis holder <b>50</b> of the present embodiment, there is no need to dispose a limiting portion, to limit a possible width of the relative movement of the holder <b>50</b> with respect to the tool rest <b>200</b> in the X axis direction, to a predetermined range. Hence, the shank portion <b>53</b> may have a straight shape (may be a straight shank), and the adjacent width of the projection amount may be wider than the holder having the limiting portion in the head or the like. Further, if the shank portion <b>53</b> can have a straight shape, adjustment cutting tools (cutting insert <b>10</b> and holder <b>50</b>) <b>1</b>, which line up at equal intervals D, do not interfere with each other very much, hence the shapes and of tools are less restricted, and machining flexibility improves (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>). Furthermore, the tools can be disposed at narrower intervals since adjacent tools are less likely to interfere with each other, and as a consequence, a number of tools installed in the tool rest <b>200</b> can also be increased.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The above embodiment is merely an example of a preferred embodiment of the present invention, and the present invention is not limited to this embodiment, but may be modified in various ways within a range not departing from the spirit of the invention. For example, in the present embodiment, the three directions orthogonal to one another are expressed using three axes: the X axis, Y axis and Z axis, and such phrases as the X axis holder and the Y axis holder are used accordingly, but these are merely for explanatory convenience.
