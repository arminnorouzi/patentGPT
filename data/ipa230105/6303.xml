To improve safety performance of a battery cell, a pressure relief mechanism is usually disposed at the battery cell. In a case that gas is generated inside the battery cell due to abnormal operation of the battery cell, the gas can be exhausted by the pressure relief mechanism to avoid major safety accidents.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Currently, in order to increase an energy density of a battery, a relatively large number of battery cells are arranged in the battery. The plurality of battery cells are stacked. Consequently, a thickness of each battery cell is relatively small, and a lateral area of the battery cell is relatively small, so that the pressure relief mechanism disposed at a lateral side of the battery cell is undersized. As an additional consequence, the dimension of the battery cell in a length direction is excessively large, and a path for conveying the gas inside the battery cell to the pressure relief mechanism is excessively long. The gas is not expelled in time, resulting in an explosion.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, a new type of battery cell, battery, and electrical device are urgently needed.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">This application provides a battery cell, a battery, and an electrical device to improve safety performance of the battery cell.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">An embodiment in a first aspect of this application provides a battery cell, including: a housing, where a dimension of the housing along a length direction is greater than a dimension of the housing along a thickness direction and a dimension of the housing along a width direction, and the housing includes a first board extending along the length direction and an accommodation space opened from at least one end of the accommodation space; an electrode assembly, disposed in the accommodation space; and a cover, configured to cover the opening. A pressure relief mechanism is disposed at the first board. The pressure relief mechanism is configured to be actuated to relieve an internal pressure when the internal pressure or temperature of the housing reaches a threshold. In the length direction, an extension dimension of the pressure relief mechanism is greater than or equal to &#xbc; of an extension dimension of the first board.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the battery cell according to this embodiment of this application, the battery cell includes the housing, the electrode assembly located inside the accommodation space of the housing, and the cover configured to cover the opening. The housing includes the first board extending in the length direction, and the extension dimension of the housing in the length direction is greater than the extension dimension of the housing in the thickness direction and the extension dimension in the width direction. Therefore, the extension length of the first board is relatively large. The pressure relief mechanism is disposed at the first board. The extension dimension of the pressure relief mechanism is greater than or equal to &#xbc; the extension dimension of the first board. Due to the relatively large length of the first board, the pressure relief mechanism can be disposed long enough to meet the pressure relief requirements of the battery cell. In addition, the dimension of the housing in the width direction and the thickness direction is relatively small. Therefore, a distance for conveying gas in the battery cell to the pressure relief mechanism is relatively short, thereby reducing hazards of explosion caused by inability to exhaust the gas inside the battery cell in time, and improving the safety performance of the battery cell.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to an embodiment in the first aspect of this application, the pressure relief mechanism is located in a middle region of the first board. In this way, distances from different positions in the housing to the pressure relief mechanism tend to be identical, thereby avoiding a major safety accident caused by a high pressure at a partial position in the housing.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to any one of the embodiments in the first aspect of this application, the first board includes a first part and a second part that are arranged side by side. The first part is fixed to the second part by welding. A weld is formed at a joint between the first part and the second part. The weld is the pressure relief mechanism. The pressure relief mechanism is disposed in a simple way, and is formed conveniently, thereby improving efficiency of preparing the battery cell.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to any one of the embodiments in the first aspect of this application, the weld runs through the first board along the length direction. In this way, the dimension of the pressure relief mechanism is large enough, thereby further improving the safety performance of the battery cell. In a case that the housing includes a side board and a bottom board, the side board may be formed by bending and welding a whole sheet of panel. During assembling and formation of the battery cell, the electrode assembly may be disposed at the side board, and then the side board is bent so that the side board encloses the electrode assembly, thereby reducing the difficulty of assembling the electrode assembly and improving the efficiency of forming the battery cell.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to any one of the embodiments in the first aspect of this application, the pressure relief mechanism is a notch groove disposed at the first board. The notch groove can reduce structural strength of a position at which the notch groove is located. When the internal pressure or temperature of the housing <b>110</b> reaches a threshold, the notch groove is ruptured first before other positions of the first board. Therefore, the internal pressure of the housing can be relieved through a gap generated by the ruptured notch groove.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to any one of the embodiments in the first aspect of this application, the notch groove is disposed at an outer surface that is of the first board and that faces away from the accommodation space. This prevents the electrode assembly from being scratched by edges and corners formed on the surface of the first board by the notch groove.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to any one of the embodiments in the first aspect of this application, along a direction perpendicular to the first board, a corresponding dimension of the first board at the notch groove is &#xbc; to &#xbe; of a dimension of the first board in other regions. When the dimension of the notch groove falls within the foregoing range, it is avoided that, because the strength of the housing is insufficient due to an oversized notch groove, the first board is prone to be damaged at the notch groove. It is also avoided that, because the structural strength of the pressure relief mechanism is excessive due to an undersized notch groove, the pressure is unable to be released from the notch groove when the internal pressure or temperature of the housing reaches the threshold.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to any one of the embodiments in the first aspect of this application, the housing further includes a second board extending along the length direction. The second board intersects the first board. The first board is perpendicular to the width direction. The second board is perpendicular to the thickness direction. An area of the first board is less than an area of the second board. The area of the first board is less than the area of the second board, and the pressure relief mechanism is disposed at the first board that is smaller in area. In a case that the battery cell is applied in a battery and a plurality of battery cells are arranged side by side in the battery, the plurality of battery cells can be stacked oppositely on the second board that is larger in area, thereby reducing the extension dimension of the plurality of battery cells in the thickness direction and simplifying the structure of the battery.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to any one of the embodiments in the first aspect of this application, the electrode assembly includes a plurality of electrode plates stacked along the thickness direction. The electrode plates are stacked together with the second board along the thickness direction. With the electrode plates being stacked together with the second board along the thickness direction, a gap between two adjacent electrode plates can be disposed opposite to the first board. During the use of a battery cell, hot gas in the battery cell is usually generated between the two adjacent electrode plates. The gap between the two adjacent electrode plates is opposite to the first board. That is, the gap between the two adjacent electrode plates is disposed opposite to the pressure relief mechanism. In this way, the hot gas can be exhausted quickly through the pressure relief mechanism to avoid a major safety accident.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">An embodiment in a second aspect of this application provides a battery, including the battery cell according to any one of the embodiments in the first aspect. A plurality of the battery cells are arranged side by side along the thickness direction. Both the length direction and the thickness direction are parallel to a horizontal direction, and the width direction is parallel to a vertical direction.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The battery cell described above is applied in the battery to improve the safety performance of the battery. The extension dimension of the battery cell in the thickness direction and the width direction is relatively small. In the battery according to this embodiment of this application, a plurality of battery cells are arranged side by side along the thickness direction, thereby reducing the extension dimension of the battery in the thickness direction. With the width direction being parallel to the vertical direction, the extension dimension of the battery in the vertical direction can also be reduced.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to the embodiment in the first aspect of this application, the first board is located at a bottom of the battery cells along the vertical direction. During the use of the battery, for example, when the battery is used in a vehicle, compartments or other components of the vehicle are usually arranged on top of the battery. The bottom of the battery is usually the underbody and floor of the vehicle. The first board on which the pressure relief mechanism is disposed is located at a bottom of the battery cell. When the pressure relief mechanism relieves the internal pressure of the battery cell, the internal pressure can be released toward the bottom, thereby avoiding major injury or damage to passengers in the compartment or other parts of the vehicle and reducing the loss caused by the pressure relief mechanism releasing the internal pressure of the battery cell.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">An embodiment in a third aspect of this application provides an electrical device, including the battery according to any one of the embodiments in the second aspect. The battery described above is applied in the electrical device to improve the safety performance of the electrical device.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">To describe the technical solutions in the embodiments of this application more clearly, the following outlines the drawings used in the embodiments of this application.

The embodiments of this application do not limit the type of the battery cell. The battery cell may be in a cylindrical shape, a flat shape, a cuboidal shape, or other shapes. The embodiments of this application do not limit the shape of the battery cell. Depending on the form of packaging, the battery cell is typically classed into three types: cylindrical battery cell, prismatic battery cell, and pouch-type battery cell. The embodiments of this application do not limit the form of the battery cell.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0051">The battery mentioned in the embodiments of this application means a stand-alone physical module that includes one or more battery cells to provide a higher voltage and a higher capacity. For example, the battery mentioned in this application may include a battery module, a battery pack, or the like. A battery typically includes a box configured to package one or more battery cells. The box can prevent liquid or other foreign matters from affecting the charging or discharge of the battery cells.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0052">A battery cell includes an electrode assembly and an electrolytic solution. The electrode assembly includes a positive electrode plate, a negative electrode plate, and a separator. The battery cell works primarily by relying on movement of metal ions between the positive electrode plate and the negative electrode plate. The positive electrode plate includes a positive current collector and a positive active material layer. The positive active material layer is coated on a surface of the positive current collector. A part that is of the current collector and that is not coated with the positive active material layer protrudes from a part that is of the current collector and that is coated with the positive active material layer. The part that is of the current collector and that is not coated with the positive active material layer serves as a positive tab. Using a lithium-ion battery as an example, the positive current collector may be made of aluminum, and a positive active material may be lithium cobalt oxide, lithium iron phosphate, ternary lithium, lithium manganese oxide, or the like. The negative electrode plate includes a negative current collector and a negative active material layer. The negative active material layer is coated on a surface of the negative current collector. A part that is of the current collector and that is not coated with the negative active material layer protrudes from a part that is of the current collector and that is coated with the negative active material layer. The part that is of the current collector and that is not coated with the negative active material layer serves as a negative tab. The negative current collector may be made of copper, and a negative active material may be carbon, silicon, or the like. In order to ensure passage of a large current without fusing off, the positive tab is plural in number, and the plurality of positive tabs are stacked together; the negative tab is plural in number, and the plurality of negative tabs are stacked together. The separator may be made of polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), or another material. In addition, the electrode assembly may be a jelly-roll structure or a stacked structure, without being limited herein.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0053">The development of the battery technology needs to allow for a plurality of design factors, including performance parameters such as energy density, cycle life, discharge capacity, charge rate, and discharge rate, and also needs to consider the safety of the battery.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0054">For a battery cell, main safety hazards come from a charging process and a discharging process. In addition, appropriate ambient temperature design is required. To effectively avoid unnecessary losses, the battery cell is generally protected by at least three protective measures. Specifically, the protective measures include at least a switch element, selecting an appropriate separator material, and a pressure relief mechanism. The switch element is an element that, when a temperature or resistance in the battery cell reaches a given threshold, causes the battery to stop charging or discharging. The separator is configured to separate the positive electrode plate from the negative electrode plate, and, when the temperature rises to a given value, automatically melt micron-scale (or even nanometer-scale) micropores attached to the separator, so as to prevent metal ions from passing through the separator and terminate internal reactions of the battery cell.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0055">The pressure relief mechanism means an element or component that is actuated to relieve an internal pressure or temperature when the internal pressure or temperature of a battery cell reaches a preset threshold. The threshold may vary depending on design requirements. The threshold may depend on the material of one or more of the positive electrode plate, the negative electrode plate, the electrolytic solution, or the separator in the battery cell. The pressure relief mechanism may be in the form of an explosion-proof valve, a gas valve, a pressure relief valve, a safety valve, or the like, and may specifically adopt a pressure-sensitive or temperature-sensitive element or structure. To be specific, when the internal pressure or temperature of the battery cell reaches a preset threshold, the pressure relief mechanism performs an action or a fragile structure disposed in the pressure relief mechanism is ruptured to form an opening or channel for relieving the internal pressure or temperature.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0056">The term &#x201c;actuate&#x201d; mentioned in this application means that the pressure relief mechanism performs an action or is activated to a given state so that the internal pressure and temperature of the battery cell is relieved. The actions performed by the pressure relief mechanism may include, but are not limited to rupturing, shattering, tearing, or opening at least a part of the pressure relief mechanism, or the like. When the pressure relief mechanism is actuated, high-temperature and high-pressure substances inside the battery cell are expelled as emissions out of the actuated position. In this way, the pressure and temperature of the battery cell are relieved under a controllable circumstance to avoid potential severer accidents.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0057">The emissions out of the battery cell mentioned in this application include but are not limited to: electrolytic solution, melted or split positive and negative electrode plates, fragments of the separator, high-temperature and high-pressure gases generated during reactions, flames, and the like.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0058">The pressure relief mechanism on the battery cell exerts an important effect on the safety of the battery. For example, in a case of short circuit, overcharge, or the like, thermal runaway may occur inside the battery cell, resulting in a sudden rise in pressure or temperature. In this case, the internal pressure and heat may be released outward through the actuation of the pressure relief mechanism to prevent explosion and fire of the battery cell.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0059">Currently, in order to increase the energy density of the battery, a relatively large number of battery cells are arranged in the battery. The dimension of a battery cell is relatively small in the thickness direction, and the dimension of the battery cell is relatively large in the length direction. Consequently, on the one hand, a lateral area of the battery cell is relatively small, so that the pressure relief mechanism disposed at a lateral side of the battery cell is undersized. On the other hand, a path for conveying the gas inside the battery to the pressure relief mechanism in the length direction is relatively long. Due to the two factors, the gas is unable to be exhausted in time by the pressure relief mechanism, and explosion may occur, thereby severely deteriorating the safety performance of the battery cell.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0060">To solve the foregoing technical problems, this application is put forward. In a solution disclosed in this application, by increasing the length of the pressure relief mechanism, a distance for conveying the gas generated in different positions inside the battery cell to the pressure relief mechanism is shortened, thereby reducing hazards of explosion caused by inability to exhaust the gas inside the battery cell in time, and improving the safety performance of the battery cell.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0061">All technical solutions described in the embodiments of this application are applicable to various battery-powered devices such as a mobile phone, a portable device, a laptop computer, an electric power cart, an electrical toy, a power tool, an electric vehicle, a ship, and a spacecraft.

The weld <b>140</b><i>a </i>is formed by welding the first part <b>111</b><i>a </i>and the second part <b>111</b><i>b </i>with solder, for example.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0097">Optionally, the weld <b>140</b><i>a </i>runs through the first board <b>111</b> along the length direction. That is, a joint gap that runs through the first board along the length direction exists between the first part <b>111</b><i>a </i>and the second part <b>111</b><i>b</i>. In this way, the dimension of the pressure relief mechanism <b>140</b> is large enough, thereby further improving the safety performance of the battery cell <b>100</b>. In a case that the first board <b>111</b> extends along the thickness direction, the first board <b>111</b> includes a first part <b>111</b><i>a </i>and a second part <b>111</b><i>b </i>that are arranged side by side along the thickness direction. The first part <b>111</b><i>a </i>is welded to the second part <b>111</b><i>b </i>to form the weld <b>140</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0089" num="0098">Optionally, the extension dimension of the weld <b>140</b><i>a </i>in the width direction is 1 mm to 3 mm. When the extension dimension of the weld <b>140</b><i>a </i>in the width direction falls within the foregoing range, on the one hand, an oversized weld <b>140</b><i>a </i>is avoided. The oversized weld results in insufficient structural strength of the position at which the weld <b>140</b><i>a </i>is located, makes the battery cell <b>100</b> prone to be damaged, and leads to leakage of the electrolytic solution in the housing. On the other hand, an undersized weld <b>140</b><i>a </i>is avoided. The undersized weld results in excessive structural strength of the position at which the weld <b>140</b><i>a </i>is located. Consequently, the weld <b>140</b><i>a </i>is unable to be ruptured to relieve the internal pressure when the internal pressure or temperature in the battery cell <b>100</b> reaches the threshold.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0099">The housing <b>110</b> includes, for example, a side board and a bottom board <b>114</b>. The bottom board <b>114</b> is disposed opposite to an opening. The side board closes in to form the opening. The side board includes the first board <b>111</b>. When the first part <b>111</b><i>a </i>is fully separated from the second part <b>111</b><i>b</i>, the side board may be formed by bending a whole sheet of panel.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0100">When the extension length of the battery cell <b>100</b> in the length direction is relatively large, the operation of disposing the electrode assembly <b>120</b> into the accommodation space <b>112</b> from the opening is relatively difficult. In a case that the side board is formed by bending a whole sheet of panel, the electrode assembly <b>120</b> may be disposed at the side board first, and then the side board is bent so that the side board encloses the electrode assembly <b>120</b>. This can reduce the difficulty of operation and improve the efficiency of forming the battery cell <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0101">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a sectional view along an A-A section line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> according to another embodiment of this application. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a partially enlarged schematic structural diagram of position II in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0102">In some other embodiments, the pressure relief mechanism <b>140</b> is a notch groove <b>140</b><i>b </i>disposed at the first board <b>111</b>. The notch groove <b>140</b><i>b </i>can reduce structural strength of a position at which the notch groove is located. When the internal pressure or temperature of the housing <b>110</b> reaches a threshold, the notch groove <b>140</b><i>b </i>is ruptured first before other positions of the first board <b>111</b>. Therefore, the internal pressure of the housing <b>110</b> can be relieved through a gap generated by the ruptured notch groove <b>140</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0094" num="0103">Optionally, the notch groove <b>140</b><i>b </i>is disposed at an outer surface that is of the first board <b>111</b> and that faces away from the accommodation space <b>112</b>. This prevents the electrode assembly <b>120</b> from being scratched by edges and corners formed on the surface of the first board <b>111</b> by the notch groove <b>140</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0095" num="0104">The dimension of the notch groove <b>140</b><i>b </i>is not limited. Optionally, along a direction perpendicular to the first board <b>111</b>, a corresponding dimension of the first board <b>111</b> at the notch groove <b>140</b><i>b </i>is &#xbc; to &#xbe; of a dimension of the first board <b>111</b> in other regions. When the dimension of the notch groove <b>140</b><i>b </i>falls within the foregoing range, it is avoided that, because the strength of the housing <b>110</b> is insufficient due to an oversized notch groove <b>140</b><i>b</i>, the first board <b>111</b> is prone to be damaged at the notch groove <b>140</b><i>b</i>. It is also avoided that, because the structural strength of the pressure relief mechanism <b>140</b> is excessive due to an undersized notch groove <b>140</b><i>b</i>, the pressure is unable to be released from the notch groove <b>140</b><i>b </i>when the internal pressure or temperature of the housing <b>110</b> reaches the threshold.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0105">Optionally, an opening width of the notch groove <b>140</b><i>b </i>is 1 mm to 3 mm. When the width of the notch groove <b>140</b><i>b </i>falls within the foregoing range, it is avoided that, because the structural strength of the position at which the notch groove <b>140</b><i>b </i>is located is insufficient due to an oversized notch groove <b>140</b><i>b</i>, the housing is prone to be damaged, resulting in leakage of the electrolytic solution in the housing. It is also avoided that, because the structural strength of the position at which the notch groove <b>140</b><i>b </i>is located is excessive due to an undersized notch groove <b>140</b><i>b</i>, the notch groove <b>140</b><i>b </i>is unable to be ruptured to release the internal pressure when the internal pressure or temperature of the housing <b>110</b> reaches the threshold.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0106">Optionally, a cross section of an inner surface of the notch groove <b>140</b><i>b </i>is V-shaped or arc-shaped to facilitate the formation of the notch groove <b>140</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0098" num="0107">A person skilled in the art understands that the foregoing embodiments are exemplary but not restrictive.
