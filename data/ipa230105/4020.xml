The cavity is substantially in the form of a rectangular prismatic shape. The male connector portion has a substantially rectangular prismatic shape adapted to be snugly received in said cavity. And, the female connector portion includes a female connector body and a pair of projecting members.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0019">The invention is further directed to a male connector portion which
