Such improper operation is called a fault condition. For example, a common fault condition arises responsive to a battery cell providing an excessively high voltage that exceeds a threshold voltage, which is called an overvoltage fault condition. Many electronic systems contain safety mechanisms to detect the occurrence of a fault condition and to take remedial action responsive to occurrence of the fault condition. For example, responsive to the occurrence of a fault condition, an electronic system safety mechanism may issue an alert signal. Such a safety mechanism may take the form of an integrated circuit (IC) that is coupled to the battery cells in the electronic system so the IC may monitor the battery cells and take remedial action as may be appropriate.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The IC should be tested prior to implementation in an electronic system to verify whether the IC responds appropriately to input voltages that exceed a threshold voltage. Current techniques for testing such ICs are expensive and time-consuming at least in part because they involve testing individual components of the IC against the threshold, one at a time. This inefficiency is exacerbated if the IC is to be tested against multiple different threshold voltages.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Described below are various examples of a multi-cell battery fault indicator IC that resolves the challenges described above. The IC includes a first comparator having a first comparator output, a pair of first comparator battery cell inputs, and a first comparator threshold input. The pair of first comparator battery cell inputs is adapted to be coupled in parallel to a first battery cell. The IC includes a second comparator having a second comparator output, a pair of second comparator battery cell inputs, and a second comparator threshold input. The pair of second comparator battery cell inputs is adapted to be coupled in parallel to a second battery cell. The IC includes a logical AND gate having an AND gate output and first and second AND gate inputs. The first AND gate input is coupled to the first comparator output and the second AND gate input is coupled to the second comparator output. The IC includes a logical OR gate having an OR gate output and first and second OR gate inputs. The first OR gate input is coupled to the first comparator output and the second OR gate input is coupled to the second comparator output.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">As the IC is being tested, the first and second battery cells are forced into a fault condition that causes the voltages provided by the first and second battery cells to exceed a threshold voltage. The threshold voltage is provided to the first and second comparator threshold inputs. The AND gate output is monitored. If the AND gate output provides a HIGH signal, the IC is operating properly, because the first and second comparators are properly recognizing that the voltages provided by the first and second battery cells exceed the threshold voltage provided at the first and second comparator threshold inputs. A HIGH signal provided by the AND gate output also indicates that the connections between the first and second comparators and the AND gate are operating properly. If the AND gate output provides a LOW signal, the IC is defective and can be repaired or discarded. Because an AND gate does not provide a HIGH signal unless all inputs to the AND gate are HIGH, the AND gate in the IC facilitates the rapid and efficient bulk testing of large numbers of comparators. Similarly, because the same threshold voltage is provided to the various comparator threshold inputs, the proper operation of the IC may be rapidly and efficiently verified against multiple threshold voltages.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">As described, the IC includes a logical OR gate. The operation of the OR gate may be tested by forcing at least one of the first and second battery cells into a fault condition and verifying that the OR gate provides a HIGH output.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">After the IC has been tested and its proper operation has been verified, the IC may be implemented in an electronic system. The electronic system may be configured to monitor the OR gate output of the IC and to disregard the AND gate output of the IC. The OR gate output is monitored because it will provide a HIGH signal if even one of the battery cells is in a fault condition, which is a useful feature for mitigating the consequences of fault conditions. Conversely, the AND gate output is disregarded because it will provide a HIGH signal only if all of the battery cells are in fault conditions, which is not a useful feature for mitigating the consequences of fault conditions. A HIGH signal provided by the OR gate output indicates a fault condition among one or more of the battery cells in the electronic system. The electronic system may take corrective action responsive to such an OR gate output.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram of an electronic system <b>100</b>, in accordance with examples. In examples, the electronic system <b>100</b> is a personal electronic system (e.g., smartphones, laptop computers, desktop computers, tablets, notebooks, artificial intelligence assistants), electronic appliance (e.g., refrigerators, microwave ovens, toaster ovens, dishwashers), networking or enterprise-level electronic system (e.g., servers, routers, modems, mainframe computers, wireless access points), automobile or aviation system (e.g., control panels, entertainment devices, navigation devices, power electronics), or any of a variety of other electronic systems. The electronic system <b>100</b> includes a set of battery cells <b>102</b>. The battery cells may be of any suitable type. In examples, the battery cells may be of the same or different types. The set of battery cells <b>102</b> includes battery cells <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, and <b>110</b>. As numeral <b>112</b> indicates, further battery cells may be included. The scope of this description is not limited to any specific number of battery cells, and the set of battery cells <b>102</b> may include any number of battery cells (e.g., one or more). The battery cells <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> may be coupled in series, as shown. Numerals <b>114</b> and <b>116</b> indicate the voltage that may be provided by the set of battery cells <b>102</b> responsive to the battery cells being coupled in series. Pairs of nodes <b>118</b>, <b>120</b>, nodes <b>120</b>, <b>122</b>, nodes <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, nodes <b>124</b>, <b>126</b>, and nodes <b>126</b>, <b>128</b> couple the battery cells <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> to a multi-cell battery fault indicator IC <b>130</b>. The IC <b>130</b> includes an IC output <b>132</b>. In operation, the IC <b>130</b> monitors the voltages provided by the battery cells in the set of battery cells <b>102</b>. Comparators in the IC <b>130</b> provide a HIGH comparator output signal responsive to corresponding battery cells entering a fault condition. A logical OR gate in the IC <b>130</b> provides a HIGH OR gate output signal responsive to a HIGH comparator output signal. The OR gate output signal is provided on the IC output <b>132</b>. Thus, the IC output <b>132</b> is configured to provide a flag or alert signal responsive to a fault condition in one or more of the battery cells in the set of battery cells <b>102</b>. The IC <b>130</b> also includes a logical AND gate. The logical AND gate receives the same inputs as the logical OR gate. The AND gate is not use in the electronic system <b>100</b>. Rather, the AND gate is a remnant of the testing process that was applied to the IC <b>130</b> during manufacture to verify that the IC <b>130</b> operates properly. After testing of the IC <b>130</b> is complete, the AND gate remains in the IC <b>130</b>, even as the IC <b>130</b> is implemented in the electronic system <b>100</b>. However, the AND gate is not useful in the electronic system <b>100</b>, because the AND gate-unlike the OR gate-will not provide an alert signal unless all of the battery cells in the set of battery cells <b>102</b> are in fault conditions.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of the multi-cell battery fault indicator IC <b>130</b> in a testing environment <b>200</b>, in accordance with examples.

The comparator <b>225</b> includes a comparator battery cell input <b>227</b>, a comparator battery cell input <b>229</b>, and a comparator threshold input <b>230</b>. A threshold voltage source <b>232</b> is coupled to the comparator threshold inputs <b>207</b>, <b>214</b>, <b>223</b>, and <b>230</b>, and the threshold voltage source <b>232</b> provides a threshold voltage to the comparator threshold inputs <b>207</b>, <b>214</b>, <b>223</b>, and <b>230</b>.

The comparator <b>216</b> includes a comparator output <b>238</b>. The comparator <b>225</b> includes a comparator output <b>240</b>. The IC <b>130</b> may include a logical AND gate <b>242</b> that is coupled to the comparator outputs <b>234</b>, <b>236</b>, <b>238</b>, and <b>240</b> at AND gate inputs <b>244</b>, <b>246</b>, <b>248</b>, and <b>250</b>, respectively. The AND gate <b>242</b> has an AND gate output <b>251</b>, which in some examples is identical to the IC output <b>132</b>. The IC <b>130</b> may include a logical OR gate <b>252</b> that is coupled to the comparator outputs <b>234</b>, <b>236</b>, <b>238</b>, and <b>240</b> at OR gate inputs <b>254</b>, <b>256</b>, <b>258</b>, and <b>260</b>, respectively.

The graph <b>300</b> includes an x-axis <b>302</b> representing time, and a y-axis <b>304</b> representing voltage. Curve <b>306</b> represents a voltage provided to a non-inverting comparator battery cell input (e.g., comparator battery cell input <b>203</b>), and curve <b>308</b> represents a voltage provided to an inverting comparator battery cell input (e.g., comparator battery cell input <b>205</b>).

Curve <b>310</b> demonstrates this increase in differential. The differential between the comparator battery cell inputs may exceed a threshold voltage, as shown by curve <b>310</b> crossing the threshold line <b>312</b>. At this crossing point, which occurs at time <b>316</b>, the comparator output provides a HIGH signal, as curve <b>314</b> shows at rise <b>318</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the IC <b>130</b> may be tested in the testing environment <b>200</b> prior to implementation in an electronic device or system. In the testing environment <b>200</b>, each of the battery cells <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, <b>208</b>, and <b>210</b> is forced into a fault condition or a simulated fault condition by a suitable entity, such as testing equipment. For example, each of the battery cells <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, <b>208</b>, and <b>210</b> may be forced to output a voltage exceeding a particular threshold voltage, such as a threshold voltage provided by threshold voltage source <b>232</b>. Accordingly, the comparators <b>201</b>, <b>209</b>, <b>216</b>, and <b>225</b> should provide HIGH comparator output signals at their respective comparator outputs <b>234</b>, <b>236</b>, <b>238</b>, and <b>240</b>. Accordingly, the AND gate <b>242</b> provides a HIGH output signal at the AND gate output <b>251</b>. Such a HIGH output signal indicates that all of the comparators <b>201</b>, <b>209</b>, <b>216</b>, and <b>225</b> are operating properly, because an AND gate will not provide a HIGH output signal unless all inputs to the AND gate are HIGH. A LOW output signal at the AND gate output <b>251</b> indicates that fewer than all of the comparators <b>201</b>, <b>209</b>, <b>216</b>, and <b>225</b> produced a HIGH comparator output signal or that the AND gate <b>242</b> is defective, and thus the IC <b>130</b> should be discarded or repaired. Also, the testing entity may test the OR gate <b>252</b> by determining the OR gate output signal provided at the OR gate output <b>262</b>. If the OR gate output <b>262</b> transitions from a LOW OR gate output signal to a HIGH OR gate output signal as one or more of the battery cells is forced into a fault condition, the OR gate <b>252</b> is operating properly. Otherwise, the IC <b>130</b> should be discarded or repaired. After proper operation of the IC <b>130</b> has been verified as described above, the IC <b>130</b> may be implemented in an electronic device or system, such as those described above.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a testing environment <b>400</b> including a multi-cell battery fault indicator IC <b>402</b> coupled to a set of battery cells in a testing configuration, in accordance with examples.

In the testing environment <b>400</b>, each of the battery cells <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, <b>208</b>, and <b>210</b> is forced into a fault condition or a simulated fault condition by a suitable entity, such as testing equipment. For example, each of the battery cells <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, <b>208</b>, and <b>210</b> may be forced to output a voltage exceeding a particular threshold voltage, such as a threshold voltage provided by threshold voltage source <b>431</b>. The DCC <b>434</b> controls the MUX <b>403</b> using MUX control signal <b>436</b> to allow different pairs of MUX input signals to be provided at the MUX outputs <b>420</b> and <b>422</b>. For example, the DCC <b>434</b> may control the MUX <b>403</b> to cause the voltage provided to the MUX inputs <b>404</b> and <b>405</b> to be provided by the MUX outputs <b>420</b> and <b>422</b>. In another example, the DCC <b>434</b> may control the MUX <b>403</b> to cause the voltage provided to the MUX inputs <b>410</b> and <b>412</b> to be provided by the MUX outputs <b>420</b> and <b>422</b>. In this way, the voltage provided by each of the battery cells <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, <b>208</b>, and <b>210</b> may be individually provided by the MUX outputs <b>420</b> and <b>422</b>, depending on the MUX control signal <b>436</b>. In examples, the DCC <b>434</b> selects each pair of MUX inputs and stores the resulting comparator output signal <b>433</b>. Thus, for instance, because there are four pairs of MUX inputs, one for each battery cell, the DCC <b>434</b> contains at least four storage units (e.g., registers), each storage unit configured to store a different comparator output signal <b>433</b>. The DCC <b>434</b> may include one or more logic gates, such as an AND gate and/or an OR gate, having inputs that are configured to receive the stored comparator output signals <b>433</b> and to provide logic gate outputs in a manner similar to that described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.

In operation, the MUX controller <b>514</b> controls the MUX <b>403</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) by way of the MUX controller output <b>519</b> as described above. In examples, the MUX controller <b>514</b> selects a different pair of MUX inputs in an alternating manner. In examples, the MUX controller <b>514</b> changes the MUX control signal <b>436</b> synchronously with the clock source <b>547</b>. The comparator <b>424</b> provides a comparator output signal <b>433</b> to the register controller <b>500</b> depending on the MUX control signal <b>436</b>. The register controller <b>500</b> stores the received comparator output signal <b>433</b> to one of the registers of the DCC <b>434</b>, with the act of storage to a register and the selection of the register for storage based on the clock signal provided by the clock source <b>547</b>.

If the AND gate output <b>553</b> is HIGH, and the OR gate output <b>576</b> is HIGH, the IC <b>402</b> is operating properly. Conversely, if the AND gate output <b>553</b> is LOW, or if the OR gate output <b>576</b> is LOW, the IC <b>402</b> is not operating properly and may be either repaired or discarded. In the event that fewer than all of the battery cells are being tested, at least some of the battery cell voltages received by the AND gate <b>552</b> will be low, and thus the AND gate output <b>553</b> in these situations may be disregarded.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In this description, the term &#x201c;couple&#x201d; may cover connections, communications or signal paths that enable a functional relationship consistent with this description.
