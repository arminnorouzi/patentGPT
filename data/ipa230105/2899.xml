The liquid raw material L in the vaporizer <b>2</b> is heated and vaporized, and the vaporized gas continues to be discharged from the vaporizer <b>2</b>, thereby the liquid raw material L decreases, and when the amount of the vaporized liquid material L decreases, the pressure also drops.

However, immediately after starting the supply of gas from the vaporizer to the semiconductor manufacturing equipment through the flow rate controller, the pressure in the vaporizer rapidly drops.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0012">When the pressure in the vaporizer drops rapidly, the pressure in the vaporizer falls sharply below the saturated vapor pressure at the set temperature, thereby vaporization of the liquid material in the vaporizer is rapidly advanced, the liquid material in the vaporizer is deprived of the vaporization heat and the temperature of the liquid material falls sharply below the set temperature. A temperature sensor in the vaporizer detects this temperature drop and the temperature control unit feedback controls the supply power to the heater so as to raise the temperature of the liquid material in the vaporizer to the set temperature. As a result, the temperature inside the vaporizer rises, the liquid raw material is vaporized as the temperature rises, and the pressure inside the vaporizer rises.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0013">In the control flow rate conventionally generally used, even if the heater is feedback controlled at the time point when the pressure in the vaporizer drops below the saturated vapor pressure, since the evaporation amount of the liquid raw material can be sufficiently secured, the pressure in the vaporizer do not drops below the threshold value immediately after the gas supply starts.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0014">However, when the flow rate of the gas supplied from the vaporizer becomes a flow rate exceeding a certain level (hereinafter referred to as a &#x201c;large flow rate&#x201d;), if the temperature rises due to the feedback control after the gas supply starts, the evaporation amount of the gas generated by the vaporization by heating the heater does not catch up, the pressure in the vaporizer does not rise enough, and the pressure in the vaporizer falls below the threshold value immediately after the gas supply starts, the pressure drop is detected by the pressure detector, and the phenomenon may occur that the liquid supply control unit supplies the liquid material into the vaporizer even though enough liquid material still remains in the vaporizer.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0015">Further, when the flow rate of the supplied gas is the large flow rate, it is necessary to vaporize a large amount of liquid raw material, which requires a large amount of electric power to be supplied to the heater. When the gas supply from the vaporizer ends in such a state, the heater is still in a high temperature state, which is able to vaporize a large amount of liquid raw material until then, thus even after the gas supply ends, the temperature in the vaporizer is raised by the heat remaining in the heater.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0016">Conventionally, since the necessary evaporation amount of the gas is not so much, so the power supplied to the heater for the evaporation amount is also not so high, the heat remitting in the heater at the time point when the gas supply ends is used to vaporize the liquid raw material before the temperature in the vaporizer rises, therefore the problem of exceed temperature rising in the vaporizer after the gas supply ends did not occur.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0017">However, when the large flow rate of gas is supplied, since a large amount of the evaporation of gas is required, the power supplied to the heater is increased. Thus, a considerable amount of heat is supplied to the inside of the vaporizer even when the gas supply ends. Therefore, the amount of heat remaining in the heater not only vaporizes the liquid raw material, but also increases the temperature in the vaporizer, and as a result, the temperature in the vaporizer may also rise over the assumed upper limit temperature and cause overshoot.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0018">Therefore, a main object of the present invention is to provide a vaporization supply method and a vaporization supply device capable of preventing overshoot of the temperature of the vaporizer at the time point when the gas supply ends and preventing excessive supply of the liquid material to the vaporizer at the time point when the gas supply starts.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Means for Solving Problem</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0019">In order to achieve the above object, a first aspect of the present invention is a vaporization supply method of a vaporizer for heating and vaporizing a liquid raw material inside the vaporizer, controlling a flow rate of a vaporized gas and suppling to a supply destination. By using the vaporizer, the inside of the vaporizer is heated to obtain a necessary gas flow rate, and feedback control is performed so that a pressure becomes equal to or higher than a predetermined value. The vaporization supply method includes a step of stopping the feedback control at a time point when the flow rate control of the vaporized gas starts, and heating the liquid raw material in the vaporizer by providing a heat amount more than a heat amount that has already been provided immediately before stopping the feedback control, thereby increasing the evaporation amount of the vaporized gas more than that when the feedback control is performed, and a step of changing the amount of heart provided to the vaporizer to the amount of heat provided by the feedback control, after a predetermined time has elapsed from the time when the flow rate control of the vaporized gas starts.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0020">A second aspect of the present invention, according to the first aspect, further includes a step of stopping to heat the liquid raw material a predetermined time at the time point when the gas supply from the vaporizer ends, thereby vaporizing the liquid raw material in the vaporizer by the amount of heat that has already been provided to the vaporizer until the time point when the gas supply from the vaporizer ends.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0021">A third aspect of the present invention is a vaporization supply method of a vaporizer for heating and vaporizing a liquid raw material in a vaporizer, controlling a flow rate of a vaporized gas and suppling to a supply destination.

device including: a vaporizer for heating and vaporizing a liquid raw material, a flow rate controller for controlling a flow rate of a gas supplied from the vaporizer to a gas supply destination and

vaporizer by the amount of heat that has already been provided to the vaporizer until the time point when the gas supply from the vaporizer ends.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0027">A ninth aspect of the present invention is a vaporization supply device including: a vaporizer for heating and vaporizing a liquid raw material, a flow rate controller for controlling a flow rate of a gas supplied from the

Therefore, the Example was able to prevent the temperature overshoot of the vaporizer when the gas supply ended.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0075">The present invention is not limited to the above embodiments, and various aspects can be adopted without departing from the spirit of the present invention. For example, in the second control mode M<b>2</b>, rather than setting the duty ratio, the amount of heat supplied to the vaporizer may be increased by setting the set temperature to a value higher than the normal control temperature.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">REFERENCE SIGNS LIST</heading><p id="p-0074" num="0000"><ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0076"><b>1</b>, <b>1</b>A Vaporization supply device</li>    <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0077"><b>2</b>, <b>2</b>A Vaporizer</li>    <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0078"><b>2</b><i>a</i><b>3</b> Vaporization chamber</li>    <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0079"><b>4</b> Flow rate controller</li>    <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0080"><b>5</b> Controller</li>    <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0081"><b>11</b> First control valve</li>    <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0082"><b>13</b> Pressure detector</li>    <li id="ul0002-0008" num="0083"><b>9</b>A Temperature control unit</li>    <li id="ul0002-0009" num="0084"><b>14</b> Liquid supply control unit</li></ul></p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
